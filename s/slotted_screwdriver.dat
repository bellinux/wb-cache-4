5000|$|The first Apple {{product to}} include pentalobe screws {{internally}} was the Mid 2009 MacBook Pro 15-inch model. Three pentalobe screws {{were used to}} attach the battery to the internal frame. A 1.5 mm flat-blade (<b>slotted)</b> <b>screwdriver</b> could easily remove these screws, which were originally mistaken for 5-point Torx screws. This was the only internal usage of pentalobe screws; all following MacBook Pros use the [...] "Tri-Wing" [...] security bit to attach the battery to the internal frame.|$|E

50|$|Many {{textbooks}} and vocational schools instruct mechanics to grind down {{the tip of}} the blade, which, due to the taper, increases its thickness and consequently allows more precise engagement with the slot in the screw. This approach creates a set of graduated <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> that fit a particular screw for a tighter engagement and reduce screw head deformation. However, many better-quality screwdriver blades are already induction-hardened (surface heat-treated), and tip grinding after manufacture compromises their durability. Thus, it is best to select a tip made to fit precisely to begin with, and avoid weakening the factory heat-treatment.|$|R
50|$|Among <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdrivers,</b> {{variations}} at {{the blade}} or bit end involve {{the profile of}} the blade as viewed face-on (from the side of the tool). The more common type is sometimes referred to as keystone, where the blade profile is slightly flared before tapering off at the end, which provides extra stiffness to the workface and makes it capable of withstanding more torque. To maximize access in space-restricted applications, the cabinet variant screwdriver blade sides are straight and parallel, reaching the end of the blade at a right angle. This design is also frequently used in jeweler's screwdrivers.|$|R
40|$|Vacuolar type rotary H+-ATPases (VoV 1) couple ATP synthesis/hydrolysis by V 1 with proton {{translocation}} by Vo via {{rotation of}} a central rotor apparatus composed of the V 1 -DF rotor shaft, a socket-like Vo-C (eukaryotic Vo-d) and the hydrophobic rotor ring. Reconstitution experiments using subcomplexes revealed a weak binding affinity of V 1 -DF to Vo-C {{despite the fact that}} torque needs to be transmitted between V 1 -DF and Vo-C for the tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. Mutation of a short helix at the tip of V 1 -DF caused intramolecular uncoupling of VoV 1, suggesting that proper fitting of the short helix of V 1 -D into the socket of Vo-C is required for tight energy coupling between V 1 and Vo. To account for the apparently contradictory properties of the interaction between V 1 -DF and Vo-C (weak binding affinity but strict requirement for torque transmission), we propose a model in which the relationship between V 1 -DF and Vo-C corresponds to that between a <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and a head of slotted screw. This model is consistent with our previous result in which the central rotor apparatus is not the major factor for the association of V 1 with Vo (Kishikawa and Yokoyama, J Biol Chem. 2012 24597 - 24603) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tissue micro-array {{enables the}} {{analysis}} {{of a large number}} of tissues simultaneously. Widespread use of this technology is hampered by the high cost of commercial array instruments. We describe our experience of constructing tissue micro-array in a simple method using easily available and inexpensive instruments. Materials and Methods: We used an 11 - 19 gauge (G) bone marrow trephine biopsy needle/ small sized <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdriver</b> to punch holes in the wax blocks. Cores were taken from donor tissue blocks using a bone marrow trephine biopsy needle and arrayed into host paraffin wax blocks. A detailed database was constructed for each array constructed. Results: The array blocks were used over a period of one year as internal control for immunohistochemistry (IHC), quality control and research. It took about 10 minutes to construct a nine-dot array and about one hour for a 56 -dot array. During IHC, the average loss of control dots was less than one per cent. We did not see any loss of antigenicity in the control sections even after four weeks storage. Discussion: Tissue array construction by the technique described here is inexpensive and reliable alternative to automated instruments. Because it is easy to modify the arrays by varying the core size, it is easy to adapt this to individual labs and requirements. We recommend using blocks with cores in 3 x 3 to 5 x 4 grids as controls in IHC and for standardizing antibodies and array blocks with a larger number of cores for research...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, Henry F. Phillips {{patented}} his own invention, {{an improved}} {{version of a}} deep socket with a cruciform slot, today known as the Phillips Screw. Phillips offered his screw to the American Screw Company, and after a successful trial on the 1936 Cadillac, it quickly swept through the American auto industry. With the Industrial Revival {{at the end of}} the Great Depression and the onslaught of World War II, the Phillips screw quickly became, and remains, the most popular screw in the world. A main attraction for the screw was that conventional <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> could also be used on them, which was not possible with the Robertson Screw.|$|R
50|$|The screws {{used in the}} Flexowriter were unique, having large flat {{heads with}} a very narrow <b>screwdriver</b> <b>slot</b> and a unique thread size and pitch. This {{may have been a}} {{conscious}} decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.|$|R
40|$|In the UK, {{stabbing}} is {{the most}} common cause of homicide. The weapons used include knives, swords, screwdrivers and glass shards. Quantifying the exact force used in a stabbing incident is considered to be a difficult area due to the large number of variables present, such as sharpness of weapon, angle of attack and relative movements of the people involved. Having quantifiable data would allow a forensic pathologist to make a more informed decision when it comes to answering the commonly posed question in court "what was the degree of force involved in the stabbing incident?" The answer to this question is considered significant in determining an alleged assailant's intent to cause harm. This paper presents results of the first detailed study relating geometry of screwdrivers to the forces required for penetration. Additionally, a range of other blunt weapons such as pens and chisels have also been studied. A silicone rubber-foam analogue has been used as the main skin simulant owing to it having similar mechanical properties to that of human skin and giving highly repeatable results. Different screwdrivers of varying shape and size have been tested (i. e. slotted, Phillips, posidriv and Torx), along with other implements including chisels and pens. The weapon geometry was characterised and related to the peak force required for penetration. Our results show that there is a direct correlation between the cross-sectional area of a screwdriver head and the amount of force required for penetration. Screwdrivers with larger cross-sectional areas require a significantly greater force to penetrate (forces in the region of 100 - 120 N) but "sharper" <b>slotted</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> penetrate with much lower forces (~ 30 N). The forces required for penetrating the rubber-foam analogue with screwdrivers are higher than for "sharp" knives, but in some cases similar to the forces required for stabbing with "blunt" knives. For the other weapons such as chisels and biros, the force required for penetration was again high and there was found to be a good relationship between area of the implement making contact and penetration force. 4154...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though a}} {{determined}} thief could eventually defeat the skewer's lock nut {{by using a}} power tool, e.g. by grinding a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>slot</b> into it or simply cutting it off, locking skewers provide convenient protection against theft of bicycle parts in areas where locked bicycles should not be left unattended {{for long periods of}} time. The highest quality products currently found on the market use stainless steel to avoid a number of disadvantages presented by carbon steel and aluminum including corrosion (rust) and damage to the locking mechanism's unique key indentations caused by key slip-out.|$|R
