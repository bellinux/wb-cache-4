5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle <b>Stone</b> <b>Age</b> shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early <b>Stone</b> <b>Age</b> to the Middle <b>Stone</b> <b>Age</b> onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle <b>Stone</b> <b>Age,</b> microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the <b>Stone</b> <b>Age,</b> Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively <b>Stone</b> <b>Age</b> in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the <b>Stone</b> <b>Age</b> into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E

5|$|Today {{there is}} {{widespread}} agreement among archaeologists that the world's first art and symbolic culture dates to the southern African Middle <b>Stone</b> <b>Age.</b> Some {{of the most striking}} artifacts, including engraved pieces of red ochre, were manufactured at Blombos Cave in South Africa 70 ka.

Arrows and hide working tools have been found at Sibudu Cave as evidence of making weapons with compound heat treated gluing technology.|$|E
