Improvements include a new audio system with support for <b>sound</b> <b>occlusion</b> and reverb, as well as numerous improvements to the graphical rendering system. Unlike the first game, it includes a full single-player story mode focusing on the relationship between Titans and pilots. The developers also confirmed {{that they were going to}} release all of the post-release maps and modes free of charge in an effort not to fragment the player base. A virtual reality version of the game was prototype but it never went into full production, because according to Joe Emslie, the player would [...] "vomit all over their controller." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to efficiently compute effects of <b>sound</b> <b>occlusion</b> and diffraction by obstacles in general virtual acoustic environments. Based on the Fresnel-Kirchoff approximation to diffraction, our method uses a 3 D model of the environment and computer graphics hardware to evaluate diffraction effects between a sound source and a receiver position. No further hypothesis is needed on the diffracting domain. This method allows us to compute attenuation data and filters which can then be used for auralization. The method can also be extended to indirect sound propagation paths...|$|E
40|$|Human {{localisation}} {{of sound}} in enclosed spaces is a cross-disciplinary research topic, with important applications in auditory science, room acoustics, spatial audio and telecommunications. By combining an accelerated model of $ 3 $D sound propagation in rooms with a perceptual model of spatial processing, this thesis provides an integrated framework for studying sound localisation in enclosed spaces on the horizontal plane, with {{particular emphasis on}} room acoustics applications. The room model {{is based on the}} finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, which has been extended to include physically-constrained sources and binaural receivers based on laser-scanned listener geometries. The underlying algorithms have been optimised to run on parallel graphics hardware, thus allowing for a high spatial resolution, and accordingly, a significant decrease of numerical dispersion evident in the FDTD method. The perceptual stage of the model features a signal processing chain emulating the physiology of the auditory periphery, binaural cue selection based on interaural coherence, and a final decision maker based on supervised learning. The entire model is shown to be capable of imitating human sound localisation in different listening situations, including free field conditions and at the presence of <b>sound</b> <b>occlusion,</b> diffraction and reflection. Results are validated against subjective data found in the literature, and the model's applications to the fields of room acoustics and spatial audio are demonstrated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sound</b> source <b>occlusion</b> {{occurs when}} the direct path from a sound source to a {{listener}} is blocked by an intervening object. Currently, {{a variety of methods}} exist for modeling <b>sound</b> source <b>occlusion.</b> These include finite element and boundary element methods, as well as methods based on time-domain models of edge diffraction. At present, the high computational requirements of these methods precludes their use in real-time environments. In the case of real-time geometric room acoustic methods (e. g. the image method, ray tracing), the model of sound propagation employed makes it difficult to incorporate wave-related effects such as occlusion. As a result, these methods generally do not incorporate <b>sound</b> source <b>occlusion.</b> The lack of a suitable <b>sound</b> source <b>occlusion</b> method means that developers of real-time virtual environments (such as computer games) have generally either ignored this phenomenon or used rudimentary and perceptually implausible approximations. A potential solution to this problem is the use of shadow algorithms from computer graphics. These algorithms can provide a way to efficiently simulate <b>sound</b> source <b>occlusion</b> in real-time and in a physically plausible manner. Two simulation prototypes are presented, one for fixed-position sound sources and another for moving sound sources...|$|R

The difficulty lies in treating a mixture of <b>sounds,</b> <b>occlusion</b> (some talkers are hidden) and real-time processing. Our approach consists of three components; (1) the extraction of the direction of each speaker by using interaural phase difference and interaural intensity difference, (2) the resolution of each speaker's direction by multi-modal integration of audition, vision and motion with canceling inevitable motor noises in motion {{in case of an}} unseen or silent speaker, and (3) the distributed implementation to three PCs connected by TCP/IP network to attain real-time processing.

40|$|Audio is {{a crucial}} aspect {{to bear in mind}} when {{designing}} virtual reality applications, as it can add a whole new level of immersion to this kind of experiences if properly used. In order to create realistic sound, it is essential to take audio spatialization into consideration, providing the information necessary for an individual to estimate the position of sound sources and the characteristics of surrounding spaces. This project proposes implementing spatial audio in virtual reality scenes created with a game engine, as well as providing all of the theoretical bases that explain how this can be ultimately achieved. It first touches upon how the human auditory system is able to estimate the direction and distance to an audio source by interpreting cues such as time and level differences between ears, pinnae reflections, reverberation and general variations in loudness. Next, the limited spatial properties present in the most common audio reproduction systems are discussed, arguing why they are insufficient for virtual reality applications. Two spatial audio recording and reproduction techniques for headphones and loudspeakers are presented as alternatives for virtual reality scenarios in which the user remains static. As a means of acquiring the knowledge necessary to understand more advanced spatial audio systems, the concept known as Head Related Transfer Function or HRTF is introduced in great detail. It is explained how HRTFs encompass all physical cues that condition sound localization, as well as how the frequency responses that characterize them can be experimentally measured and used for artificial spatialization of virtual sources. Several HRTF-based spatial audio systems are presented, differentiating between those that apply HRTFs as mathematical models and those that make use of experimental impulse response data sets. These advanced models are the way to go if spatial audio is to be applied to virtual reality experiences that involve user motion, as they are capable of constantly adapting to the user’s position and direction relative to the present virtual sources. The rest of the project focuses on how some of the mentioned HRTF-based spatial audio systems can be implemented in the Unity game engine. The poor built-in spatialization options the main software offers can be complemented and greatly improved with the use of audio plugins that perform HRTF filtering and introduce features such as <b>sound</b> <b>occlusion,</b> room simulation models and sound directivity patterns. Three demos with different levels of complexity are finally carried out in Unity in order to showcase the virtues of spatial audio in virtual reality applications...|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustical}} model using simplified ear anatomy {{was designed}} to predict the ear-canal <b>sound</b> pressure <b>occlusion</b> effect in humans. These predictions were compared perceptually {{as well as with}} ear-canal <b>sound</b> pressure <b>occlusion</b> effect measurements using a foam earplug with shallow insertion, a foam earplug with deep insertion into the bony part of the ear canal, and a circumaural earmuff. There was good resemblance between model predictions and ear-canal sound pressure measurements. It was also found that all occlusion positions, even deep ear-canal occlusion, produced noticeable occlusion effects. With the bone-conduction transducer at the forehead, the perceived occlusion effect was close to that obtained from ear-canal sound pressure data in the 0. 3 to 2 kHz frequency range; when the stimulation was at the mastoid the difference between the perceived and measured ear-canal <b>sound</b> pressure <b>occlusion</b> effect was around 10 dB at frequencies below 1 kHz. Further, the occlusion effect was obtained in two clinical settings: with supra-aural earphones (TDH 39), and insert earphones (CIR 22). Although both transducers produced occlusion effects, insert earphones produced a greater effect than surpaaural earphones at the low frequencies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHeat is a {{byproduct}} of phacoemulsification, {{which can lead to}} phacoburns. Torsional phacoemulsification has been reported to generate less heat and hence fewer phacoburns. We describe three cases of phacoburns during torsional phacoemulsification, which were caused by ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) occlusion. Prominent phacoburns occurred at the beginning of sculpting using torsional phacoemulsification. The tips and tubing were patent on examination. <b>Occlusion</b> <b>sounds</b> disappeared after aspiration of OVD. The corneal wounds were closed with sutures, leaving the adhesion of the iris to the corneal wounds. Separation of the iris from the cornea was done later, and a central round pupil was achieved in Cases 2 and 3. Astigmatism improved with time in all three patients. OVD still needs to be cleared around the tip before torsional phacoemulsification is activated. Once a thermal burn has occurred, sutures with acceptable adhesion of the iris to the wound and delayed separation may be considered...|$|R

The pump manometer system of an impedance bridge {{was used to}} change the air pressure in the ear canal of twenty-two normally hearing subjects. BC thresholds were measured with: (1) open ear; (2) the ear canal occluded with a probe tube and application of 0 daPa air pressure; and (3) the ear canal occluded with a probe tube and application of - 350 daPa air pressure. Thresholds were lower in condition 2 than in condition 1, the difference decreasing from 27 dB at 2500 Hz to 4. 5 dB at 2000 Hz. Thresholds were higher in condition 3 than in condition 2.

40|$|Abstract Background Magnesium sulfate is an {{affordable}} and effective treatment for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. In settings where infusion pumps {{are not available}} to regulate the flow rate of intravenous delivery, healthcare providers must administer magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) via time-consuming and painful, large-volume intramuscular injections. As an alternative to costly commercially available syringe pumps, we developed AutoSyp, an accurate, low-cost, and low-powered syringe pump {{designed to meet the}} needs and constraints these low-resource settings. This paper describes results of a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of using AutoSyp to administer MgSO 4 intravenously to women suffering from pre-eclampsia at a referral hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods AutoSyp was programmed to deliver MgSO 4 following the Zuspan regimen to pregnant and post-partum women suffering from pre-eclampsia at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blatnyre, Malawi. Given the selection of either loading or maintenance dose on AutoSyp’s user interface, the flow rate was automatically programmed to dispense 60  mL/h or 5  mL/h of 20 % MgSO 4 solution, respectively. During each treatment, the dispensed volume was automatically calculated by the device based on the plunger position and stored on a computer for accuracy analysis of the mean flow rate and total volume delivered. The clinical results for both the loading and maintenance dose administrations were compared to the device’s accuracy during tests performed in the laboratory setting. Results Twenty-two women were enrolled in this study. In both the clinical and laboratory settings, the mean flow rate errors for the loading and maintenance dose infusions were under 2 %. During 466  h of testing, the device <b>sounded</b> 129 <b>occlusion</b> alarms across 14 subjects. Of these, 71 alarms were false positives. Conclusion Results of this study support the use of AutoSyp as a less painful and accurate means of MgSO 4 administration in clinical environments that lack infusion systems. There were a large number of false alarms in the current system which will be addressed in future designs. AutoSyp maintains the comfort of intravenous MgSO 4 administration, but unlike commercially available syringe pumps, it is capable of operating with a variety of syringe brands and sizes and requires no additional consumables. AutoSyp’s appropriate design will benefit its implementation and sustained use in low-resource settings.

40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} {{linguistic}} concept of metonymy and examines its {{potential as a}} creative structural principle both in poetry and in music. I explore the role of metonymy {{in the work of}} the poet J. H. Prynne, the improvising guitarist Derek Bailey, and the composer Helmut Lachenmann. I have also deployed some of the ideas arising from this exploration in a modular composition for improvisers entitled Representations, recordings of which accompany this thesis. My argument is that metonymy provides a means by which a work of poetry or of music can be highly sensitive to the world which it inhabits, but can do so by itself being an inextricably linked part of this world, rather than an attempt to reproduce or represent it, or to simply pass judgement from the sidelines. In my introduction I outline the literary theory of metonymy. I discuss the way that metonymy encompasses relationships both of contiguity and causality, and make the case that the many limitations inherent in metonymy (which have often led to its being perceived as inferior to metaphor) can in fact be seen as advantanges, because of the way that they can bind the work of art to the real. I briefly discuss some previous applications of metonymy to music, and outline an understanding of musical metonymy based on linear dissimilarity, historical and social contiguity, the origins and agency behind particular <b>sounds,</b> and an <b>occlusion</b> of the structural middleground. The first chapter discusses the work of J. H. Prynne. I argue that a use of metonymy as a productive constraint is illuminated by a philosophical position according to which the world is known to be real because of the resistances it presents to the actualisation of our desires. I discuss the role of metonymy in the development of Prynne’s poetic oeuvre, before illustrating my argument with a detailed analysis of the 2001 sequence Unanswering Rational Shore. In the second chapter I turn to the work of Derek Bailey. Drawing heavily on unpublished items from the Incus archive, I demonstrate the meticulous way in which Bailey constructed his improvisational vocabulary, and the senses in which that vocabulary and its deployment could be characterised as metonymic. I explore the influence on Bailey of Stockhausen, Beckett and Musil, and show how form and material in his work are inextricably entwined. The third chapter examines the work of Helmut Lachenmann and in particular the 1992 composition „ [...] . zwei Gefühle [...] . “, Musik mit Leonardo. I examine the role of the listener and the productive activity that metonymic structures require of them. I focus on Lachenmann’s deployment both of actual and pseudo-causality in his music, as well as his use of historical reference in an indexical fashion. In my fourth chapter I present my composition for improvisers, Representations. I discuss its mechanics, development, and influences, and I set forth its relationship to the concepts of musical metonymy I have elucidated in the body of this thesis, under the headings of “arbitration”, similarity, referentiality and the relationship between material and the middleground. In a short concluding chapter I take another angle on the links between the themes of this thesis by discussing the role of rubbish in the work of Prynne, Bailey and Lachenmann, and its apparently paradoxical relationship with a certain concept of purity. This allows me to conclude by considering the relationship of metonymic structures to a conception of truth which, I believe, has a certain urgency in the contemporary artistic climate.
