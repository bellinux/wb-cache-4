5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with {{a consideration of the}} relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E

I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E

25|$|The rabbis of the Middle Ages {{discussed}} {{the issue of}} people eating milk and meat {{at the same table}}. Jacob ben Asher suggested that each individual <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> from different tablecloths, while Moses Isserles argued that a large and obviously unusual item should be placed between the individuals, as a reminder to avoid sharing the foods. Later rabbinic writers pointed out exceptions to the rule. Chaim ibn Attar, an 18th-century kabbalist, ruled that sitting at the same table as a non-Jew eating non-kosher food was permissible; Yechiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-century rabbi, argued that the risk was sufficiently reduced if individuals sat far enough apart {{that the only way to}} share food was to leave the table.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century there were several visitations. There is no notice of any by Bishop Dalderby; but he {{commissioned}} the prior of Dunstable in 1315 to visit the nuns of St. Giles-in-the-Wood in his name. Bishop Burghersh in 1322 wrote to order the prior and convent to take back a brother {{who had been on}} a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and asserted that he did so with the permission of his superior; and a little later the prior was cited for refusing to obey this injunction. In 1359 Bishop Gynwell, passing by the priory, noticed 'certain insolences and unlawful wanderings' of the canons, and wrote to reinforce the rule that none should go beyond the precincts of the monastery without reasonable cause, nor without the permission of the prior; and ordered further that such permission should not be too frequently given. He also reminded them of the rule that none <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> or drink outside the monastery, or talk with seculars without permission.|$|E
40|$|Chronic energy {{deficiencies}} {{leading to}} impaired performance and injury are a prevalent {{problem in the}} dance world. This {{is due to a}} lot of dancers' misconceptions about nutrition as well as what and how much they <b>should</b> be <b>eating</b> to fuel their bodies. This is also due to a high rate of disordered eating and eating disorders among the dance population. This project explores the science behind what dancers <b>should</b> be <b>eating,</b> how much they <b>should</b> be <b>eating,</b> and when they <b>should</b> be <b>eating.</b> Recipes for healthy breakfasts, lunches, and dinners are included as examples for quick and easy solutions to meal times. A typical dance schedule with a proper diet is also included {{to make it easier to}} see what a day of training and <b>eating</b> <b>should</b> look like. Lastly, a section discussing eating disorders and disordered eating is included to bring awareness to those issues. This project was put together using information from various textbooks and scientific journals from the past fifteen years. The recipes were created to be quick and easy, as well as to also provide adequate nutrition to the consumer. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

500|$|When Mortimer {{discovered}} the conspiracy against him, Montagu {{was brought in}} for interrogationalong with the kingbut gave nothing away. Afterward he supposedly advised Edward to move against his protector, because [...] "It was better that they <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> the dog than that the dog <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> them". On 19 October 1330, while Mortimer and Isabella were entrenched in Nottingham Castle, the constable of the castle showed Montagu a secret entrance through an underground tunnel. Along with William de Bohun, Robert Ufford, and John Neville and others, he entered the castle, where he met up with the king. A short brawl followed before Mortimer was captured. The queen stormed into the chamber shouting [...] "Good son, have pity on noble Mortimer". Edward did not obey his mother's wishes, and {{a few weeks later}} Mortimer was executed for treason in London. As a reward for his part in the coup, Montagu was given lands worth £1000, including the Welsh lordship of Denbigh that had belonged to Mortimer. His family also benefited; his brother Simon Montacute became Bishop of Worcester and later of Ely. Another brother, Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu, married Alice of Norfolk, a co-heir of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Matt Selman and directed by Nancy Kruse. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 27, 2002. The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is at the movie theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, he did say that one <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These trivias were subsequently included in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the beliefs}} held by Han-era {{physicians}} {{are known to}} modern historians through such texts as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing) medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the Book of Later Han. It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the five phases and yin and yang dictated their medical decisions and assumptions. The Han-era Chinese believed that each organ in the body was associated {{with one of the}} five phases (metal 金, wood 木, water 水, fire 火, earth 土) and had two circulatory qi channels (任督二脉). If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health. For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart—associated with the fire phase—caused one to become sluggish, then one <b>should</b> <b>eat</b> sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire). The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis, a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted [...] "vital energy" [...] (qi) and what qualities the latter had, in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering. Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as the proper way to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess. The Huangdi neijing noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of circadian rhythm, although explained in terms of the five phases.|$|E
