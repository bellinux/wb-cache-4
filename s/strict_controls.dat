25|$|In the afternoon, Thailand's coup leader ordered media {{executives}} to army headquarters {{to tell them}} to stop carrying expression of public opinion following the military takeover. The move came after the military imposed <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> on the media and said they would block information deemed harmful to the provisional military council now in control of Thailand.

25|$|Another popular legend {{concerns}} the Han Chinese's uprising against the ruling Mongols {{at the end}} of the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368 CE), in which the Han Chinese used traditional mooncakes to conceal the message that they were to rebel on Mid-Autumn Day. Because of <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> upon Han Chinese families imposed by the Mongols in which only 1 out of every 10 households was allowed to own a knife guarded by a Mongolian guard, this coordinated message was important to gather as many available weapons as possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, federal {{expenditures}} {{accounted for}} only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt {{as a percent of}} GNP showed little change. Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944 government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The US economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise in favor of the imposition of <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among Labor and Business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the Federal Government.

We searched the medical literature for export opinions, surveys, and clinical reports on blood glucose control in intensive care medicine. While <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control</b> has been recommended standard of care for critically ill patients, the risk of severe hypoglycemia with <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control</b> is frequently mentioned by experts. Some rationalize this risk, though others strongly point out {{the high incidence of}} hypoglycemia to be (one) reason not to perform <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Implementation of <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control</b> is far from complete in intensive care units across the world. Frequently local guidelines accept higher blood glucose levels than those with <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Only a minority of retrieved manuscripts are on blood glucose regimens with the lower targets as with <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Hypoglycemia certainly is encountered with blood glucose control, in particular with <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Reports show intensive care-nurses can adequately and safely perform <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Reports show intensive care-nurses can adequately and safely perform <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control.</b> Implementation of <b>strict</b> glycemic <b>control</b> is far from complete, at least {{in part because of the}} feared risks of hypoglycemia.

25|$|Just {{how long}} the {{trajectory}} could continue, however, remained unclear. According to the 11th five-year plan, China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of central planning and winning them {{to the cause of}} reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the banking sector and launching the beginnings of a real capital market. According to an article in Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China. This process, however, would not be easy. As of 2004, China's state-owned enterprises were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in non-performing loans, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a floating exchange rate, and <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> on both the current and capital accounts.|$|E

500|$|Amphetamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, {{when it was}} independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine as a decongestant. Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3years later and was used to treat {{a wide variety of}} medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> on the sale of amphetamine. [...] For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a scheduleII controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes.|$|E
500|$|Schwarzkopf {{sought to}} change the {{relationship}} between journalists and the military, feeling that the news media's negative portrayal of the Vietnam War had degraded troops there. When he took command during the Gulf War, he sought an entirely different strategy which was ultimately successful, where he favored greater media coverage, albeit subject to <b>strict</b> <b>controls</b> on the battlefield. Schwarzkopf favored the intense press surrounding the Gulf War conflict, feeling that blocking the news media as had been done in Grenada would contribute to negative public perception {{of the war in}} the United States. His dealings with the press were thus frequent and very personal, and he conducted regular briefings for journalists. He would usually not attack media coverage, even negative coverage, unless he felt it was blatantly incorrect. He staged visible media appearances which played to patriotism. In fact, Schwarzkopf believed extensive press coverage would help build public support for the war and raise morale. In some press conferences, he showed and explained advanced war-fighting technology the U.S. possessed to impress the public. These also had the side effect of distracting the public from focusing on U.S. casualty counts or the destruction wrought in the war. Schwarzkopf's strategy was to control the message being sent, he therefore ordered media on the battlefield to be escorted at all times. In spite of this, several high-profile reports publicized the CENTCOM strategy. [...] After the war Schwarzkopf was very critical of military analysts who scrutinized his operation, feeling that some of them were poorly informed on the factors involved in his planning, and that others were violating operational security by revealing too much about how he might plan the operation.|$|E
