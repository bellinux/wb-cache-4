25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} <b>square</b> <b>threads</b> {{is that they}} have a much higher intrinsic efficiency than trapezoidal threads (Acme or metric trapezoidal).

40|$|A {{screw jack}} is a device used {{to lift the}} vehicle above the ground level in order to ease repairs. A power screw is {{designed}} to translate radial motion to linear motion. Many users are familiar with manually operated car jack which still included as standard equipment in cars. A car jack is an important device in vehicle to change flat tire in our journey. Every year near about 160 injuries are associated with car jacks. The correct use of jacks can prevent the accidents and injuries. Improvement in Design of car jack is really important to make the tool more efficient and user friendly with high safety features. The objectives of this project work is to critically analyze and compare between ACME and <b>SQUARE</b> <b>threads</b> from stress and strain perspective {{in order to improve}} the performance from safety and durability point of view for developments in the field of thread design. In this project selection of two different types of screw <b>threads</b> namely <b>Square</b> and Acme <b>threads.</b> The <b>square</b> <b>threads</b> are named after their square geometry. They are the most efficient power screw, but also the most difficult to machine, thus most expensive. The Acme threads are machining with multipoint cutting tool on thread milling machine, it is an economical operation. Acme threads have more thickness at core diameter than of <b>Square</b> <b>threads</b> therefore a screw with Acme threads is stronger than equivalent screw with <b>Square</b> <b>threads.</b> Assumptions made in designing a Power screw are the total load is distributed among the threads i. e. of car jack of capacity 1. 5 to 3 tones threads are in direct shear, various stresses in screw like tensile or compressive {{in the body of the}} screw due to an axial load.

50|$|In machinery, the {{buttress}} thread form {{is designed to}} handle extremely high axial thrust in one direction.

The resulting thread form has the same low friction properties as a <b>square</b> <b>thread</b> form but at about twice the shear strength due to the long thread base. This thread form also is easy to machine on a thread milling machine, unlike the difficult to machine <b>square</b> <b>thread</b> form. It can also compensate for nut wear using a split nut, much like the Acme thread form.|$|E

When the handle is turned clockwise, the screw moves further out of the base, lifting the load resting on the load table. In order to support large load forces, the screw usually has either <b>square</b> <b>threads</b> or buttress threads.|$|R

50|$|The term {{is often}} applied to illegal weapons that {{are created by}} cutting off {{the barrel of a}} {{standard}} shotgun. This has a dramatic effect on double-barreled or single-shot shotguns because the barrel can be cut to any length. Pump-action or semi-automatic shotguns usually have a tube magazine attached to the underside of the barrel which limits the minimum barrel length to slightly longer than the length of the magazine tube, when only the barrel is modified. Although the magazine can be shortened, with a corresponding loss in magazine capacity, such a modification tends to be considerably more technically complex, involving cutting and welding or silver soldering at a bare minimum and often large diameter <b>square</b> <b>threading.</b> Repeating-fire shotguns with box magazines do not lose shell capacity when sawed off, but they are far less common than those with tubular magazines.
