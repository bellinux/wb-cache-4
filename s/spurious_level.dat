Design parameters for the proposed fractional-N PLL synthesizer for WiMAX system are either selected from WiMAX standards or according to results of analysis for each unit of the proposed system. Different techniques for phase noise reduction are discussed. Sigma-delta fractional-N technique is chosen for WiMAX system, since low settling time, <b>spurious</b> <b>level</b> and phase noise can be obtained by using this technique. The simulation result shows the system is stable, since the phase margin is greater than 45 degree. The settling time, <b>spurious</b> <b>level</b> and phase noise obtained with this synthesizer are 5. 9 µs,- 90 dBc/Hz, and- 100 dBc/Hz respectively.

This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on.

30|$|However, {{as can be}} {{seen from}} Figure 10, the {{cancelling}} pulses show obvious discontinuity which would produce substantial out-of-band emission. To mitigate the out-of-band emission, a filter can be applied to smooth the discontinuities, and the resulting waveform of the smoothed cancelling pulse is also denoted by the dashed curve in Figure 10. In our method, we use a simple moving average filter as a smoothing filter, with which the out-of-band <b>spurious</b> <b>level</b> caused by non-continuous cancelling pulses can be reduced. Note that the smoothing filter is actually optional as we can still obtain a moderate out-of-band emission without it, considering that the occurrence of high peaks is a rare event [3]. The smoothing filter is only necessary in the ACLR-prior circumstance. Normally, a short-length smoothing filter is adequate to further improve the ACLR performance. As the filter length is very short, it gives negligible effect on EVM.|$|E

The architecture consists of a digital frequency synthesizer/modulator for continuousphase modulations (CPM’s) and a fast frequency settling RF synthesizer consisting of one phase-locked loop (PLL). The performance of the digital frequency synthesizer/CPM modulator has been analyzed theoretically and simulated by a computer program. The analyses show that the proposed digital frequency synthesizer/CPM modulator achieves 2. 5 -W lower power consumption and 18 -dB lower <b>spurious</b> <b>levels</b> than the fast frequency hopping systems synthesizing digitally a full frequency band.

Similarly, finds {{known only to}} the nearest kilometre square are usually mapped in the bottom left-hand corner of the square in GIS.

This article looks at an alternative method for mapping such finds in order to produce an Artefact Density Index for areas, which more usefully reflects the pattern of activities across the landscape. The Artefact Density Index (ADI) was divided to reflect broad archaeological periods (e. g. Roman, medieval etc.), as well as broad artefact types (e. g. weapons, tools etc.). The ADI was based on combining weighted values for finds types, with the weight reflecting the precision of the location of the finds (i. e. finds recorded only at parish level will be given less weight than those recorded more precisely).

Frequency synthesizers are used throughout communications systems for tuning the signal frequencies needed for receiving and transmitting.

Many of these synthesizers have been developed as integrated-circuit (IC) solutions. 3 In terms of circuit architectures, integer-N frequency synthesizers are often challenged in meeting performance requirements such as loop bandwidth, phase noise, and channel spacing due to the fundamental design of the integer-N divider modulus. In contrast, a fractional-N frequency synthesizer can provide the loop bandwidths needed for many of these emerging wireless applications, with fine channel spacing.

The predictive {{power of the}} random-matrix theories, which do not contain any adjustable parameters, is striking, and the application is rather simple and fast. A new evaluation of 238 U resonance parameters has recently been performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory; {{the objective of this}} paper is to illustrate the use of RMT in the field of resonance-parameter evaluation with the newly evaluated 239 U energy levels and widths. Several statistics were computed using the s-wave resonances up to 20 keV and compared to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble predictions. It is shown that a good agreement is observed between RMT and the experimental data up to 2. 5 keV. The F-Dyson statistic was especially investigated because of its claimed ability to detect locally missed and <b>spurious</b> <b>levels</b> in the sample (p-resonances contamination or unresolved multiplets). As expected, the entire set of evaluated 238 U s-wave resonances up to 20 keV disagrees significantly with the theory. There are two reasons for this: First, it is difficult to distinguish s- and p-wave resonances in the analysis. Second, especially above 10 keV, it is impossible to determine reliable resonance energies from the available experimental data. It is concluded that the use of RMT can help nuclear data evaluators to improve their evaluations in the resonance range...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{and interpretation of}} the impact factor of a journal is fraught with problems, {{some of which are}} explored in this editorial. The impact factor is a magic number. It can turn lecturers into professors, cause editors to whoop with delight, bring riches to the impoverished, and resuscitate moribund uni-versity departments. But it has a dark side too. Unlike the Michelin star, it has not yet led to suicide, but it may only be a matter of time. What is this magic number and why should any reader of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery be interested in it? Invented in 1955 by the information scien-tist Eugene Garfield, 1 the impact factor has come to have prime importance in evaluating academics, university departments and scien-tific journals. When applied to journals, it in essence measures the number of times schol-arly articles in a particular journal are cited in a larger group of journals. The notion is that an article must have some value if it has been cited. For example, the annual impact factor of a journal for 2006 would be as follows: Citations in 2006 to articles published in 2004 - 2005 Number of ‘citable ’ articles published in 2004 - 2005 The impact factor is calculated by Thomson Scientific (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) using a database of journals. The Annual Review of Immunology has an impact factor of 54. 445, the New England Journal of Medicine around 35, the Lancet around 23, and the British Med-ical Journal around 9.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} a useful and economic measuring principle with which radar spurious emissions can be investigated {{under field conditions}} without disturbing {{the function of the}} radar in any way. The method presented here consists of two parts: In the time-domain parameter study is presented, how the radar antenna rotation produces radar pulses to the measuring receiver. Also is presented, how receiver parameters are defined by availability and use of radar pulses in the measurement. In the frequency spectrum measurement part a new sweep measurement system is presented. In this measurement the YIG filter presented by ITU [1] is replaced by a similar multistage tunable band-stop filter, which meets similar filtering characteristics, this is more easy to use and a less expensive filter. It is explained how the needed measurement dynamics are achieved and how the measurement time is determined and optimized in different situations. A two part measuring approach like this has not been reported before. ITU recommendations for attenuation of radar spurious emissions are updated to 100 dB below the radar nominal frequency (NF) signal level. The fulfillment of these <b>spurious</b> <b>level</b> requirements sets a hard challenge for measuring dynamics: dynamics must be more than 110 dB. The author provides in this work a solution to this requirement. This measuring method produces results, with which one can conclude the relative power level of radar spurious emissions and its effect on other radio services. In this work the spectrum produced by a 5 GHz weather radar has been studied and the results have been applied to study radar impact to terrestrial digital radio relay systems (TDRRS). The achieved result is both very important and current, and it can be utilized in the planning of new radar systems as also in the planning of new radio networks operating in the frequency ranges adjacent to radar frequencies.
