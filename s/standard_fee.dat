5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ. This {{is an example of}} a linear free energy relationship as log(Ka) is proportional to the <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E
25|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> is £11.50 per day if paid {{by midnight}} {{on the day}} of travel, £14 if paid {{by the end of the}} {{following}} day, or £10.50 if registered with CC Autopay, an automated payment system which records the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month and bills the customer debit or credit card each month. Businesses with six or more vehicles can register with Fleet Auto Pay, and will be charged £10.50 rather than £11.50 per vehicle per day for each vehicle detected within the zone. From 20 May 2013 failure to pay results in the issuance of a Penalty Charge Notice for £130, reduced to £65 if paid within 14 days, but increased to £195 if unpaid after 28 days.|$|E
25|$|Shooting {{began in}} mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. It was a mid-summer shoot and while on {{location}} {{on a huge}} castle set that was built near Acton, California {{on the edge of}} the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. Money problems forced cinematographer Bill Pope to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his <b>standard</b> <b>fee.</b> Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was still}} in Meadville, he was asked to prepare legal {{documentation}} for a new railroad that would connect to the city. The proposed railroad (likely the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad which was sometimes known as [...] "The Meadville Line") would almost connect with a larger nearby system (the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad), which meant that it could become a feeder route to the larger railroad. Holliday saw the potential of the line and instead of asking for a <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> to create the documents, he asked for and was granted a partnership in the new railroad. When this railroad was purchased by the larger system, Holliday earned $20,000 from the sale.|$|E
500|$|On 17 May 1636, Hale {{was called}} to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn, and {{immediately}} became the pupil of William Noy. Hale and Noy became close friends, {{to the point where}} he was referred to as [...] "the young Noy", and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden, a [...] "man of almost universal learning, whose theories were to dominate much of [...] later thought". Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law, and much of Hale's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory. Hale gained a good legal practise, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work. He sought to help the court reach a just verdict, whatever his client's concerns, and normally returned half his fee or charged a <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate. He refused to accept unjust cases, and always tried to be on the [...] "right" [...] side of any case; John Campbell wrote that [...] "If he saw that a cause was unjust, he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so; if the parties after that would go on, they were to seek another counsellor, for he would assist none in acts of injustice".|$|E

2500|$|Grace and {{his brother}} Fred faced {{financial}} difficulty after their father died in December 1871 as they were still living with their mother who had been left just enough to retain the family home. As medical students, they faced considerable outlay {{in addition to their}} living expenses and it became imperative for them to make what they could out of cricket, especially the United South of England Eleven. Grace as its match organiser had to find gaps in the first-class fixture list and then pull together a team to visit a location where a suitable profit could be made. It has been estimated that the <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> paid to the USEE was £100 for a three-day match with £5 each going to the nine professionals in the team and the other £45 to W. G. and Fred: a sizeable amount in 1872 when £100 was perhaps the equivalent of £3,000-plus {{at the end of the}} 20th century. Otherwise, Grace played for expenses but these were loaded as, for example, he is known to have claimed £15 per appearance for Gloucestershire and £20 for representing the Gentlemen. Although the money he was paid is [...] "small beer" [...] compared with 21st-century sports stars, there is no doubt he had a comfortable living out of cricket and made far more money than any contemporary professional. To put it in context, a domestic servant earned less than £50 a year.|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{issues related}} to the traditional and new health care systems in China. The driving force behind the traditional health care system was an uncontrollable increase in costs paid by the government. The new health care system requires both the individual and enterprises (private and state-owned) to contribute to their plan by establishing individual and hospital accounts, which appear to be effective in controlling medical care expenses. One unintended result is that the new system suppresses the demand of part-time workers (lowincome group) for hospital services. Policymakers, in revising urban health care plans, should seriously consider varying the upfront <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> (deduction) borne by patients because low-income groups {{may not be able to}} afford them. ...|$|R
