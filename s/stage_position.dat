5000|$|In 1980 Genigraphics engineers, {{while still}} under the budget of General Electric, worked with the {{production}} center [...] "Artists" [...] ("Operators") to develop a 35mm film animation capability within the limited constraints of the existing 100B system (Later to be called Computer Generated Illustration, or CGI). On the prototype consoles the software was enhanced to control shading and lighting angle, 3D <b>stage</b> <b>position,</b> orbit and rotation as well as timeline parameters with speed and dampening controls with start and end points. To create animated sequences the Artist simply created the object(s) from pre-shaped objects menus or created a wireframe and then affected that object with opacity, lighting and motion parameters while timing out the start and end points on a timeline. The software would then generate the interpolated frames in between the start and end points morphing the object's shape, color, rotational speed, <b>stage</b> <b>position</b> and size, for the specified number of frames within the specified start and end frame numbers of the timeline. An infinite number of objects could be animated throughout a sequence. In 1980 a collaboration {{of a group of}} Artists designed several animation sequences some of which ended up as openers for several network television broadcasts as well as a sequence for ABC's [...] "The Wide World of Sports". These computer generated sequences pre-dated the now famous Pixar and Lucas Studios CGI production capabilities by several years.|$|E

A double dot or some other variation marks the 12th fret and 24th frets. Variations on the standard dot shape can make a guitar more distinctive.

5000|$|The {{published}} stage directions {{also call}} for a character of indeterminate sex referred to as 'the Auditor' (generally played by a male) who wears a black robe and can be dimly seen stage left. When Beckett came {{to be involved in}} staging the play, he found that he was unable to place the Auditor in a <b>stage</b> <b>position</b> that pleased him, and consequently allowed the character to be omitted from those productions. However, he chose not to cut the character from the published script, and whether or not the character is used in production seems to be at the discretion of individual producers. As he wrote to two American directors in 1986: [...] "He is very difficult to stage (light--position) and may well be of more harm than good. For me the play needs him but I can do without him. I have never seen him function effectively." [...] In the 1978 Paris production he did reinstate the character but from then on abandoned the image concluding, as he had once said, that it was perhaps [...] "an error of the creative imagination." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a Lorentz force-based XY <b>positioning</b> <b>stage</b> with a {{stack of}} four {{electromagnetic}} linear motors in parallel configuration is presented.

40|$|Assembly, {{handling}} and dispensing systems for small-scale parts play {{an essential part}} in reducing the cost of these products. These operations require both long coarse positioning for transfer between operations as well as dispensing as well as fine short range positioning on the submicron level for feature assembly. Typical prismatic rolling guide-way based <b>positioning</b> <b>stages</b> with ballscrew drives are to inaccurate for positioning in the submicron level {{which led to the}} development of dual <b>stage</b> <b>positioning</b> systems [1]. One stage performs the coarse long-range motions whereas another stage provides small precise motions. One disadvantage of such systems is that each actuator requires individual motion feedback, which leads to higher system cost. Focus of this paper is the design of a <b>positioning</b> <b>stage</b> that uses a dual stage approach for coarse and fine positioning, but utilizes a single two-dimensional optical grating interferometer as position feedback for the resultant motion feedback. This results in significant reduction in error sources and measurement uncertainties due to misalignment and measurement system errors...|$|R
