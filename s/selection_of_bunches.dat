40|$|A 4. 2 GS/sec. beam {{excitation}} system with accelerator synchronization and power stages is described. The system {{is capable of}} playing unique samples (32 samples/bunch) for 15, 000 turns on selected bunch(es) in the SPS in syn- chronism with the injection and acceleration cycle. The purpose {{of the system is}} to excite internal modes of single-bunch vertical motion, and study the bunch dynamics in the presence of developing Electron cloud or TMCI effects. The system includes a synchronized master oscillator, SPS timing functions, an FPGA based arbitrary waveform generator, 4. 2 GS/sec. D/A system and four 80 W 20 - 1000 MHz amplifiers driving a tapered stripline pickup/kicker. A software GUI allows specification of various modulation signals, <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> and turns to excite, while a remote control interface allows simple control/monitoring of the RF power stages located in the tunnel. The successful use of this system for SPS MD measurements in 2011 is a vital proof-of-principle for wideband feedback using similar functions to correct the beam motion...|$|E

40|$|Association rule mining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} techniques of data mining that are used to extract the association patterns from large databases. Association rules are one of the most important assets of any organization that can be used for business development and profitability increase. Association rules contain sensitive information that threatens the privacy of its publication and they should be hidden before publishing the database. The aim of hiding association rules is to delete sensitive association rules from the published database so that possible side effects are reduced. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm DCR to hide sensitive association rules. In the proposed algorithm, two clustering operations are performed on the sensitive association rules and finally, a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> smaller clusters is chosen to hide. A <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> a smaller <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> clusters reduces the changes in the database and side effects.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the genetic diversity and performance of jatropha clones through morphological characterization to <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> clonal varieties for biofuels production. The clones were obtained through shoot cuttings from previous selection in a population of half - sibs progenies. The morphoagronomic analyses of clones was carried out at 180 days after transplantation and were evaluated plant height, stem diameter, number of primary branches and number of secondary branches, number <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> and number <b>of</b> fruits per plant. Evaluating clones performance, significant results were found for the number of secondary branches. About analysis of genetic diversity, the measures of dissimilarity genetic varied from 0. 62 to 13. 11, this way, the UFRBPR 14 and UFRBPR 15 clones were more divergent. The Tocher method was efficient to verify formation of four groups. The characteristics that most contributed to the divergence among clones were branches number, height and number <b>of</b> <b>bunches,</b> and, stem diameter had lower contribution. The jatropha clones differed only in the secondary branches number and multivariate analysis showed divergence among the jatropha clones with formation of four groups.

For simplicity, we use two-diffusional solution field and one-dimensional vicinal face.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explain the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around kink {{points in the}} tax schedule, and {{investigate}} whether such bunching may be occurring at the kink point created by the Norwegian wealth tax. I conclude that {{there seems to be}} no evidence <b>of</b> such <b>bunching,</b> after examining the distribution of taxpayers around the kink point in several ways. Theoretically, bunching at kink points should occur when there is an increase in the marginal tax rate, as the change in marginal payoff will lead to an uneven distribution of taxpayers around the kink point. This could also be further affected by different assets being treated differently for tax purposes. I present such a model, explaining the various mechanisms that affect the amount <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> and explain how it can occur. There have been other studies <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with some that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> and some that did not. Very few such studies have examined wealth taxation, with the exception of a recent Swedish study (Seim 2012) that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around a kink point created by the Swedish wealth tax. No such studies have been previously done for Norway, however. Examining tax data for the year 2012, I observe that the distribution of taxpayers appears to have no trace <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with various methods for observing potential bunching leading to the same conclusion. Furthermore, a look at the composition of wealth gave no indication that taxpayers responded to the wealth tax at all around the kink. It is particularly difficult to point to any strong reason for the different findings, given the similarity between Norway and Sweden in most aspects related to taxation. There are some methodological differences however, that are worth taking into account...|$|R
