5|$|On Ralph's death a second-cousin of dramatist William Congreve {{inherited}} the manor. The Congreve Family owned the estate {{at the time}} of the 1830 Swing Riots. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, wrecking twenty-three agricultural machines. Workers were <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> by the riots that they left their machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage. Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} {{results of}} Harders fifth war patrol have caused some {{to call it}} the most brilliant of the war. Not only did Harder further deplete the critical supply of destroyers by sinking four of them and heavily damaging or destroying another one in four days, but her frequent attacks and a rash of enemy contact reports on this fleeting marauder <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> Admiral Soemu Toyoda that he believed Tawi-Tawi surrounded by submarines. As a result, Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans, and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the Philippine Sea, thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.|$|E

25|$|In 1257, Crown Prince Trần Hoảng {{witnessed}} the first Mongol invasion in Vietnam. In the beginning, Đại Việt's army suffered several defeats by the Mongols {{who had already}} conquered a vast area in Asia. Several high-ranking officials of Trần dynasty were <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> that Prince Khâm Thiên Trần Nhật Hiệu, younger brother of Thái Tông, even suggested the Emperor that they might escape from Đại Việt to the Song dynasty. But because of the firm faith of the Emperor Thái Tông, grand chancellor Trần Thủ Độ and the talents of generals such as Prince Hưng Đạo Trần Quốc Tuấn and Lê Phụ Trần, the Trần dynasty was able to throw back the invasion and ultimately re-established the peace in Đại Việt in December 1257.|$|E
25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E
25|$|During the screening, {{people began}} walking out; Goodman thought {{the film was}} bombing, until {{he learned that the}} viewers were {{actually}} leaving because they were <b>so</b> <b>frightened.</b> He then realized a remake was unwise. Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for USD$350,000. When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot. The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release {{is the only one of}} the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings. The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries. Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film finally get slated for a fall release.|$|E

25|$|Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the {{barbiturates}} {{are known}} for the severe physical dependence that {{they are capable of}} inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects. This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of tolerance often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe benzodiazepine dependence. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could offer me a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time– I've never been <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> in my life. Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} short: {{in the morning}} of the same day the Byzantines {{attacked}} and the squad of Aplakes engaged the Bulgarians first. It managed to inflict some casualties to the Bulgarians but from the very beginning most of the Byzantines were <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> that they did not even engage their enemy. The Byzantines could not withstand even the first Bulgarian counter-attack and when Khan Krum advanced with the Bulgarian heavy cavalry against the left flank of Byzantines they immediately ran away. The Anatolian squad was the first to flee followed by the entire army. The soldiers of Aplakes were left behind and most of them perished, including their commander. The battle took place in a valley and when the Bulgarians saw the retreating enemy which was in the higher positions they at first suspected a trap. In fact they also did not expect to achieve success so quickly and at first did not chase them. But when the Bulgarians were certain that the enemy was fleeing in panic, their heavy cavalry rushed after the Byzantines. Many of them perished during the flight, others hid in different fortresses which were taken by the Bulgarians one by one and the rest managed to reach Constantinople. The chief commanders of Byzantine army, including the Emperor Michael I Rangabe and Leo the Armenian, were the first to abandon the battlefield. The Bulgarians took the Byzantine camp and a rich prize including gold and weaponry.|$|E

500|$|Although many Vikings {{had died}} in the plague during the siege of Paris, Ragnar lived to return home to King Horik. According to a story {{originating}} from a member of Cobbo's embassy, Ragnar, having attacked the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, then in the outskirts of medieval Paris, and which Cobbo later visited, attributed the plague to the power of Saint Germain of Paris. [...] While Ragnar showed the gold and silver he had acquired to Horik and boasted about how easy he thought the conquest of Paris had been, [...] he reportedly collapsed crying while relating that the only resistance he had met was by the long deceased saint. [...] As several of Ragnar's men died not long after, the king was <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> that he ordered the execution of all the survivors, and the release of all his Christian captives. [...] This event, in part, led Horik to receive Archbishop Ansgar, [...] "Apostle of the North", on friendly terms in his own kingdom.|$|E

One of them was Diego Viñales, an Argentinian national <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> {{that he might be}} deported as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a [...] spike fence. The New York Daily News printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gays, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.

500|$|Harald {{also wanted}} to re-establish Magnus's rule over Denmark, {{and in the long}} term {{probably}} sought to restore Cnut the Great's [...] "North Sea Empire" [...] in its entirety. While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through, the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn, from 1048 almost yearly until 1064. Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus's rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered Jutland, and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby, at the time the most important Danish trade center, {{and one of the best}} protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia. Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald's destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066. One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but according to Saxo Grammaticus, Sweyn's smaller army was <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned. Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements, he was never successful in occupying Denmark.|$|E
500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, {{and that she had}} told him to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|E
500|$|In The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide (1985), Goin' Home {{was given}} five stars and called [...] "particularly heartfelt". In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, jazz critic Scott Yanow gave it four-and-a-half stars {{and found the}} performances [...] "compelling". He said listeners who are [...] "only familiar with Shepp's earlier Fire Music" [...] will see the album as a [...] "revelation." [...] Moon believed its tempoless mood [...] "gives the themes an extra shot of majesty" [...] and found it [...] "supremely melodic", writing that both Shepp and Parlan [...] "do {{whatever is necessary to}} bring the spirit to the forefront." [...] Richard Cook gave it four out of four stars in The Penguin Guide to Jazz (2002). JazzTimes cited Goin' Home as one of [...] "the finest [...] of his career", and Tom Hull of The Village Voice cited it as SteepleChase's best release. Phil Johnson of The Independent wrote that the album [...] "can be listened to almost without cease." [...] Jazz historian Eric Nisenson called it [...] "one of the most moving albums of the Seventies", but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp, an iconic figure in free jazz, [...] "was no longer the firebrand who had <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans." [...] Nisenson felt that, like Pharoah Sanders, Shepp's [...] "trial by fire {{at the heart of the}} Sixties avant-garde had made him an unusually expressive musician," [...] and Goin' Home showed that he was [...] "finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition." ...|$|E

500|$|Ralambo {{expanded}} and defended his realm {{through a combination}} of diplomacy and successful military action aided by the procurement of the first firearms in Imerina by way of trade with kingdoms on the coast. According to legend, when a group of warriors from a village near the Ikopa river attempted to attack the village of Ambohibaoladina, Ralambo <b>so</b> <b>frightened</b> the warriors with the noise of a single shotgun blast that every warrior ran into the Ikopa river and drowned. Imposing a capitation tax for the first time (the vadin-aina, or [...] "price of secure life"), he was able to establish the first standing Merina royal army and established units of blacksmiths and silversmiths to equip them. He famously repelled an attempted invasion by an army of the powerful western coastal Betsimisaraka people at a site now known as Mandamako ("Lazy") at Androkaroka, north of Alasora. The Betsimisaraka traditionally only fought at night and so were found asleep in their camp by Ralambo and his men and were easily vanquished. In another famous incident, Ralambo's army set a trap for a Vazimba king named Andrianafovaratra who claimed to control thunder. Ralambo's emissary, a man named Andriamandritany, was sent to the Vazimba king to invite him to participate in a contest of superiority against Ralambo. While Andrianafovaratra traveled to join Ralambo for the competition, Andriamandritany set fire to the Vazimba capital of Imerinkasinina. The Vazimba king saw the smoke and began to hasten back to the village but was captured in an ambush laid by Ralambo's troops and was forced to exile himself in the forests far to the east.|$|E
