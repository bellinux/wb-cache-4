5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that the two groups were related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, more similar to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{relations}} of early Philippine polities with the various state-level polities of Indonesia and Malaysia, legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early Philippine polities with the Srivijaya empire, {{but there is not}} much archeological evidence to definitively support <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship.</b> Considerable evidence exists, on the other hand, for extensive trade with the Majapahit empire.|$|E

5|$|The Adventure Time {{crew was}} {{satisfied}} with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship.</b> Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E
25|$|The Doukai of the 11th century {{provided}} several generals, governors. They seem to {{have come}} from Paphlagonia, and were exceedingly wealthy, possessing extensive estates in Anatolia.

25|$|She {{was taught}} her craft of {{performing}} {{at a school}} for young actors developed by Killigrew {{and one of the}} fine male actors of the time, Charles Hart, and learned dancing from another, John Lacy; both were rumored by satirists of the time to be her lovers, but if she had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with Lacy (Beauclerk thinks it unlikely), it was kept much more discreet than her well-known affair with Hart.|$|E
25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.|$|E
25|$|Mycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the roots of most plant species. In <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship,</b> both the plants themselves and {{those parts of the}} roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The Orchidaceae are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.|$|E

50|$|Arguably, Korte's law is counterintuitive.

25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship,</b> but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
25|$|Engels' {{ideas on}} the role of {{property}} {{in the creation of the}} modern family and as such modern civilization begin to become more transparent in the latter part of Chapter 2 as he begins to elaborate on the question of the monogamous relationship and the freedom to enter into (or refuse) <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship.</b> Bourgeois law dictates the rules for relationships and inheritances. As such, two partners, even when their marriage is not arranged, will always have the preservation of inheritance in mind and as such will never be entirely free to choose their partner. Engels argues that a relationship based on property rights and forced monogamy will only lead to the proliferation of immorality and prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In this {{therapeutic}} setting, {{the family}} is urged not to condone or reward the FD individual's behavior. This form of treatment can be unsuccessful if {{the family is}} uncooperative or displays signs of denial and/or antisocial disorder. Psychotherapy is another method used to treat the disorder. These sessions {{should focus on the}} psychiatrist's establishing and maintaining a relationship with the patient. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> may help to contain symptoms of FD. Monitoring is also a form that may be indicated for the FD patient's own good; FD (especially proxy) can be detrimental to an individual's health—if they are, in fact, causing true physiological illnesses. Even faked illnesses/injuries can be dangerous, and might be monitored for fear that unnecessary surgery may subsequently be performed.|$|E

25|$|In Islam, {{marriage}} is a contract between {{the bride and groom}} (or their proxies) known as a nikah. Some Islamic couples only go through a nikah ceremony and do not register the marriage with the civil authorities or go through a civil ceremony. When <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> breaks down, the wife is left without state protection that would normally be available if the marriage had been registered according to civil law. The situation is exacerbated if the husband refuses to grant a talaq and also refuses to make any provision. In states where there is no Sharia Court, the affected individuals' only recourse would be to the local civil courts, but jurisdiction would be difficult to invoke except under the parens patriae provisions to protect the best interests of any children. As to transnational marriages, there is no reason in principle why religious ceremonies effective under the lex loci celebrationis should not create marriages recognized as valid everywhere.|$|E
25|$|During the 1999 offseason, West and Lakers owner Jerry Buss {{agreed to}} sign the then six-time NBA {{champion}} Phil Jackson to a high-priced, 5-year $30 million contract to be the team's new head coach entering the 1999–2000 season. Buss was previously a believer in spending conservatively on coaches, but O'Neal and Bryant had both encouraged West to hire Jackson. Jackson decided that the offense would revolve around O'Neal, who would be given responsibility to distribute the ball. Jackson also wanted better leadership, physical conditioning, and defense from O'Neal. The coach chose to develop {{a close relationship with}} O'Neal and not Bryant. Jackson calculated that O'Neal's personality craved <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship.</b> Bryant missed the season's first 15 games due to a broken right wrist, allowing the team to focus on O'Neal as Jackson had planned. The results of Jackson's hiring were promising, as the Lakers amassed a 67–15 record (one of the best records in league history). O'Neal led the league in scoring, averaging 29.7points per game, and he won his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award. During the playoffs, the Lakers fought off the eighth-seeded Sacramento Kings in five games, and then defeated the Phoenix Suns in the second round, four games to one.|$|E
