Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the <b>Syrian</b> parliament in Damascus {{in a gesture of}} solidarity, only for the visit to end with the <b>Syrian</b> parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A <b>Syrian</b> delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the <b>Syrian</b> military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The <b>Syrian</b> political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E
