5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He {{was in many}} ways a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> achievements.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} {{announcement}} {{to the actual}} launch of the product, Microsoft made <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> changes to the console. Initially the system was {{to be able to}} play a disc-based game without the disc after the initial install; however, this came with a requirement that the users would have to connect online once per day, as well as restrictions on used games. These policies were reversed in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E

5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity. On June 1, 2016, the Rockets named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard opted out of {{the final year of}} his {{contract}} later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. With Howard gone, Harden was now the undisputed franchise player. Harden reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. The Rockets also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented Harden and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European {{countries}}, {{women still}} lacked <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which he was expected to get <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E

5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> changes to its {{campaign}} {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi faction, included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid faction, if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR faction of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1620 (Old Style date), {{the initial}} group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the Speedwell, which {{was meant to}} {{accompany}} another ship to be hired in England. This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation. Myles and Rose Standish were aboard, along with the Bradfords, Winslows, Carvers, and others. The small, 60-ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers, to be provisioned there and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World. Another 90 passengers would board the 180-ton Mayflower. The Speedwell had <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> leaks while in port that caused delays, but both vessels departed Southampton August 5.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> weaknesses. The rear {{transverse}} bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature in the same vein as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided he wanted a big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was originally}} planned as a three-act opéra comique for the Opéra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped {{work on the}} opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form {{to meet the requirements}} of the Paris Opéra. This entailed <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics – including the spending of Bertram's money – continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in opéra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> {{problems}} with the casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E

The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian {{front was}} a {{separate}} theater of operations, which {{was involved in}} the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it was too far away and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds. In addition, and again unlike Crete, the Venetians enjoyed the support of much of the local population, particularly the Morlacchi. The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made <b>some</b> <b>significant</b> gains, including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres, and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment. The Ottomans were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split. In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of Šibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area. As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.|$|E
