25|$|The next {{buildings}} were all {{built in the}} 1940s. These include the other two sheds. The wooden shed is about ten by fifteen feet, with a gable roof of medium pitch, sheathed in corrugated metal. Its exterior walls are covered in <b>shiplap</b> wood siding. Its single entrance is off centered on the southern side, and has two small windows. Next to this wooden shed is a small corrugated metal shed. Its walls and roof are of corrugated metal, with the roof being shed-style sloping towards the ditch.|$|E
25|$|All three entrances use heavy opaque modern metal doors. On the inside, the {{sanctuary}} has curved rows of wooden pews on a hardwood floor divided by a central aisle that offer seating for 350. Laminated wooden buttresses flank all the windows; in between {{them are the}} painted Stations of the Cross. Every third buttress is heavier and thicker. The walls are finished in <b>shiplap</b> below the windowsill level; above that a chair rail sets off a finish of grooved rectangles similar to those on the exterior.|$|E

His home, sided in brick on the first story but <b>shiplap</b> above, dates to 1800 and occupied by the Belcher family {{until late in the}} 20th century. When the railroad began construction, in the 1850s, Belcher built most of the other homes in the district as tenant properties, to be rented to both his employees and those working at the large riverfront estates nearby.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Chris Fick and Betty Martin {{acquired}} the 6,000-square-foot building at 30 York Street and renovations were undertaken {{in order to}} create a more light-filled space prior to Gallery 30’s opening. Several 6-feet tall by 8-inches wide window panels were added to the east side of the brick building, and the interior was opened up to make way for a <b>shiplap</b> structure to be installed through the center of the space. Gettysburg contractor Robert Crouthamel was hired to construct a small house inside the building to serve as Gallery 30’s children’s book department. Gallery 30’s logo and storefront sign were designed by architect Fred Harle of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; the logo consisted of a white numeral 30 oriented at a 30-degree angle on a green background.|$|E
500|$|The marble {{capstone}} of the pyramidion is a truncated pyramid with a cubical keystone {{projecting from}} its base {{and a deep}} groove surrounding the keystone. The aluminum apex replaces its truncated top. The inside upper edges of the topmost slabs on the four faces of the pyramidion rest on the keystone and in the groove. It has a large vertical hole through which a [...] threaded copper rod passes and screws into {{the base of the}} apex, which used to form part of its lightning protection system. The keystone and groove occupy so much of its base that only a small horizontal area near its outer edge remains. The weight of the capstone is transferred to both the inner and outer portions of the <b>shiplap</b> upper edges of the slabs. It weighs , is [...] high from its base to its top, and is [...] square at its base.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} structural {{dynamic analysis}} of the Pratt & Whitney high-pressure fuel pump first-stage turbine blades has been performed to identify {{the cause of the}} tip cracking found in the turbomachinery in November 1997. The analysis was also used to help evaluate potential fixes for the problem. Many of the methods available in structural dynamics were applied, including modal displacement and stress analysis, frequency and transient response to tip loading from the first-stage Blade Outer Gas Seals (BOGS), fourier analysis, and shock spectra {{analysis of the}} transient response. The primary findings were that the BOGS tip loading is impulsive in nature, thereby exciting many modes of the blade that exhibit high stress at the tip cracking location. Therefore, a proposed BOGS count change would not help the situation because a clearly identifiable resonance situation does not exist. The recommendations for the resolution of the problem are to maintain the existing BOGS count, eliminate the stress concentration in the blade due to its geometric design, and reduce the applied load on the blade by adding <b>shiplaps</b> in the BOGS...|$|R

Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is [...] [...] Its weight is [...] The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24' from the vertical. [...] There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the [...] level, all being integrated into the walls up to the [...] level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E

50|$|Useful for its {{strength}} as a supporting member, {{and its ability}} to form a relatively tight seal when lapped, <b>shiplap</b> is usually used as a type of siding for buildings that do not require extensive maintenance and must withstand cold and aggressive climates.
