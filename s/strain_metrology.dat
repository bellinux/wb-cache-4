40|$|We have quantitatively {{measured}} the angle dependence in the Silicon 1 s X-ray absorption spectra of strained Si 1 -xGex thin films prepared by epitaxial growth on Si(1 0 0) substrates, through surface sensitive total electron yield detection. The linear dichroism difference extracted from these angle dependent X-ray absorption spectra {{is proportional to}} the degree of strain, as measured separately by Raman spectroscopy. This quantitative relationship provides a means to measure the compressive strain in Si 1 -xGex thin films. This strain-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy has the potential to realize a semiconductor <b>strain</b> <b>metrology</b> through high spatial resolution X-ray spectromicroscopy.

40|$|Semiconductor strain {{engineering}} {{has become}} a critical feature of high-performance electronics because of the significant device performance enhancements that it enables. These improvements, which emerge from strain-induced modifications to the electronic band structure, necessitate new ultra-sensitive tools to probe the strain in semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate that minute amounts of strain in thin semiconductor epilayers can be measured using electronic Raman scattering. We applied this strain measurement technique to two different semiconductor alloy systems using coherently strained epitaxial thin films specifically designed to produce lattice-mismatch strains as small as 104. Comparing our strain sensitivity and signal strength in AlxGa 1 xAs with those obtained using the industry-standard technique of phonon Raman scattering, we {{found that there was}} a sensitivity improvement of 200 -fold and a signal enhancement of 4 103, thus obviating key constraints in semiconductor <b>strain</b> <b>metrology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Strain in {{blanket and}} {{patterned}} silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structures {{have been investigated}} via apertureless near-field scanning Raman spectroscopy, specifically, to investigate the efficacy of so-called tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) for Si <b>strain</b> characterization and <b>metrology</b> for integrated circuit (IC) devices. The current study compares TERS generation using Ag-coated W tips in a 45 º incident beam, fixed-tip geometry and Ag-coated SiO 2 capillary tips in a normal incident, scanning-tip geometry. The latter demonstrates superior performance and is used in a differential scheme to investigate strain profiles in patterned SOI structures. Specifically, a blanket device layer with an engineered strain of 0. 075 %, is patterned to form arrays of isolated mesa structures (2 µm diameter). These mesa structures exhibit a stress relaxation of 117 MPa over a region extending ~ 200 nm from the island edge...|$|R
