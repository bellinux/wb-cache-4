40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} and control of permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind turbines (PMSG-WTs). The PMSG-WTs are widely used in wind energy conversion systems(WECSs), due to their merits such as high reliability, high efficiency, low noise, high torque to weight ratio and fast dynamic response. Usually, a PMSG-WT {{is connected to the}} power grid via an AC-DC-AC converter system. The PMSG-WT can rotate at varying speed based on variable wind power input and thus achieve high efficiency as it dose not need to synchronise its rotational speed with the grid frequency. An overview of the modeling of the PMSG-WT is give at first, with conventional vector control (VC) strategies applied for machine-side and grid-side converter. The VC strategy is a popular method widely used in industry due to its decoupled control of active/reactive power, but it may not provide satisfactory performance for the PMSG-WT as it is required to operate at varying speed in an operation envelope with wide operating range rather than one operation point. The feedback linearisation control (FLC) strategy can improve the performance of the VC with a global optimal controller crossing a wide region and variable operation points, but it has weak robustness against parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, and requires full state measurements. To improve performance of the VC and the FLC, nonlinear adaptive controllers (NACs) designed based on FLC and perturbation estimation and their applications in machine-side and grid-side converter control of the PMSG-WT, and speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) have been studied. In the design of the proposed NAC, by defining a lumped perturbation term to present coupling nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainties, and other unknown disturbance, then a perturbation observer is designed to estimate the perturbation which is used to compensate the real perturbation and realise an adaptive linearising of the original nonlinear system, without requiring the accurate system model and parameters and full state measurements, and still considering all system nonlinearities and unknown time-varying dynamics, such as tower <b>shadow,</b> <b>grid</b> faults and intermittent wind power inputs. In this thesis, the proposed control schemes are applied for control of PMSGWT in Region 2, Region 3 and integration with the grid. A NAC is developed for a PMSG-WT to extract maximum wind power in Region 2. Simulation and experiment studies are carried out to verify the design and results show that the proposed NAC can provide better performance in MPPT and robustness against parameter uncertainties and time-varying wind power inputs, in comparison with a convention VC and FLC. NACs are designed for control of the pitch angle and generator control of a PMSG-WT to limit the extracted power from time varying wind in Region 3. Simulation results of the proposed NACs are compared to a conventional VC and FLC. The fault ride-through capability (FRTC) of the PMSG-WT at different voltage dip’s levels has been enhanced by a novel NAC applied at the grid-side converter. Simulation results have shown that the proposed NAC can provide satisfactory performances with smaller inrush current and voltage overshoots during grid fault and better robustness against uncertainties. A coordinated nonlinear adaptive control (CNAC) of the machine-side and grid-side converter in the PMSG-WT were studied. The NACs are designed based on state and perturbation observers for control of subsystems. Simulation results show that the CNAC can coordinate each other to achieve the objectives of different operating regions and enhance the FRTC of the PMSG-WT. Finally, the proposed control schemes are applied for control of PMSM. NAC is developed for PMSM to track mechanical rotation speed and provide high robustness against system parameter uncertainties and unknown time-varying load disturbances. Simulation results show that the proposed NAC provides better performance and robustness against system parameter uncertainties and unknown time-varying load disturbances, in comparison with a nonlinear controller with an extended nonlinear observer and a conventional VC...|$|E
40|$|Owing to the {{rotational}} {{sampling of}} turbulence, wind shear and tower <b>shadow</b> effects <b>grid</b> connected variable speed wind turbines {{could lead to}} the power fluctuations which may produce flicker during continuous operation. A model of an megawatt (MW) -level variable speed wind turbine with a doubly fed induction generator is presented to investigate the flicker mitigation. Taking advantage of the large inertia of the wind turbine rotor, a generator torque control (GTC) strategy is proposed, so that the power oscillation is stored as the kinetic energy of the wind turbine rotor, thus the flicker emission could be reduced. The GTC scheme is proposed and designed according to the generator rotational speed. The simulations are performed on the national renewable energy laboratory 1. 5 MW upwind reference wind turbine model. Simulation results show that damping the generator active power by GTC is an effective means for flicker mitigation of variable speed wind turbines during continuous operation. keywords: asynchronous generators;oscillations;power generation control;torque control;wind power plants;wind turbines;GTC strategy;continuous operation;doubly fed induction generator;flicker emission;flicker mitigation strategy;generator active power;generator torque control;kinetic energy;megawatt-level variable speed wind turbine;power oscillation;tower <b>shadow</b> effects <b>grid</b> connected variable speed wind turbines;turbulence;upwind reference wind turbine model;variable speed wind turbines;wind shear;wind turbine roto...|$|R

We compare our {{algorithm}} (LogPSM) to Kozlov’s improved perspective shadow map (PSM) algorithm. Both algorithms use a cube map {{with a total}} resolution of 1024 × 1024. The images have a resolution of 512 × 512. (Left) Compared to a standard cube map, the PSM cube map greatly reduces aliasing artifacts near the viewer, but some aliasing is still visible. The shadows are severely stretched on the back wall. LogPSMs provide higher quality both near the viewer and in the distance. The <b>shadow</b> map <b>grid</b> has been superimposed to aid visualization (grid lines every 20 texels). (Right) An error visualization for both algorithms. We use an error metric m that is essentially the maximum extent of a shadow map texel projected into the image. Green represents no aliasing (m = 1) and dark red (m> 10) represents high aliasing. LogPSMs provide significantly lower maximum error and the error is more evenly distributed. We present a novel shadow map parameterization to reduce perspective aliasing artifacts for both point and directional light sources. We derive the aliasing error equations for both types of light sources in general position. Using these equations we compute tight bounds on the aliasing error. From these bounds we derive our shadow map parameterization, which is a simple combination of a perspective projection with a logarithmic transformation. We then extend existing algorithms to formulate three types of logarithmic perspective shadow maps (LogPSMs) and analyze the error for each type. Compared with competing algorithms, LogPSMs can produce significantly less aliasing error. Equivalently, for the same error as competing algorithms, LogPSMs can produce significant savings in storage and bandwidth. We demonstrate the benefit of LogPSMs for several models of varying complexity. ...|$|R

While the existing edge tab method for interconnecting and stringing edge-connected back contact cells is acceptably straightforward and reliable, there are further gains to be exploited when you have both contact polarities {{on one side of}} the cell. In this work, we produce 'busbarless' emitter wrap-through solar cells that use 41 % of the gridline silver (Ag) metallization mass compared to the edge tab design. Further, series resistance power losses are reduced by extraction of current from more places on the cell rear, leading to a fill factor improvement of about 6 % (relative) on the module level. Series resistance and current-generation losses associated with large rear bondpads and busbars are eliminated. Use of thin silicon (Si) wafers is enabled because of the reduced Ag metallization mass and by interconnection with conductive adhesives leading to reduced bow.

A quantification of all power loss mechanisms of such industrial PERC cells is helpful in prioritizing future efficiency improvement measures. We report on a numerical simulation of the power losses of a 21. 2 %-efficient industrial PERC cell using extensive experimental input data. Our synergetic efficiency gain analysis relies on deactivating single power loss mechanisms in the simulation at a time to access the full potential power gain related to that mechanism. The complete analysis therefore explains the efficiency gap between the industrial PERC solar cell and the theoretical maximum efficiency of a crystalline Si solar cell. Based on the simulations, the largest single loss mechanism is front <b>grid</b> <b>shadowing</b> followed by recombination in the emitter and its surface. All individual resistive losses, all individual optical losses and all (avoidable) individual recombination losses sum up to efficiency gains of 0. 8 %, 1. 6 %, and 1. 3 %, respectively, which is 3. 7 % in total. The efficiency gap between real and ideal solar cell is, however, much larger with 7. 3 %. The discrepancy is mainly due to the non-linear behaviour of recombination-based power losses which adds synergetic efficiency enhancements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Raytracing dynamic scenes at {{interactive}} {{rates have}} {{received a lot of}} attention recently. We present a few strategies for high performance raytracing on a commodity GPU. The construction of grids needs sorting, which is fast on today’s GPUs. The grid is thus the acceleration structure of choice for dynamic scenes as per-frame rebuilding is required. We advocate the use of appropriate data structures for each stage of raytracing, resulting in multiple structure building per frame. A perspective grid built for the camera achieves perfect coherence for primary rays. A perspective grid built with respect to each light source provides the best performance for <b>shadow</b> rays. Spherical <b>grids</b> handle lights positioned inside the model space and handle spotlights. Uniform grids are best for reflection and refraction rays with little coherence. We propose an Enforced Coherence method to bring coherence to them by rearranging the ray to voxel mapping using sorting. This gives the best performance on GPUs with only user-managed caches. We also propose a simple, Independent Voxel Walk method, which performs best by taking advantage of the L 1 and L 2 caches on recent GPUs. We achieve over 10 fps of total rendering on the Conference model with one light source and one reflection bounce, while rebuilding the data structure for each stage.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{results of}} our most recently thermally diffused InP solar cells using the p(+) n (Cd,S) structures are presented. We have succeeded in fabricating cells with measured AMO, 25 C V(sub oc) exceeding 880 mV (bare cells) which {{to the best of}} our knowledge is higher than previously reported V(sub oc) values for any InP homojunction solar cells. The cells were fabricated by thinning the emitter, after Au-Zn front contacting, from its initial thickness of about 4. 5 microns to about 0. 6 microns. After thinning, the exposed surface of the emitter was passivated by a thin (approximately 50 A) P-rich oxide. Based on the measured EQY and J(sub sc) -V(sub oc) characteristics of our experimental high V(sub oc) p(+) n InP solar cells, we project that reducing the emitter thickness to 0. 3 microns, using an optimized AR coating, maintaining the surface hole concentration of 3 x 10 (exp 18) cm(sup - 3), reducing the <b>grid</b> <b>shadowing</b> from actual 10. 55 percent to 6 percent and reducing the contact resistance will increase the actual measured 12. 57 percent AMO 25 C efficiency to about 20. 1 percent. By using our state-of-the-art p(+) n structures which have a surface hole concentration of 4 x 10 (exp 18) cm(sup - 3) and slightly improving the front surface passivation, an even higher practically achievable AMO, 25 C efficiency of 21. 3 percent is projected...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary results {{indicate}} that Cd-doped substrates are better candidates for achieving high efficiency solar cells fabricated by closed-ampoule sulfur (S) diffusion than Zn-doped substrates. The differences in performance parameters (i. e., 14. 3 percent efficiency for Cd-doped vs. 11. 83 percent {{in the case of}} Zn-doped substrates of comparable doping and etch pit densities) were explained in terms of a large increase in dislocation density as a result of S diffusion in the case of Zn-doped as compared to Cd-doped substrates. The In(x) S(y) and probably Zn(S) precipitates in the case of Zn-doped substrates, produce a dead layer which extends deep below the surface and strongly affects the performance parameters. It {{should be noted that the}} cells had an unoptimized single layer antireflective coating of SiO, a <b>grid</b> <b>shadowing</b> of 6. 25 percent, and somewhat poor contacts, all contributing to a reduction in efficiency. It is believed that by reducing the external losses and further improvement in cell design, efficiencies approaching 17 percent at 1 AMO, 25 degrees should be possible for cells fabricated on these relatively high defect density Cd-doped substrates. Even higher efficiencies, 18 to 19 percent should be possible by using long-lifetime substrates and further improving front surface passivation. If solar cells fabricated on Cd-doped substrates turn out to have comparable radiation tolerance as those reported in the case of cells fabricated on Zn-doped substrates, then for certain space missions 18 to 19 percent efficient cells made by this method of fabrication would be viable...|$|R
40|$|The type of {{coplanar}} back contact {{solar cell}} described was constructed with interdigitated n(+) and p(+) type regions {{on the back}} of the cell, such that both contacts are made on the back with no metallization grid on the front. This cell construction has several potential advantages over conventional cells for space use namely, convenience of interconnects, lower operating temperatures and higher efficiency due to the elimination of <b>grid</b> <b>shadowing.</b> However, the processing is more complex, and the cell is inherently more radiation sensitive. The latter problem can be reduced substantially by making the cells very thin (approximately 50 micrometers). Two types of interdigitated back contact cells are possible, the types being dependent on the character of the front surface. The front surface field cell has a front surface region that is of the same conductivity type as the bulk but is more heavily doped. This creates an electric field at the surface which repels the minority carriers. The tandem junction cell has a front surface region of a conductivity type that is opposite to that of the bulk. The junction thus created floats to open circuit voltage on illumination and injects carriers into the bulk which then can be collected at the rear junction. For space use, the front surface field cell is potentially more radiation resistant than the tandem junction cell because the flow of minority carriers (electrons) into the bulk will be less sensitive to the production of recombination centers, particularly in the space charge region at the front surface...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an electron gun for a sheet beam klystron. Initially intended for accelerator applications, the gun can operate at a higher perveance than one with a cylindrically symmetric beam. Results of 2 D and 3 D simulations are discussed. Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. (CCR) is developing rectangular, gridded, thermionic, dispenser-cathode guns for sheet beam devices. The first application is expected to be klystrons for advanced particle accelerators and colliders. [1] The current generation of accelerators typically use klystrons with a cylindrical beam generated by a Pierce-type electron gun. As RF power is pushed to higher levels, space charge forces in the electron beam limit the amount of current that can be transmitted at a given voltage. The options are to increase the beam voltage, leading to problems with X-Ray shielding and modulator and power supply design, or to develop new techniques for lowering the space charge forces in the electron beam. In this device, the beam has a rectangular cross section. The thickness is constrained as in a normal, cylindrically symmetric klystron with a Pierce gun; however, the width of the beam is many times the thickness. The resulting cross sectional area is much larger than in the conventional device. This allows much higher current and/or a lower voltage before space charge forces become too high. The current program addresses issues related to beam formation at the emitter surface and implementation of <b>shadow</b> and control <b>grids</b> in a rectangular geometry.

My paintings are made through a layered process that constructs and mediates my approach to a subject. I think through and about the levels and methods of mediation between the world of experience and the act of painting, examining the complex and interconnected realities of things and making images of things. I begin with the rooms or houses that I remember most vividly from my life. I build maquettes of these spaces, combining them with photographs, projected images, maps, <b>grids,</b> <b>shadows,</b> reflections, and views of my studio space and exterior landscapes. In my paintings, walls unfold or merge into other spaces, doors and windows open into other realities, rooms are half buried, light and images are projected onto walls, and objects appear or disappear with varying degrees of resolution. I foreground the tape, gaps, and crookedness of the maquettes in my paintings as a means of reflecting on the ways that memories are inherently malleable and always incomplete. Memories are warped by the stories we construct to fit our evolving identities. These stories, in the telling, are like architecture. We move through them, they fall apart and are repaired, and they give shape to our experience. Memories, like the mind and like time, are unimaginable without their physical manifestations. The foundation of my practice is the concept of “pictures residing in pictures,” which sets individual levels of visual experience at a remove. Each painting presents a record of my effort to make these variously represented realities cohere into a convincing and engaging entity. In my paintings, the image and the materiality of paint dovetail and mutually transform each other: raw canvas gradually becomes recognizable image, paint thins into atmosphere, becomes more suggestive of things, builds up, and congeals into a tangible mass before gradually “dissolving” back into the canvas surface. The act of painting itself possesses narrative possibilities that give physical form to memory and perception...|$|R

The project is treated as an educational experience, and is based on Socrates’ thoughts about learning. He contended that those who felt they posessed great knowledge, were in fact ignorant because they limited their capabilities. He also felt that those who could admit to ignorance were considered to be knowledgeable because they had the universe open before them. The ignorant man who places himself {{at the center of the}} universe will be forever bound and gagged by his own intrepid ego. These notions become organizers for the design: A sequence through two points with a barrier in between. Kato stands at the point of ignorance. He posesses all literary knowledge. He feels himself moving from the world of reality to a world of contempolation. Under a leafy canopy, the <b>gridded</b> <b>shadows</b> provide a constant constant, but the effects of weaving about the sterile trunks remove him from his sense of intrinsic value. Kato is surprised when the forest suddenly opens up to a green, grassy flat. He is in search of his place at the center of the universe. His eyes are riveted in focus on the Temple of Man. He approaches it casually, it seemed farther away than it was. Kato enters the Temple. He is inside of the flaming wall. He knows he is at the center. Kato can see his own ego acting as a barrier which is preventing him from extended life. He can see the struggle ahead, a stairway embedded in an earthen, inclined plane. He decides to press on. For some reason, the stairs are getting harder and harder to climb with every step. Kato is below the landscape, removed from the Sun. In darkness, feeling his way up a set of stairs based on a progression of the perfect Golden Section, he sees a light coming down from above. The stairs are nearly impossible to scale upwards. They are impossible to traverse downwards. The light illuminates the edge of each stair. Finally, at the top, he realizes he is trapped. He is tired, sweating, and humbled. Kato has entered the point of knowledge. He is greeted by a man in a white tux who pours him a glass of red, sweet vermouth. Outside, Kato finds himself on a large, grassy cliff. He looks back over his path. He turns and enjoys a view to The City, and over The River to The Mountain. He enjoys a liesurely stroll along the edge of the cliff with the treetops at his feet. Kato, thinking to himself, realizes that the universe is now before him. He remembers the Temple, and recollects the symbol of Total Knowledge meshed within the trees across The River on the mountainside. He leaves the world of the possible and enters the world of the plausible. He sees the treetops at his feet as an extension of the ground plane. Kato moves above the trees in quest of the utopian symbol. Images roar through his head. He remembers the flaming wall. He remembers the center. He remembers the sweat and the humility. He turns to go back to knowledge. It is too late. He is back in the world of the possible. Suddenly… the treetops… Kato falls. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|R
40|$|O {{principal}} objetivo da indústria de células solares é obter alta eficiência e baixo custo de produção. Uma das linhas de atuação é o aumento da eficiência de células solares industriais. O objetivo desta dissertação é desenvolver células solares n+pn+ em lâminas de Si-Cz do tipo p, grau solar, com metalização por serigrafia e avaliar a influência do emissor n+ e das pastas de prata PV 159 e PV 16 A. Parâmetros como tempo, temperatura da difusão de fósforo, recozimento, processo de queima das pastas metálicas e espessura do filme antirreflexo foram otimizados experimentalmente. Também foi avaliada a influência do fator de sombra relativo à malha metálica, da concentração de POCl 3 durante a difusão de fósforo. Para a metalização com a pasta PV 159, concluiu-se que a temperatura de difusão (TD) de 875 °C e resistência de folha (R□) de 59 Ω/□ resultam na melhor eficiência de 13, 7 %. Com o aumento da TD para 900 °C verificou-se que todos os parâmetros elétricos tendem a diminuir com o aumento da R□, e a melhor eficiência obtida foi de 13, 4 %. Verificou-se que o recozimento após a difusão de fósforo praticamente não afeta a eficiência das células solares, porém, aumenta levemente a profundidade da junção. A velocidade de esteira e a temperatura de queima para a pasta PV 159 que resultaram em maior eficiência e maior fator de forma (FF) foram, 240 cm/min e 840 °C, respectivamente. Comprovou-se que a diminuição do fator de sombra de 9, 4 % para 8, 2 %, aumentou a JSC sem reduzir o FF. Com a pasta PV 16 A, a TD de 875 °C resultou na eficiência de 13, 7 %, devido ao elevado FF. No entanto, com a redução da TD para 850 °C, o FF sofre redução, devido ao aumento da R□. Com a introdução da etapa de recozimento, a JSC diminuiu, porém o FF aumentou, elevando a eficiência de 10, 8 % para 13, 2 %. A concentração de POCl 3 de 0, 1 % sem redução da vazão de O 2 e N 2 resultou na melhor eficiência para células com a pasta PV 16 A, de 13, 9 %. Juntamente com o aumento do FF, a R□ diminuiu, limitando a JSC. A redução do fluxo dos gases levou a valores menores de JSC, devido ao aumento da espessura da “zona morta”. Para ambas as pastas, o FF reduziu-se com o aumento da R□. The {{main goal}} of the solar cell industry is to obtain high efficiency and low production cost. One line of action {{is to increase the}} efficiency of industrial solar cell. The goal of this dissertation is to develop n+pn+ solar cells in p-type Si-Cz wafer, solar grade, with metallization by screen printing and to evaluate the influence of the n+ emitter and PV 159 and PV 16 A silver pastes on cell efficiency. Parameters such as time, temperature of phosphorus diffusion, annealing, metal paste firing and antireflection coating thickness were optimized experimentally. We also evaluated the influence of the <b>shadow</b> factor metal <b>grid,</b> and the POCl 3 concentration during P diffusion. For the metallization with the PV 159 paste, it was concluded that the diffusion temperature (TD) of 875 °C and sheet resistance (R□) de 59 Ω/□ results in better efficiency of 13. 7 %. With the increase in TD to 900 °C it was found that all electrical parameters tend to decrease with increasing of R□ and the better efficiency obtained was 13. 4 %. It was verified that the annealing after the phosphorus diffusion hardly affects the efficiency of solar cells, however, slightly increases the junction depth. The belt speed and the temperature of the PV 159 paste firing process resulting in higher efficiency and fill factor (FF) were 240 cm/min and 840 °C, respectively. It was shown that the reduction of the shadow factor from 9. 4 % to 8. 2 %, increased the JSC without decreasing the FF. With the PV 16 A paste, the TD of 875 °C results in efficiency of 13. 7 %, due to the elevated FF. However, with the reduction of TD to 850 °C, the FF is reduced due to the increase of R□. With the introduction of annealing step, the JSC decreased, but the FF increased, raising the efficiency from 10. 8 % to 13. 2 %. The use of POCl 3 concentration of 0. 1 % without reducing O 2 and N 2 flows resulted in better efficiency for cells with PV 16 A paste, achieving 13. 9 %. Jointly with the increase of FF, the R□ decreased, limiting the JSC. The reduction of the gas flows led to lower values of JSC, due to the increase of "dead zone" thickness. For both pastes, the FF decreased with the increase of R□...|$|R
