50|$|Triangular, Diamond or Box Shaped Bladders: This {{design of}} bladder owes its {{heritage}} {{to the early}} use of MSR hydration bags converted for diving buoyancy. The concept maximizes buoyancy provision over the hip area, {{with little or no}} buoyancy held on the upper back. The bladder is normally attached at the top to the <b>shoulder</b> <b>plate</b> or spine webbing; and at the base to the waist-belt webbing. They are often 'wrap-around' in design and some use lengths of bungee for connection around the divers stomach area and through the crotch. Notable examples are the Razor 2.0, XDeep Stealth and UTD Z-Trim.|$|E
50|$|The AUG is hammer-fired and {{the firing}} {{mechanism}} {{is contained in}} the rear of the stock, near the butt, covered by a synthetic rubber <b>shoulder</b> <b>plate.</b> The hammer group is made entirely of plastics except for the springs and pins and is contained in an open-topped plastic box which lies between the magazine and the buttplate. During firing the recoiling bolt group travels over the top of it, resetting the hammer. Since the trigger is located some distance away, it transmits its energy through a sear lever which passes by the side of the magazine. The firing pin is operated by a plastic hammer under pressure from a coil spring.|$|E

5000|$|M.C. Bishop lists likely {{components}} as one <b>shoulder</b> <b>plate,</b> about 35 metal (ferrous or copper alloy) strips, 90-120 leathering rivets, 3 or 4 internal leathers, and one padded lining. The lining {{may have}} been a separate component, in order to avoid it being torn by the articulated metal plates. The metal strips were about 25 to 30 mm wide and 0.35 to 0.5 mm in thickness; they were longer {{at the top of the}} arm. Each strip had holes at its lower edge, through which flat-headed copper alloy rivets passed from the inside to hold the leather straps in place. It also had a hole punched at each end, which did not have a rivet and presumably served as an attachment point for an organic fastening. The lower few plates were in some cases riveted together, rather than articulated on leather. One depiction appears to show a manica terminating in a hand shape.|$|E
5000|$|A variant {{known as}} the FN Mle 1930 was {{developed}} in 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser by FN Herstal and adopted by the Belgian Army. The Mle 1930 is basically a licensed copy of the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle, Model 1925 (R 75). The Mle 1930 had a different gas valve and a mechanical rate-reducing fire control mechanism designed by Dieudonne Saive, housed in the trigger guard/pistol grip housing. Some of these FN rate reducer mechanisms and pistol grip housings were later purchased by Springfield Armory for evaluation and possible adoption on a replacement for the M1918. The weapon also had a hinged <b>shoulder</b> <b>plate</b> and was adapted for use on a tripod mount. In 1932, Belgium adopted {{a new version of}} the FN Mle 1930 allocated the service designation FN Mle D (D—Demontable or [...] "removable") which had a quick-change barrel, shoulder rest and a simplified take-down method for eased cleaning and maintenance. The Mle D was produced even after World War II in versions adapted for [...]30-06 Springfield and NATO-standard 7.62×51mm ammunition.|$|E
40|$|Like most gobies, Pomatoschistus lozanoi is a benthic fish species. During {{locomotion}} the {{pectoral fin}} adduction {{is of great}} importance in generating a forward propulsion. Several specimens of Pomatoschistus lozanoi were dissected, cleared with staining and sectioned with staining, {{in order to examine}} the morphology of the pectoral girdle-apparatus. In this paper a detailed description is given of the skeletal elements, the musculature and the ligaments of the pectoral girdle-apparatus. The pectoral fins of gobies seem better adapted to powerful adduction than a generalised teleost. The proximal radials form a large rigid <b>shoulder</b> <b>plate</b> with a long distal margin on which a high pectoral fin articulates. The fin muscles are strongly developed and assure, together with the large pectoral fin, powerful- drag based- pectoral propulsion. The morphological adaptations for powerful adduction, however, are at cost of the maneuvering abilities of the pectoral fins...|$|E

25|$|Among stegosaurids, only Kentrosaurus {{has been}} found with parascapular spines, which project posteriorly out of {{the lower part of}} the <b>shoulder</b> <b>plates.</b> These spines are long, rounded and comma-shaped in lateral view and have an {{enlarged}} base. Loricatosaurus was also believed to have a parascapular spine, but Maidment et al. (2008) observed that the discovered specimen, from which the spine is described, has a completely different morphology than the parascapular spine specimens of other stegosaurs. They suggest it may be a fragmentary tail spine instead. The genuine absence of parascapular spines in other stegosaurids is considered a secondary loss since many basal stegosaurs like Gigantospinosaurus and Huayangosaurus have been discovered with them.|$|R

An experiment was conducted using a novel method of plate exposure. Continuous-tone masks were placed in contact with the plate back and the halftone negative used on the plate face. The resulting shoulder angles were measured and analyzed for significant fit to a linear mathematical model. For many dot sizes the face exposure level was significant in determining <b>shoulder</b> angle.

40|$|The {{growth of}} lean from nine {{wholesale}} cuts {{in relation to}} the total lean weight in carcass side were evaluated with three allometric equations for 18 Najdi male camels slaughtered at 8, 16 and 26 months of age. The allometric growth coefficients indicated that as camels grew, weights of lean from brisket and flank cuts increased relatively more rapidly than the total lean in carcass side (β > 1. 1) and that weights of lean from wholesale shoulder and rump cuts increased relatively less rapidly (β > 0. 9) than the total lean weight from carcass side. The growth coefficients for the lean in the thoracic limb and pelvic limb showed a dorsoventral rise in the growth impetus, with coefficients for the thoracic limb correspondingly higher than those of pelvic limb. The growth coefficients for the lean from shoulder, rib, flank and leg cuts increased (P< 0. 01) with increased weight of total lean in carcass side, whereas it decreased with increased total lean weight in carcass side for the lean in neck, brisket, plate, loin and rump cuts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{the use of}} angular stable {{implants}} for proximal humeral fractures a lot {{of problems}} remain unsolved such as cutting out of screws, secondary displacement of the greater tubercle and the aim to minimize operative morbidity. This study analyses whether a plate using the DHS principle (H-DHS plate) may overcome these shortcomings. METHODS: In Phase A 8 intact enbalmed human cadaver <b>shoulders</b> received <b>plate</b> fixation in a minimally invasive technique. Humeri were then dissected by an independent examiner and the course of the axillary and radial nerve in relation to the implant were displayed. In Phase B a Neer IV/ 3 fracture was created with a 5 mm osteotomy gap simulating metaphyseal comminution. Limbs were randomly assigned to receive H-DHS plate fixation and on the contralateral limb Philos plate fixation before biomechanical evaluation (MTS-Bionix 858. 2). FINDINGS: Submuscular positioning of the plate did not cause any damage to the axillary nerve, joint capsule or rotator cuff. With a mean stiffness of 300. 9 +/- 28. 8 N/mm the H-DHS plate proved to be significantly stiffer than the Philos plate (184. 2 +/- 23. 4 N/mm; p= 0. 006). The H-DHS plate also resisted higher loads in terms of fixation failure with loss of reduction at 290 +/- 58. 6 N in comparison to 205 +/- 8. 6 N for the Philos plate (p= 0. 2). Displacement of the greater tubercle occured in no case of the H-DHS group and in two out of four cases in the Philos group. INTERPRETATION: The H-DHS plate can be savely inserted in a minimally invasive technique and provides a high fixation stability in an in vitro humeral head fracture model...|$|R

This modified flying model became a popular interpretation.

6000|$|Another {{plan is to}} {{maintain}} that if the poet does not in any case mention a corslet, there was no corslet. Thus in V. 99, an arrow strikes Diomede [...] "hard by the right <b>shoulder,</b> the <b>plate</b> of the corslet." [...] Thirteen lines later (V. 112, 113) [...] "Sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through out of Diomede's shoulder, and the blood darted up through the pliant chiton." [...] We {{do not know what}} the word here translated [...] "pliant" [...] [Greek: streptos] means, and Aristarchus seems to have thought it was [...] "a coat of mail, chain, or scale armour." [...] If so, here is the corslet, but in this case, if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or rings of bronze be meant, gualon cannot mean a large [...] "plate," [...] as it does. Mr. Ridgeway says, [...] "It seems certain that [Greek: streptos chitoon] means, as Aristarchus held, a shirt of mail." [...] [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, vol. i. p, 306.] Mr. Leaf says just the reverse. As usual, we come to a deadlock; a clash of learned opinion. But any one can see that, in the space of thirteen lines, no poet or interpolator who wrote V. i 12, i 13 could forget that Diomede was said to be wearing a corslet in V. 99; and even if the poet could forget, which is out of the question, the editor of 540 B.C. was simply defrauding his employer, Piaistratus, if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the poet. When this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a corslet, it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it, though, as we have seen, a man is occasionally smitten, in the midriff, say, without any remark on the flimsy piece of mail.|$|R
