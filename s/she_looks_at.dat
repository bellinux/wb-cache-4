5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

"Just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this, Mrs. Maze," [...] said Gaites {{when she}} drew {{near enough to}} read the address on the piano-case. <b>She</b> did <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it; then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Gaites's face, into which he had thrown a sort of stony calm; and then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> back <b>at</b> the piano-case.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses.

Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him.

25|$|One {{example of}} this is the role gender plays in the {{production}} of cash crops versus subsistence crops. Here, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the effects of colonial influence on the practices of the Jola, and how traditional cultivation differs from modern cultivation of crops purely for export.|$|E

500|$|Naughty Dog {{designed}} Elena as a sidekick and {{a romantic}} interest to Drake, and her personality to complement his. However, she proves just as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness. Her voice actor commented, [...] "In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's {{a lot more}} naive, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> things as being very possible, {{and in the second}} (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, you see that in her. She's a little bit more hesitant, a little more cynical". Commentators have mentioned how unusually strong and resilient Fisher is for a female character, and GamesRadar UK called her one of the strongest heroines in video gaming.|$|E
500|$|Red-Headed Woman {{begins with}} Harlow seducing her boss Bill LeGendre and {{intentionally}} breaking up his marriage.

Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots LeGendre, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur.

500|$|Female emus {{court the}} males; the female's plumage darkens {{slightly}} {{and the small}} patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. [...] When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than [...] away. [...] Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate {{at a distance of}} [...] As she does this, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him by turning her neck, {{while at the same time}} keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Ella Brown is {{the only child of}} a poor widower. Their home is {{in a small town in}} the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to start there. He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing for her to do except submit. Sitting in her room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Second Self, Turkle {{defines the}} {{computer}} {{as more than}} just a tool, but part of our everyday personal and psychological lives. [...] <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> how the computer affects the way we look at ourselves and our relationships with others, claiming that technology defines the way we think and act. [...] Turkle's book allows us to view and reevaluate our own relationships with technology.|$|E
2500|$|In Cat's Eye, {{the narrator}} recognizes the {{similarity}} between a turkey and a baby. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> [...] "the turkey, which resembles a trussed, headless baby. It has thrown off its disguise as a meal and has revealed itself to me for what it is, a large dead bird." [...] In Atwood's Surfacing, a dead heron represents purposeless killing and prompts thoughts about other senseless deaths.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1980s until present, Linares began {{extensive}} {{research in the}} Casamance region of Southern Senegal, the region located below the Gambia.

Lastly <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the delicately shaped Noie by her side, with her sweet, inscrutable face, the woman whose parents and kin this outcast had brought to a bloody death, the woman whom to forward his base ends he had vilely striven to murder.

2500|$|In The Phantom Menace, Portman had {{to portray}} a {{character}} younger than herself. In Attack of the Clones, however, her character had aged 10 years. Portman had aged {{only five years}} between the two films. She remarks, [...] " [...] {{wants to make sure}} I seem older than Anakin in Attack of the Clones, so it's believable that I can be bossing him around, and he's a little intimidated. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him as a little boy – at least {{for the first half of}} the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of her {{greatest}} successes {{were in the}} French repertoire.

[...] Her Marguerite in Gounod's Faust in Paris and London drew warm notices: [...] "The jewel song has the girlish delight that Gounod wanted (but does not always get) delivered in the easy coloratura Miss Masterson first displayed in The Pirates of Penzance." [...] She sang Juliet, in Romeo and Juliet, in London and internationally, Leila in The Pearl Fishers, and the title role in Louise.|$|E
2500|$|It {{begins in}} the year 2005 when Sae is {{traveling}} to her birthplace of Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia in Canada. On the bus, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a photo, and the scene immediately goes back to 1996. Sae and Kouhei met on a train ride to their respective college entrance examinations. The train hit a deer, causing Sae to worry about being late for the examinations. They went to a nearby house to ask if the owners could give them a lift. Sae spotted a key in the truck parked at the porch. She asked Kouhei if he would [...] "borrow" [...] the truck {{to take her to}} the exam center. However, when Kouhei tried to overtake a slow cow truck, he narrowly avoided an incoming crane, and went off the road into a ditch. They were brought to a police station and Sae was disqualified from her examinations.|$|E
