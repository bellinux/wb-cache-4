Both iridium 192 and thulium 170 sources {{have been used to}} measure gradients. Traverses of both a horizontal and a vertical pipe, in which a tungsten-water suspension was flowing, have been made.

40|$|A {{square steel}} pipe is {{reshaped}} from a welded round pipe by roll forming. The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a roll-forming machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and bottom rolls is usually set larger than that of the side roll pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors. When the diameter of the top roll is larger than that of the side roll, the width of a corner part of the formed pipe is larger than the height. A <b>square</b> <b>pipe</b> was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases. Therefore, elliptical preforming is effective in forming <b>square</b> <b>pipe</b> with a sharp corner. However, excessive preforming causes a hollow at the flat surface of a square product.

A Row Indented tube. In case (1), the local coefficients of heat transfer were calculated and the results correlated by empirical equations based on the dimensional analysis.

After a dimensional analysis of results (for the average coefficient of heat transfer) in the case of promoters, those results were correlated with those in previous research on air flowing inside pipes having different diameters and promoters of different pitches. In the case of the <b>square</b> <b>pipe,</b> the average coefficients and the coefficients of the tube of infinite length were correlated by the methods of both Dettus & Boeltcr, and Sieder & Tate, by the use of the hydraulic diameter in the dimensionless groups.

A pulsedlaser beam produces an acoustic pulse, whose propagation is registered by its deflection effects on two cw probebeams. The acoustic pulse in a flowing fluid is produced by absorption of a laser pulse (30 ns, 1. 1 mJ) focused overa path flow line. The acoustic propagations, along and against the flow, are monitored by two cw probe beams. Inthe interaction, the probe beam undergoes a transient deflection that is detected by a fast response photodiode.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{implement}} a simple strategy, based on Jin and Braza's method, {{to deal with}} nonreflecting outlet boundary conditions for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The outflow boundary conditions are implemented using an outflow zone downstream of the outlet, where particles are moved using an outgoing wave equation for the velocity field so that feedback noise from the outlet boundary is greatly reduced. For unidirectional flow across the outlet, this condition reduces to Orlanski's wave equation. The performance of the method is demonstrated through several two-dimensional test problems, including unsteady, plane Poiseuille flow, flow between two inclined plates, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a channel, and flow in a constricted conduit, and in three-dimensions for turbulent flow in a 90 ^∘ section of a curved <b>square</b> <b>pipe.</b> The results show that spurious waves incident from the outlet are effectively absorbed and that steady-state laminar flows can be maintained for much longer times compared to periodic boundary conditions.

Dimensions are intended to fluctuate at a minimum to greatly reduceorcompletely remove the need for correcting actions during assembly. Approach To create a viable and functional product proposal, a thorough investigation of legalrequirements and previously published material regarding chassis development was conducted. This information was then translated and integrated with the customer requirements provided during the initial consultation at the company. A draft of the intended product was designed through different CAD-software based on thisinformation, which then in turn was further developed by multiple feedback sessions with the project owner. Findings The resulting product features a concept primary designed through sheet-metalbased solutions, but also includes a lesser amount of complementary solutionsbased on pre-fabricated <b>square</b> <b>pipes</b> and a ready-made clamp system which was integrated into the structure, for economic benefit. Limitations The information acquired from the investigation of legal requirements have been regarded to as a foundation to improve the product quality, with respect to e. g. user’s functional- and perceived safety, and to pioneer for future certification. However, due to the business concept and the available timeframe, an internationalcertification for making the vehicle eligible for the common commercial marketwas omitted. Furthermore, the FEM verification of the final product was postponed to future work resulting from inadequate software licensing levels, which disabled full access to the required functions.
