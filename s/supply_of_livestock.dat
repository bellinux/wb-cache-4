50|$|Crop {{cultivation}} has slowly {{become less}} {{important in the}} gross output of the agricultural sector. Cropping and livestock were almost equal branches in 1960, but by 1985 crops accounted for only 43% of gross agricultural output compared with 57% for livestock products. Main crop products in the 1980s were wheat, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, rye, and hops (an important export crop). Sugar, derived from sugar beet production, is both a significant export crop (especially to hard currency areas) and an important item of domestic consumption. Fruit and vegetables accounted for {{only a small part}} of the cultivated area. Since the 1950s, the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> has gradually increased because of government encouragement. Producers have been urged to meet the demand for meat that accompanied the rise in income levels of the population. After the collectivization of agriculture, raising livestock increasingly became a large-scale operation, usually undertaken in conjunction with cropping. The major constraint to livestock expansion has been a shortage of fodder and feed mixtures, although government pricing policies and the labor demands of animal husbandry have also tended to deter efforts. During the 1970s, progress was made in expanding the supplies of fodder and feed mixtures and the country's processing capacity. However, it remained necessary to supplement the supply of feed and fodder through imports, which became increasingly burdensome because they came from noncommunist countries and thus required payment in convertible currencies.|$|E

The proposed criteria are briefly discussed. Factors which might influence the effect <b>of</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> in an agricultural system on each criterion are also discussed. It is argued that identification of livestock-specific criteria is impossible {{because of the large}} heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> production systems and the non-linear relation between livestock-specific criteria and agroecological criteria.

30|$|Proactive {{responses}} such as selling <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> before drought are strategies {{practiced by}} the majority (79 Â %) of respondents. The prevalence of the practice contradicts the conventional view that pastoralists do not sell their livestock before drought. The household interviews indicate that recent awareness and capacity-building initiatives from various nongovernmental organizations and government agencies led most of the pastoralists to embrace livestock off-take for long-term resilience to drought. Although still very reactive as indicated in the FGDs, the increased local market demand for livestock and livestock products {{is one of the}} main drivers of increased off-take. But households that did not dispose <b>of</b> their <b>livestock</b> before or during a drought gave two reasons for their market inactivity: (1) the low livestock prices offered before and during drought periods; and (2) the high post-drought livestock prices that make restocking expensive for most households.

They cover the land, providing a habitat and a source of food for domestic livestock, thus ensuring a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> products, with contributes to rural agricultural and economic development. Grasses are a natural food for ruminants. Rich in fibre, they provide the bulk necessary for good rumen function.

At this stage they also have high mineral and protein contents that cover a large part of animals â€™ requirements. Grasslands usually produce the majority of the forage ingested by ruminant animals during grazing season. During winter housing grass hay and silage are often major parts of the staple diets. There are many improved grass genotypes in Serbia that share main characteristics: high yield and quality of dry matter within a target group of environments and in particular agricultural context.

40|$|The use of {{positioned}} mineral fertilizer phosphorus (P) starters {{reduces the}} risk of yield penalties in maize production. However, it also increases the soil P surplus and attendant risk of P losses to the environment, in particular on farms with ample <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> manures. We examined whether routine applications of starter P can be refrained from if manure is injected in subsurface bands close to the anticipated position of the maize rows {{as an alternative to the}} conventional even injection at random lateral positions relative to the rows. Fourteen field experiments were executed on sandy soils in The Netherlands. In these experiments comparisons were made of the nitrogen (N) and P-concentrations in shoots and of dry matter (DM), N and P-yields over time, between evenly injected liquid manure (with and without starter P) and band-injected liquid manure. Silage yields of DM, N and P generally responded positively (P < 0. 05) to starter P applied at a rate of 9 â€“ 31 kg per hectare where manure had been applied at rates of circa 120 kg N and circa 20 kg P per hectare, but less so when the manure was band-injected. This positive response to P was not reflected in the concentration of P in shoots. Positioning of manure via band-injection without extra starter P resulted in silage maize dry matter yields that were similar to yields after even injection combined with a P-starter. Band-injection improved the recovery of the N and P (P < 0. 05) supplied by the manure and reduced the soil surpluses of N and P. Planting maize close to bands where liquid manure had been injected, thus increased silage yields and contributed to a better balance between the inputs and outputs of plant nutrients...|$|R
40|$|The paper dwells {{on general}} {{problems}} concerning {{the influence of}} prices on the conditions of development in the livestock and meat market. This influence has been analyzed from the following aspects: 1) the size of production and livestock supplies, 2) the effect of retail prices on demand in the meat market, 3) the shaping of the sum of prices in the meat market at a given <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> 4) the relations existing between the livestock prices and meat prices and the need of taking them into consideration {{in the process of}} regulating the conditions of market equilibrium. The inference which can be drawn from the study may be expressed as follows: albeit the influence of prices on the volume of production and the size of livestock supplies is quite substantial, it does not constitute a decisive factor. Moreover this influence is not exclusively governed by changes in prices but depends also on conditions of development, especially in the fodder sphere and in the directions of livestock production. What concerns the retail meat prices, they can be taken advantage of in the process of shaping the demand on the meat market. The field of maneouvre in that respect is, however, strictly limited because of a relatively small sensibility of demand on price changes and the prevailing character of meat market and its dimensions. In this situation a specific change in prices results in deep and manifold consequences. In the meat processing sphere, there exists a possibility of changing the list of meat products from a given <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock,</b> and thus the possibility of changing the sum of prices of said products, which in turn can help the processes of regulating the partial equilibria as well as the general market" equilibrium. The feasibility of undertaking such changes is, however, conditioned by concrete market situation. Much attention has been given to the mutual relations existing between the level of livestock prices and meat prices. The links between those levels {{must be taken into account}} in order to ensure a proper functioning of price mechanism. The strength of said links depends on the structure of meat market and on the possibility of exerting an influence on the size of supply by means of manipulating with the stocks and synchronizing the meat turnover in foreign trade. The shaping of conditions which weaken the levels of said prices gives greater freedom in separating their respective movements and thus a greater possibility of influencing â€” by means of prices â€” the conditions of market equilibrium.

40|$|Plant species {{diversity}} regulates the productivity {{and stability of}} natural ecosystems, along with their resilience to disturbance. The influence of {{species diversity}} on the productivity of agronomic systems is less clear. Plant genetic diversity is also suspected to influence ecosystem function, although empirical evidence is scarce. Given the large range of genotypes that can be generated per species through artificial selection, genetic diversity is a potentially important leverage of productivity in cultivated systems. Here we assess the effect of species and genetic diversity on the production and sustainable <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> fodder in sown grasslands, comprising single and multispecies assemblages characterized by different levels of genetic diversity, exposed to drought and non-drought conditions. Multispecies assemblages proved more productive than monocultures when subject to drought, regardless {{of the number of}} genotypes per species present. Conversely, the temporal stability of production increased only with the number of genotypes present under both drought and non-drought conditions, and was unaffected by the number of species. We conclude that taxonomic and genetic diversity can play complementary roles when it comes to optimizing livestock fodder production in managed grasslands, and suggest that both levels of diversity should be considered in plant breeding programmes designed to boost the productivity and resilience of managed grasslands in the face of increasing environmental hazards...|$|E

This leads to the meat processing companies having very pronounced peaks and shoulders in the throughput of livestock.
