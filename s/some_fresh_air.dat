However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University said that only some of these products, like High Efficiency Particulate air filters, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of air purifiers like ionizing purifiers gave off ozone which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze.

25|$|The {{first use}} of gas by the British was at the Battle of Loos, 25 September 1915, but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed Red Star, was the agent to be used (140 tons arrayed in 5,100 cylinders), and the attack was {{dependent}} on a favorable wind. However, on this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in no man's land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches. This debacle was compounded when the gas could not be released from all the British canisters because the wrong turning keys were sent with them. Subsequent retaliatory German shelling hit some of those unused full cylinders, releasing more gas among the British troops. Exacerbating the situation were the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to the British. The masks got hot, and the small eye-pieces misted over, reducing visibility. Some of the troops lifted the masks to get <b>some</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air,</b> causing them to be gassed.|$|E

Peter and Olivia go to a bar while waiting, where Olivia tries to kiss Peter but becomes uncomfortable, knowing {{of the influence of}} her parallel universe doppelganger, Fauxlivia (Torv), on Peter. Her emotional reaction triggers her ability to see once again the [...] "shimmer" [...] around Peter that marks him [...] as a native of the parallel universe.

When Olivia and Peter enter the apartment, Olivia (but not Peter) can see a shimmering figure that Alice claims is the ghost of her late husband Derek (Ken Pogue). Walter surmises that the figure is a parallel Derek seen across a crack between the universes. If the crack widens, Walter predicts they would see occurrences of the same singularities that have plagued the parallel universe, and suggests the use of the same amber-like compound they had previously recovered ("The Ghost Network") to limit the damage.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} carried out on a real site of a {{gymnasium}} situated in the centre of France. The building is equipped with two remarkable energy saving devices running together: a ventilated roof and an air-earth heat exchanger. Experimental and theoretical studies were done on these two energy saving systems and a sensitivity factor analysis was performed. First, each component was modelled in order to (1) determine the component's contribution to the energy savings; and (2) indicate {{the relative importance of}} different types of heat transfer which occur in the ventilated roof. Then, several types of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> preheating were studied, varying the heating control temperature of the building. The main results show that the economy of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> preheating can vary with the system used, and indicate the reasons for the lack of efficiency of <b>some</b> systems. Finally, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduction into the gymnasium was optimized. The combined influences of ventilation intermittency and climate on the global theoretical consumptions for the building were studied. It was shown that the optimization of air introduction into the gymnasium has no influence on the energy consumption of the building for a rather cold climate. On the other hand, for a warmer climate, significant energy savings can be obtained. In conclusion, this study points out the general interest of simulation for new building designs. However, it can be also used for existing buildings to give significant information about equipment weaknesses and, of course, about improvements to be made...|$|R

Ultimately, there are multiple ways of thinking and writing about music. However, both of these texts ignite important and much-needed debates {{over the future of}} this decidedly interdisciplinary field.

40|$|In {{conventional}} air-conditioning system, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> {{volume is}} always restricted to save energy, which sacrifices {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) to some extent. However, removing the latent load of air by liquid desiccant rather than by cooling is an alternative way of reducing energy consumption. Therefore, IAQ can be improved by increasing the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> introduced into an air-conditioning system. In this paper, a liquid desiccant based air-conditioning system is studied, with the system performance under various <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratios analyzed using simulation tests. In addition, the proposed system and a conventional system are compared. In the proposed system, {{with the increase in}} <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio, the heating load for solution regeneration rises, the dehumidification efficiency increases and the regeneration efficiency drops. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the liquid desiccant based system decreases sharply when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio exceeds 60 %. The results also show that the proposed system can save power notably. The maximum power saving ratio is 58. 9 % when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio is 20 %; however, the ratio drops when the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ratio increases.
