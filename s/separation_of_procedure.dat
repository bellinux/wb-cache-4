This study of exponential product formulas has lead to the general formulation of quantum analysis. One of the most important applications of the above exponential product formulas was given in quantum Monte Carlo methods...|$|R

Many of these methods rely on quantitative data from inspections, rather than qualitative and subjective data. The focus of this paper is on the development of an inspection-based decision scheme, incorporating analysis on the effect of the cost and quality of NDT tools to assess the condition of infrastructure elements/networks during their lifetime. For the first time the two aspects of an inspection are considered, i. e. detection and sizing. Since each stage of an inspection is carried out for a distinct purpose, different parameters are used to represent each procedure and both have been incorporated into a maintenance management model. The <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>procedures</b> allows the interaction between the two inspection techniques to be studied. The inspection for detection process acts as a screening exercise to determine which defects require further inspection for sizing.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{estimate of}} consumable food and probability of acquiring {{food in a}} blowfly species, Chrysomya putoria, is presented. This alternative procedure combines three distinct models to estimate consumable food {{in the context of}} the exploitative competition experienced by immature individuals in blowfly populations.

40|$|The scalar, electromagnetic, and {{gravitational}} geodesic-synchrotron-radiation (GSR) spectra {{are determined}} {{for the case}} of a test particle moving on a highly relativistic circular orbit about a rotating (Kerr) black hole. It is found that the spectral shape depends only weakly on the value of the angular-momentum parameter (a/M) of the black hole, but the total radiated power drops unexpectedly for a value of at least 0. 95 and vanishes as the value approaches unity. A spin-dependent factor (involving the inner product of the polarization of a radiated quantum with the source) is isolated to explain the dependence of the spectral shape on the spin of the radiated field. Although the scalar wave equation is solved by <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> variables, this <b>procedure</b> is avoided for the vector and tensor cases by postulating a sum-over-states expansion for the Green's function similar to that found to hold in the scalar case.

40|$|AbstractWe study a {{programming}} language LPas consisting of blockstructured programs with a Pascal-like procedure concept which allows procedures as parameters. Due to Clarke (1979) there cannot be any sound and relatively complete Hoare-like system proving partial correctness for the full language LPas.

In this paper we prove a slightly weaker version of this conjecture by presenting a Hoare-like system which is sound and g-complete for all programs in LPas without global variables; g-completeness means completeness modulo a special second-order theory and an appropriate notion of expressiveness. The proof system provides new methods <b>of</b> dealing with <b>procedures</b> which are formalized in the Rule <b>of</b> <b>Separation</b> for <b>procedure</b> calls.
