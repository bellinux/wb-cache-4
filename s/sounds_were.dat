5|$|When {{fin whale}} <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe basic {{difference}} between real and virtual <b>sound</b> environments <b>is</b> that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> originating from another environment or are artificially created, whereas the real <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> the natural existing {{sounds in the}} user's own environment. Augmented Reality Audio combines these aspects in a way where real and virtual <b>sound</b> scenes <b>are</b> mixed so that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> perceived as an extension or a complement to the natural ones...|$|R
5|$|Somewhat unusually among theropods, T.rex had a {{very long}} cochlea. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, {{or at least the}} {{importance}} of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 {{team was}} managed by former player Leon Roberts who had {{temporarily}} lead the team the previous season. The Sounds {{finished third in}} their division with a 68–74regular season record, their first losing season since the inaugural 1978 season. Also that year, the <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> enlisted {{to serve as the}} competition in the Southern League All-Star Game, held in Huntsville. The game was won by Nashville with a score of four runs to two. The team ended their affiliation with Detroit after two seasons of poor attendnace and a lackluster 1986 campaign.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> {{established}} as an expansion {{team of the}} Double-A Southern League (SL) in 1978. They moved to the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. The team won the Southern League Championship in 1979 as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds and again in 1982 as the Double-A club of the New York Yankees. The Sounds won the Pacific Coast League Championship in 2005 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers.|$|E
5|$|According to a Sakura Blog study, Yuri on Ice {{used more}} key animators {{than any other}} anime series during the fall 2016 season: an average of 48.5 key animators per episode, five more than Flip Flappers (which had the second-highest number of key animators). In the early episodes of the series, each {{character}} was handled by a different key animator, meaning that skating style of the characters differed from each other. In the skating scenes, the sound effects were changed to match each venue, according to the building's capacity and crowd size. The skating sounds for each sequence were recorded separately. No stock <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> used for the sequences because each part sounds different, and no footage of professional skaters was used because the music in the programmes normally muffles the sounds. Thus the sounds used were recorded and performed by series choreographer Miyamoto, and each skating sequence is unique to the program.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the team's {{first season}} as a Pirates affiliate, the Sounds {{finished}} last in the American Conference East Division with a 67–76 record. The <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> led by manager Trent Jewett who {{would go on to}} win 320games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Sounds managers. The Sounds experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, putting together an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish left them out of the PCL playoffs where only division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E

5|$|The 1988 <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> in last-place and had {{a losing}} record until making {{numerous}} management changes late in the season. During a two-week period in July and August 1988, the Sounds went through five different managers. The team started the season with Jack Lind, who left due to health problems. His position was filled on an interim basis by pitching coach Wayne Garland until former manager George Scherger, manager of the 1979 Southern League championship Sounds, was brought in. He retired after one game {{and was replaced by}} Jim Hoff, who stayed a few days before taking up a position with the Reds' front office. Finally, former Texas Rangers manager Frank Lucchesi was hired to lead the Sounds {{for the rest of the}} season. Lucchesi managed the team's last 39 games, leading them to a final record of 73–69. They finished second in the Eastern Division, sixteen games behind the Indianapolis Indians who went on to win the league championship.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> {{one game}} shy {{of winning the}} first-half pennant in 1984. Winning the first-half title is {{something}} that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span in the Southern League. One important highlight {{of the first half}} of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch, advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game. Nashville went on to capture the second-half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but the Blue Jays emerged the victor, eliminating the Sounds from the playoffs. Skipper Jim Marshall led his Sounds to a 74–73 record.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E

50|$|Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> {{formed when}} the {{terminal}} moraine that dammed {{the waters of}} glacial Lake Connecticut failed, and sea water mixed with the lake's fresh waters. The first European to record the existence of Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> the Dutch navigator Adriaen Block, who entered the sound from the East River in 1614. The <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> known as The Devil's Belt in colonial times and the reefs that run across the <b>sound</b> <b>were</b> known as Devil's Stepping Stones, from which Stepping Stones Lighthouse got its name.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} Twotone {{features}} regular techno conventions, {{such as a}} regular kick drum and snare beat, but these <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> augmented by irregular rhythmic placements and supplemental click and cut sounds.

Other featured <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> vocal snippets and occasional industrial samples.|$|R
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> added to the sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, {{but he refused to}} go back on his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of the}} season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E
5|$|With a team {{in place}} and a stadium under construction, the Nashville <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> set to begin play in 1978 as an {{expansion}} team of the Southern League. As the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, the Sounds played their first game on April 15, 1978, against the Memphis Chicks at Memphis' Tim McCarver Stadium, which they lost, 4–2. The Sounds recorded their first win the next evening, defeating Memphis, 3–0. Meanwhile, construction on Greer Stadium continued {{in order to be}} ready for the home opener. The team had requested to open the season on the road and had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have enough time to complete the stadium. On April 26, the Sounds played their first home game, a 12–4victory, against the Savannah Braves in front of a sellout crowd of 8,156fans. The Greer home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening, but was rained out. Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day, and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. Much of the sod that been laid that winter died, and the replacement sod arrived late, leaving it to be laid the day before the scheduled opening game. The Sounds finished their inaugural 1978 season under manager Chuck Goggin with a 64–77 record and failed to win either half of the Southern League's split-season, leaving them out of the championship playoffs. Bruce Berenyi was selected as the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher.|$|E
