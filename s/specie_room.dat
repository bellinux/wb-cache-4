60|$|It was a sunny {{afternoon}} {{when the little}} West Coast mailboat's engines ceased their throbbing off the mole of Santa Cruz, Teneriffe. Clear skies had hung over her as she rolled northward in no great hurry, and the fresh breezes which curl the sparkling sea between Morocco and the fever coast had brought new life to her sickly passengers. Dane felt his heart grow lighter as each league of deep blue water rolled astern, and {{the shadow of the}} dark land had almost fallen from him when the Canaries rose out of the sea. He had youth on his side, besides a comparatively clean conscience and a sound constitution; and a little chest consigned by him to a British bank was locked in the steamer's <b>specie</b> <b>room.</b> Though he would gladly have flung its contents into the sea to undo the past, regrets were futile. So, with a courage which sprang rather from humility than pride, he had determined to ask Lilian Chatterton to either share his struggles or await his prosperity.|$|E
5000|$|The 1987 salvage {{effort was}} {{successful}} in targeting and excavating their target area, but failed to locate the gold, however. The crew excavated the target area but {{ended up in the}} ship’s wine locker, finding hundreds of pre-1900 bottles of wine and champagne. [...] Once they realized they were in the wine locker rather than the <b>specie</b> <b>room,</b> Capt. Bayerle flew to London and appeared on ITV and BBC radio, offering a £25,000 reward for the construction plans of the Republic. [...] No one came forth with the plans to the ship, however, and the salvage was terminated for lack of funds. Despite many years of research and effort, the plans to the ship still have never been found.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hydrogen is the {{dominating}} gas <b>specie</b> in <b>room</b> temperature, ultrahigh vacuum {{systems of}} particle accelerators and storage rings, {{such as the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven. Rapid pressure increase of a few decades in hydrogen and other residual gases was observed during RHIC's recent high intensity gold and proton runs. The type and magnitude of the. pressure increase were analyzed and compared with vacuum conditioning, beam intensity, number of bunches and bunch spacing. Most of these pressure increases {{were found to be}} consistent with those induced by beam loss andor electron stimulated desorption from electron multi-pacting...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Captain Bayerle's {{exclusive}} salvage {{rights to}} the wreck were reconfirmed by the United States District Court, District of Massachusetts. A re-survey of the vessel was performed during 2012 and MVSHQ is preparing for a major recovery effort during summer months of 2015-2017. A [...] "section lift" [...] of the vessel had been planned but recent surveys (2009) have determined that the ship is in such fragile condition that she would break up under any strain. Instead, Bayerle said he would excavate {{the section of the}} ship which contains the <b>specie</b> (bullion) <b>room.</b> In 2013, MVSHQ, Inc. retained Etoile Blanc Consulting, LLC to manage investment and media properties related to the anticipated RMS Republic recovery.|$|R
5000|$|RMS Windsor Castle was {{the largest}} {{passenger}} and cargo liner operated by the Union-Castle Line on its Cape Mail service between Britain and South Africa. Completed in 1960, the new Royal Mail Ship was notable for the high standard, if conservative, design of her public rooms in a [...] "traditional" [...] first class and [...] "contemporary" [...] tourist class configuration, which by clever arrangement, afforded both classes public rooms and open-deck areas facing forward and aft. The spacious passenger lounges and dining rooms were designed by eminent British architects. Windsor Castle was air-conditioned throughout the passenger and crew areas. Facilities included a fully-equipped hospital, two outdoor swimming pools, a health spa and a theatre/cinema. A large amount of dry and refrigerated cargo space, cargo wine tanks and a <b>specie</b> (bullion) <b>room,</b> were also fitted.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{stress-strain}} {{tests are}} performed on Gaboon (Aucoumea Klaineana Pierre) <b>specie</b> in <b>room</b> temperature and humidity. This specie is used, in major part, in collective, individual and industrial construction, in timber structure {{and also in}} the fabrication of paper and veneer wood products in Europe. 15 samples have been tested under monotonous loading and 6 others in 5 cycles compression loading with different levels. According to the typical load stress-strain curve, the elastic moduli are obtained and the comparison between envelope of the cyclic load curve and the monotonous loading curve is achieved. The evolution of continuous displacement versus number of cycles shows three different zones representing the mechanical behaviour of the specie. The obtained results are in accordance with these proposed in the literature and the European code and bring important informations to the Gaboon's timber building...|$|R
