2500|$|In {{her book}} Soap Opera, Dorothy Hobson {{suggests}} that Raquel epitomised {{the representation of}} Northern working-class women during the 1990s: [...] "Raquel articulated the hopes of many young women in her position. The character was complex; one that the whole audience loved, she was naive, gentle, and although {{she looked as if}} she would break men's hearts, for the most part it was her own heart that was broken." [...] Hobson deemed Raquel's breakdown at the registry office prior to her marriage to Curly [...] "one of the most poignant and heartbreaking of any scene in a soap opera, or indeed in any other dramas." [...] She felt that in sobbing with awareness that she was marrying not for love but security, Raquel [...] "spoke of the young working-class women, bright, intelligent, who had been failed by the education system, thus united the shared cultural knowledge of the audience as <b>she</b> <b>wept</b> for herself and millions of other women like her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huntley was {{the brains}} behind Richardson's entire {{literary}} success—such as it was. She was an educated, trained, talented, successful newspaper woman; an altruist, a philosopher, a thinker, and a genius for dissecting and analyzing intricate psychological problems. Huntley edited everything of any merit that TK ever wrote. He produced nothing after [...] "The Great Work," [...] in 1906. Huntley and Richardson married on January 30, 1910, 23 {{years after their}} first meeting.

But a short time before her death, she became aware of TK's real nature, the awful consequences of his destructive influences, together with her own part in carrying them out. With this recognition, for several days, <b>she</b> <b>wept,</b> and finally on January 28, 1912, she began to experience a severe headache, a few hours later lapsing into unconsciousness which lasted nearly four days.

Harrison followed her 1964 win by entering the Miss Maryland beauty pageant, a preliminary event to the Miss American pageant, itself the final preliminary event to the Miss International contest, which would be held in Long Beach, California, in mid-June 1965. Harrison won the contest over nineteen other girls; that June, as Miss Maryland, she flew to California for the Miss American contest. She thought the trip would last for two weeks; bidding farewell to her boyfriend, she schedule her return home in two weeks, after she was crowned Miss American.
