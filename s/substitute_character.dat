40|$|Every {{acquisition}} of rights to prestations (benefit payments) from the Alimony Fund is always preceded with a realization of duty of alimony (art. 4 of the Alimony Fund Act of July 18, 1974). The notion of duty of alimony {{does not have a}} precise meaning. The author attempts at reconstructing a meaning of that notion. It is found in the conclusion that adll legal bonds conséquent upon familly law regulation, connecting the person entitled with the person obliged, are the grounds for appearance of duties of alimony. On the base of the adopted criterion all duties of providing the means of maintenance and possibly means of education established according to the regulation of art. 753 of Gode of Civil Procedure and Family and Guardianship Code have to be considered as duties of alimony. Next the author discusses the previous evolution and trends of developement of the studied piremise of {{acquisition of}} a right to benefits from the Alimony Fund. The 1982 and 1984 amendments of. the Act prove, in the author's opinion, that a formerly tight bond between the existence and scope of duties of alimony and the existence and scope of the right to the Alimony Fund benefits is presently diminishing. Now, the benefits have in a lesser extent a <b>substitute</b> <b>character</b> vs. the unenforced. alimony payments as compared with the initial period of the Fund's functioning. It results from taking over alimony burdens by the State and discharging the obliged from the liability. It is mostly the case of those obliged to alimony payments in a further precedence. The author criticizes the postulates to develop the Fund in that direction. Such a trend would undoubtedly end up in eroding the institution of duty of alimony.

40|$|As Chinese text {{is written}} without word boundaries, {{effectively}} recognizing Chinese words is like recognizing collocations in English, <b>substituting</b> <b>characters</b> for words and words for collocations. However, existing topical models that involve collocations {{have a common}} limitation. Instead of directly assigning a topic to a collocation, they take the topic of a word within the collocation as {{the topic of the}} whole collocation. This is unsatisfactory for topical modeling of Chinese documents. Thus, we propose a topical word-character model (TWC), which allows two distinct types of topics: word topic and character topic. We evaluated TWC both qualitatively and quantitatively to show that it is a powerful and a promising topic model...|$|R

50|$|Script typefaces {{have evolved}} {{rapidly in the}} second half of the 20th century due to {{developments}} in technology and the end of widespread use of metal type. Historically, most signwriting on logos, displays and shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather custom-designed lettering created by signpainters and engravers. As phototypesetting and then computers have made printing text at a range of sizes far easier than in the metal type period, it has become increasingly common for businesses to use type for logos and signs rather than hand-drawn lettering. In addition, phototypesetting made overlap of characters relatively simple, something very complicated to achieve in metal type. Matthew Carter has cited his 1966 Snell Roundhand typeface as deliberately designed to replicate a style of calligraphy hard to simulate in metal. An additional development enabling more sophisticated script fonts has been the release of the OpenType format, which most fonts are now released in. This allows fonts to have a large character set, increasing the sophistication of design possible, and contextual insertion, in which characters that match one another are inserted into a document automatically, so fonts can convincingly mimic handwriting without the user having to choose the correct <b>substitute</b> <b>characters</b> manually. Many modern script typefaces emulate the styles of hand-drawn lettering from different historical periods.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} enumerating {{the size of the}} k-spheres of a fixed word for the edit metric as well as discussing the symmetry group of the edit graph in order to create an edit metric error correcting code. The application of such error correcting codes is to the correction of sequencing errors in DNA barcodes, short stretches of DNA incorporated into genomic libraries to identify source tissue or other information about the source of a given DNA sequence. As sequencing errors not only <b>substitute</b> <b>characters</b> but potentially insert and delete them, the traditional Hamming metric used in standard error correcting codes is not useful. The natural metric, the edit distance, is algebraically complex as compared to the Hamming metric. In this thesis the exact size of edit spheres of radius 1 and 2 are computed for any binary or q-ary string. The number of edit distance d neighbors of two special types of strings is also presented. Structural information about the edit metric space, in particular a representation as a pyramid of hypercubes and the symmetry group of the space, is given. This result begins the process of reconstructing the theory of error correcting codes for the edit metric and yields practical advice for the design of heuristic algorithms, e. g. evolutionary algorithms, used in practice to create error correcting DNA barcodes...|$|R
40|$|Until the Muromachi era, the {{relationship}} between kanji (Chinese characters) and furigana (small‑print marginal annotations to kanji {{using one of the}} Japanese kana syllabaries) was chiefly that the latter were used as guides to the pronunciation or meaning of unusual or difficult characters. But in the early modern period, furigana came to be used more creatively as a means for expressing double meanings or overlapping significations, and in haikai {{from the beginning of the}} early modern period, furigana take on a variety of functions. But there has been little progress in research into haikai from this period. This paper aims at furthering such investigation by examining Saikaku gohyaku in. The first section demonstrates how the kanji compound 日外, which in classical Chinese meant "a place the power of the sovereign does not reach" came to be read and used in Japanese as itsuzoya. The second section looks at how the now obsolete compound 性躰 (shotai) was used in the same contexts that the present 正体 (shotai) would be employed, and seen as a legitimate usage of Chinese vocabulary. The third section considers the use of 上夫 as ateji or phonetic <b>substitute</b> <b>characters</b> for 丈夫 in order to express a double entendre.

I, in charge of "Japanese Expression Practice" have noticed that many problems are latent in the sentences my students write. They are neither the wrong words nor the false <b>substitute</b> <b>characters</b> but more essencial problems such as the way of looking at things or the way of thinking. Thesefore I have corrected the writing of the sentences again and again, guiding them to deepen their way of looking at things and that of thinking.

" Moreover they haven't acquired the fundamental learning habit, "to study repeatedly" as the background of the above mentioned. On the other side, it has been pointed out that the learning habit and the learning desire are related to the habit of life.

5000|$|When italicized, only Latin {{characters}} are slanted, not CJK characters and kana. CJK characters use other methods of emphasis or quotation indication; thus differing from, for example, the typefaces of Romance languages (unrelated distinctions between cursive and non-cursive and other traditional writing styles do exist). Nowadays, however, italicization {{is used in}} advertising but usually combined with other, common forms of emphasis, such as bold weight, exclamation marks, and, in Japanese, katakana use. Academic texts, for example, do not use italicized CJK characters {{as opposed to those}} in non-CJK languages, e.g. in traditionally Latin-1 encoded European languages that use italics for things like inline quotations. Since these traditions of italicization do not exist in CJK, the decisions made for Meiryo is based on the existing general use. According to Microsoft, Meiryo uses a customized version of Verdana for italics instead of the generic slanting method. Although the font includes an OpenType table for italics, this feature only <b>substitutes</b> <b>characters</b> already included in the font, instead of applying transformation effects to the affected characters. Since Meiryo only has italic characters for Latin, Greek, Coptic, and Cyrillic characters, it is an indication that Windows Vista does not use emulated italic effects if it uses a substitute font for italic effect but cannot find the correct glyph in the italic font. Similarly, most of the OpenType tables used in the font (except kern) only work if substitute glyphs are available inside the font.|$|R
