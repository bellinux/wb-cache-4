50|$|However, {{the film}} of {{condensation}} will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and {{depending upon the}} spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. If the unit is not laid to falls, and the condensate not allowed to drain properly, this will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the device.|$|E
50|$|The {{pumped fluid}} {{will have to}} be {{protected}} from freezing in certain climates, and as such is normally treated with a glycol based anti-freeze. This also reduces the specific heat capacity of the fluid and increases the viscosity, increasing pump power consumption, further reducing the <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the device. For example, a 20% glycol mixture will provide protection down to -10 C, but will increase system resistance by 15%.|$|E
50|$|When heat {{recovery}} is not required, it is typical for {{the device to}} be bypassed by use of dampers arranged within the ventilation distribution system. Assuming the fans are fitted with inverter speed controls, set to maintain a constant pressure in the ventilation system, then the reduced pressure drop leads to a slowing of the fan motor and thus reducing power consumption, and in turn improves the <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the system.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{this system}} is {{generally}} limited to situations where the air streams are separated and no other type of device can be utilised since the heat recovery efficiency is lower than other forms of air-to-air heat recovery. Gross efficiencies are usually {{in the range of}} 40 to 50%, but more significantly <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of this system can be very low, due to the extra electrical energy used by the pumped fluid circuit.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to find}} suitable efficiency and leakage specifications for Energy Star duct systems and provide recommendations on duct insulation specifications. This analysis looks at a typical house, with a selection of duct locations, climates, duct insulation (R-value), and duct leakage. A set of calculations were performed with reduced capacity and airflow to look at the effect of variable capacity systems. This was done to address concerns regarding the increased efficiency of multi-capacity equipment due to good part load performance and how these efficiency gains may be offset by increased duct losses. The duct system efficiencies were calculated using the procedures in proposed ASHRAE Standard 152 P ''Method of Test for Determining the Design and <b>Seasonal</b> <b>Efficiencies</b> of Residential Thermal Distribution Systems'' (ASHRAE 1999). This proposed ASHRAE Standard can be used to calculate duct efficiency for both design and seasonal weather conditions. In this report, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are used for most of the analysis because they are the most appropriate for estimating energy consumption in buildings. The effects at peak conditions are examined for changing duct insulation in order to provide preliminary estimates of the potential responses to time of use pricing. The study {{was performed in}} two parts. The first part focused on duct leakage and the second part on duct insulation. The HVAC systems in the two parts share many attributes, however, they differ in detail and so are treated separately here.

5000|$|Because of {{the nature}} of thermal wheels in the way that heat is {{transferred}} from the exhaust air stream to the supply air stream without having to pass directly through an exchange medium, the gross efficiencies are usually much higher than that of any other air-side heat recovery system. The shallower depth of the heat exchange matrix, as compared to that, say, for a plate heat exchanger, means that the pressure drop through the device is normally lower in comparison. Generally, a thermal wheel will be selected for face velocities between 1.5 and 3.0 m/s, and with equal air volume flow rates, gross [...] "sensible" [...] efficiencies of 85% can be expected. Although there is a small extra energy requirement to rotate the wheel, the motor energy consumption is usually very low and has little effect upon the <b>seasonal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the device. In addition, the ability to recover [...] "latent" [...] heat, depending upon the materials and coatings used, can improve gross efficiencies by 10-15%.|$|E
