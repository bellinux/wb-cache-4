5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E
5|$|In Vijayanagara, Madhura was {{the court}} poet of King HariharaII and King Deva RayaI under the {{patronage}} {{of their respective}} prime ministers. He is famous for {{his account of the}} 15th tirthankar titled Dharmanatha Purana (1385), written in a style similar to that of Jain poets of earlier centuries. Madhura is also credited with a poem about Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola. Ayata Varma, who is tentatively dated to 1400, translated from Sanskrit a champu (mixed prose-verse) titled Ratna Karandaka describing Jain ideologies. Manjarasa, a feudatory king of Kallahalli and a Vijayanagara general of rank, wrote two books. Nemijinesa Sangata, completed in 1508, was an account {{of the life of the}} 22nd Jain tirthankar; Samyukta Koumudi, written in 1509, comprised 18 short <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> religious values and morals.|$|E

Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted {{for the remainder of}} his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.|$|E

5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> the battle, public outrage over the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E

Whether {{or not they were}} actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out.

5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Newsweek {{verbally}} accepted Hensmann's {{offer and}} he in turn informed Murdoch, {{giving him the}} option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements {{and came to a}} second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $400,000; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with Panorama for $50,000. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the plant}} {{consisted}} of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building. The Mason house, which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861. It is a two-story brick Italianate style house that was converted {{to be used as}} an office building and significantly modified throughout the years. The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year. In 1942, a two-story front addition was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950. These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola, brick chimneys, front entry, and veranda. The Manufacturing building, constructed from 1912 to 1913, is three stories high on the river side and two <b>stories</b> <b>on</b> the east. It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters. At each end of the building are stairs and elevator towers. The structural remains of the original glass house survive as a sub-basement in a one-story extension {{at the south end of}} the building.|$|E
