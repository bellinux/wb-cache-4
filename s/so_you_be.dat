6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{says the}} other, [...] "and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> up at last, and no great harm done, I'll be bound. And {{how does your}} head feel by now, my young master?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the word}} [...] "fever" [...] Carlos Dunetta drew down {{the corners of}} his broad mouth. [...] "Fever? Dat is werry bad--Americano canno stand dat. Maybe I best carry you to Josefina's hut. Josefina she my sistair. She take care of you if <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> sick." ...|$|E
60|$|B. B. [archly] Aha! Ha ha! Aha! [trilling like a lark as {{he shakes}} his finger at Walpole]. You removed her nuciform sac. Well, well! force of habit! force of habit! Never mind, ne-e-e-ver mind. She got back her voice after it, and thinks you the {{greatest}} surgeon alive; and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And there <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> my partner, eh?" [...] says Mr. Bucket to himself, apostrophizing Mrs. Bucket, stationed, by his favour, on {{the steps}} of the deceased's house. [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> And very well indeed <b>you</b> <b>are</b> looking, Mrs. Bucket!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Cary, my dear life! Mr. Cary! and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be!</b> Oh, dear soul alive! but you're burnt so brown, and I be 'most blind with misery. Oh, {{who ever}} sent you here, my dear Mr. Will, then, {{to save a}} poor wretch from the pit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. [Good-humouredly] Well, it's partly that. But [more seriously] it's {{more the}} feeling I get that I'm not doing my duty by her. Goodness knows whom {{she may be}} picking up with! Artists are a loose lot. And young people in these days are the limit. I quite believe in moving with the times, but one's either born a Conservative, or one isn't. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> ready at twelve, see. By the way, that French maid of yours, Julia-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] she said, [...] "I {{believe you}} acted rightly. I believe {{with you that}} no man of honour could have acted otherwise. I must believe you, Noll, for did I not, then I could believe in naught and hope for naught. You are as a fire that has seized upon {{the better part of}} me and {{consumed}} it all to ashes that you may hold it in your heart. I am content <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What!' he said, starting, 'surely <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not that}} wicked man? If <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> bold indeed {{to risk the}} sharing of her fate.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>are</b> from a rich family, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> used to luxury. But I'm {{from a poor}} family, so I cannot {{accept this}} gift.|$|R
60|$|ELLIE. A siren. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> born to lead men by the nose: if you weren't, Marcus {{would have}} waited for me, perhaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{let him be}} gagged instantly," [...] said Albany. [...] "And you, my royal nephew, why stand {{you there}} fixed in astonishment? Call your {{resolution}} up--speak to the prisoner--swear--protest by all that is sacred that you knew not of this felon deed. See how the people look on each other and whisper apart! My life on't that this lie spreads faster than any Gospel truth. Speak to them, royal kinsman, {{no matter what you}} say, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> constant in denial." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{man looked}} {{steadily}} at Barnaby True for above {{half a minute}} and then burst out a-laughing. And, indeed, Barnaby, standing there with the bandage about his head, must have looked a very droll picture of that astonishment he felt so profoundly at finding who was this pirate into whose hands he had fallen. [...] "Well," [...] says the other, [...] "and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> up at last, and no great harm done, I'll be bound. And how does your head feel by now, my young master?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, {{they are}} waiting for the corporation, that's the mayor and town council of Montacute; they are coming up with an address. There! Do you hear that? That's the signal gun. They are leaving the town-hall at this same moment. Now, in three-quarters of an hour's time or so, the duke and duchess, and the young markiss, and all of them, will come on the terrace. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> alive, and draw near, and get a good place. I must look after these people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jane, {{my little}} darling (so I will call <b>you,</b> for <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are),</b> <b>you</b> don't know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking about; <b>you</b> misjudge me again: {{it is not}} because she is mad I hate her. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> mad, do <b>you</b> think I should hate you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT [delighted]. I hope so. I think <b>so.</b> [Fluctuating] <b>You</b> {{really think}} <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> sure <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not {{allowing}} your enthusiasm for our principles {{to get the}} better of your judgment? ...|$|R
30|$|Facilitator: Ah, okay, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{saying that}} {{students}} can {{just sit back and}} then not do anything—ah, she could—.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's as you think, Hetty; but it's no matter. Young {{women are}} apt to lay most stress on what most touches their feelin's; but no matter; have it your own way, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> but {{careful not to let}} the vagabonds get the mastery of a canoe. When you get back to the Ark, tell 'em to keep close, and to keep moving too, most {{especially}} at night. Many hours can't go by without the troops on the river hearing of this party, and then your fri'nds may look for relief. 'Tis but a day's march from the nearest garrison, and true soldiers will never lie idle with the foe in their neighborhood. This is my advice, and you may say to your father and Hurry that scalp-hunting will be a poor business now, as the Mingos are up and awake, and nothing can save 'em, 'till the troops come, except keeping a good belt of water atween 'em and the savages." ...|$|E
5000|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} God's {{message to}} Israel in [...] to mean: [...] "My children, as I am separate, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> separate; as I am holy, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> holy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under Downs as host, 20/20 {{changed into}} a more {{standard}} yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around {{the world and into your}} home, the stories that touch your life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E
