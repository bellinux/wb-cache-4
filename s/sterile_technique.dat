25|$|Acupuncture is {{generally}} safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles. When properly delivered, {{it has a}} low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of <b>sterile</b> <b>technique</b> or neglect of the practitioner. A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections.

25|$|Acupuncture is {{generally}} safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles. When improperly delivered {{it can cause}} adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of <b>sterile</b> <b>technique</b> or neglect {{on the part of}} the practitioner. To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture, acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently. People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for acupuncture. Contraindications to acupuncture (conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture) include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. hemophilia and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns). Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the {{collision}} of <b>sterile</b> <b>technique,</b> anaesthesia and radiology made routine surgery on the wisdom teeth possible.

2500|$|Cotton fever is a {{high fever}} {{supposedly}} caused by injecting cotton fibers into the blood stream when shooting up heroin. [...] Cotton is sometimes used as a crude filter for particulate matter prior to IV injection. [...] Other commonly blamed substances include fiberglass if a cigarette filter was used (cigarette filters do not contain fiberglass), or dirt if Mexican heroin was injected. In general, cotton fever refers to a fever that users believe is caused by inanimate particulate matter injected into the blood stream. [...] In reality, the particulate matter causing cotton fever is bacteria from lack of <b>sterile</b> <b>technique.</b> [...] Most cases of cotton fever resolve as the body clears the infection. [...] Users will often seek medical attention when cotton fever persists. [...] Persistent cotton fever is often infective endocarditis. [...] Although endotoxin shed by the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, which colonizes cotton plants, has been implicated {{as the cause of}} cotton fever, most clinical cases demonstrate blood cultures positive for skin and fecal bacteria.|$|E

5000|$|Even when <b>sterile</b> <b>techniques</b> are adhered to, {{surgical}} procedures can introduce bacteria and other microbes {{in the blood}} (causing bacteremia), which can colonize and infect {{different parts of the}} body. An estimated 5 to 10 percent of hospitalized patients undergoing otolaryngology ("head and neck") surgery acquire a nosocomial ("hospital") infection, which adds a substantial cost and an average of 4 extra days to the hospital stay.|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of infection was re-confirmed with bacterial cultures {{at the time}} of killing.

30|$|Some sterile drug {{products}} require reconstitution, admixing, dilution, and withdrawing doses {{before the}} drug is administrated to the patient. This requires penetration of the container closure system in a hospital pharmacy setting. Although the process should be handled using <b>sterile</b> <b>techniques,</b> {{there is no way}} to assure that the container was not contaminated with microorganisms. Since each drug product differs in its ability to support microbial growth, the post-penetration and admixture storage time and temperature that is provided in the drug product label should be product-specific and supported by scientific data.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sterile</b> <b>technique,</b> aseptic {{post-operative}} care, antibiotics, {{use of the}} WHO Surgical Safety Checklist, and vigilant post-operative monitoring {{greatly reduce}} the risk of these complications. Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions. The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.|$|E
5000|$|In {{alternative}} manner, live bacteria cultivated on trypticase soy {{agar plates}} may be prepared using <b>sterile</b> <b>technique</b> with a single-line streak inoculation.
