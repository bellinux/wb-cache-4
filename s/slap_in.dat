5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

500|$|Georgia Tech {{students}} hold a heated, {{long and}} ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities {{between the two}} institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be [...] "old gold, black, and crimson". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it [...] "symbolized cowardice". After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color. Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.

500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views.

[...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages.

500|$|Caligari was a {{critical}} success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it [...] "superb" [...] and wrote, [...] "What a lesson to all directors!" [...] and René Clair said [...] "overthrew the realist dogma" [...] of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: [...] "At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> the face." [...] Jean Epstein, however, called it [...] "a prize example of the abuse of décor in the cinema" [...] and said it [...] "represents a grave sickness of cinema". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it [...] "the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise {{by means of the}} camera". [...] French critic Frédéric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: [...] "It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth." [...] The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a [...] "combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras".|$|E
