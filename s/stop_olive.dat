5000|$|Olive {{eventually}} {{finds out}} that this is because Blitzen, one of Santa's reindeer, is injured earlier during a practice flight and can not fly. Santa (voiced by Edward Asner) hopes he can make the Christmas run with [...] "all of the other reindeer". Mishearing this on the radio as [...] "Olive the other reindeer", Olive becomes convinced that it is she Santa is referring to, prompting her to travel to the North Pole to fill in on the sleigh team. On the way to the bus station, Olive runs into a grouchy Postman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) who is fed up with the stress of having to deliver the heavy loads of mail during the Christmas rush. ("Christmas (Bah, Bug and Hum)") He then tells Olive that [...] "By next year, people will have forgotten about Christmas." [...] He learns that Olive is trying to help save Santa's flight. He is vengeful towards Santa for being repeatedly put on his Naughty list and is determined to <b>stop</b> <b>Olive</b> from saving Christmas.|$|E

60|$|Helena, Louisa, and Olive {{climbed the}} steps {{to go to the}} South-Western platform. They were laden with dress-baskets, umbrellas, and little packages. Olive and Louisa, at least, were in high spirits. <b>Olive</b> <b>stopped</b> before the indicator.|$|R

He also left the {{management}} of the ANPEAP and Convención Nacional del Agro Peruano - CONVEAGRO (National Convention of the Peruvian Agriculture), in order to spend all his time in the political struggle from the CM direction.|$|R
50|$|Creve Coeur was {{incorporated}} in 1949. Although there are cabins {{that are more}} than 200 years old (including two still in Conway Park) in the community, it grew primarily as a <b>stopping</b> point along <b>Olive</b> Boulevard (now Route 340) between University City and Creve Coeur Lake. It expanded faster following construction of Interstate 270 and U.S. Route 40.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} <b>stopped,</b> and <b>Olive</b> slipped out, and, before Mrs. Easterfield had {{any idea}} {{of what she was}} going to do, the girl climbed the rail fence which separated the road from the captain's pasture field. Between this field and the garden was a picket fence, not very high; and, toward a point about midway between the little tollhouse and the dwelling, Olive now ran swiftly. When she had nearly reached the fence she gave a great bound; put one foot on the upper rail to which the pickets were nailed; and then went over. What would have happened if the sharp pales had caught her skirts might well be imagined. But nothing happened.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} decade, New Jersey Transit closed several {{stations}} over {{the length of}} the Montclair Branch. The Harrison and Roseville Avenue stations were closed on September 16, 1984; the Ampere station in East Orange was closed less than seven years later, on April 7, 1991. Plans to extend the Morristown Line and Boonton Line westward from Netcong station to Hackettstown were proposed in June 1992 as part of proposed service extension. On November 6, 1994, service was ceremonially extended along Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary from Netcong Station with the creation of the <b>stops</b> in Mount <b>Olive</b> and Hackettstown. Trackage along those two stations is still Norfolk Southern's, though anything beyond Netcong remains New Jersey Transit's.|$|R
50|$|The first {{reports of}} a pilgrimage route {{corresponding}} to the Biblical events dates from the Byzantine era; during that time, a Holy Thursday procession started {{from the top of}} the Mount of <b>Olives,</b> <b>stopped</b> in Gethsemane, entered the Old City at the Lions' Gate, and followed approximately the current route to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; however, there were no actual stops during the route along the Via Dolorosa itself. By the 8th century, however, the route went via the western hill instead; starting at Gethsemane, it continued to the alleged House of Caiaphas on Mount Zion, then to Hagia Sophia (viewed as the site of the Praetorium), and finally to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sick of the}} Back Bay!" [...] said Olive fiercely; and {{she passed}} to the door with Miss Birdseye, bidding good-bye to no one. She was so {{agitated}} that, evidently, she could not trust herself, {{and there was nothing}} for Ransom but to follow. At the door of the room, however, he was checked by a sudden pause {{on the part of the}} two ladies: <b>Olive</b> <b>stopped</b> and stood there hesitating. She looked round the room and spied out Verena, where she sat with her mother, the centre of a gratified group; then, throwing back her head with an air of decision, she crossed over to her. Ransom said to himself that now, perhaps, was his chance, and he quickly accompanied Miss Chancellor. The little knot of reformers watched her as she arrived; their faces expressed a suspicion of her social importance, mingled with conscientious scruples as to whether it were right to recognise it. Verena Tarrant saw that she was the object of this manifestation, and she got up to meet the lady whose approach was so full of point. Ransom perceived, however, or thought he perceived, that she recognised nothing; she had no suspicions of social importance. Yet she smiled with all her radiance, as she looked from Miss Chancellor to him; smiled because she liked to smile, to please, to feel her success--or was it because she was a perfect little actress, and this was part of her training? She took the hand that Olive put out to her; the others, rather solemnly, sat looking up from their chairs.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{candle in}} any window, {{and when she}} pushed in {{and stood in the}} hall, {{listening}} a moment, her step awakened no answering sound. Her heart failed her; Verena's staying out in a boat from ten o'clock in the morning till nightfall was too unnatural, and she gave a cry, as she rushed into the low, dim parlour (darkened on one side, at that hour, by the wide-armed foliage, and on the other by the veranda and trellis), which expressed only a wild personal passion, a desire to take her friend in her arms again on any terms, even the most cruel to herself. The next moment she started back, with another and a different exclamation, for Verena was in the room, motionless, in a corner--the first place in which she had seated herself on re-entering the house--looking at her with a silent face which seemed strange, unnatural, in the dusk. <b>Olive</b> <b>stopped</b> short, and for a minute the two women remained as they were, gazing at each other in the dimness. After that, too, Olive still said nothing; she only went to Verena and sat down beside her. She didn't {{know what to make of}} her manner; she had never been like that before. She was unwilling to speak; she seemed crushed and humbled. This was almost the worst--if anything could be worse than what had gone before; and Olive took her hand with an irresistible impulse of compassion and assurance. From the way it lay in her own she guessed her whole feeling--saw it was a kind of shame, shame for her weakness, her swift surrender, her insane gyration, in the morning. Verena expressed it by no protest and no explanation; she appeared not even to wish to hear the sound of her own voice. Her silence itself was an appeal--an appeal to Olive to ask no questions (she could trust her to inflict no spoken reproach); only to wait till she could lift up her head again. Olive understood, or thought she understood, and the woefulness of it all only seemed the deeper. She would just sit there and hold her hand; that was all she could do; they were beyond each other's help in any other way now. Verena leaned her head back and closed her eyes, and for an hour, as nightfall settled in the room, neither of the young women spoke. Distinctly, it was a kind of shame. After a while the parlour-maid, very casual, in the manner of the servants at Marmion, appeared on the threshold with a lamp; but Olive motioned her frantically away. She wished to keep the darkness. It was a kind of shame.|$|R
40|$|Rad je osvrt na tipove amfora iz Vinkovaca (Cibalae) na osnovi objavljenog materijala iz starijih istraživanja i neobjavljenog materijala sa četiri lokaliteta koji su smješteni uz jugoistočni dio foruma Cibala. Ustanovljeno je devet tipova amfora: Lamboglia 2, Dressel 2 - 4, Camulodunum 184, Forlimpopoli, Dressel 6 B, Dressel 20, Schörgendorfer 558, Camulodunum 189 i Beltran I. The aim of {{the paper}} is typological {{analysis}} of amphorae based on the published material from former excavations, and the material from four protection excavations in Vinkovci (Cibalae), which has never been published. Protection excavations were done at the localities situated {{next to each other}} and connected with each other (Figure 1.), alongside the south-eastern part of the forum of Cibalae. The localities were excavated at di?erent times during the construction and renewal of certain objects and were named after the buildings. The locality named Vinkovci - Museum was excavated in 1994 during the work in the cellar of the City Museum of Vinkovci; the locality Vinkovci - Šokadija in 1990; the locality Vinkovci - Varteks in 1982; and the locality Vinkovci - Komercijalna Banka in 1973. The excavations were conducted by Ivana Iskra - Janošić, PhD, employed with the City Museum of Vinkovci. Amphorae from Cibalae have only been published in the syntheses dealing with pottery or amphorae in Pannonia. Olga Brukner’s synthesis on the Roman pottery of Pannonia Inferior {{is the source of the}} first information on amphorae. Recently, Bezecky and Kelemen have mainly adopted the ideas of Olga Brukner in their several syntheses. According to these data, all the knowledge of the amphorae Lamboglia 2, Dressel 20, and Beltran I is available from former excavations only. Amphorae Dressel 6 B and Dressel 2 - 4 were documented in former excavations and confirmed in the new ones. Amphorae Camulodunum 184, Schörgendorfer 558, and Camulodunum 189, and Forlimpopoli were first documented during the excavations of the locality next to the south-eastern part of the forum of Cibalae. Synthesising the present knowledge on amphorae from Vinkovci it is possible to conclude that Cibalae had commercial relations with di?erent parts of the Roman Empire. The goods from the Mediterranean reached Pannonia via Aquileia, and further inland to Siscia. From Siscia the goods could reach Cibalae by the Sava and Bosut Rivers, and by land. Wine came from Italy already in the late Republican Lamboglia 2 amphorae, and in Dressel 2 - 4 amphorae, starting in mid 1 st century and in the second half of the 1 st century. This is the time when wine was transported from Aegae in the so-called Rhodian amphorae. In the second century wine from the west Adriatic coast vineyards was transported in Forlimpopoli type of amphorae. Olive oil from the peninsula of Istria was transported to Cibalae as noted by a number of Dressel 6 B type of amphorae there. The quality Istrian oil covered the needs of Noricum and Pannonia until the end of Hadrian’s rule. When Istrian workshop <b>stopped</b> the production, <b>olive</b> oil was imported from Baetica in Dressel 20 amphorae. In 2 nd century preserved black olives were transported in Schörgendorfer 558 amphorae. Dried fruit, mainly dates and figs, were brought in small Camulodunum 189 amphorae. In the course of 1 st century until mid 2 nd century the best quality garum or liquamen was transported from Spain in Beltran I amphorae. Based on the data, the amphorae found by now in Cibalae can be dated between mid 1 st century and the beginning of 3 rd century. The later types of amphorae have not been documented yet. This survey tries to reconstruct the picture of trade and economy in Cibalae using the data about amphorae. We confirmed the former data on amphorae in Vinkovci, and added new knowledge to them. As we do not have enough data yet to make new conclusions, this work can be considered an introduction to the study of the significant archaeological issue...|$|R
