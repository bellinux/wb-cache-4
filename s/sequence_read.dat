5|$|In 2010 the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Read</b> Archive made up {{approximately}} 95% of {{the base}} pair data available through the ENA, encompassing over 500,000,000,000 sequence reads made up of over 60 trillion (6×1013) base pairs. Almost half of this data was deposited {{in relation to the}} 1000 Genomes Project wherein the researchers published their sequence data to the SRA in real-time. In total, as of September 2010, 65% of the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Read</b> Archive was human genomic sequence, with another 16% relating to human metagenome sequence reads.|$|E
5|$|The archive is {{composed}} of three main databases: the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Read</b> Archive, the Trace Archive and the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-bank). The ENA is produced and maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute {{and is a member}} of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) along with the DNA Data Bank of Japan and GenBank.|$|E
5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Read</b> Archive (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads. Currently, the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background RNA-seq {{can be used}} {{to measure}} {{allele-specific}} expression (ASE) by assigning <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> to individual alleles; however, relative ASE is systematically biased when <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> are aligned to a single reference genome. Aligning <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> to both parental genomes can eliminate this bias, but this approach is not always practical, especially for non-model organisms. To improve accuracy of ASE measured using a single reference genome, we identified properties of differentiating sites responsible for biased measures of relative ASE. Results We found that clusters of differentiating sites prevented <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> from an alternate allele from aligning to the reference genome, causing a bias in relative ASE favoring the reference allele. This bias increased with greater sequence divergence between alleles. Increasing the number of mismatches allowed when aligning <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> to the reference genome and restricting analysis to genomic regions with fewer differentiating sites than the number of mismatches allowed almost completely eliminated this systematic bias. Accuracy of allelic abundance was increased further by excluding differentiating sites within <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> that could not be aligned uniquely within the genome (imperfect mappability) and reads that overlapped one or more insertions or deletions (indels) between alleles. Conclusions After aligning <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> to a single reference genome, excluding differentiating sites with at least as many neighboring differentiating sites as the number of mismatches allowed, imperfect mappability, and/or an indel(s) nearby resulted in measures of allelic abundance comparable to those derived from aligning <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> to both parental genomes...|$|R

The <b>sequence</b> <b>read</b> archive includes this quality score.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} link <b>sequence</b> <b>read</b> {{abundance}} to {{expression of a}} particular gene, transcript sequences are aligned to a reference genome, or de novo aligned to one another if no reference is available. The key challenges for alignment software include sufficient speed to permit billions of short sequences to be aligned in a meaningful timeframe, flexibility to recognise and deal with intron splicing of eukaryotic mRNA, and correct assignment of reads that map to multiple locations. Software advances have greatly addressed these issues, and increases in sequencing read length are further reducing multimapping reads. A list of currently available high-throughput sequence aligners is maintained by the EBI.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of using}} {{multiple}} sequencing technologies to facilitate genome assembly may become {{an idea of the}} past as the quality of long <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> (hundreds or thousands of base pairs) approaches and exceeds the quality of current second generation <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads.</b> The computational difficulties that are encountered during genome assembly will also become a concept of the past as computation efficiency and performance increases. The development of more efficient sequencing algorithms and assembly programs is needed to develop more effective assembly approaches that can tandemly incorporate <b>sequencing</b> <b>reads</b> from multiple technologies.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two general}} methods of {{inferring}} transcriptome sequences.

25|$|Transcriptomics {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. Microarray data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. Microarray raw image files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must be aligned to reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple transcriptomics experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed microarray intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the <b>Sequence</b> <b>Read</b> Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can be uploaded via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E

Results The tool JANE rapidly maps ESTs {{or variable}} <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> in prokaryotic <b>sequencing</b> and transcriptome efforts to related template genomes. It provides an easy-to-use graphics interface for information retrieval and a toolkit for EST or nucleotide sequence function prediction. Furthermore, we developed for rapid mapping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided from the BLAST algorithm. Rapid assembly on and replacement of the template genome by <b>sequence</b> <b>reads</b> or mapped ESTs is achieved.
