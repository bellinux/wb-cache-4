25|$|The first {{possible}} literary {{reference to}} the salt cementation parting process is in the Arthashastra, a 4th-century BC treatise from India, that mentions heating of gold with Indus earth. Indus earth is taken to mean soils high in salt, nitre and ammonium salts and therefore ideal for the cementation parting process. A better known and more detailed early description is given by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC quoting an earlier lost book, On the Erythraean Sea from the 2nd century BC by Agatharchides of Cnidus. An experiment recreating the process as described by Diodorus Siculus by heating a mixture of the gold and <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sealed pot for 5 days was done by Notton and {{was found to be}} successful.|$|E

Senator Breckinridge died in 1806, leaving his wife to tend the family's large plantations. Robert soon earned a {{reputation}} of misbehaving. In one instance, {{he and his brother}} John had a physical altercation because Robert put <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blind cousin's coffee; in another, his mother gave him a [...] "tremendous whipping" [...] for beating an old slave.|$|E
500|$|Different natural salts have {{different}} mineralities {{depending on their}} source, giving each one a unique flavour.

In traditional Korean cuisine, so-called [...] "bamboo salt" [...] is prepared by roasting <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang (a fermented bean paste).|$|E

60|$|In this dilemma, Captain Hardy {{arranged}} {{that the}} corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, {{with a large}} quantity of <b>salt,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise. Nothing was to {{be said of the}} lady's decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased lady's-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress' life, was now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every night. In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress--whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board.|$|E

On the table was spread a solid lump of excellent pemmican--excellent, because made by the fair hands of Mrs Stanley. It stood vis-a-vis to a tin plate whereon lay three large steaming cuts of boiled fresh salmon--fresh, because, although caught some months before, it had been frozen solid ever since. There was a large tin kettle of hot tea in the centre of the board--if under the circumstances we may use the term--and three tin cups out of which to drink it; besides a plate containing broken pieces of ship-biscuit and a small quantity of sugar wrapped up in a morsel of paper. Also a little <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tin box.|$|E
