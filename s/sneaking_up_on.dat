5|$|Mario and Princess Peach {{are walking}} {{together}} when lightning suddenly strikes Peach's castle nearby. As Mario runs to help, Bowser Jr. appears, <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Princess {{from behind and}} kidnapping her. Realizing what has happened, Mario quickly rushes back and gives chase. Mario ventures through eight worlds pursuing Bowser Jr. and trying to rescue the kidnapped princess. Mario catches {{up to them and}} confronts Bowser Jr. occasionally, but is unable to save the princess from the young Koopa's clutches. At {{the end of the first}} world, Bowser Jr. retreats to a castle, where his father, Bowser, awaits Mario on a bridge over a pit filled with lava. In a scene highly reminiscent of the original Super Mario Bros., Mario activates a button behind Bowser to defeat him, and the bridge underneath Bowser collapses, causing him to fall into the lava which burns his flesh, leaving a skeleton.|$|E
25|$|The Neapolitan Mastiff is fearless and {{extremely}} protective of its home and family. They {{prefer to be}} with their family. The Neapolitan Mastiff rarely barks unless under provocation, renowned for <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> intruders as opposed to first alerting them of its presence.|$|E
500|$|Criticism was {{leveled at}} the game's {{difficult}} gameplay {{due to the}} scarcity of health and ammunition. The weak artificial intelligence of enemies and superficial stealth mechanics were also noted. According to GameSpot, [...] "in theory you should be <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> enemies, defusing bombs, and saving hostages. In practice, however, enemies turn around and attack even when you're <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them and defusing bombs requires no effort, so the suggestion of strategy is moot." [...] The size of the player character was also a subject of criticism {{because it does not}} allow players to properly see their immediate surroundings, prompting them to accidentally alert nearby enemies. Although the different mini-games were highlighted, reviewers felt that they were clearly imitative of games like Spy Hunter and Operation Wolf.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-crowned {{night heron}} may forage {{any time of the}} day and night, {{although}} it prefers the night to feed the young. It becomes very aggressive if another individual approaches when foraging, but will tolerate a safe distance of about ten meters. It selects prey visually, either stalking it or standing and waiting for it to come within reach. When hunting crayfish, the heron stands at the entrance of the burrow, always facing the sun so its shadow is not cast over the entrance of the burrow, which would alert the crawfish. It can also chose an alternate pattern of walking slowly towards prey with its body bent and its head retracted, then standing and waiting before walking slowly again, <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> effectively <b>on</b> unsuspecting crabs. Sometimes it can be seen running in shallow water after a prey, but it will not follow one in deep water.|$|R
50|$|Back in Africa, Thoren takes Liane {{with him}} and Jacqueline. When Liane's tribesman friend Tanga (Jean Pierre Faye) and Simba show up, he ends <b>up</b> <b>sneaking</b> <b>on</b> the ship. While Liane, Thoren, and Jacqueline are playing cards, Tanga catches up with them and they end up taking him and the lion cub with them. When the ship arrives in Germany, the press swarm over Liana until Thoren sends then off.|$|R
5000|$|Nothosaurus was a semi-oceanic animal which {{probably}} had a lifestyle {{similar to that of}} today's seals. It was about 4 m, with long, webbed toes and possibly a fin on its tail. However, some species such as N. zhangi and N. giganteus were larger, up to 5-7 m. When swimming, Nothosaurus would use its tail, legs, and webbed feet to propel and steer it through the water. The skull was broad and flat, with long jaws, lined with needle teeth, it probably caught fish and other marine creatures. Nothosaurus hunted by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> slowly <b>on</b> prey, such as shoals of small fish, then putting on a last-minute burst of speed. Trackways attributed, partly by process of elimination, to a nothosaur, that were reported from Yunnan, China in June 2014, were interpreted as the paddle impressions left as the animals dug into soft seabed with rowing motions of their paddles, churning up hidden benthic creatures that they snapped up. Once caught, few animals would be able to shake themselves free from the mouth of Nothosaurus.|$|R
500|$|Cow tipping is {{the purported}} {{activity}} of <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping {{is generally considered}} an urban legend, and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment {{due to lack of}} other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened. They lie down to sleep deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.|$|E
500|$|A line {{in which}} Dwight tells Andy that Angela [...] "certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking" [...] was improvised by Wilson. Much of the {{dialogue}} between Andy and Dwight during the duel scene was also improvised. It was writer Paul Lieberstein, who served as show runner along with Celotta at the time, who suggested the idea of Andy <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Dwight with his Toyota Prius. The original script called for the entire office cast {{to come down to}} the parking lot from the Dunder Mifflin office to try to stop Dwight and Andy from fighting. However, the staging proved awkward during filming, so John Krasinski suggested that only Jim go down to the parking lot while the others stayed behind, and the change was eventually incorporated into the episode.|$|E
500|$|Dark Angel is a single-player beat 'em up {{game played}} {{from a third}} person view. Players take control of Max Guevara, a genetically-enhanced super soldier. [...] Levels involve {{fighting}} enemies while following a fairly straightforward path to the level's exit. Max attacks enemies using various punches, kicks and throws, and can also utilize the environment to perform actions, such as kickflipping off a wall then attacking an enemy from behind. She can also perform moves like back flips and side twirls to evade enemies. Occasionally Max may have {{to interact with the}} environment to advance past a point, such as placing an explosive on a door, though what is required to progress through the level is clearly highlighted to the player. Max receives communications from Logan Cale, who offers his advice on how she may reach objectives. The game also presents 'stealth mode' sequences during some levels. In stealth mode, Max can distract enemies by making noise or perform stealth kills by <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them. If Max is spotted during stealth mode, a timer is activated and additional enemies begin to appear. If she has not reached the exit or killed the enemies when the timer has run out, the level must be restarted. Boss enemies are present in some levels.|$|E

500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
2500|$|To {{find out}} who wants her dead, Carrie goes off her medication, {{claiming}} that her manic phases make her mind sharper. She and Jonas get into an argument when he finds out how many drone strikes she ordered while at the CIA, and he storms out. Soon after, he learns that Quinn kidnapped his son and then released him as a ploy to draw Carrie out. The following night, Carrie finds Quinn <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Jonas' house and shoots him in the back. Quinn was wearing body armor, however, and incapacitates her. Quinn tells her that Saul gave him an order to kill her. They stage a crime scene and take photos to fake Carrie's death, and Carrie prepares to go into hiding. Before she does, she insists on scouting the post office where Quinn gets his assignments in order to confirm whether it really was Saul who wanted her killed. After Quinn drops off his [...] "proof" [...] of Carrie's death in the P.O. box, a hitman arrives, targeting Quinn, and a gunfight ensues in which Quinn is wounded. Carrie leaves Quinn with Jonas, and goes to investigate. She learns that the hitman worked for Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and realizes that Russia wants CIA intelligence that had recently been stolen by hackers.|$|E
2500|$|Later that day, lookouts {{aboard the}} raider spotted a {{merchant}} ship sailing without lights. <b>Sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the vessel, Kormoran opened fire; her first salvo missed, but within minutes, {{the target was}} heavily damaged and aflame. The ship transmitted a distress signal, which Kormoran was unable to jam completely, but this ceased as crew members started to abandon ship. The raider stopped firing, but resumed when the merchantman attempted another transmission, and shore stations responded. Communications intercepts and the code books taken from Afric Star earlier that day revealed the target's identity: the 5,273-ton British freighter Eurolychus, with a cargo of bombers for the Gold Coast (now Ghana). These intercepts also indicated that several parties, including the British Air Ministry, {{were aware of the}} attack, prompting Detmers to order the torpedoing of Eurolychus. This was accomplished with a single torpedo, sinking the British ship and her cargo at , {{three and a half hours}} after Afric Star. 39 Chinese and four British crew were recovered by the German raider before she fled the area with British warships [...] and [...] in pursuit. Another 28 survivors were found by the Spanish merchant ship Monte Tiede later that night, with 10 men killed during the attack or lost at sea. Eurolychus master was among those rescued by the Allies, and recounted that two ships had attacked, one of them armed with [...] guns, which led British Naval Intelligence to conclude that the responsible ships were Thor and Admiral Scheer, or an unknown raider operating in concert with one of these. Among the rescued was ship's gunner Frank Laskier who, on returning to England, was interviewed by BBC radio and proved so popular he became a figurehead for Merchant Navy enlistment propaganda for the rest of the war.|$|E

6000|$|Ted and Verona {{went to a}} dance after dinner. Even {{the maid}} was out. Rarely had Babbitt been {{alone in the house}} for an entire evening. He was restless. He vaguely wanted {{something}} more diverting than the newspaper comic strips to read. He ambled up to Verona's room, sat on her maidenly blue and white bed, humming and grunting in a solid-citizen manner as he examined her books: Conrad's [...] "Rescue," [...] a volume strangely named [...] "Figures of Earth," [...] poetry (quite irregular poetry, Babbitt thought) by Vachel Lindsay, and essays by H. L. Mencken--highly improper essays, making fun of the church and all the decencies. He liked none of the books. In them he felt a spirit of rebellion against niceness and solid-citizenship. These authors--and he supposed they were famous ones, too--did not seem to care about telling a good story which would enable a fellow to forget his troubles. He sighed. He noted a book, [...] "The Three Black Pennies," [...] by Joseph Hergesheimer. Ah, that was something like it! It would be an adventure story, maybe about counterfeiting--detectives <b>sneaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the old house at night. He tucked the book under his arm, he clumped down-stairs and solemnly began to read, under the piano-lamp: ...|$|E
