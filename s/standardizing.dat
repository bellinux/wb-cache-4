5|$|IUPAC is {{best known}} for its works <b>standardizing</b> {{nomenclature}} in chemistry and other fields of science, but IUPAC has publications in many fields including chemistry, biology and physics. Some important work IUPAC has done in these fields includes <b>standardizing</b> nucleotide base sequence code names; publishing books for environmental scientists, chemists, and physicists; and improving education in science. IUPAC is also known for <b>standardizing</b> the atomic weights of the elements through one of its oldest standing committees, the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW).|$|E

5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests with the intention of <b>standardizing</b> a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E

40|$|Detection of outlier {{based on}} <b>standardized</b> Pearson {{residuals}} has gained widespread use in logistic regression {{model in the}} presence of a single outlier. An innovation attempts in the same direction but dealing for a group of outliers have been made using generalized <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual which requires a graphical or a robust estimator to find suspected outliers to form a group deletion. In this study, an alternative measure namely modified <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual is derived from the robust logistic diagnostic. The weakness of <b>standardized</b> Pearson residuals and the usefulness of generalized <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual and modified <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual are examined through several real examples and Monte Carlo simulation study. The results of this study signify that the generalized <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual and the modified <b>standardized</b> Pearson residual perform equally good in identifying a group of outliers...|$|R
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{regulated}} {{commerce and}} the economy by creating official markets (tsena) and <b>standardizing</b> market scales (fandanjana) and other units of measurement, including length and volume. King Andrianampoinimerina established the first marketplace in Antananarivo on the grounds today occupied by the Analakely market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s. Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (Zoma) as market day, when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols. This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley, forming {{what has been called}} the largest open air marketplace in the world. Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever-growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997. Prosperity for the masses in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina's reign, leading to growth in population density.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include <b>standardizing</b> nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, Boeing {{announced}} a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was {{officially launched on}} July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity {{was too close to}} the 757's seating, while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of <b>standardizing</b> around the twinjet configuration.|$|E

40|$|This {{critique}} of <b>standardized</b> tests begins {{by placing the}} use of such tests within a social context. It then addresses the matter of <b>standardized</b> testing in theory and practice in relation to teaching. The substance of <b>standardized</b> examinations, their common content, and the things they do not test are also explored. The relationship of good teaching to history and the corollary of research and teaching to defeat irrational thinking are considered. The paper also addresses what students and parents can do when they are confronted with <b>standardized</b> testing. <b>Standardized</b> tests are characterized by "intellectual bias, irrationalism, racism, fatuous anticommunism, witless patriotism, the worship of capital, the fear of sexuality, and the justification of the way things are. " Subservience, powerlessness, and alienation are the consequences of <b>standardized</b> tests. Many important truths for educators and students are not represented on <b>standardized</b> tests. There is no <b>standardized</b> pathway to wisdom, nor to democracy, and good teaching is not enhanced by <b>standardized</b> testing. Good teaching must be aligned with the quest for social justice, and <b>standardized</b> testing promotes neither. (Contains 21 references.)

5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and <b>standardizing</b> Lingbao ritual. This organization of texts and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, British Airways, Iberia, and Icelandair {{were the}} 757's largest {{mainline}} customers, while other carriers such as Lufthansa rejected the type as {{too large for}} their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including Air 2000, Air Holland, and LTU International, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer Japan Airlines, and the first Asian customer, Singapore Airlines, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of <b>standardizing</b> on the 240-seat wide-body Airbus A310, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as China Southern, China Southwest, Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, and Xinjiang Airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.|$|E
5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the <b>standardizing</b> influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E

SPI and SEI were calculated on the assumption that empirical monthly precipitation sums and monthly sums of reference evapotraspiration, obtained from Wrocław-Swojec data, are gamma distributed. Since monthly sums of climatic water balance for analogous data are normally distributed, CWB required standardization to SCWB.

25|$|<b>Standardized</b> {{testing has}} been a part of American {{education}} since the 1800s, but the widespread reliance on <b>standardized</b> is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. For instance the College Entrance Examination Board did not begin <b>standardized</b> testing in connection to higher education until 1900. This test was implemented with the idea of creating <b>standardized</b> admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to <b>standardize</b> curriculum.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this mixed-methods {{retrospective}} {{study was to examine}} the effectiveness of a training intervention for <b>standardized</b> patients to improve their verbal feedback to medical students. Although feedback is acknowledged as important for medical student development, actual interventions to improve effective feedback to medical students are scarce in the literature.; In the 2006 - 2007 academic year, the <b>Standardized</b> Patient Program at the Keck School initiated a revised training protocol for <b>standardized</b> patients playing patient cases in the Year I and Year II Introduction to Clinical Medicine interviewing workshops. Assessment instruments consisted of a <b>Standardized</b> Patient Training Satisfaction Questionnaire, a Faculty Workshop Feedback Form, student online evaluations of the workshops, and a Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Patient Feedback form. The <b>Standardized</b> Patient Training Satisfaction Questionnaire measured the knowledge, skills and confidence of the <b>standardized</b> patients in providing verbal feedback. The Faculty Workshop Feedback Form assessed whether the <b>standardized</b> patients followed the seven steps for providing verbal feedback as taught in the intervention. The student online evaluations determined if the post-intervention <b>standardized</b> patient feedback was more useful than the pre-intervention feedback. The Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Feedback form was utilized by two independent raters to score the feedback given to the medical students from video review of the workshops.; Descriptive statistics from the <b>Standardized</b> Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Faculty Workshop Feedback Form and student online evaluations indicated <b>standardized</b> patients provided effective verbal feedback post-intervention. However, direct observation by two independent raters of videos of workshop feedback revealed that <b>standardized</b> patients often omitted feedback steps.; The main conclusion reached was that although three of the four assessment instruments indicated the <b>standardized</b> patients provided quality feedback, it cannot be determined conclusively if the improved feedback was the effect of the feedback intervention in the revised training protocol. Direct observations of the independent raters must be considered as the <b>standardized</b> patients had less than satisfactory scores on the Quality of <b>Standardized</b> Patient Feedback form, indicating a lower quality of feedback. Further research with psychometrically sound instruments is needed to delineate variables contributing to the knowledge and skills of SPs as they learn to provide quality verbal feedback...|$|R
