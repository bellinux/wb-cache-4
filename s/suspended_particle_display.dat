This technology {{is based on}} analyzing and studying the transmission characteristics of the laser in the seawater. Based on Mie scattering theory, the optical scattering characteristics of oceanic <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> is researched, and a new method of calculating the scattering coefficient and backward scattering ratio is putted forward. By detecting the laser scattering signal under the seawater, the density information of ocean <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> can be gain and detect.

The RTI of a Newtonian viscous fluid overlying Walters B′ viscoelastic fluid containing <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> in porous medium has been studied by Kumar and Sharma [32]. Electro-hydrodynamic Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of two superposed Rivlin–Ericksen viscoelastic dielectric fluids containing <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> in a porous medium is considered by El-Sayed [33]. The effect of viscosity, finite ion Larmor radius and <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> on Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of two superposed incompressible fluids in the presence of a uniform magnetic field is considered by El-Sayed [34]. The stability of the plane interface separating two viscoelastic (Rivlin–Ericksen) superposed fluids in the presence of <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> are studied by Kumar and Singh [35].

Several {{studies have found that}} the demand for carbon by the mesopelagic community exceeds the sinking flux of particulate carbon by up to two to three orders of magnitude. This suggests that additional overlooked sources of carbon exist in the mesopelagic. <b>Suspended</b> <b>particles</b> have been suggested as one of these sources but little has been done to estimate their relative contribution to the mesopelagic food web. In this study, we investigate whether <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> are an important nutritional source in the mesopelagic using amino acid compound specific nitrogen isotope analysis. <b>Suspended</b> <b>particles</b> have distinct nitrogen isotope values in their source amino acids which can be traced through the food web.

The constructed wetland consists of unvegetated ponds and reed beds and receives treated municipal wastewater containing low concentrations of <b>suspended</b> <b>particles.</b> It was found that residence in the unvegetated ponds caused no major changes in particle concentration, but the organic content (53 - 33 %) and average size (4. 3 - 3. 7 μm) of the <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> did decrease, caused by sedimentation of large organic particles and addition of smaller inorganic particles most likely resulting from shore erosion. The bacterial species originating from the wastewater treatment plant (quantified by indicator organisms) decreased strongly in abundance (> 90 % reduction), especially during residence in the reed beds. Simultaneously the total abundance of bacteria gradually increased, indicating the replacement of the bacterial species present in the treated wastewater with other species during residence in the constructed wetland.

The capacity of CWs to reduce nutrients, pathogens and organic matter and restore oxygen regime under normal operating conditions cannot be extrapolated to periods of incidental peak discharges.

By applying normal mode analysis method, the dispersion relation has been derived and solved analytically. It is observed that the rotation, stable solute gradient, <b>suspended</b> <b>particles,</b> gravity field and viscoelasticity introduce oscillatory modes. For stationary convection, {{it is observed that}} the rotation, stable solute gradient have stabilizing effect and <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> have destabilizing effect on the system whereas Darcy number and medium permeability have stabilizing/destabilizing effects under certain conditions. The effects of rotation, stable solute gradient, <b>suspended</b> <b>particles,</b> Darcy number and medium permeability have also been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Existence {{of natural}} {{succession}} area at Modified Ajkwa Deposition Area (Mod-ADA) {{closely related to}} sedimentation process happened. Data of <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> in Mod-ADA on April 2009 indicating that particle is precipitated follows particle size. The biggest <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> tends to precipitate in advance. <b>Particle</b> value <b>suspended</b> in water is calculated to apply method APHA (2005) and done in laboratory TRMP PT Freeport Indonesia. Picture as of <b>particle</b> swampy forest <b>suspended</b> at area Mod-ADA projected in data Landsat Acquitation 2007, 2008, and 2009. <b>Suspended</b> <b>particle</b> data analysis in 2007 indicating that distribution of large <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> sized (> 600 mg/l) in upstream ModADA followed by precipitation of smaller fairish particle (300 - 600 mg/i and 50 - 300 mg/ 1) in centered and 0 - 50 mg/I in estuary area. Distribution of <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> shows the same pattern in the 2008 and 2009 that is the large of particle suspension tends to precipitate in centered of Mod-ADA. Kinetics of rainwater and surface current of influential to sedimentation in river body. Sedimentation process causes changing of river stream pattern. Change of river stream pattern in ModADA depicted in Landsat Accusation 1991, 1999, and 2008. Result of image analysis to <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> swampy forest to indicate that smooth and small fairish particle tends to precipitate in part of downstream Mod-ADA especially in gabion area. Deceleration of current in gabion detains <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> stream so that particle to tends to sedimentation. Suspended sediment characteristic and material contained by it to stand to form sedimentation area which can be growed vegetation. Sediment characteristic like this found at Double Levee {{which is part of}} area Mod-ADA and grows as natural succession area. Based on analysis result this has been done able to be predicted that sedimentation process formed in Mod-ADA can be exploited and managed as area growing of natural vegetation. Condensed of particle is dissolved entering Mod-ADA, high water debit and climate influence causes sediment area formed cannot be exploited carefully as place of growing of vegetation, causing natural succession process doesn't take place in area Mod-ADA...|$|R
