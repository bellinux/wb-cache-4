500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's {{why it was so}} hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

2500|$|Forced {{to choose}} between the two in a 2008 interview, Brazelton claimed that the writing in his comics was more {{important}} than the art; [...] "You can try to dazzle people [...] all you like and some people will fall for it. [...] But most people <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> the deception." [...] Conceding his writing as the weakest point of Theater Hopper in 2006, Brazelton noted his tendency to be overly verbose, and how it was detrimental to his four-panel formatting and a difficult obstacle to overcome.|$|E

2500|$|Goblins are reptilian fairies, often {{described}} as upright, raptor like creatures (minus the claws and feathers). They are quite stupid as they have brains the size of rats, but they can still talk and (to a certain extent) work machinery like lasers and sometimes even computers. They {{have the ability to}} create fireballs in their hands, or shoot them through their nostrils (sometimes by inhaling fireballs created in their own hands). Groups of goblins are involved in an ongoing turf war with groups of dwarves. They make their clothing from their own shed skin. In Book 3, Holly describes goblins as [...] "Evolution's little joke", with the reasoning, [...] "pick the dumbest creatures on the planet, and give them the ability to conjure fire". Notable goblins include General Scalene who was killed along with Julius Root in book 4, also a general in the goblin revolution and public enemy No.2 [...] (after Opal Koboi). [...] Also there are Generals Sputa and Phlebum, leaders of the triad, and captain (now lieutenant after killing D'Nall and Aymon) [...] Nyle, a young, cocky goblin captain also enlisted in the goblin revolution. Another notable goblin is Lieutenant Poll. He was the leader of the goblin hit squad who nearly killed Root and Butler in book 2. After straying too close to an avalanche to inspect the [...] "bodies" [...] of Butler and Root, a one-ton pane of ice put [...] "some big hole in Lieutenant Poll. I could <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> 'im. An' I don't mean that like he was a bad liar." [...] in the words of Aymon.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a version}} of Good Game aimed at spawnlings (younger gamers), though Bajo and Hex have {{stressed}} {{in the past that}} the show is for gamers of all ages. The show is hosted by Bajo, Hex, and a robot named DARREN. Part of the reason for its creation is because [...] "some of the content in the games isn't necessarily appropriate for a younger player". MolksTVTalk1 explains that the show is one of a few on TV that doesn't dumb it down for kids, and is genuinely enjoyable content for all ages. Hex said that they made a conscious effort not to be condescending as the younger gamers <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> it and get offended by it, and that they are game-savvy anyway. For this reason, only a few minor differences needed to be made, for the format's transition to a younger audience. Bajo explained that it was Janet Carr's idea to do a kids show, and the team was like [...] "yeah, of course we have to". The audience interactivity spreads to Good Game: Spawn Point as well. One of the segments introduced in this spin-off is Ask Good Game, where the hosts answer gaming questions by the viewers. Bajo said [...] "we get something like 3 emails a minute from kids", and Hex said [...] "the letters and mail we get from kids are awesome". Janet Carr said around 50% of Spawn Point's audience are female, and MolksTVTalk1 said the show has given many young female gamers a role model in Hex. Many questions were asked regarding Minecraft that the team put a special F.A.Q. related to the game on the GG: SP website. The show started in 2009, the same year that Hex joined the Good Game team.|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca Sharp, called Becky, is Amelia's opposite, an {{intelligent}} {{young woman with}} a gift for satire. She is described as a short sandy haired girl who has green eyes {{and a great deal of}} wit. Fluent in both French and English, Becky has a beautiful singing voice, plays the piano, and shows great talent as an actress. Without a mother to guide her into marriage, Becky resolves that [...] "I must be my own Mamma". She thereafter appears to be completely amoral and without conscience and has been called the work's [...] "anti-heroine". She does not seem to have the ability to get attached to other people, and lies easily and intelligently to get her way. She is extremely manipulative and, after the first few chapters and her failure to attract Jos Sedley, is not shown as being particularly sincere. Never having known financial or social security even as a child, Becky desires it above all things. Nearly everything she does is with the intention of securing a stable position for herself, or herself and her husband after she and Rawdon are married. She advances Rawdon's interests tirelessly, flirting with men such as General Tufto and the Marquis of Steyne to get him promoted. She also uses her feminine wiles to distract men at card parties while Rawdon cheats them blind. Marrying Rawdon Crawley in secret was a mistake, as was running off instead of begging Miss Crawley's forgiveness. She also fails to manipulate Miss Crawley through Rawdon so as to obtain an inheritance. Although Becky manipulates men very easily, she does not even try to cultivate the friendship of most women. She is utterly hostile to Lady Bareacres and Lady Jane, the Dobbin sisters, and Lady Steyne <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> her. Amelia and (initially) Miss Crawley are exceptions to the rule.|$|E

She is emotionally torn by her relationship with Yoshinori and to a certain extent has become emotionally needful of him.|$|R

Niki Harris, the schoolmarm and Jessica's understudy, steps forward and says she would feel terrible taking over, but Belling {{goes on to say that}} he is {{actually}} casting Georgia as Madame Marian. Bambi, the show's featured dancer, steps forward and says that Niki should get the role, but Belling <b>sees</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> her: Bambi is Niki's understudy, meaning if Niki got the lead, she'd get to play Miss Nancy. Georgia is cast, in spite of Aaron's disapproval.|$|R

6000|$|The {{sound of}} that word on his own lips made him pause, confused, like an {{unexpected}} and unanswerable rebuke. The anger of his outraged pride, the anger of his outraged heart, had gone out in the blow; and there remained nothing but the sense of some immense infamy--of something vague, disgusting and terrible, which seemed to surround him on all sides, hover about him with shadowy and stealthy movements, like a band of assassins {{in the darkness of}} vast and unsafe places. Was there, under heaven, such a thing as justice? He looked at the man before him with such an intensity of prolonged glance that he seemed to <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> him, that at last he saw but a floating and unsteady mist in human shape.

There, I started with my mind quite made up that orders was to be obeyed, and that your mother was to be kept in the dark about it till she got here; and I had considered with myself that in such a case as this it would be no great weight upon my conscience if I had to make up some kind of a yarn that would satisfy her; and yet in three minutes after she got me into that cabin she was at the bottom of it all." ...|$|E
60|$|All at once Ellen {{felt cold}} shivers steal over her. Isbel's {{piercing}} gaze was directed straight at her hiding place. Her heart stopped beating. If he discovered her there {{she felt that}} she would die of shame. Then she became aware that a blue jay was screeching in a pine above her, and a red squirrel somewhere near was chattering his shrill annoyance. These two denizens of the woods could be depended upon to espy the wariest hunter and make known his presence to their kind. Ellen had a moment of more than dread. This keen-eyed, keen-eared Indian might <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> her brushy covert, might hear the throbbing of her heart. It relieved her immeasurably to see him turn away and take to pacing the promontory, with his head bowed and his hands behind his back. He had stopped looking off into the forest. Presently he wheeled to the west, and by the light upon his face Ellen saw that the time was near sunset. Turkeys were beginning to gobble back on the ridge.|$|E

Chuck is an African-American, and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes. Mike and Chuck regularly exchange barbs as if they don't like each other.

Or, [...] say, 'I don't like you.'" [...] She added, [...] "But I've always thought that, deep inside, Tony loves Ziva and Ziva loves Tony, but she's almost ashamed of saying it because he's so stupid. In the best of ways.

6000|$|... "It puzzled her, I could see. She {{called the}} man she had been talking to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in French. His voice was very {{ordinary}} and quiet, but somehow, I don't know why, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he'd <b>seen</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> me, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, {{and then went on}} that there was something I MUST remember--MUST remember--only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more distressed.

6000|$|But {{even as he}} did so a {{gleam of}} light, like a faint moonbeam, stole out into the garden of his despair.

But if there be no such thing, I cannot exist to give it what it wants. What then is the reason of my existence? Am I but a windlestraw?" [...] And wearied out with his perplexity, he fell into a doze. And while he dozed he dreamed that he saw the figure of a woman standing in darkness, from whose face and form came a misty refulgence, such as steals out into the dusk from white campion flowers along summer hedgerows. She was holding her pale hands before her, wide apart, with the palms turned down, quivering as might doves about to settle; and for all it was so dark, her grey eyes were visible-full of light, with black rims round the irises. To gaze at those eyes was almost painful; for though they were beautiful, they seemed to <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> his soul, to pass him by, as though on a far discovering voyage, and forbidden to rest.|$|E
6000|$|Certainly it {{was with}} a spirit {{somewhat}} overshadowed that I turned away from the grave to the hardly less melancholy spectacle of the wreck. Her stem was above the first arc of the flood; she was broken in two a little abaft the foremast--though indeed she had none, both masts having broken short in her disaster; and as the pitch of the beach was very sharp and sudden, and the bows lay many feet below the stern, the fracture gaped widely open, and you could <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> her poor hull upon the farther side. Her name was much defaced, and I could not make out clearly whether she was called Christiania, after the Norwegian city, or Christiana, after the good woman, Christian's wife, in that old book the [...] "Pilgrim's Progress." [...] By her build she was a foreign ship, but I was not certain of her nationality. She had been painted green, but the colour was faded and weathered, and the paint peeling off in strips. The wreck of the mainmast lay alongside, half-buried in sand. She was a forlorn sight, indeed, and I could not look without emotion at the bits of rope that still hung about her, so often handled of yore by shouting seamen; or the little scuttle where they had passed up and down to their affairs; or that poor noseless angel of a figure-head that had dipped into so many running billows.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{in spite}} of all this my vaunted philosophy, I will frankly confess that more than once Eliza and Lucy sorely tried my patience, and that I was often a good deal better than half-minded in my soul to rush out in a feverish fit of moral indignation {{and put an end to}} their ghastly career of crime without waiting to hear what they had to say in their own favour, showing cause why {{sentence}} of death should not be executed upon them. And I would have done it, I believe, had it not been for that peculiar arrangement of the drawing-room windows, which made it impossible to get at the culprits direct, without going out into the garden and round the house; which, of course, is a severe strain in wet or windy weather to put upon anybody's moral enthusiasm. In the end, therefore, I always gave the evil-doers the benefit of the doubt; and I only mention my ethical scruples in the matter here lest scoffers should say, when they come to read what manner of things Lucy and Eliza did: 'Oh yes, that's just like those scientific folks; they're always so cold-blooded. He could stand by and see these poor helpless flies tortured slowly to death, without a chance for their lives, and never put out a helping hand to save them!' Well, I would only ask you one question, my sapient friend, who talk like that: Has it ever occurred to you that, if you kill one spider, you merely make room in the overflowing economy of nature for another to pick up a dishonest livelihood? Have you ever reflected that the prime blame of spiderhood rests with Nature herself (if we may venture to personify that impersonal entity); and that she has provided such a constant supply or relay of spiders as will amply suffice to fill up all the possible vacancies that can ever occur in insect-eating circles? Unless you have considered all these points carefully, and have an answer to give about them, you are not in a position to pronounce upon the subject, and you had better be referred for six months longer, as the medical examiners gracefully put it, to your ethical, psychological, and biological studies. The great point about the position in which Eliza and Lucy had placed themselves was simply this. They stood full against the light, so that we could <b>see</b> <b>right</b> <b>through</b> their translucent bodies, which were almost liquid to look upon, and beautifully dappled with dark spots on a grey ground in a very pretty and effective pattern. So favourable was the opportunity for observation, indeed, that we could clearly make out with the naked eye even the joints of their legs, the hairs on their tarsi--excuse the phrase--and the very shape of their cruel tigerlike claws, as they rushed forth upon their prey in a sort of carnivorous frenzy. At all hours of the day we could notice exactly what they were doing or suffering; and so familiar did we become with them individually and personally, that before the end of the season we recognized in detail all the differences of their characters almost as one might do with cats or dogs, and spoke of them by their Christian names like old and well-known acquaintances.|$|E
