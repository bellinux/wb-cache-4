5|$|Bevin {{issued the}} first {{executive}} orders {{of his administration}} on December 22, 2015. Among the issues addressed were removing the names of county clerks from state marriage licenses, and reversing orders by Beshear that restored voting rights for non-violent felons who had completed their sentences and raised the minimum wage for <b>some</b> <b>state</b> workers to $10.10 per hour.|$|E
5|$|The dates given are, where possible, the {{earliest}} date that the motto {{was used in}} an official sense. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> mottos are not official but are on the official state seal; in these cases the adoption date of the seal is given. The earliest use of a current motto is that of Puerto Rico, Johannes est nomen ejus, granted to the island by the Spanish in 1511.|$|E
5|$|The {{state governments}} are {{structured}} in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature. The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> judges and cabinet officers are {{appointed by the}} governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.|$|E
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> require homeschool {{students}} to be enrolled in public schools. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> allow homeschool {{students to}} enroll in public schools but do not require them to do so. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> prohibit homeschool students from enrolling in public schools.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{disclosure}} requirements vary between <b>states.</b> In <b>some</b> <b>states</b> brokers must disclose a range, typically 0%-2% {{of the loan}} amount, but not the exact amount. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> simply require that a warning is appended. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> require the broker to disclose an estimated dollar amount, such as $2,500.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws {{approved}} the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) to replace URESA. Since 1992, UIFSA has been enacted by all states; while <b>some</b> <b>states</b> completely repealed URESA, <b>some</b> <b>states</b> retained aspects of URESA, and <b>some</b> <b>states</b> retained the entire URESA.|$|R
5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> newspapers charged that Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering a run for president. Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her Jewish courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which offered <b>some</b> <b>state</b> protection to her Jewish subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of Jewish children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting surplice fees from her Jewish subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E
50|$|School trusts are MEWAs, but <b>some</b> <b>states</b> impose {{slightly}} different requirements upon MEWAs established solely {{by a group}} of public schools. It is unclear whether <b>some</b> <b>states</b> treat these particular MEWAs differently due to the government funding of the schools or the public interest served, but <b>some</b> <b>states</b> have lowered the enforcement or standards or other requirements for these MEWAs.|$|R
50|$|In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> {{state health}} {{departments}} may additionally {{be responsible for}} social services and welfare, environmental protection/pollution control, or {{the operation of the}} <b>state</b> psychiatric hospital. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> have a Surgeon General.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> were [...] "dry" [...] {{well before}} {{national}} Prohibition was enacted in 1919, {{in some cases}} since achieving statehood. Also, <b>some</b> <b>states</b> did not become fully [...] "wet" [...] until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 (e.g. Mississippi in 1966). Since 1966, all states and territories of the USA have been [...] "wet", but dry counties and towns still exist in <b>some</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
5|$|On May 10 Daniels {{signed into}} law two {{immigration}} bills; one denying in-state tuition prices to illegal immigrants and another creating fines for employers that employed illegal immigrants. Several protestors, at least five of whom were illegal immigrants, were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when they broke into Daniels' office after being denied a meeting. Student leaders called for their release, while <b>some</b> <b>state</b> legislators called for their deportation.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul is {{the capital}} of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, {{designed}} by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for <b>some</b> <b>state</b> functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.|$|E
5|$|Since then, under Strache's leadership, {{the party}} has again {{attracted}} an increase in its popular support. In the 2013 legislative election the FPÖ won 20.5% of the vote and, more recently, it came ahead either of the SPÖ or the ÖVP in <b>some</b> <b>state</b> elections, entered in a SPÖ-led government in Burgenland and gained more than 30% {{of the vote in}} Vienna. Finally, in the 2016 presidential election, FPÖ member Norbert Hofer won the first round, receiving 35.1%, but was defeated by The Greens' candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, 53.8% against 46.2%, in the final run-off (an earlier run-off was invalidated).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> {{require a}} {{specific}} form to be used. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> also allow a grantor (or seller) to add warranties. In such case, {{it may be}} called a bargain and sale with covenants deed.|$|R
50|$|Licensing and {{certification}} for caregiving can vary by <b>state.</b> In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> the only licensing needed {{is by the}} company that employs the caregivers (unless {{it is from the}} state). In other states, an online certification course is recommended. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> require in-classroom certification, and others require personal care licensing, which can be applied for online. Along with that, in <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> further certifications are required such as CPR training and first aid training.|$|R
50|$|In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> sex between first cousins is {{prohibited}} (see cousin marriage {{law in the}} United States by state for cousin sex, as well as cousin marriage, being outlawed in <b>some</b> <b>states).</b> Many states also apply incest laws to non-blood relations, including stepparents, stepsiblings, in-laws and people related through adoption.|$|R
5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of <b>some</b> <b>state</b> horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian {{government}} aims {{to balance}} economic growth with environmental protection, {{but has been}} accused of favouring big business over the environment. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation; and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10percent each year. 28 national parks have been established; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular. Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of <b>some</b> <b>state</b> assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E
50|$|In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> such as Ohio, state {{constitutional}} officers {{play a major}} role in redistricting. In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> including North Carolina, the statewide elected officials are not a part of the cabinet, which is instead composed of gubernatorial appointees.|$|R
50|$|Marriage between first cousins {{is illegal}} in most states. However, {{it is legal}} in <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> the District of Columbia and <b>some</b> territories. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> have <b>some</b> {{restrictions}} or exceptions for first cousin marriages and/or recognize such marriages performed out-of-state.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> require and <b>some</b> <b>states</b> permit parent/subsidiary {{controlled}} {{groups of}} corporations to file returns on a consolidated or combined basis. California and Illinois require that all U.S. members of a [...] "unitary" [...] group must file a combined return.|$|R
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was then}} the second largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's main source of income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently chrome and asbestos. Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of chrome for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer of asbestos after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes of asbestos a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of chrome. Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also set up <b>some</b> <b>state</b> industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E
25|$|There {{also were}} state-chartered S that failed. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> {{insurance}} funds failed, requiring state taxpayer bailouts.|$|E
25|$|While <b>some</b> <b>state</b> {{statutes}} {{specify the}} drugs required, a majority do not, giving more flexibility to corrections officials.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>some</b> <b>states</b> opt to {{pass their}} own {{legislation}} allowing in-state tuition for undocumented students, it {{does not fully}} bridge the gap for financial aid. <b>Some</b> <b>states,</b> like Georgia, have worked against education for undocumented students by forbidding enrollment in some colleges.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> require {{continuing}} education.|$|R
50|$|State law {{and state}} constitutions, {{controlled}} by state legislatures regulate elections at state level and local level. Various officials at state level are elected. Since {{the separation of}} powers applies to states as well as the federal government, state legislatures and the executive (the governor) are elected separately. Governors and lieutenant governor are elected in all <b>states,</b> in <b>some</b> <b>states</b> on a joint ticket and in <b>some</b> <b>states</b> separately, <b>some</b> separately in different electoral cycles. The governors of the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands are also elected. In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> executive positions such as Attorney General and Secretary of State are also elected offices. All members of state legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislatures are elected. In <b>some</b> <b>states,</b> members of the state supreme court {{and other members of the}} state judiciary are elected. Proposals to amend the state constitution are also placed on the ballot in <b>some</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
25|$|Multiple {{corporations}} may file a consolidated {{return at}} the federal and <b>some</b> <b>state</b> levels with their common parent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>state</b> that {{cephalosporins}} can {{be divided}} into five or even six generations, although the usefulness of this organization system is of limited clinical relevance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{religious}} conversion from and to Hinduism {{has been a}} controversial subject. <b>Some</b> <b>state</b> the concept of missionary conversion, either way, is anathema to the precepts of Hinduism.|$|E
5000|$|Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria (death {{penalty in}} <b>some</b> <b>states),</b> Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia (death penalty in <b>some</b> <b>states),</b> South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe ...|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the courts}} will seldom apply {{principles}} of fault, but might willingly hold a party liable for {{a breach of}} a fiduciary duty {{to his or her}} spouse (for example, see Family Code Sections 720 and 1100 of the California Family Code). Grounds for divorce differs from state to state in the U.S. <b>Some</b> <b>states</b> have no-fault divorce; <b>some</b> <b>states</b> require a declaration of fault on the part of one partner or both; <b>some</b> <b>states</b> allow either method.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>states</b> {{prohibit}} the delivery or serving of documents on Sundays, holidays, and/or election days (dies non juridicum). However, <b>some</b> <b>states</b> {{will allow the}} service of documents under special circumstances. One such circumstance is when the service of process is pursuant to a court order.|$|R
