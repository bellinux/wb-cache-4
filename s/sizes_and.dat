40|$|Simulation {{modelling}} is {{the business}} of reducing complexity of the real world. Keep your models small and simple, is the basic heuristic found in simulation & modelling literature; yet the modellers are developing models of increasing <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity. Simulation model <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity is generally a less debated and poorly understood area. Despite the importance of model simplification and its relation with <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity; {{only a handful of}} papers, addressing the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity of simulation models, can be found. This paper reports on general concepts of simulation model <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity held by expert modellers and proposes a framework to understand the origins of simulation model <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity. <b>Size</b> <b>and</b> complexity are two most important contextual factors that may affect simulation practice. Increased understanding of concepts of simulation model <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity held by the modellers will potentially underpin simulation methodology research and help us in addressing the issues raised by increasing <b>size</b> <b>and</b> complexity of simulation models.

30|$|Panel A of Table  8 {{shows the}} {{coefficients}} on ASY for different saturated versions of model (1), {{where we have}} included polynomials on <b>SIZE</b> <b>and</b> Age. Since these coefficients are quite stable from the simplest models to the more saturated models on <b>size</b> <b>and</b> age, {{these findings suggest that}} ASY contains information beyond <b>SIZE</b> <b>and</b> Age that is relevant for capital structure. In addition, we have performed two other tests. First, we have orthogonalised <b>SIZE</b> <b>and</b> ASY, by regressing ASY on <b>SIZE,</b> <b>and</b> taking the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by SIZE (r_ASY). Second, we have regressed ASY on <b>SIZE</b> <b>and</b> Age, and we have taken the residuals as the part of ASY which is not explained by <b>SIZE</b> <b>and</b> Age (z_ASY). Then, we include r_ASY or z_ASY in the original model with <b>size</b> or <b>size</b> <b>and</b> age controls, respectively, instead of our original ASY variable. The results, as shown in the Panel B of Table  8, are also significant and the coefficients on r_ASY or z_ASY are very stable. Overall, all these findings suggest that the effect of ASY on firm’s debt financing decisions is not caused by firm <b>size</b> <b>and</b> age.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMice and rats, {{two species}} of rodents, show some dental {{similarities}} such as tooth number and cusp number, and differences such as tooth <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp <b>size.</b> In this study, the tooth size, tooth number, cusp <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp number, which are four major factors of the tooth patterning, were investigated by the heterospecific recombinations of tissues from the molar tooth germs of mice and rats. Our {{results suggest that the}} dental epithelium and mesenchyme determine the cusp <b>size</b> <b>and</b> tooth <b>size</b> respectively <b>and</b> the cusp number is co-regulated by the tooth <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp <b>size.</b> It is also suggested that the mesenchymal cell number regulates not the tooth size but the tooth number. The relationships among these factors in tooth patterning including micropatterning (cusp <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp number) <b>and</b> macropatterning (tooth <b>size</b> <b>and</b> tooth number) were analyzed in a reaction diffusion mechanism. Key molecules determining the patterning of teeth remains to be elucidated for controlling the tooth <b>size</b> <b>and</b> cusp <b>size</b> of bioengineered tooth...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{variation}} along altitudinal gradients {{can promote}} life-history trait differentiation in ectothermic animals. Life-history theory predicts that increased environmental stress {{results in a}} shift in reproductive allocation from offspring quantity to quality and a stronger trade-off between egg <b>size</b> <b>and</b> clutch <b>size.</b> To test this prediction, we investigated patterns of variation in life-history traits (i. e. age, body <b>size,</b> clutch <b>size</b> <b>and</b> egg <b>size)</b> among four populations of Bufo andrewsi from Baoxing County, western China, at different altitudes. We found that body size, age, egg <b>size</b> <b>and</b> total reproductive output, but not clutch size, differed between populations. Clutch <b>size</b> <b>and</b> total reproductive output increased with female <b>size</b> <b>and</b> age. However, egg size decreased with female <b>size</b> <b>and</b> did not change with female age. The egg <b>size</b> <b>and</b> clutch <b>size</b> trade-off was evident for all populations except at lowest altitude, {{and the strength of}} trade-off between egg <b>size</b> <b>and</b> clutch <b>size</b> increased with altitude. Our findings suggest that environmental constraints at high altitude select for investment in larger eggs at a cost of offspring number...|$|R
