I tried twice to go and see her. But I do not think I need tell you, little son, of these self-inflicted humiliations and degradations. An angry man is none the less a pitiful man because he is injurious.

However, {{it has been suggested}} that Achilles speaks only to Phoenix and Ajax, ignoring Odysseus, to whose guile he bears a considerable dislike. [...] "I hate like the gates of Hades the man who says one thing and holds another in his heart."Phoenix also makes a cameo in Virgil's Aeneid.

Also, Sarah had to raise Sheila’s children because Sheila was always so obsessed with Lauren that she wasn’t around to raise her kids properly." [...] In 2012, Lauren and Michael's son Fenmore (Max Ehrich) began acting out, and developed a [...] "bad side". Bregman explained that Lauren and Michael had [...] "no role models" [...] because, [...] "Lauren’s father died early on, and she had a horrible mother", which could be the reasoning behind Fen's behavior.|$|R
