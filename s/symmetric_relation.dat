25|$|In mathematics, an {{equivalence}} relation is a binary relation {{that is at}} the same time a reflexive relation, a <b>symmetric</b> <b>relation</b> and a transitive relation.

25|$|The Rado graph {{may also}} be formed by a {{construction}} resembling that for Paley graphs. Take as the vertices of a graph all the prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 4, and connect two vertices by an edge whenever {{one of the two}} numbers is a quadratic residue modulo the other (by quadratic reciprocity and the restriction of the vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4, this is a <b>symmetric</b> <b>relation,</b> so it defines an undirected graph). Then, for any sets U and V, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the numbers that are quadratic resides modulo every prime in U and nonresidues modulo every prime in V form a periodic sequence, so by Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions this number-theoretic graph has the extension property.|$|E

2500|$|The {{meaning of}} such {{statements}} is as follows: for any functions which satisfy each O(...) {{on the left}} side, there are some functions satisfying each O(...) on the right side, such that substituting all these functions into the equation makes the two sides equal. For example, the third equation above means: [...] "For any function f(n) = O(1), there is some function g(n) [...] =O(e'n) such that n'f(n) = g(n)." [...] In terms of the [...] "set notation" [...] above, the meaning is that the class of functions represented by the left side is {{a subset of the}} class of functions represented by the right side. In this use the [...] "=" [...] is a formal symbol that unlike the usual use of [...] "=" [...] is not a <b>symmetric</b> <b>relation.</b> Thus for example n'O(1) = O(en) does not imply the false statement O(en) = n'O(1) ...|$|E
50|$|One way {{to conceptualize}} a <b>symmetric</b> <b>relation</b> in graph {{theory is that}} a <b>symmetric</b> <b>relation</b> is an edge, with the edge's two {{vertices}} being the two entities so related.

The fusion of a cover is the finest coarsening of the cover that turns it into a partition. This corresponds to the transitive closure of the similar-ity defined by the cover. These are important ingredients of a concise and efficient representation of multi-agent epistemic models, where knowledge of agents is captured by equivalences.

40|$|In {{a binary}} {{symmetric}} relationship, A {{is related to}} B {{if and only if}} B is related to A. Symmetric relationships between k participating entities can be represented as multisets of cardinality k. Cardinality-bounded multisets are natural in several real-world applications. Conventional representations in relational databases suffer from several consistency and performance problems. We argue that the database system itself should provide native support for cardinality-bounded multisets. We provide techniques to be implemented by the database engine that avoid the drawbacks, and allow a schema designer to simply declare a table to be symmetric in certain attributes. We describe a compact data structure, and update methods for the structure. We describe an algebraic symmetric closure operator, and show how it can be moved around in a query plan during query optimization in order to improve performance. We describe indexing methods that allow efficient lookups on the symmetric columns. We show how to perform database normalization in the presence of <b>symmetric</b> <b>relations.</b> We provide techniques for inferring that a view is symmetric. We also describe a syntactic SQL extension that allows the succinct formulation of queries over <b>symmetric</b> <b>relations...</b>|$|R
