With steady {{increases}} {{in social media}} use and Internet use for health information in general, individuals are turning to their interpersonal, social networks to find subjective evaluation information regarding health-related behavior. At the same time, marathon completion rates have been steadily increasing and are now at an all-time high. Scholars have assessed varying {{factors that contribute to}} successful adoption of marathon running, but none yet have examined the ways in which social media may be affecting those factors. Using framework and theory from the fields of communication, sport psychology, behavior, and health, this study identified relationships between social media use and other factors related to marathon-running adoption. It found that there is a <b>strong,</b> <b>positive,</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation between social media use and perceived observability of marathon-running activity on SNS; a moderate, positive, and significant correlation between social media use and athletic identity; and also a <b>strong,</b> <b>positive,</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation between perceived observability of marathon running on SNS and perceived competence to successfully adopt marathon running...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Research Station of Gharakheil of Mazandaran Province, Iran, to evaluate the response of seed corn single crosses SC 704 and SC 770 to different plant densities and nitrogen levels during summer 2010. The soil {{at the site of}} the experiment had a loamy texture consisting of 48 % sand, 35 % silt, and 17 % clay, with pH of 7. 81, and electrical conductivity of 0. 55 mmohs/cm. The {{experiment was}} performed in the form of factorial-split using the randomized complete block design. The main factor investigated was the two corn cultivars of Single Cross 704 and Single Cross 770. The sub-factors included three levels of applied nitrogen: the control treatment B 1 receiving no nitrogen, treatment B 2 receiving 250 Kg nitrogen per hectare and treatment B 3 receiving 350 Kg of nitrogen per hectare, along with three plant density levels were C 1, C 2, and C 3, with 75000, 85000, and 95000 plants per hectare, respectively. Results showed that the effect of the cultivar on the trait of grain yield was significant at the probability level of 5 percent. Comparison of the means showed that the cultivar Single Cross 704 with a yield of 12138 Kg. h was superior to the cultivar Single Cross 770 (which had a yield of 10877 Kg. h). Comparison of the means of nitrogen levels indicated that the highest yield (12310 kg. h) was achieved with the application of 350 kg. h of nitrogen and the lowest (10500 kg. h) was obtained in the control treatment. Comparison of the means of the cultivars with respect to the number of seed rows suggested that the cultivar Single Cross 704 with 15. 28 seed rows was superior to the cultivar Single Cross 770 with 14. 96 seed rows. The rate of nitrogen application had no significant effects on the number of seed rows. The maximum and the minimum numbers of seed rows of 15. 74 and 14. 48 were observed at densities of 75000 and 95000 plants per hectare, respectively. Results of individual correlation coefficients of the traits studied suggest that seed yield has the <b>strongest</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation with the trait of the 1000 – seed weight (0. 539 *), with the corn ear length (0. 52 *), and with the number of seed rows per corn ear (0. 453 *).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine egg quality characteristics, phenotypic correlations and prediction of egg weight from egg quality parameters in three varieties (naked neck, frizzled feather and normal feathered) of local chickens in Akwa Ibom State, Southeastern Nigeria. A total of 600 eggs (200 each of naked neck, frizzled feather and normal feathered varieties) were collected. External and internal defects were computed and expressed as percentage of total egg production and summed up to obtain the total defects score for each variety. Egg quality parameters were compared between varieties using Multivariate General Linear Model of SPSS version 17. 0 for ANOVA. Means were tested using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. Phenotypic correlations of egg quality parameters and prediction of egg weight using yolk weight, yolk width and albumen weight was done. Lowest total defects score (11. 00 %) was recorded for frizzled feather, 11. 63 % for naked neck and the highest (12. 65 %) for normal feathered. Egg weight differed significantly (p 0. 05). Mean highest value of 82. 49 % for haugh unit by naked neck was significantly different (p< 0. 05) from 77. 57 % by normal feathered and 77. 01 % by frizzled feather. Naked neck had best egg quality characteristics, followed by normal feathered and lastly the frizzled feather. In the normal feathered variety, <b>strong,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> (p< 0. 01) correlations were observed between egg weight and yolk weight (0. 773) and albumen weight (0. 797); yolk weight and albumen weight (0. 567); yolk index and yolk height (0. 715); haugh unit and albumen height (0. 954) and albumen index (0. 863). In the naked neck, <b>strong,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> (p< 0. 01) correlations were observed between egg weight and yolk weight (0. 611) and albumen weight (0. 768); haugh unit and albumen height (0. 934). In the frizzled feather, <b>strong,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> (p< 0. 01) correlations were observed between egg weight and yolk weight (0. 567) and albumen weight (0. 680); haugh unit and albumen height (0. 883) and albumen index (0. 856). These parameters would give rapid improvements if selected together in the respective varieties. Egg weight was predictable from albumen weight with sufficient Reliability (R) of 0. 77. 0. 77 and 0. 68 for normal feathered, naked neck and frizzled feather varieties respectively.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether ‘chewing side preference’ (CSP) is correlated to ‘chewing side preference during the first chewing cycle’ (CSP 1 ºC) in the deciduous, mixed and permanent dentitions. Methods: Three-hundred subjects were divided in 3 groups: Group 1 – 100 children 3 - 5 years old, primary dentition; Group 2 – 100 children 6 - 12 years old, mixed dentition; Group 3 – 100 subjects 18 - 47 years old, permanent dentition. CSP was determined using a method developed by McDonnell et al. (2004). Subjects were given a piece of gum and the position of the chewing gum was recorded 7 times as right or left. Subjects were classified as ‘observed preferred chewing side’ (OPCS) when they performed 5 / 7, 6 / 7 or 7 / 7 strokes on the same side. OPCS corresponded to the CSP. CSP 1 ºC was determined using a method developed by Hoogmartens and Caubergh (1987). Subjects were given five pieces of gum and the position of the chewing gum at first chewing cycle was recorded as right or left. For each subject, an index (I) was performed. The Chi-square (X 2) and phi correlation (r) tests were used to investigate signiﬁcant correlations between CSP and CSP 1 ºC. Results: There was a <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation between CSP and CSP 1 ºC for primary dentition (p= 0. 000; r= 0. 82), for mixed dentition (p= 0. 000; r= 0. 81) and a very <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation for permanent dentition (p= 0. 000; r= 0. 90).

The research exclusively {{looks at}} how {{the increase in the}} number of SMEs over time has resulted in the provision of employment regarding the number of people employed. In the investigation of this study, the quantitative approach method has been adopted using questionnaire and data gathered from secondary sources as research instruments to statistically explain SMEs growth and its impact in employment opportunities. Six years data on growth of SMEs was collected from Ibadan Southwest LGA, while 58 structured questionnaires were completed by owners of registered SMEs. Data obtained was analyzed with percentages, charts, tables, trend analysis, Pearson 9 ̆ 2 s correlation and linear regression. Results showed that a substantial number of SMEs had been in existence for more than six years with business operations alongside staff employment. Enterprise expansion and under-staff were the two principal factors for employing staff. From 2009 to 2014, Small-scale Enterprises showed an upward movement of 70. 6 per cent. Pearson 9 ̆ 2 s correlation showed that increase in Small-scale enterprise had a <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> association with employment (r 9 ̆ 6 0. 879, p< 0. 05).

The growing importance of organizational learning and innovativeness motivated us to conduct this research. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore relationship between organizational learning, innovativeness and non financial performance of NGOs. For data collection questionnaire survey method was adopted. A sample of 120 respondents was received out of 150 respondentswithin the period of one month by using random sampling technique. Findings reveled that organizational learning practices (employees ’ empowerment, behavioral & cognitive changes and leadership that reinforce learning) and innovativeness (Innovative culture) have <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> relationship with non-financial performance of NGOs. This research bestowhelp to have deeper understandings and guidelines for management to create learning zone & innovative culturewithinthe organization with a view to enhance employees and organizational performance.

This study investigated students ’ attitude and achievement in Computer science as a correlate of teacher classroom management behaviors (TCMB). A random sample of secondary school computer science students and teachers were selected from 5 junior secondary Schools in Debre Markos town Amhara region. A sample size of 50 students and 5 teachers were selected. Data were collected using direct-observation instruments and questionnaires. Pearson product moment coefficient {{was used to test}} the null hypothesis for significance at 0. 05 error margin. On the average, TCMB was found to have no significant correlation with attitude and achievement. However, the TCMB categories: Interest boosting, Student involvement and Varying instruction were found to have a <b>strong,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> correlation achievement in computer science (r =. 637,. 641,. 648 respectively; p < 0. 05). The implications for policy formulation, teacher training, teaching and learning in science education were discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a hedonic pricing model {{to estimate the}} effects of wine quality and regional and varietal reputation on prices in the Bulgarian wine market. We show, most importantly, that wine quality has a significant and positive impact. Red wines of local varieties have diminishing reputations, while white wines from local varieties have improved their standing in consumers' preferences. Our results reveal that there is significant regional reputation effect as well [...] {{at least for now}} [...] with wines sold with significant price discounts compared to Svishtov cabernet sauvignon wines. Over time, price discounts are rapidly diminishing for white wines and increasing for red wines, and regional reputations are losing significance, with an increase in the coefficients. We also show that product differentiation is important when transition markets are discussed. Regional specialization in production of a certain type of wine is displayed, and regional reputation depends strongly on it. Finally, the age of the wine has a <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>significant</b> impact on market prices for red wines but is insignificant for white wines. ...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes {{from the}} displacement-loop (D-loop) region (436 bp) were genotyped and sequenced in Japanese Black beef cattle {{raised in the}} same herd. Correlation {{coefficients}} between mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, maternal lineage, birth weight, preweaning average daily gain, weaning weight, post weaning average daily gain and yearling weight were computed. The objective was to study the relationship between maternal and postnatal growth traits and to investigate if postnatal growth of calves to yearling age could be accurately predicted from mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. Results of the phylogenetic analysis revealed 17 maternal lineages and four mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. There were <b>strong,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> highly <b>significant</b> (p 0. 05) ranging from - 0. 05 to 0. 1. Prediction of postnatal growth from mitochondrial DNA yielded very low R 2 values ranging from 0. 002 to 0. 019. It was concluded that mitochondrial DNA polymorphism has no significant association with postnatal growth from birth to yearling age, and by implication, nuclear rather than cytoplasmic DNA, accounts {{for most of the}} genetic variation observed in postnatal growth of Japanese Black cattle. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA genotyping at an early age has no bearing on the accurate prediction of the future growth performance of calves...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several bibliometric {{studies have}} been {{published}} on AIDS. The findings obtained from these studies have provided a general picture of the history and growth of AIDS literature. However, factors related to variation in HIV research productivity in sub-Saharan Africa have not been examined. Therefore, this study aims to fill some of the gap in existing research to provide insights into factors associated with HIV research productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A bibliometric analysis regarding sub-Saharan Africa HIV/AIDS research was conducted in the PubMed database {{for the period of}} 1981 to 2009. The numbers of HIV research articles indexed in PubMed was used as surrogate for total HIV research productivity. Series of univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to explore factors associated with variation in HIV research productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Results: First authors from South Africa, Uganda and Kenya contributed almost half {{of the total number of}} HIV articles indexed in PubMed between 1981 and 2009. Uganda, Zimbabwe and Malawi had better records when the total production was adjusted for gross domestic product (GDP). Comoros, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau were the most productive countries when the total products were normalized by number of people with HIV. There were <b>strong</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> statistically <b>significant</b> correlation between countries number of indexed journal (Pearso...|$|R
