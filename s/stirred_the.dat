5|$|Treasure {{hunters have}} {{sought out the}} Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 {{artifacts}} bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site {{found their way to}} Beirutine antiquities markets where they <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> interest of the Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, local clandestine {{treasure}} hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved {{onto the}} temple's walls. This discovery <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> interest of Theodore Macridy, {{curator of the}} Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.|$|E
5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 {{until the beginning of}} the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.|$|E

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E

25|$|When Otto {{returned}} to Saxony, Adelaide and Henry persuaded the king to void the treaty. Convening the Imperial Diet at Fritzlar, Otto declared Liudolf and Conrad as outlaws in absentia. The king reasserted his desires for dominion over Italy and {{to claim the}} imperial title. He sent emissaries to the Duchy of Lorraine and <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> local nobles against Conrad's rule. The duke was a Salian Frank by birth and unpopular {{with the people of}} Lorraine, so they pledged their support to Otto.|$|E
25|$|After the Bulgarians {{conquered the}} Avar Khanate in 804-805, Avar soldiers, who were now {{subjects}} of the Bulgarian crown, were recruited in the army, especially during the campaign against Nicephorus I in 811, when the Byzantines burned down the capital, Pliska. In the 9th-10th centuries the Bulgarians often resorted to the services of the Pechenegs, who were probably Bulgarian federates. When the Byzantines <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> Kievan Rus' up against the Empire, the Bulgarian diplomacy in turn used the Pechenegs against Rus'.|$|E

Such activities doubtlessly helped to foster unity within the state's numerically dominant Seattle local.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 1860 a {{group of}} Maronites raided a Druze village. Massacres and {{reprisal}} massacres followed, {{not only in the}} Lebanon but also in Syria. In the end, between 7,000 and 12,000 people of all religions had been killed, and over 300 villages, 500 churches, 40 monasteries, and 30 schools were destroyed. Christian attacks on Muslims in Beirut <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> Muslim population of Damascus to attack the Christian minority with between 5,000 and 25,000 of the latter being killed, including the American and Dutch consuls, giving the event an international dimension.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the {{political}} or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce {{by the end of the}} century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views.|$|E
25|$|The Finnish {{national}} awakening in {{the mid-19th}} century {{was the result of}} members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of nation building, i.e. to establish a feeling of unity among all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling elite and the ruled peasantry. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, a collection of traditional myths and legends which is the folklore of the Karelian people (the Finnic Eastern Orthodox people who inhabit the Lake Ladoga-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> nationalism that later led to Finland's independence from Russia.|$|E

25|$|The French {{presence}} {{encouraged by}} Phaulkon, however, <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> resentment and suspicions of the Thai nobles and Buddhist clergy. When word spread that Narai was dying, a general, Phetracha (reigned 1688–93) stage a coup d'état, the 1688 Siamese revolution, seized the throne, killed the designated heir, a Christian, and had Phaulkon {{put to death}} along {{with a number of}} missionaries and expelled the remaining foreigners. Some studies said that Ayutthaya began a period of alienation from western traders, while welcoming more Chinese merchants. But other recent studies argue that, due to wars and conflicts in Europe in the mid-eighteenth century, European merchants reduced their activities in the East. However, it was apparent that the Dutch East Indies Company or VOC was still doing business in Ayutthaya despite political difficulties.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Stähelin {{successfully}} {{applied for}} a 12-month postdoctoral fellowship sponsored by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) {{to work on a}} project on phagocytosis inspired by Emanuel Suter (then at Harvard, later second Dean of the University of Florida Medical School). In 1955, Stähelin rediscovered the respiratory burst in leucocytes in Manfred L. Karnovsky's laboratory at the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, U.S.A. His experiments <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> interest of Karnovsky, who was at the time unaware of this metabolic phenomenon (which had first been described more than twenty years earlier in 1933 by C.

25|$|Nationalism was {{a central}} force in the History of Finland {{for the last two}} centuries. The Finnish {{national}} awakening in the mid-19th century was the result of members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of nation building—i.e. to establish a feeling of unity between all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling elite and the ruled peasantry. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, a collection of traditional myths and legends which is the folklore common to the Finns and to the Karelian people (the Finnic Russian Orthodox people who inhabit the Lake Ladoga-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> nationalism that later led to Finland's independence from Russia.|$|E
25|$|When King Lycurgus of Thrace {{heard that}} Dionysus {{was in his}} kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus' followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> people into revolt. Dionysus then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe {{in the belief that}} he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus was alive. His people had him drawn and quartered. Following the death of the king, Dionysus lifted the curse. This story is told in Homer's epic, Iliad 6.136-7. In an {{alternative}} version, sometimes shown in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} B.C. Pal and G.S. Khaparde in London in 1908 further <b>stirred</b> <b>the</b> matter, since both {{were known to}} have been radical {{nationalist}} politicians in India. By September 1908, an agent had been installed within India House who was able to invite detectives to the Sunday night meetings of the Free India Society (attendance for Europeans was by invitation only). The agent passed on some additional information, but was not able to infiltrate Savarkar's inner circle. Savarkar himself did not come under special scrutiny as a dangerous suspect until November 1909, when the agent delivered information about discussions of assassinations at Indian House. The agent may have been a young Maharashtrian by the name of Kirtikar, who had arrived at India House as an acquaintance of V.V.S. Aiyar, ostensibly to study dentistry in London. Kirtikar was discovered after Aiyar made enquiries at the London Hospital where {{he was supposed to be}} training, and was one night forced by Savarkar to confess at gun-point.|$|E
