40|$|OBJECTIVES: All commercially {{available}} triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) <b>suspensions,</b> used <b>for</b> intravitreal treatment, contain retinal toxic vehicles (e. g., benzyl alcohol, solubilizer). Our {{aim was to}} find a convenient and reproducible method to compound a completely preservative-free TACA suspension, adapted to the intraocular physiology, with consistent quality (i. e., proven sterility and stability, constant content and dose uniformity, defined particle size, and 1 year shelf life). METHODS: We evaluated two published (Membrane-filter, Centrifugation) and a newly developed method (Direct Suspending) to compound TACA <b>suspensions</b> <b>for</b> intravitreal <b>injection.</b> Parameters as TACA content (HPLC), particle size (microscopy and laser spectrometry), sterility, and bacterial endotoxins were assessed. Stability testing (at room temperature and 40 degrees C) was performed: color and homogeneity (visually), particle size (microscopically), TACA content and dose uniformity (HPLC) were analyzed according to International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. RESULTS: Contrary to the known methods, the direct suspending method is convenient, provides a TACA suspension, which fulfills all compendial requirements, and has a 2 -year shelf life. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple, reproducible method to compound stable, completely preservative-free TACA suspensions with a reasonable shelf-life, which enables to study the effect of intravitreal TACA [...] not biased by varying doses and toxic compounds or their residues...|$|R
40|$|Flow of {{suspensions}} in porous {{media with}} particle capture and detachment under alternate flow rates is discussed. The mathematical model contains the maximum retention concentration function of flow velocity that governs the particle release {{and is used}} instead of equation for particle detachment kinetics from the classical filtration model. An analytical model <b>for</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>injection</b> with alternate rateswas derived, and a coreflood by suspension with alternate rates was carried out. The modelling and laboratory data are in a good agreement, which validates the modified particle detachment model with the maximum retention function.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of manganese dioxide particles 1 hour following intravenous injection in cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, chickens, and turtles is described. This distribution is remarkably constant {{for all the}} animals tested, except the cat, in which the injected material is practically equally divided between the lungs and liver. In the other animals the liver performs the main share of the work, and in the cat {{it has been shown}} that the liver after 12 hours accumulates the manganese which was formerly deposited in the lungs. The results are in harmony with experiments in which bacterial <b>suspensions</b> are employed <b>for</b> <b>injection</b> and confirm the suggestion previously made (2) that in the first handling of foreign particulate material the animal behaves similarly whether protein or inorganic injections are used...|$|R
40|$|Diseases of {{the nervous}} system takes one of the key place in disease {{distribution}} and mortality all over the world. According to the data of WHO near 30 % of population takes nootropic drugs regularly. For older people this specific part in modern society increases inexorably. This parameter reaches approximately 50 %. Although {{it should be noted that}} incidence of nervous system diseases rises in young people too. These facts prove about actuality and much need for medicinal drugs of abovementioned class, particularly, nootropic drugs which are most commonly used for neurotherapy. Aim. The aim of this research was carrying-out of analytical review of pharmaceutical market of nootropic drugs in Ukraine. Methods. Statistical and marketing methods of investigation of electronic and paper sources of information. Object of research is an information about nootropic drugs registered in Ukraine. Results. It has been found that Ukrainian pharmaceuticals compose 57 % of nootropics’ market. There are 16 producing countries of nootropic drugs on Ukrainian market. Investigation of nootropics’ market showed that these drugs present in different dosage forms (tablets, capsules, syrups, pills, <b>suspensions,</b> solutions <b>for</b> <b>injection,</b> solutions <b>for</b> infusion, oral solutions, sachets), among which tablets prevail. Conclusions. Synthetic nootropic drugs prevail and compose 87 % of Ukrainian market, fraction of herbal drugs is 13 %, and they are characterized with monotonic content and represented with medicinal products of Ginkgo Biloba. Results concerning dosage forms’ ratio prove that herbal medicinal products having nootropic action are mostly presented in the form of tablets (67 %) </p...|$|R
40|$|Injectivity decline due to {{injection}} {{of water with}} particles is a widespread phenomenon in waterflood projects. It happens due to particle capture by rocks and consequent permeability decline and also due to external cake formation on the sandface. Since offshore production environments become ever more complex, particularly in deep water fields, the risk associated with injectivity impairment due to {{injection of}} seawater or re-injection of produced water may increase {{to the point that}} production by conventional waterflood may cease to be viable. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to predict injectivity evolution under such circumstances. The work develops a semi-analytical model for injectivity impairment during a <b>suspension</b> <b>injection</b> <b>for</b> the case of filtration and formation damage coefficients being linear functions of retained particle concentration. The model exhibits limited retained particle accumulation, while the traditional model with a constant filtration coefficient predicts unlimited growth of retained particle concentration. The developed model also predicts the well index stabilization after the decline period. A. S. L. Vaz, P. Bedrikovetsky, C. J. A. Furtado and A. L. S. de Souz...|$|R

40|$|Nanomedicine, an {{emerging}} new field {{created by the}} fusion of nanotechnology and medicine, {{is one of the}} most promising pathways for the development of effective targeted therapies with oncology being the earlier and the most notable beneficiary to date. Indeed, drug-loaded nanoparticles provide an ideal solution to overcome the low selectivity of the anticancer drugs towards the cancer cells in regards to normal cells and the induced severe side-effects, thanks to their passive and/or active targeting to cancer tissues. Liposome-based systems encapsulating drugs are already used in some cancer therapies (e. g. Myocet, Daunoxome, Doxil). But liposomes have some important drawbacks: they have a low capacity to encapsulate lipophilic drugs (even though it exists), they are manufactured through processes involving organic solvents, and they are leaky, unstable in biological fluids and more generally in aqueous solutions for being commercialized as such. We have developed new nano-cargos, the lipid nanocapsules, with sizes below the endothelium fenestration (phi inférieur à 100 nm), that solve these disadvantages. They are prepared according to a solvent-free process and they are stable for at least one year in <b>suspension</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>injection,</b> which should reduce considerably the cost and convenience for treatment. Moreover, these new nano-cargos have the ability to encapsulate efficiently lipophilic drugs, offering a pharmaceutical solution for their intravenous administration. The lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) have been prepared according to an original method based on a phase-inversion temperature process recently developed and patented. Their structure is a hybrid between polymeric nanocapsules and liposomes because of their oily core which is surrounded by a tensioactive rigid membrane. They have a lipoprotein-like structure. Their size can be adjusted below 100 nm with a narrow distribution. Importantly, these properties confer great stability to the structure (physical stability > 18 months). Blank or drug-loaded LNCs can be prepared, with or without PEG (polyethyleneglycol) ylation that is a key parameter that affects the vascular residence time of the nano-cargos. Other hydrophilic tails can also be grafted. Different anticancer drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide, hydroxytamoxifen, doxorubicin, etc.) have been encapsulated. They all are released according to a sustained pattern. Preclinical studies on cell cultures and animal models of tumors have been performed, showing promising results...|$|R
