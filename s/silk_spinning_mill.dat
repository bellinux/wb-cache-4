50|$|Strutt {{and another}} spinner, Samuel Need, were {{introduced}} to Richard Arkwright who had arrived in Nottingham in about 1768, and set up his spinning frame there using horse-power to run the mill, but this was an unsatisfactory power source. In Derby, John Lombe had built a successful <b>silk</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mill</b> using water power. Strutt and Need joined Arkwright {{in the building of}} a cotton mill at Cromford, using what was henceforth called Arkwright's water frame. This was {{the first of its kind}} in the world, marking the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

She married Gaspare Granoli (1898-1979) and the couple raised two children, Carla (1925) and Luigi (1930-2004). She worked in a <b>silk</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mill</b> for almost 40 years while her husband was a {{steelworker}} in the Breda Industry, in Sesto San Giovanni, where they lived. After 1974, Redaelli moved to Novate Milanese and lived with her daughter's family. In her last days she was in good health, clear headed, quite active, and was still able to walk. Although she had some problems with her sight and hearing, she still read newspapers and magazines every day and on television followed her greatest passion and favourite football club, Inter Milan.|$|E

The 18th century is full of events in Campo’s life: suffering floods, involved in political struggles between Vienna and the Republic of Genoa, the town sees a gradual buildup of manufacturing activities (iron production and processing, <b>silk</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mills,</b> paper mills, lime pits, forestry and agriculture) and eventually {{the birth of the}} republican municipality that joins the Ligurian Republic in 1797.|$|R

5000|$|In 1462 the Duke of Austria {{acquired}} the castle and estates from the Bishop of Chur {{and sold it}} to Ulrich von Brandis, who began rebuilding. In 1467 the duke expanded the estates attached to Marschlins by adding Malans, Untervaz and Valzeina. In 1498 the Brandis family began {{trying to sell the}} castle and estates, but the outbreak of the Swabian War in the following year broke the deal. After the war, in 1509, they pawned the castle to Ulrich Goeldin and in 1518 the Gugelberg family bought it outright. Around 1600 the moat was drained. In 1633 it was acquired by a branch of the Salis family, who adopted the name Salis-Marschlins. Two years later Ulysses Salis began renovating the castle and turned it from a more military fortification into an elegant house with a french garden. In 1771 the bell tower on the chapel was added. [...] From 1771 until 1777 the castle became a philanthropinist school. Later, it was a tobacco factory and a <b>silk</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mill.</b> After the French invasion of Switzerland the castle became an army camp. A total of about 10,000 soldiers and 3,000 horse passed through the castle between March 1799 and December 1800.|$|E
40|$|When {{approaching}} {{the design of}} a new building, it is possible to define a wide set of options and to choose between them taking account of the local climate, the mini- mum performance standards, the architectural context and the landscape. However, when approaching a refurbishment project the number of degrees of freedom is obviously lower. The retrofit of historic buildings introduces further limitations, especially when regulated through the decision-making processes of different local and regional authorities. We consider different sustainable retrofit approaches for the former <b>silk</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>mill</b> located in Valmadrera, not far from Lake Como in northern Italy, which has been active since 1819. Due to its historic value, any physical intervention on the building should be authorised by the cultural heritage authority. For this reason, dif- ferent possible wall insulation approaches are considered: a conservative retrofit, with a lower visual impact on the external façade, to preserve the historic value of the building, and a deep retrofit that includes thermal insulation on both the internal and external surfaces of the walls...|$|E
