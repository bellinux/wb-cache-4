It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'. Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> 'British' by sharing in the war effort.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E

40|$|Taking as its {{starting}} point the Aristotelian consideration <b>of</b> the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>being,</b> this paper concentrates on being as true (ens ut verum) analyzing and {{commenting on the}} text of Metaphysics in which this concept appears, in order to delimit, as far as possible, its authentic meaning and to resolve the apparent contradictions that may be observed in these texts. The analysis is made using the commentaries by St. Thomas Aquinas. The conclusions reached are that being as true is properly one <b>of</b> the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> that must not be mistaken with ontological truth. It is also determined in this article in what being as truth consists, {{and there is a}} fimal remark on the essence of the truth of the simple...|$|R
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{philosophers}} {{can be seen}} as embodying different potencies and <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{throughout the}} history of philosophy. Kant, for instance, is best defined as a transcendental univocalist. Nietzsche would come close to something like an aesthete given his acknowledgment of the aesthetic/sensual part of being; he is, however, described by Desmond as being defined by the transcending potency and being both equivocal and a dialectician. Hegel might be defined as a dialectician. Desmond believes, however, that all of these philosophers are somehow haunted by those potencies which they seek to ignore or devalue. There is a dialectics in Kant and there are equivocities in Nietzsche. [...] "Metaxological vigilance" [...] shows a clearer picture of the ethos than do any views that restrict philosophical considerations to the other <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> and potencies.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the ethos}} {{there are seven}} potencies <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> This [...] "enabling {{repertoire}} of self becoming" [...] has the [...] "character of an endowment", and is thus seen as a gift. The potencies are not a program to follow; they simply are all together the powers from which ethical selvings, expressed through particular <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>being,</b> take their endowment.|$|R

25|$|In many cultures, {{inability}} to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, {{a degree of}} rejection (or a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment. Some respond by actively avoiding the issue altogether; middle-class men {{are the most likely}} to respond in this way.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{elements}} that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was {{what he called the}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a true self was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> difficult to eat: their body {{is covered with}} setae (like carpet pile) and is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: {{with the exception of}} specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees presented to them. After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill and eat a bumblebee.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversational}} model {{views the}} aim of therapy as allowing {{the growth of the}} patient's self through encouraging a form of conversational relating called 'aloneness-togetherness'. This phrase is reminiscent of Winnicott's idea of the importance <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to be 'alone in the presence of another'. The client comes to eventually feel recognised, accepted and understood as who they are; their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>being,</b> or self, is fostered; and they can start to drop the destructive defenses which disrupt their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>being.</b>|$|R

25|$|Symonds's {{mother died}} when he was only four years old, and his father had a {{powerful}} influence upon the formation of his character. The fashionable Freudian theory that a man's homosexuality is caused by a close-binding-intimate mother and a weak-or-absent father is put to rout by Symonds's childhood, in which the opposite was the case. Admittedly there were mostly women in the household, governesses, aunts, and eventually four sisters, but he records no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> overwhelmed by the feminine atmosphere, and was fairly indifferent to their presence.|$|E
25|$|He {{is a man}} magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, {{almost a}} Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with {{classical}} myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} {{is linked to}} an individual's intrinsic sense of self and, particularly the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> male or female. Gender identity {{may or may not}} conform to a person's birth assigned sex. The personal characteristics that are associated with gender identity include self-image, physical and biological appearance, expression, behaviour and conduct, as they relate to gender. … Individuals whose birth-assigned sex does not conform to their gender identity include transsexuals, transgenderists, intersexed persons and cross-dressers. A person's gender {{identity is}} fundamentally different from and not determinative of their sexual orientation.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to {{how difficult it}} is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E
25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} World War I on the {{evolution}} of Canada’s identity is debated by historians. While there is a consensus that {{on the eve of the}} war, most English speaking Canadians had a hybrid imperial-national identity, the war's effects on Canada’s emergence as a nation are complex. The Canadian media often refers to the First World War and, in particular, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, as marking “the birth of a nation.” Some historians consider the First World War to be Canada’s “war of independence.” They argue that the war decreased the extent to which Canadians identified with the British Empire and intensified their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> Canadians first and British subjects second.|$|E
