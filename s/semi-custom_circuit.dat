We describe here algorithms for minimizing i) the area of synchronous combinational and/or ~quential circuits under cycle time CCX 1 straints and ii) the cycle time under area constraints. Previous approaches attacked this problem by ~parabng the combinational logic from the regisrers and by applying cilcuit uansfonnations to the combinational compUlel 1 t only. We show in this paper inStead how to ~timize concwrently the cilcuit equations and the register position. This method is novel and can achieve results that are at least as good as those ot [...] ained by previous methods. A computer implementation of the algorithms in program Minerva is described. 1 lntrod uction Logic synthesis has shown to be of pivotal importance in the computer-aided design of integrated circuits. Logic synthesis systems have been the object of extensive investigation and commercial implementations have shown to be practical for product-level design of digital circuits. Most circuits of interest in digital design are synd 1 ronous logic circuits, that are interconnections of logic gates and registers with synchronous clocking. Feedback connections are restricted to be through synchronous registers, to guarantee race-free design. <b>Semi-custom</b> <b>circuit</b> implementations, such as standard-cells and sea-ofgates...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The advantage of using a semi-custom design approach over a fully custom design approach are a faster turnaround of circuit design, ease of use for the inexperienced engineer, and lower production costs. A semi-custom design approach, however, has a heavily constrained layout and thus is not optimum for high performance circuits. Analog arrays are a particular type of <b>semi-custom</b> <b>circuit</b> which are currently being used in industry. The objective of this work is to develop a design methodology for designing a field programmable analog array (FPAA). This work is meant to be used in systems that require filtering in the audio bandwidth (20 Hz- 20 kHz) and thus is limited in its direct application. The first process in developing the FPAA is to determine an architecture or floor plan for the layout of the FPAA. This involves the design of the active ceus (ie. programmable opamp), a programmable capacitor bank, the switches used in the SC filter synthesis, and the routing interconnections. A second objective of this work is to study and minimize the effects of the programmable switch parasitics on circuit performance, and overall system performance. A final objective of this work is to develop CAD tools in order to design and use the FPAA...|$|E

ACME is a CAD tool specifically developed for HBT circuits. ACME implements a novel physical schematic-capture design technique where designers simultaneously view {{the structure and}} physical organization of a circuit. ACME's design interface is similar to schematic capture; however, unlike conventional schematic capture, designers can directly control the physical placement of both function and interconnect at the schematic level. In addition, ACME provides design-time parasitic extraction, complex wire models, and extensions to Multi-Chip Modules (MCM's).

50|$|Improvements {{over the}} POWER1 {{included}} enhancements to the POWER instruction set architecture (consisting of new user and system instructions and other system-related features), higher clock rates (55 to 71.5 MHz), an extra fixed point unit and floating point unit, a larger 32 KB instruction cache, {{and a larger}} 128 or 256 KB data cache. The POWER2 was a multi-chip design consisting of six or eight <b>semi-custom</b> integrated <b>circuits,</b> depending {{on the amount of}} data cache (the 256 KB configuration required eight chips). The partitioning of the design was identical to that of the POWER1: an instruction cache unit chip, a fixed-point unit chip, a floating-point unit chip, a storage control unit chip, and two or four data cache unit chips.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a technique for translating <b>semi-custom</b> VLSI <b>circuits</b> automatically, integrating two design environments, into eld programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for rapid and inexpensive prototyping. The VLSI circuits are designed using a cell-matrix based environment that produces chips with density comparable to full custom VLSI design. These circuits are translated automatically into FPGAs for testing and system development. A four-bit pipelined array multiplier {{is used as}} an example of this translation. The multiplier is implemented in CMOS in both synchronous and asynchronous pipelined versions, and translated into Actel FPGAs both automatically, and by hand for comparison. The six test chips were all found to be fully functional, and the translation e ciency in terms of chip speed and area is shown. This result demonstrates the potential of this approach to system development. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} hardware/software co-design that starts with a high-level specification of a target machine and a synchronous data flow representation of an algorithm. The instruction set description is translated into a netlist-level machine description. A set of independent tools successively transform the algorithm into a program for the target processor. We employ the machine description formalism nML, in which a processor architecture is defined solely by its instruction set semantics. Modularization and sharing of semantic properties between instructions are modelled by structuring the complete description as an attributed grammar. Analysis tools guide the user in optimizing both the hardware and the software. The design trajectory is explained by using the ADPCM algorithm as an example application and a core DSP as initial target machine. 1.

40|$|Presently, {{there are}} many {{difficulties}} associated with implementing application specific custom or semi-custom (standard cell based) integrated circuits (ICs) into JPL flight projects. One of the primary difficulties is developing prototype <b>semi-custom</b> integrated <b>circuits</b> for use and evaluation in engineering prototype flight hardware. The prototype semi-custom ICs must be extremely cost-effective and yet still representative of flight qualifiable versions of the design. A second difficulty is encountered in the transport of the design from engineering prototype quality to flight quality. Normally, flight quality integrated circuits have stringent quality standards, must be radiation resistant and should consume minimal power. It is often not necessary or cost effective, however, to impose such stringent quality standards on engineering models developed for systems analysis in controlled lab environments. This article presents work originally initiated for ground based applications that also addresses these two problems. Furthermore, this article suggests a method that has been shown successful in prototyping flight quality semi-custom ICs through the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) program run by the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute. The method has been used successfully {{to design and fabricate}} through the MOSIS three different semi-custom prototype CMOS p-well chips. The three designs make use of the work presented and were designed consistent with design techniques and structures that are flight qualifiable, allowing one hour transfer of the design from engineering model status to flight qualifiable foundry-ready status through methods outlined in this article...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} a digital calorimeter trigger processor system which could form {{a major part of the}} ATLAS level- 1 trigger system. Utilising novel techniques, but with today’s technologies, the system can be contained within six electronics crates and will provide the central trigger logic with signals from events with high-pT electrons, photons, jets and missing ET. Communication with the trigger digitisation system will employ commercial high-speed optical links, terminating in multi-chip modules (MCMs) incorporating custom-designed integrated optics. Simulation studies combined with an extensive demonstrator programme have been used to develop flexible digital algorithms with programmable parameters for bunch-crossing identification and electromagnetic cluster-finding. These algorithms will be embedded in <b>semi-custom</b> application-specific integrated <b>circuits,</b> of which five types will be designed. Inter-crate data fan-out will be achieved by means of optical splitters, while communication within crates will use transmission-line backplanes. The remaining technical issues will be studied in the final phase of the current R&D demonstrator programme. A parallel demonstrator programme is also under way to study alternative techniques with the potential for future system enhancement...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} a software system for optimizing synthesized logic circuits. The particular implementation described is targeted to the Xilinx Virtex family of FPGAs, but the techniques developed are relevant to other families of array-based <b>semi-custom</b> programmable logic <b>circuits.</b> One of the unique aspects of my approach is that the optimization occurs after the circuit is mapped onto the logic array. Prior to this work it was commonly believed that optimization after mapping was infeasible. The advantages of this approach include the ability to optimize a design without having the VHDL source code, the opportunity to selectively optimize only parts of a circuit and {{the preservation of the}} original the state encoding. The optimizations are also transparent to the synthesis process. This is a powerful and versatile method, which gives the designer considerable freedom in optimizing parts of the design according to his or her preferences. The optimization process proceeds as follows. The behavioral or structural description of the design is first written in VHDL. The design is then synthesized using the Workview Office synthesis tool and extracted to an EDIF (Electronic Design Interface Format) mapped netlist targeting Xilinx's Virtex family of FPGAs. This netlist is then analyzed, and an internal representation of the given circuit is created. Any pipelines (blocks of combinational logic feeding one or more registers) that exist in the circuit are then identified and common blocks of logic that reside between the pipeline registers are extracted. Multilevel minimization algorithms in the SIS framework are applied in order to optimize the design. The optimized equations are then converted to an EDIF-compatible format and all the necessary modifications are computed in order to restructure the original netlist to produce the optimized one. The resultant remapped circuit is then placed and routed as before...|$|R
