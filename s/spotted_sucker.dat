50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (Minytrema melanops) is {{a species}} of sucker (fish) that is native to eastern North America. The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> inhabits deep pools of small to medium rivers over clay, sand or gravel. They are {{occasionally}} found in creeks and large rivers. Through its life stages, the <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> goes from a mid-depth predator to a bottom forager. Spotted suckers have a lifespan of approximately six years and spawn in April and May. Limited knowledge of the occurrence, abundance, and natural history of this species has been an impediment to status assessment and the determination of need for conservation measures within this family.|$|E
50|$|Common fish by biomass in the {{freshwater}} {{portions of}} the Edisto include <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (Minytrema melanops), bowfin (Amia calva), flat bullhead (Ameiurus platycephalus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus), and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). Redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) is the species most prized by anglers.|$|E
50|$|Predators of the <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> {{typically}} {{vary depending}} on the environment. It depends heavily on clean waters with no silt to survive. It prefers sluggish water, but has been found in some turbid environments. Human activities have caused for the streams that Minytrema lives in to become silted, thus making it hard for them to survive. However, dams have also caused impoundments which can cause slower moving waters and boost populations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> are not federally {{listed as}} {{endangered}} or threatened in the United States. However, in Canada {{the number of}} <b>spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> is very low. They are listed as a species of concern and fishermen are asked to report any sightings they have of the fish {{in order to keep}} a current count of fish populations. The suckers do not usually hybridize with other species. Overfishing is not a problem for this species either. While they generally taste pretty good to eat, the flesh has a lot of bones making it difficult to clean them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> have a {{dark spot}} {{at the base of}} each scale giving them the {{appearance}} of having many rows of small black spots on their body and can reach about 19 inches.|$|R
40|$|Food {{habits of}} bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque) largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lacepede), and <b>spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> (Minytrema melanops Rafinesque) were {{investigated}} {{to determine their}} dependence on the zooplankton and benthos. The area under investigation consisted of three finger lakes in the backwaters of Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River southwest of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Fish, benthos, and zooplankton samples were taken {{during the summer and}} fall of 1972...|$|R
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> has a {{very wide}} distribution. They are widely found {{throughout}} the central and southeastern United States and reach southern Canada. They are distributed within and east of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basin but these species are at the southeastern limits of their distribution in the Apalachicola River. It {{is found in the}} lower Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins from Pennsylvania to Minnesota and in Atlantic and Gulf Slope drainages in North Carolina to western Texas. Populations in the United States have remained stable and they are still relatively common. The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> prefers clean, clear bodies water with a firm substrate. It is reported that they are abundant in oxbow lakes and other areas without a strong current. They do not tolerate pollution or siltation very well and because of this they have been lost in some areas of their historic range such as Illinois. Numbers are also declining in areas such as Ohio and Kansas. Farther north in Canada the species is a species of concern due to declining numbers and deteriorating water quality. This represents the northern most area of their range, so they may have always been rare in Canada.|$|E
50|$|The feeding {{habits of}} Minytrema Melanops show a {{distinct}} change throughout its life cycle. As larvae the fish feed upon individual zooplankton. Larvae up to 25 millimeters in length were observed feeding in shallow back waters during the day. The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> begins to ingest organic matter once they reach approximately 25 millimeters. It {{is at this}} length that they become bottom feeders. At about 50 millimeters Minytrema begins to feed on the substrate and benthos and sand {{become part of the}} stomach contents. As larvae and juvenile Minytrema feeds in schools, but as they become adults they separate to feed in deeper waters. There is not much known about the feeding habits of adults. It is believed that suckers feed primarily during dusk and dawn. Spotted suckers primarily feed upon organic fragments, copepods, cladocerans, and chironomids. Other benthic invertebrates have been found in gut contents, but are not {{a large part of the}} diet. The stomach content of spotted suckers varies with the time of the year. In the spring, summer, and autumn large numbers of zooplankton are ingested. In the summer and autumn chironomids are also found. This shows the change in abundance with the change in season. Numerically, organic fragments and sand are most abundantly found in the gut. This is followed by diatoms, copepods and cladocerans making up much of the remainder. From the differences in abundance and types of particles in gut contents from different populations, it appears that Minytrema is not selective for any particular group, but harvests those groups that are seasonally or regionally abundant.|$|E
5000|$|The Red Cedar River is a {{familiar}} campus landmark at Michigan State University. The name of the river is featured in {{the first line of}} MSU's fight song, and MSU students can be found studying in the parkland along its banks. A number of student activities centered around the Red Cedar over the course of MSU's history, including freshman vs. sophomore [...] "tug-o-war" [...] spanning the river and a Water Carnival featuring student made floats drifting in procession. People on campus frequently feed the large community of mallard ducks that congregate near the river. Wildlife in the river includes 33 species of fish and various other aquatic animals, and study of the river and its ecosystem is incorporated into relevant areas of the university's curricula. Fishing was banned on the campus in the 1960s; the ban was rescinded for a section of the river in 2013. The river is popular in the summer for canoeing and kayaking. (The campus canoe dock is self-mockingly named Red Cedar Yacht Club.) During floods, the river forms a standing wave at the campus dam that can be surfed. In the winter, the river often freezes over and students walk or play on the ice despite the inherent danger. During its inaugural season in 1922, the MSU hockey team played games on the frozen river. Alongside the river on MSU's campus is the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden, the oldest continuous botanical garden in the United States. The garden was started in 1873. A variety of species of fish {{can be found in the}} Red Cedar River. From December 1979 to 1981, Dr. Patrick M. Muzzall from MSU's zoology department collected the following species: white sucker, northern hog sucker, <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker,</b> golden redhorse, silver redhorse, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkin seed, warmouth, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, stoneroller, carp, hornyhead chub, common shiner, rosyface shiner, sand shiner, bluntnose minnow, blacknose dace, creek chub, grass pickerel, brook stickleback, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rainbow darter, johnny darter, yellow perch, blackside darter, and central mudminnow.|$|E
50|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Turtle Creek is {{designated as a}} Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In the 1930s, the creek was noted in the Pennsylvania Angler {{to be a viable}} <b>spot</b> for <b>sucker</b> fishing.|$|R
50|$|Spawning {{season for}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> begin {{anywhere}} from early March to early May when the water temperature reaches approximately 12 to 19 C. The fish migrate upstream to smaller tributaries in January to spawn in riffles containing gravel substrates. There are usually two males for every female. As the female approaches, the males bump and prod her in the abdomen. The males then clasp the posterior half of the female between themselves on either dies. They vibrate their caudal sections and head toward the surface. During this time semibouyant eggs are released downstream. There is no parental care by the adults. The males do not guard the nest and leave after the act of spawning. Both sexes are able to spawn {{more than once in}} a season. The eggs will hatch after seven to ten days depending on the water temperature and will reach sexual maturation after three years. The lifespan is generally six years. However, fish in the southeast and to only live for five years. It is unknown why this is.|$|R

[...] Nick and his crony Al (George Tobias) travel to Los Angeles, where another con artist, Doc Ganson (George Coulouris), has <b>spotted</b> a <b>sucker,</b> but has neither the money nor the charm {{necessary}} for the job. Doc reluctantly approaches Pop to recruit Nick, even though there is bad blood between them.|$|R
40|$|The {{reported}} {{range of}} the <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (Minytrema melanops) extends roughly through {{the eastern half of}} Oklahoma (1). The only collections from a more western longitude were from the Colorado River drainage in Texas (2). In 1991, we captured and released a single adult specimen during an electrofishing survey of Lake Lawtonka in Comanche County of southwest Oklahoma. Subsequent review of Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) records revealed that spotted suckers have been taken sporadically from Lake Lawtonka since at least 1952. Spotted suckers were collected from Lake Lawtonka in a ten-hectare rotenone survey by the ODWC in 1952 (unpublished data-no sizes given). Spotted suckers were also killed in a lake-wide fish eradication effort in 1953 (3). In 1973, a single immature <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (total length = 203 mm, weight = 104 g) was collected in a cove-rotenone survey of Lake Lawtonka (4), and one adult (356 mm, 482 g) was collected by rotenone use in 1977 (unpublished ODWC data). In 1982, one specimen (length unknown, 292 g) was recorded from gill-net sampling in the lake (5). In the spring of 1992, we collected a young <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (200 mm) and three adults (297, 344, and 362 mm) by electrofishing in Lake Lawtonka. In April and May of 1992, an angler caught eight spotted suckers below Lake Lawtonka in Medicine Creek (S 19, T 3 N, R 12 W) using live worms. Two of these fish (295 and 395 mm), and the four captured from Lake Lawtonka in 1992 were deposited at the University of Oklahoma Museum of Zoology. Several spotted suckers were seen and photographed during a snorkel survey of the headwaters of Lake Lawtonk...|$|E
40|$|Age, growth, {{and food}} habits of ten catostomids from Pool 8 of of the Upper Mississippi River were determined. The catostomids studied were the bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus Valenciennes), small-mouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus Rafinesque), river carpsucker (Carpiodes velifer Rafinesque), quillback carpsucker (Carpiodes syprinus Lesueuer), <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> (Minytrema melanops Rafinesque), Shorthead redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum Lesueur), silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum Rafinesque), golden redhorse (Moxostoma erythrurum Rafinesque), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni Lacepede). Thirty-eight {{ecotypes}} were investigated from June through August, 1975. Catostomids {{were collected from}} the main channel and backwater areas by use of gillnets, hoopnets, frame nets, seine nets and a boomhocker. Four species (<b>spotted</b> <b>sucker,</b> shorthead, silver and golden redhorse) comprised 94. 2 % of the catostomids collected from Pool 8. The shorthead redhorse was the most abundant catostomid collected. The shorthead redhorse consisted of eight age groups (0 -VII). The period of greatest growth occurred during their second year when they increased their size by 106. 4 mm. The most important food item was Tendipedidae larvae by both number (75. 8 %) and volume (41. 2 %). There were 10 age groups of silver redhorse collected (0 -IX), of which 60. 4 % were represented by age groups IV-VI. The greatest increase during {{the second year of}} growth (l 33. 0 mm). The most important food items were Tendipedidae larvae (73. 3 % by number), and was Sphaeriidae (59. 5 % by volume). The golden redhorse exhibited seven age groups (0 -V and VII), with 68. 0 % belonging to age groups III and IV. The greatest mean annual increment was 108. 4 mm, which occurred. during the third year of growth. Food items of importance for golden redhorse included Tendipedidae larvae, Trichoptera larvae, and Ephemeroptera larvae. The <b>spotted</b> <b>sucker</b> was represented by seven age groups (0 -VI), of which 38. 5 % belonged to the IV age class. The greatest mean annual 1 ncrement was 105. 1 mm and occurred during the second year of growth. Crustaceans were the principle food consumed (98. 5 % by volume). The remaining members of the Family Catostomidae comprised 5. 8 % of the individuals collected. The true relative abundance of these groups was perhaps not determined because of sampling only in selected areas and the use of gear that was selective for movements by fish...|$|E
40|$|Whirling Disease (WD) {{is caused}} by the exotic {{parasite}} Myxobolus cerebralis (Mc) which was introduced into North America from Europe in 1956. WD has had extremely detrimental effects on native trout populations in the intermountain west. Mc has not yet been reported from Wisconsin and Minnesota. This study was initiated to assess the potential for WD becoming established in Wisconsin trout. We also began the process of evaluating the specificity of a new polymerase chain reaction assay designed for early detection of Me. Two-hundred and six fish representing 27 species from 11 sites were examined for parasites using standard necropsy procedures. No Mc were recovered. The infection rates for myxosporeans related to Mc, however, ranged from 0 to 66 %, and no trout species examined (brown, brook) were infected with myxosporeans. Many white suckers and redhorse which inhabit the same trout streams, as well as <b>spotted</b> <b>suckers</b> and carp from the Mississippi River, harbored myxosporeans whose spores were saved for use in testing the PCR assay specificity. We began the process of identifying these myxosporeans using classical morphometrics, and work is being continued at the La Crosse Fish Health Center, where it appears that this assay is indeed specific for Mc. We have also conducted surveys of benthos from the trout streams and established sever-al hopefully pure laboratory cultures of oligochaetes. These benthic samples are being examined for oligochaere community structure. Many specimens of Tubifex tubifex, the only known intermediate host for Me, have been identified from these streams, and their presence {{as well as that of}} susceptable salmonid species, suggests that conditions are appropriate for WD to establish in the Coulee region...|$|R
