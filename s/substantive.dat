5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to <b>substantive</b> rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than <b>substantive</b> rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a <b>substantive</b> legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

Although he was entitled to keep his AIF rank of major as an honorary rank, his <b>substantive</b> rank—and pay grade—was still lieutenant. Promotion was painfully slow. He was promoted to captain and brevet major on 1 March 1923, but was not promoted to the <b>substantive</b> rank of major until 1 March 1935.|$|E
5|$|Procedural due process, {{arising from}} the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is {{minimally}} the right to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in some circumstances rights to counsel and rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As <b>substantive</b> due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a <b>substantive</b> due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explains}} the term gender in linguistics and its reflection in English, Slovak, and Latin languages. The Slovak language expresses gender in <b>substantives,</b> adjectives, some pronouns, some numerals, {{and in the}} simple past tense of verbs in the 3 rd person singular.

For derivative <b>substantives</b> and adjectives, only two prefixes {{are still in}} use as of 1970: un-, which expresses negation (as in Ungesund from Gesund), and ur-, which means [...] "original, primitive" [...] in <b>substantives,</b> and has an emphatic function in adjectives. ge- expresses union or togetherness.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study six <b>substantives</b> that specialists agree belong to the ŭ-declension, and two <b>substantives</b> they agree belong to the o-declension, {{in order to find}} out more about the interplay between the two declensions in Old Church Slavonic. This is a period when it is {{difficult}} to say if some <b>substantives</b> were ŭ-stem <b>substantives</b> confused with o-declension case endings, or o-stem <b>substantives</b> influenced by the ŭ-declension case endings. 15 biblical and five non-biblical sources (menaea and miscellanies) from the 10 th, 11 th and 12 th centuries have been used as sources for the study. The results were analysed in the light of R. Lass’ theory on exaptation in language, and A. Ch. Vostokov’s thoughts on parallel use of both the ŭ- and o-declension case endings but in different syntactic situations (Vostokov 2007 : 92 wordlist). In conclusion, even if few occurrences of ŭ-stem <b>substantives</b> with o-declensions case endings were found, these were all from very early sources, and were replaced by the ŭ-declension case endings in later copies...|$|R

5|$|By {{applying}} post-structuralist {{theory to}} anarchism, Newman presents {{an account of}} post-anarchism.

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and <b>substantive</b> unfairness. <b>Substantive</b> legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and <b>substantive</b> due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and <b>substantive</b> due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{introduce}} a problem which was not very well developed prior {{to the implementation of}} the Czech National Corpus: Czech morphological variants. All these variants were analyzed from the perspective of different Czech grammar standards (Čechová, 2000; Česká mluvnice, 1981; Příruční mluvnice češtiny, 1995; Akademická mluvnice II, 1986; and Šmilauer, 1972), the Czech literary dictionary (Slovník spisovné češtiny pro školu a veřejnost, 2004) and the Czech National Corpus (Korpus Syn 2005). Analyzed variants were taken from all the Czech nouns: masculine animate and inanimate, feminine and neutral nouns. Due to the limited extension of this work, {{it was not possible to}} include variants from <b>substantives</b> with a variation in gender, adjectival <b>substantives,</b> indeclinable <b>substantives,</b> territorial <b>substantives</b> and personal <b>substantives.</b> These topics would have to be considered in a future work. The thesis consists of three chapters. The first chapter presents the theoretical basis of the work. In the first part of this chapter we analyze the composition of the Czech language from different points. Next, we define the concept of norm, use and codification, and the theory of the evolution of language. Finally, we highlight the concepts of variant within its differences.

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and <b>substantive</b> rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a <b>substantive</b> right. The recognition of <b>substantive</b> legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the <b>substantive</b> form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question.|$|E
5|$|Vasey held {{a series}} of staff postings in Australia and India. From 1928 to 1929 he {{attended}} the Staff College at Quetta, India, where Bernard Montgomery was an instructor. In October 1934 he was appointed as a brigade major once more. Following a brief stint as a GSO2 on the headquarters of the 1st Indian Division, his final posting in India was again as a brigade major, from April 1936 to March 1937. By November 1934 his <b>substantive</b> rank was that of captain, but while he held the brevet and local rank of major, he was not promoted to the <b>substantive</b> rank of major until 1 March 1935. Vasey was finally promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1937, after nearly 20 years as a major, although he was only promoted to the <b>substantive</b> rank on 2 November 1939. This was not unusual, and it fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among regular officers, who found themselves outranked by CMF officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E
