Nenova admitted in writing to injecting children with contaminated products that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> from the Palestinian Ashraf Al Hajuj.

While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, {{she knew she was}} not the studio's first choice and had to be patient (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. She celebrated when she learned <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> the part.|$|E

500|$|Charisma Carpenter had {{originally}} planned {{to read for}} the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were [...] "really responsive" [...] to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> the part. After Carpenter's audition, Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to Buffy, and to represent the characteristics of the less mature and shallower Buffy portrayed in the original film.|$|E

Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to close her career, while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal. However, while attending the Opals training camp in Canberra, she announced her retirement saying her conditions were not improved enough and she needed an [...] "absolute miracle" [...] to get into shape.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks she had said, [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. What {{do you know about}} politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep."

500|$|Hitoshi Sakimoto {{composed}} {{most of the}} game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, {{following his}} departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song, [...] "Kiss Me Good-Bye", sung by Angela Aki. Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing {{reminded him of his}} childhood idol, Elton John, {{which was one of the}} reasons he chose her. Aki was approached for the role three years before the release of the game. She based her words for the song on [...] "a scene of a new journey after good-bye", which was the sense <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> from Uematsu's melody, and was encouraged by Uematsu not to limit herself in her lyrics to what she thought the producers wanted. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Gaga began {{promoting}} the album {{through a series}} of public appearances with and without Bennett, the first of them being at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in New York City. At the school, which was founded by Bennett and his wife Susan Crow, the pair performed as a duo and individually, and fielded questions from the audience. They concluded their engagement by watching a performance from the school's choir. Two days after her performance at the school, Gaga showed a new tattoo of a Miles Davis trumpet <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> earlier. The singer posted a picture to her Instagram account of her getting the tattoo with Newman, announcing his involvement on the album while proclaiming, [...] "It's jazz time, world". Gaga also performed with Bennett at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and starred in a holiday commercial for retail company H, directed by Johan Renck and featuring [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If I Ain't Got That Swing)". The artists announced the news on Instagram. At the 2014 New York Fashion Week party, Gaga performed [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", dedicating it to her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney.|$|E
500|$|... {{wrote the}} {{developing}} romance between Daniel and Vala in [...] "Unending" [...] {{by having them}} have sex without a confrontation. Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because {{of the fear of}} getting too close." [...] Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed over the course of six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, [...] "You better not be messing with me", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes with a laugh, the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship.|$|E
