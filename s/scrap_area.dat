From the recovery process, the reaction rate is consistently {{to be first}} order to cupric ion. The activation energy for the process calculated from the Arrhenius plot indicates a chemical controlled process. The immersion of aluminium scraps into prepared cupric and cuprous solutions created a clean and depressed aluminium surface morphology. It is found that cuprous solution cements higher purity of copper than cupric solution. The aluminium <b>scrap</b> surface <b>area</b> also contributes to the purity of cemented copper. For a sample of copper bearing spent etching bath containing 131. 6 g L 1 copper, more than 99 % copper was recovered with 94. 4 % purity...|$|R

40|$|Lake Tohopekaliga {{is a large}} (surface area 9, 800 ha) {{and shallow}} (mean depth 2. 1 m) natural lake in central Florida. Cultural {{eutrophication}} and lake water level stabilization led to accelerated growth of invasive native and non-native aquatic macrophytes, resulting in the buildup of thick deposits of organic matter along the shoreline. Those shoreline areas were often devoid of oxygen, and the muck buildup filled feeding grounds for wading birds and spawning fish. Muck build up has also reduced aesthetics and boat access. To remove organic accumulation, the lake water level was dropped and heavy equipment was used to scrape the plants and dead organic materials from the underlying sand substrates from more than 1, 420 ha of the littoral zone. Most of this material was heaped into large piles in shallow parts of the lake to form 29 artificial islands with basal areas from 0. 4 to 3. 3 ha each. Our {{study was designed to}} determine: (1) amount of nutrients stored in islands relative to annual inflows, (2) nutrient release to the lake from the islands, and (3) changes in lake trophic state due to the muck scraping and construction of the islands. The lake enhancement project was completed in late summer 2004, and the average thickness of organic materials in the <b>scrapped</b> <b>areas</b> was reduced from 46 cm to 1. 6 cm, improving access and aesthetics tremendously. The islands stored several times the annual inflow of total phosphorus (TP, 3. 1 times) and Total Nitrogen (TN, 6. 5 times) and thus could potentially affect the lake’s trophic state by leaching nutrients. Our study of water quality in the vicin-ity of the islands indicates that the islands had no statistically significant impact on the water chemistry of the lak...|$|R

40|$|The use of laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) for scrap {{analysis has}} been evaluated for elemental monitoring of steel scrap loading an electrical arc furnace (EAF). A LIBS prototype was developed and installed during a field test above a pendulum conveying trough between the <b>scrap</b> charging <b>area</b> and the EAF, approx. 25 m from the EAF. The width and depth of the conveying trough filled with the scrap are approx. 2 m and 1 m, respectively. The average scrap velocity is adjusted to the EAF loading requirements within a range of 0. 3 to 5. 5 m/min, resulting in a scrap throughput of 100 tons per hour, typically. At the installation site, primarily, the detection of a high content of silicon in the low-alloy steel scrap is of interest for an improved control of the EAF. The on-line LIBS measurement showed the capability of detecting high silicon scrap in an industrial environment, although the developed prototype detected {{only a fraction of}} the scrap load surface due to the restricted measuring volume of 600 ? 600 ? 180 mm 3. Increasing the measuring volume should further improve the performance in order to exploit it for charging/process control and management...|$|R
5000|$|The lack of {{permanence}} of BRT {{has also been}} criticized, with some arguing that BRT systems {{can be used as}} an excuse to build roads that others later try to convert for use by non-BRT vehicles. Examples of this can be found in Delhi, where a BRT system was scrapped, and in Aspen, where drivers are lobbying the government to allow mixed-use traffic in former BRT lanes as of 2017. Similarly, the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce has called for bus lanes to be <b>scrapped</b> in certain <b>areas</b> of the city [...] "as an experiment." [...] Bangkok was also making plans to scrap a set of bus-only lanes, as of early 2017. This perceived lack of permanence has made BRT lines significantly less attractive to real estate developers than rail lines.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{pollution}} of soil (5300 m 2) used as temporarily steel scrap storage at the CMC Sisak Ltd. was investigated. Concentrations of heavy metals, namely Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in soil were determined after their extraction in aqua regia. Concentrations of heavy metals, except Hg, were measured by inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry. Concentration of Hg {{was determined by}} atomic absorption spectrometry. For a number of years, steel scrap (raw material for steel production) was temporarily stored in the unprotected steel <b>scrap</b> yard <b>area.</b> To assess pollution level of soil under the scrap yard, comparison was done between levels of heavy metal concentrations in analysed samples and reference sample taken outside the factory ground with the levels representing tolerance for potentially unacceptable risk for industrially used soil according to the Croatian Soil Monitoring Programme. Levels were also compared with the values permitted by some EU member countries. Concentrations of heavy metals in all samples collected from the scrap yard showed higher values of heavy metals compared to the reference sample concentrations. Also, values are higher than those defined as potentially unacceptable risk for industrially used soil according to legislation of some EU member countries. Obtained results qualify analysed soil from the scrap yard as contaminated soil, caused by its use over a long time as a temporarily storage space of steel scrap on unprotected and roofless soil. In future, steel storage areas should be built {{in a way to}} prevent soil pollution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} going to be devoted to the establishment of scrapping in Germany which began in 2009 {{as a result of the}} global financial crisis. An introduction of the scrapping in Germany highly interferes to functioning of the market because of its strong car industry. The thesis {{is going to}} focus on an impact of <b>scrapping</b> in several <b>areas</b> such as an effect on the Gross domestic product, the car industry, the employment in the car industry and the financial development of the car factories Volkswagen and BMW. The crucial part of the thesis is the practical part which is going to work with an available data about the economics in the Federal Republic of Germany in years 2008 and 2009 (partially 2010) from the research of German Statistical office, appropriate ministry and further professional studies. The theoretical part of the thesis {{is going to be}} based on effectiveness of the state policy and the influence of long-term and short-term Economic Policy on economical situation. The thesis is going to marginally include an effect of lobbyism in politics which leads to an establishment of supportive moves in specific branches of industry at the expense of other branches. The purpose of my thesis is to try to determine if the introduction of scrapping is as a whole positive or negative event for society...|$|R
5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food <b>scraps</b> in urban <b>areas,</b> such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} mining activities at Bulyanhulu Gold Mine (BGM) on the water quality of Bulyanhulu River in Tanzania. Potential pollutants were identified, quantified and their spatial distribution determined along different sampling points upstream and downstream the mine. The water quality {{of the river and}} groundwater in the area is of importance as the water is used for agriculture and domestic purposes. Grab samples were collected from Bulyanhulu River, shallow wells, Effluent Control Ponds (ECPâ€™s) and boreholes during the period January-March 2008 and analyzed for Temp, pH, EC, SO 42 +, Fe, Ni, Ag, As, Hg, CN-, NO 3 - and Zn according to Standard methods. The pH values in water samples were 6. 3 Â± 1. 4 in ECP, 7. 0 Â± 0. 2 in river, 5. 9 Â± 0. 4 i n boreholes and 5. 2 Â± 0. 3 in wells. The conductivity in ECP, river, boreholes and wells sample were 1969 Â± 470 Î¼S/cm, 207 Â± 46 Î¼S/cm, 1023 Â± 497 Î¼S/cm and 203 Â± 112 Î¼S/cm respectively. The mean SO 42 + concentrations in ECP, river, boreholes and well sample points were 1014 Â± 353 mg/l, 70 Â± 30 mg/l, 497 Â± 205 mg/l and 181 Â± 0 mg/l. The temperature values were 26 Â± 1 Â°C for ECP, 24 Â± 1 Â°C for the river, 25 Â± 1 Â°C for boreholes and 24 Â± 1 Â°C for wells. Values of NO 3 - for ECP were 5 Â± 1 mg/l, 4 Â± 2 mg/l for river, 5 Â± 3 mg/l for boreholes and 4 Â± 3 mg/l for wells. Results for Ag were 0. 1 Â± 0. 1 mg/l for ECP, 0. 1 Â± 0 mg/l for the river, 0. 1 Â± 0 mg/l for boreholes and < 0. 005 mg/l for wells. Results for Ni were 0. 7 Â± 0. 3 mg/l for ECP, 0. 4 Â± 0. 3 mg/l for the river, 0. 04 Â± 0. 03 mg/l for boreholes and 0. 2 Â± 0. 1 mg/l for wells. Concentrations of Fe for ECP were 7. 2 Â± 3 mg/l, 2. 9 Â± 0. 13 mg/l for the river, 0. 3 Â± 0. 4 mg/l for boreholes and 0. 2 Â± 0. 13 mg/l for wells. Concentrations of Zn in ECP, river, borehole and well samples were 13. 0 Â± 7. 0 mg/l, 1. 8 Â± 0. 8 mg/l, 4. 0 Â± 2. 0 mg/l and 2. 5 Â± 0. 8 mg/l. Water quality of the Bulyanhulu River, shallow wells and monitoring boreholes were compared against Tanzanian maximum permissible concentration and WHO drinking water quality guidelines while Effluent Control Pond values were compared against the Tanzanian effluent discharge maximum permissible concentration guidelines. The concentrations of As, Hg and CN- were low (below method detection limit). The high concentrations of these param eters could be attributed to weathering of sulphide ore bodies, chemicals used in the process plant, decomposition and leaching of discarded batteries and old metal <b>scraps</b> in mine <b>areas.</b> These elements could relatively have high toxicological effects in the environment, biota and health hazards to human beings especially in the mining communities. It was concluded that, the water quality of the river is polluted with respect to Ni, Fe and slightly by Zn and was therefore, considered not suitable for human consumption. Groundwater quality was affected by mining activities with respect to pH, EC, SO 42 +, Ni and Zn however; EC and SO 42 + affected the boreholes more. The ECPâ€™s showed highest mean concentrations of all elements studied. It is therefore, recommended to treat the effluents in the ECPâ€™s by precipitating out metals thus reducing their mobility through seepage. The existing monitoring Programme for BGM needs improvement.,WATERne...|$|R
