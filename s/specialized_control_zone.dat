40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that a <b>specialized</b> polarizing <b>zone</b> <b>controls</b> {{the pattern of}} the anterior-posterior axis during limb development in Xenopus has been tested by analysing the cellular contribution to supernumer-ary limbs. Supernumerary limbs were generated by grafting hindlimb buds contralaterally between X. borealis and X. laevis to appose anterior and posterior limb tissues. Cells derived from these two species of Xenopus are readily identified by staining with quinacrine. The analysis of cellular contri-bution showed that supernumerary limbs consist of approximately half anterior-derived (57 %) and half posterior-derived (43 %) cells. These data are not consistent with the polarizing zone theory but are consistent with the {{hypothesis that}} both super-numerary limbs and normally developing limbs arise from intercalary interactions between limb bud cells with different positional values. Key words: pattern formation, Xenopus, supernumerary limbs, limb development, cell marker...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of}} poses screen pre-impregnated (PSP) installed at openings and eaves of dwellings in the reduction of malaria transmission in the commune of Aguégués in Bénin. MethodsThe PSP were manufactured from preimpregnated Olyset Net. They were installed at windows, eaves and doors of 70 dwellings. 320 children aged 6 - 59 months were treated and 311 children were recruited in the <b>control</b> <b>zone.</b> Variables measured are: plasmodic index (IP), gametocyte index, parasite density (PD), fever, hemoglobin, anemia. ResultsThe global IP was 16. 62 % with PSP and 72. 20 % without PSP. Gametocyte index {{did not differ significantly}} between the treated zone (27. 8) and the <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> (29. 1). The total geometric mean of DP was 309 in the treated zone and 600 in the <b>control</b> <b>zone.</b> Hemoglobin level is 8. 7 in the <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> and 9. 5 in the treated zone. We noted a predominance of anemia in the <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> compared to the treated zone.

40|$|The current {{numerical}} calculation of particulate formation during char combustion mainly adopts the two-dimensional model. In this paper, {{based on the}} introduction of the concept of diffusion depth, the char combustion is simulated with a three-dimensional model. The modified model can simulate the actual situation that the reactant gas dose not diffuse into the char completely. The approach to realize the combustion process of char in chemical <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone I) and transitional <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone II) is given, and the results are compared with those in the diffusion <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone III). The characteristic impact of initial porosity and mineral content on particulate formation in different zones is analyzed through the simulation and comparison. It {{can be seen from the}} results that the diffusion depth do put some limits on char fragmentation and mass distribution of ash particulates, which provides theoretical basis for the further study of particulate formation during char combustion and the reduction of particulate emission...|$|R
