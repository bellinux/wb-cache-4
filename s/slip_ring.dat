25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a single axis {{orientation}} mechanism for solar arrays on high power synchronous satellites is studied primarily with respect to providing 116 liquid metal <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for reduced friction and improved electrical characteristics. Designs and tradeoff studies for the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> and other components are presented. An assembly containing 33 <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> of three design approaches was designed, fabricated, and vacuum tested to 30 amperes and 30, 000 volts. Containment of the liquid metal gallium in large diameter <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> was difficult.

50|$|This {{mechanism}} is intended {{as an alternative}} to the usual method of supplying electric power to a rotating device, the use of <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are attached to one part of the machine, and a set of fine metal brushes are attached to the other part. The brushes are kept in sliding contact with the <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> providing an electrical path between the two parts while allowing the parts to rotate about each other.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for coupling. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> however inject commutator noise {{into the}} connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|R
25|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a mechanism}} used to switch {{the input of}} most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> segments insulated {{from each other and}} from the electric motor's shaft. The motor's armature current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole. In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of significant advances {{in the past few decades}} due to improved technologies in electronic controller, sensorless control, induction motor, and permanent magnet motor fields, electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors.|$|E
2500|$|The ANT-18 {{has three}} main sets of bellows. One {{set of four}} bellows (fore and aft and {{both sides of the}} cockpit) {{controls}} movement in the pitch and roll planes. A very complicated set of bellows {{at the front of the}} fuselage controls movement in the yaw plane. This Turning Motor is a complex set of 10 bellows, two crank shafts and various gears and pulleys derived from early player piano motors. [...] The Turning Motor can rotate the entire fuselage through 360 degree circles at variable rates of speed. [...] A set of electrical <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> contacts in the lower base compartment supplies electrical continuity between the fixed base and the movable fuselage.|$|E

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} shaped rotor {{is made of}} a {{solid steel}} shaft with slots running along the outside length of the cylinder for holding the field windings of the rotor which are laminated copper bars inserted into the slots and is secured by wedges. The slots are insulated from the windings and are held {{at the end of}} the rotor by <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> An external direct current (DC) source is connected to the concentrically mounted <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> with brushes running along the rings. The brushes make electrical contact with the rotating <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> DC current is also supplied through brushless excitation from a rectifier mounted on the machine shaft that converts alternating current to direct current.|$|R

50|$|Some {{other names}} used for <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> are {{collector}} ring, rotary electrical contact and electrical <b>slip</b> <b>ring.</b> Some people {{also use the}} term commutator; however, commutators are somewhat different and are specialized for use on DC motors and generators. While commutators are segmented, slip rings are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. Rotary transformers are often used instead of slip rings in high-speed or low-friction environments.|$|E
50|$|DFIG for Double Fed Induction Generator, a {{generating}} principle {{widely used}} in wind turbines. It {{is based on an}} induction generator with a multiphase wound rotor and a multiphase <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly with brushes for access to the rotor windings. It is possible to avoid the multiphase <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly (see brushless doubly-fed electric machines), but there are problems with efficiency, cost and size. A better alternative is a brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine.|$|E
50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly or standard electrical <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Several {{brushless}} concepts {{have also}} been developed {{in order to get}} rid of the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> that require maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Encryption {{itself was}} {{provided}} through a single half-rotor; input contacts were through <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> {{each of which}} connected to a single output contact on the rotor. Since both the vowels and consonants were passed through the same rotor, it had sixty contacts (the least common multiple of six and twenty); wiring ensured that {{the two groups were}} kept separate. The <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> were connected to the input keyboard through a plugboard; again this was organized to keep the vowels and consonants separate.|$|R
50|$|In {{wound rotor}} motors, rotor circuit {{connection}} through <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> to external resistances allows change of speed-torque characteristics for acceleration control and speed control purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|E
50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> motor has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, {{and the current}} lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the <b>slip</b> <b>ring.</b> Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|E

50|$|A {{brushless}} {{electric motor}} is an electric motor driven by an electrical input, which lacks any form of commutator or <b>slip</b> <b>ring.</b> The motor requires some form of alternating current to turn, either from an AC supply, or an electronic circuit.|$|E
