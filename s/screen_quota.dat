50|$|Screen quotas are a legislated {{policy that}} enforces a {{minimum number of}} {{screening}} days of domestic films in the theater each year to protect the nation’s films. The <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system is enforced to prevent foreign markets from making inroads into the domestic film market. The <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system was started in the United Kingdom in 1927 through the Cinematograph Films Act 1927. Other countries enforcing screen quotas include France, South Korea, Brazil, Pakistan and Italy.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Current situation=== The {{amendment}} of decreasing screening days to 73 days is {{in effect}} today. Mainly two factors contributed to the ratification of amendment. First, United States continued demand for the alleviation of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b> Due to the change in industry structure, Hollywood suffered from increased deficit in its domestic market. One {{way to deal with}} this problem was to increase exportation by expanding into the foreign market. By 2004, the South Korean government suggested FTA (Free Trade Agreement) rather than BIT but the United States was hesitant in considering it. The American government urged that South Korea cannot start FTA and continue <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> act at the same time. The US demanded an effort to loosen <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> system before initiating FTA. This contributed to the alleviation of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas,</b> since the American government had been constantly requesting the abolition of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> since South Korea- America BIT in 1998 while no change have been made, it was not a decisive factor.|$|R
25|$|Lee {{was against}} the halving of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> in South Korea that allows foreign films to be shown in theaters on certain days, while {{domestic}} films are allotted another amount of days. He believed that without the <b>screen</b> <b>quotas,</b> The King and the Clown {{would not have been}} as successful in competing against foreign films.|$|R
50|$|When the {{decision}} to limit <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> was notified to the public however, Korean movie industry vehemently opposed to the change. The movie industry strongly criticized both the South Korean and American government and struggled to resist the amendments. As the objection grew serious, the issue grasped {{the attention of the}} public. Under the name of protecting cultural sovereignty, many in the country sympathized with the movie industry and condemned lessening of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b>|$|R
50|$|I Saw the Devil was Choi Min-sik's {{first major}} role since {{the changes to}} the Korean <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system. The film {{received}} generally positive reviews with praise towards the acting, direction, cinematography and script.|$|E
50|$|The recent {{decision}} of the South Korean government to reduce the screen quotas system was due to heavy pressure from the U.S.A. trade negotiators after the talks between South Korea and United States for Free Trade Agreement FTA. The example of Mexico shows the fatal result of {{the ending of the}} <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system. Mexico enforced the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system to prevent being swallowed up by inflow from Hollywood, but repealed the system under pressure from the United States in 1994 when Mexico made the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. As a result, the film industry in Mexico has suffered majorly in the 10 years following the establishment of NAFTA despite the rapid growth of the Mexican economy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} four years, Choi went on a self-imposed exile from making films, begun in protest over the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> but also {{partly due to the}} studios' {{reluctance}} to hire the outspoken and politically active actor. Instead he returned to his theater roots in the 2007 staging of The Pillowman, his first play in seven years.|$|E
50|$|The {{controversy}} {{of limiting}} <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> initially stemmed from South Korea-America BIT (Bilateral Investment Treaty). As {{a solution to}} South Korea's foreign exchange crisis in 1997, President Kim Daejung suggested BIT between South Korea and the United States in a hope that it would increase credibility of South Korean economy, thus boosting foreign investments. In June 1998, President Kim and Bill Clinton agreed to enforce BIT during Kim’s visit to the US American government requested several requirements in opening South Korean market, including the alleviation of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b> American government called for the reduction and abolition of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> {{for the sake of}} Hollywood’s expansion. Initially, the South Korean government did not expect this to be much of a problem that it agreed to consider it. The representatives tried to reach an agreement by decreasing the duration of screening days to a certain extent.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the success}} of the film Shiri in 1999, the Korean film {{industry}} has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.|$|R
50|$|American {{films are}} also {{extremely}} popular {{around the world}} (even animated films, most notably those from Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Illumination), often dominating cinemas {{as a result of}} a high demand of US product exported to consumers to clear away the outlook of World War II. Out of the top-50 highest-grossing films of all time, 35 of them were made in the United States, with the top-3 all being American. Often part of the negotiating in free trade agreements between the U.S. and other nations involves <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b> One such case is Mexico, which abolished <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> following the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. Recently South Korea has agreed to reduce its quota under pressure from the U.S. as part of a free trade deal.|$|R

[...] It was delivered to the French embassy in South Korea by the French Minister of Culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres during an official visit.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the opponents}} of the quota system, the {{domestic}} film makers have mass-produced low quality films to meet the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system. As a result, the system leads to the waste of money and human resources and it is most important to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic film under the competitive atmosphere.Messerlin and Parc (2014) and Parc (2017) described precisely the side-effects of screen quotas in the Korean film industry.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the success}} of the Korean film Shiri in 1999, Korean film has become much more popular, both in South Korea and abroad. Today South Korea {{is one of the few}} {{countries}} where Hollywood productions do not enjoy a dominant share of the domestic market. This fact, however, is partly due to the existence of <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, the Studio was {{purchased}} by Archibald Nettlefold, and renamed as Nettlefold Studios, and began producing comedy silent films, until it was upgraded to sound production {{with the advent of}} sound film in the early 1930s. The 1930s saw the Studio mainly producing what were known in the industry as Quota Quickies as part of the Government's <b>Screen</b> <b>Quotas</b> programme to try to protect England's cinematic production industry from the rapidly developing commercial threat from the United States of America's Hollywood production centre.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} industry, <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> were {{introduced}} in South Korea during Park Chung-hee's presidency to restrict the number of foreign films shown in cinemas. These were intended to prevent competition between domestic films and foreign blockbuster movies. However, in 1986, the Motion Pictures Exporters Association of America filed a complaint to the United States Senate regarding the regulations imposed by the South Korean government, which was compelled to lift the restrictions. In 1988, Twentieth Century Fox became the first American film studio {{to set up a}} distribution office in South Korea, followed by Warner Brothers (1989), Columbia (1990), and Walt Disney (1993).|$|R
5000|$|South Korean cinema has had {{domestic}} box-office success exceeding that of Hollywood films {{since the}} late 1990s, largely due to laws {{limiting the number of}} foreign films per theater per year. The <b>screen</b> <b>quota,</b> in existence since 1967, limits the number of days per year that foreign films can be shown on a given South Korean screen and has been criticized by film distributors outside South Korea as unfair. As a prerequisite for negotiations with the United States for a free-trade agreement, the Korean government cut its annual <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> for domestic films from 146 days to 73 (allowing more foreign films to enter the market). In February 2006, South Korean movie workers staged mass rallies to protest the cut. According to Kim Hyun, [...] "South Korea's movie industry, like that of most countries, is grossly overshadowed by Hollywood. The nation exported US$2 million-worth of movies to the United States last year and imported $35.9 million-worth". [...] 2017 studies by Parc and Messerlin & Parc described several consequences of the screen-quota cut.|$|E
50|$|Struggling due to {{government}} regulations, imported Hollywood films, and increase in popularity of televisions, Korean movie industry {{did not have}} any choice to enforce <b>Screen</b> <b>Quota.</b> The projected image of Korean cinema in the <b>Screen</b> <b>Quota</b> protests was of a fragile, vulnerable industry. However, in Feb. 1999 Korean cinema would present a very different image of itself to the world with the release of Shiri. Shiri featured shootouts on urban streets, exploding buildings, car chases, ticking bombs, and other narrative and visual clichés of big-budget action films from Hollywood. At the same time, it incorporated a melodramatic love story, which was very common and popular theme in Korean films and dramas. The film borrowed liberally from the model of the Hollywood blockbusters, but in addressing Korean themes it sought to be recognized and accepted as a local work. It offered big budget spectacle, special effects, star power, and a politically resonant theme. These factors turned the film into something more special than imported Hollywood blockbuster films, and the film {{became one of the most}} popular films in Korea and was successful financially. Shiri’s most lasting effect may have been to impart to the industry a sense of expanding possibilities and self-confidence because it opened a door for Korean blockbuster films.|$|E
50|$|The Cinematograph Films Council was {{established}} by the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 {{as a result of}} a Board of Trade report by a committee chaired by Lord Moyne, which recommended that such a statutory body should be created to advise the UK government on matters relating to the film industry. Among its specific functions was the monitoring of a so-called 'quality test' (based on cost per foot of finished film) that was to be applied under the Act to films which sought registration as British under the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> to eliminate quota quickies.|$|E
40|$|The rising Korean cinema has {{inspired}} {{a flurry of}} new understandings of the nation’s media and cultural policies. However, there remains {{a gap in the}} historical factors leading to this phenomenon, regarding particularly Hollywood’s long-term negotiations with import and <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b> This study charts Hollywood’s export activities in Korea and analyzes differences between the US economic approach to film as ‘goods’ and Korean view of films as ‘cultural expressions’. The Korean government’s perseverance to safeguard film as cultural heritage and its ability to stand-up against relentless trade pressures from the US have led to the contemporary Korean cinema’s tangible success. Ironically, a brood of American films, which flooded Korea after 1988, helped raise this tiger from its slumber and the subsequent spread of Hallyu the so-called Korean wave, across East Asia and the globe...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the state}} undersecretary {{in charge of}} {{entertainment}} in 1949, Andreotti established import limits and <b>screen</b> <b>quotas,</b> and provided loans to Italian production firms. The measures were aimed at preventing American productions from dominating the market against Neorealist films, a genre which exhibitors complained lacked stars and was held in low esteem by the public. As he phrased it, {{there were to be}} 'Less rags, more legs'. Raunchy comedies and historical dramas with voluptuous toga-clad actresses became the staple of the Italian film industry. To ensure that state funds were not used to prop up commercially unsustainable films, the screenplays were vetted, thereby creating a form of preproduction censorship. It was intended that Italian studios use part of their profits for high-quality films. However, Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D., which depicted the lonely life of a retired man, could only strike government officials as a dangerous throwback, due to the opening scene featuring police breaking up a demonstration of old pensioners and the ending scene featuring Umberto's aborted suicide attempt. In a public letter to De Sica, Andreotti castigated him for his [...] "wretched service to his fatherland." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ==In other countries== The United Kingdom is {{the first}} country to enforce <b>screen</b> <b>quotas</b> under the Cinematograph Films Act 1927. It {{introduced}} a requirement for British cinemas to show a quota of British films for a duration of 10 years. The Act's supporters believed that this would promote {{the emergence of a}} vertically integrated film industry, in which production, distribution and exhibition infrastructure are controlled by the same companies. The vertically integrated American film industry saw rapid growth in the years immediately following the end of World War I. The idea, therefore, was to try and counter Hollywood's perceived economic and cultural dominance by promoting similar business practices among British studios, distributors and cinema chains. By creating an artificial market for British films, it was hoped that the increased economic activity in the production sector would eventually lead to the growth of a self-sustaining industry. The quota was initially set at 7.5% for exhibitors, which was raised to 20% in 1935. However, the act is generally not considered as a success, with an absurd influx of poorly made films being produced known as [...] "Quota Quickies" [...] which were produced purely to fulfill the act. Though 192 films were produced in 1936 alone. Later, The Act was modified by the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 and further acts, and eventually quotas (and levy rates) were abolished in the Films Act 1985.|$|R
50|$|In South Korea, the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> {{has contributed}} to the rapid {{increase}} in the film market. Until the 1990s, the Korean film market had lacked the ability to raise capital funds for films. The quality of Korean films has increased dramatically, with an inflow of capital funds into South Korean film market since 2000. The government has decided to reduce its 40-year-old screen quotas from 146 days to 73 days in 2006. As a result of the free trade agreement between South Korea and the United States, which was agreed on April 2, 2007, the screen quotas in South Korea will not be subject to change from the current 73 days.|$|E
5000|$|... 2007 {{was a poor}} {{year for}} South Korean cinema, {{largely due to the}} reduced <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> from 146 to 73 days as part of the 2007 free trade {{agreement}} between the US and South Korea. This resulted in production costs rising, a series of box office failures, and the number of Korean films sold overseas dropping. During May 2008, only 7.8% of films shown in South Korea were Korean, the lowest level since records began in 2000. It was hoped that the Korean film industry might rally behind Public Enemy Returns. The film sold 4,337,983 tickets nationwide and was the 4th most attended film of 2008.|$|E
5000|$|At {{various points}} during 2006, Choi (and other South Korean film {{industry}} professionals, together and separately from Choi) demonstrated in Seoul {{and at the}} Cannes Film Festival against the South Korean administration's decision to reduce the Screen Quotas from 146 to 73 days {{as part of the}} Free Trade Agreement with the United States. As a sign of protest, Choi returned the prestigious Okgwan Order of Cultural Merit which had been awarded to him, saying, [...] "To halve the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> is tantamount to a death sentence for Korean film.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of various {{policies}} to reduce rent seeking in the controlled market in which buyers have heterogeneous valuation regarding the coveted good. The good is allocated according to the buyer-specific signal ('test score'), which {{is determined by the}} quantity of wasteful 'rent seeking' exerted by the buyer. We consider three common forms of market control: minimum qualification score, quota, and price ceiling. The potential buyers with higher valuations are more likely to receive the good in equilibrium, while they exert more rent-seeking efforts. Marginally relaxing market control does not necessarily decrease the aggregated amount of rent-seeking activities, and the effectiveness of policy measures usually depends on the current degree of competitiveness in the market.

40|$|Executive Summary From 1906 to 1911, Australia was {{the most}} {{prolific}} producer of feature films in the world. During this period, Australian producers had easy access to cinema screens as supplies of overseas films were irregular. This success began to decline in 1913 when a series of takeovers and mergers in distribution and exhibition {{led to the creation}} of the monopolistic ‘Combine’, trading as Australasian Films. However, Australasian Films’ market position was gradually eroded as Hollywood studios – the world leaders in film production following European decline during the war – began to establish distribution branches in Australia during and after World War I. The US studios also began to exercise de facto control of the exhibition sector through what was known as ‘the contract system’ which required exhibitors to take all or most of a studio’s output over a given period, generally three, six or 12 months. Overseas domination of the exhibition sector was formalised in 1931 when the Fox Film Company acquired a controlling share of the largest cinema chain, Hoyts, ensuring priority for US product. Australian feature filmmaking faced further challenges in the following years with the Depression and the debilitating increase in production costs associated with the introduction of sound. And while some producers – most notably Cinesound – had partial success in the 1930 s, World War II almost fatally disrupted production allowing the industry to sink over the following 30 years, reaching its lowest point by the end of the Sixties. Two inquiries held in 1927 and 1934 attempted to act on the problems facing the industry, the latter NSW inquiry introducing <b>screen</b> <b>quotas.</b> However, the quotas were ultimately unsuccessful because of foreign distributor resistance and the lack of government support for finance and low cost studio facilities. Film production in Australia has long been the poor cousin of exhibition and distribution. Film production is high cost and high risk. The campaigns against the film quota showed that once foreign interests had established dominance in Australia they were not prepared to tolerate measures to promote the industry. Despite promising beginnings, for 50 years Australian feature films did not achieve investment and distribution in proportion to their undeniable potential and merit. It was only in the 1970 s when the feature film industry received comprehensive support in the form of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS) and the Australian Film Development Corporation (AFDC) (later the Australian Film Commission (AFC)), that the film industry began to expand...|$|R
50|$|Shiri (1999), about a North Korean spy {{preparing}} a coup in Seoul, {{was the first}} film in Korean history to sell {{more than two million}} tickets in the capital city. Its popularity, combined with the <b>screen</b> <b>quota,</b> helped Shiri to surpass Hollywood box-office hits such as Titanic, The Matrix and Star Wars in South Korean theaters. In 2000, Joint Security Area was more successful than Shiri; a year later, Friend did the same. The romantic comedy My Sassy Girl was more successful than The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, released {{at the same time in}} South Korea. New films continued to outperform older releases in 2004, and Korean productions attracted bigger audiences than Hollywood films; Silmido and Taegukgi were each seen by over 10 million people domestically.|$|E
50|$|The {{major factor}} was {{the change in}} Ministry of Culture and Tourism’s stance. Until June 2004, the {{ministry}} had consistently sided with the pro screen quotas. The minister Lee Changdong had a background as a movie director and a political chairman of anti-screen quota union. Thus, the minister used to hold a firm stance toward continuation of screen quotas. However, there were several political barriers that resisted Lee from holding onto his belief. The dominant opinion of the politics was that screen quotas should quickly {{be dealt with by}} accepting the requirements of America. The government also argued that the <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> was paralysing other important policies. Moreover, President Roh Muhyeon had a firm belief that South Korea - America FTA should be signed as fast as possible, with all the obstacles such as screen quotas being solved quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Chung Ji-young honed his {{directing}} {{skills by}} {{working as an}} assistant director to legendary filmmaker Kim Soo-yong. Chung, whose feature debut was an erotic mystery, The Mist Whispers Like a Woman (1982), also directed about 20 episodes of the MBC single-episode anthology drama series Best Theater. He spent {{the majority of the}} 1980s directing melodramatic fare before moving on to more politically-charged works following the end of the Chun Doo-hwan administration. During his heyday, Chung helmed some of the most hard-hitting and socially conscious films of the 1980s and 1990s such as North Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990), White Badge (1992), and Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid (1994). But his influence on the industry extended far beyond his filmography, as he was also a fierce advocate for governmental reform, particularly as it affected the Korean film industry. As a leading voice in the Chungmuro filmmaking community, he argued {{for the establishment of a}} <b>screen</b> <b>quota</b> system, the abolishment of the pre-censorship system, campaigned against direct distribution of foreign movies, and was opposed to the signing of the Korea-USA free trade agreement, among other issues confronting the industry at the time.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: CT colonography (CTC) {{may be an}} {{acceptable}} test for colorectal cancer screening but bowel preparation can be a barrier to uptake. This study tested the hypothesis that prospective screening invitees would prefer full-laxative preparation with higher sensitivity and specificity for polyps, despite greater burden, over less burdensome reduced-laxative or non-laxative alternatives with lower sensitivity and specificity. Design: Discrete choice experiment. Setting: Online, web-based survey. Participants: 2819 adults (45 – 54  years) from the UK responded to an online invitation {{to take part in}} a cancer <b>screening</b> study. <b>Quota</b> sampling ensured that the sample reflected key demographics of the target population and had no relevant bowel disease or medical qualifications. The analysis comprised 607 participants. Interventions: After receiving information about screening and CTC, participants completed 3 – 4 choice scenarios. Scenarios showed two hypothetical forms of CTC with different permutations of three attributes: preparation, sensitivity and specificity for polyps. Primary outcome measures: Participants considered the trade-offs in each scenario and stated their preferred test (or chose neither). Results: Preparation and sensitivity for polyps were both significant predictors of preferences (coefficients: − 3. 834 to − 6. 346 for preparation, 0. 207 – 0. 257 for sensitivity; p< 0. 0005). These attributes predicted preferences to a similar extent. Realistic specificity values were non-significant (− 0. 002 to 0. 025; p= 0. 953). Contrary to our hypothesis, probabilities of selecting tests were similar for realistic forms of full-laxative, reduced-laxative and non-laxative preparations (0. 362 – 0. 421). However, they were substantially higher for hypothetical improved forms of reduced-laxative or non-laxative preparations with better sensitivity for polyps (0. 584 – 0. 837). Conclusions: Uptake of CTC following non-laxative or reduced-laxative preparations is unlikely to be greater than following full-laxative preparation as perceived gains from reduced burden may be diminished by reduced sensitivity. However, both attributes are important so a more sensitive form of reduced-laxative or non-laxative preparation might improve uptake substantially...|$|R
40|$|Self {{reported}} smoking {{status is}} the primary measure of smoking status for research and policy, providing both a cheaper and more widely accepted indicator than biochemical validation. It is employed in observational studies where analyses seek to explain how socioeconomic background exerts an influence on smoking behaviour. Self report is used, too, for evaluating the effects of population based tobacco control policies and for assessing progress against national and state level targets to reduce smoking prevalence. For the general population, self reported measures {{have been found to}} provide reliable estimates of smoking status when cotinine validated, 1, 2 without systematic differentials in under-reporting by socioeconomic group. 3, 4 However, self report is a less reliable measure for the pregnant population, where smokers can feel under greater pressure to describe themselves as non-smokers. For this population, validated prevalence rates {{have been found to be}} substantially higher than self reported rates. 5, 6 A related, but neglected, question is whether rates of under-reporting vary between socioeconomic groups. Answering the question of whether there is a misclassification bias in the primary measure of smoking status in pregnancy is important for smoking research and tobacco control policy. It is particularly important for monitoring socioeconomic trends in smoking in pregnancy, and for evaluating the effectiveness of policies to reduce prevalence in lower socioeconomic groups. We examined under-reporting by socioeconomic group in a British pregnancy study with information on self report and biochemical smoking status, and on socioeconomic status. The study was based on a national quota survey of 1009 pregnant women in England, conducted in 1999. Participants were located by doorstep <b>screening,</b> with <b>quotas</b> set to match the age and social class profile of the general population of women of childbearing age (15 – 44 years). Data were collected in home interviews. Rates of current smoking by age and socioeconomic factors were in line with other population surveys. Full details of the sampling and methods are published elsewhere. 7, 8 Those participants who answered "yes" to the question "Do you smoke cigarettes at all nowadays?" were defined as smokers. Cotinine validation was provided using saliva samples collected at the end of each interview, using standard methods and with cotinine concentration determined by gas chromatography. 9 Dichotomous measures of socioeconomic group were constructed from data on occupation of main earner (non-manual/manual), age left full time education (15 – 16 / 17) and housing tenure (owner occupied/rented). 2 was used to test whether differences between self reported and cotinine validated smoking rates differed by socioeconomic group. A total of 832 respondents (82. 5 %) provided a saliva sample for cotinine analysis. Of these, 585 (70. 3 % or 58. 0 % of the full sample) provided a useable sample. The provision of a saliva sample was not associated with self reported smoking status, age, or socioeconomic group. The optimal cut-off level for discriminating between smokers and non-smokers using saliva cotinine is 14. 2 ng/ml. 10 Seventeen non-smokers had values above the cut-off of 14 ng/ml. In line with other studies, validated prevalence rates were higher than self reported rates in all socioeconomic groups (table 1). The proportion of self reported smokers who were reclassified as smokers following cotinine validation was also similar across socioeconomic groups on all measures. There were no significant differences in rates of under-reporting in pregnancy by occupational class, education or tenure (table 1). Our study suggests that, as in the general population, the use of self reported smoking status will not introduce systematic biases into explanatory studies seeking to understand why there are socioeconomic gradients in smoking in pregnancy. It indicates, too, that, with appropriate adjustment for under-reporting evident in all socioeconomic groups, self reports can be used in policy oriented studies to monitor socioeconomic trends in smoking in pregnancy, and to evaluate the impact of interventions on socioeconomic differentials in smoking status. A limitation of the study is its sample size and its restriction to one national population. Further studies with appropriate measures of smoking status and socioeconomic status are recommended to confirm the generalisability of our finding...|$|R
