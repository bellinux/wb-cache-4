25|$|While {{intercity}} {{passenger rail}} travel {{declined in the}} United States during the 1950s, ridership continued to increase in Europe during that time. With the increase came newer technology on existing and new equipment. The Spanish company Talgo began experimenting in the 1940s with technology that would enable the axles to steer into a curve, allowing the train to move around the curve at a higher speed. The <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> evolved into mechanisms that would also tilt the passenger car as it entered a curve to counter the centrifugal force experienced by the train, further increasing speeds on existing track. Today, tilting passenger trains are commonplace. Talgo's trains are used on some short and medium distance routes such as Amtrak Cascades from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

50|$|In both {{road and}} rail vehicles, the {{wheelbase}} is {{the distance between}} the centers of the front and rear wheels.

In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> and a point midway between the two rear axles.|$|R

50|$|AutoTURN 5.0’s {{release in}} 2004, {{among many other}} functions, {{introduced}} Heuristic algorithms for tracking, creation of simulations on spline elements, and improved layer management for simulations.

50|$|Load {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of weight a wheel will carry. This number will vary depending on the number of lugs, the PCD, the material used and the type of axle the wheel is used on. A wheel used on a free rolling trailer axle will carry more weight than that same wheel used on the drive or <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> of a vehicle. All wheels will have the load capacity stamped {{on the back of the}} wheel.|$|R
40|$|The SAFETRUCK program {{focuses on}} {{preventing}} accidents on rural highways, especially {{those associated with}} run-off-the-road incidents and driver fatigue, by giving the vehicle the ability to steer {{to the side of}} the road and come to a safe stop if the driver falls asleep or is otherwise incapacitated. Researchers have equipped a Navistar 9400 series class 8 truck tractor with the sensors and control computers necessary to perform this task. Designing the controller that will steer the truck requires a mathematical model of the lateral response of the truck to steering inputs. In this project, researchers developed a lateral dynamic model by incorporating second order dynamics into the <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> tires. Simulation of the resulting models indicated dynamic behavior that was close to the experimental data for speeds between 15 and 30 miles per hour. This is the first time that a lateral dynamic model of a truck has been experimentally verified. Both models, however, resulted in experimentally determined values for <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> cornering stiffness that were considerably smaller than published values for the Goodyear G 159 tires on the truck. 17.

50|$|In the United States most {{standard}} dump trucks have one front steering axle and one (4x2 4-wheeler)) or two (6x4 6-wheeler) rear axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Tandem rear axles {{are almost always}} powered, front <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are also sometimes powered (4x4, 6x6). Unpowered axles are sometimes used to support extra weight. Most unpowered rear axles can be raised off the ground to minimize wear when the truck is empty or lightly loaded, and are commonly called “lift axles”.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} applications {{the selection}} includes both conventional rigid axles {{as well as}} independent suspension systems, all of them being driven with planetary reduction. Both the steering and non-steering rigid axles are with 10-14 tonnes capacities and the tandem applications with double capacity, 20-28 tonnes. The brakes used on rigid axles are predominantly S-cam type; the heavier <b>steering</b> <b>axles</b> are equipped with wedge brakes. The independent suspension systems are for 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 layouts with 6 to 8 tonnes capacity per axle. The brakes are either disc or wedge type.|$|E
50|$|Allvelo (Allmänna Velocipedförsäljnings AB) was {{a company}} founded by Fritiof Karlström in Landskrona, Sweden. The company began by {{importing}} bicycles, but soon decided to purchase unassembled Waltham Orient buckboards from the United States. These they assembled and sold as All-Velos under the names Allvelo Orient and Allvelo Pansarmobil Sport. All told, probably around 50 were assembled. Most parts {{other than the}} <b>steering,</b> <b>axles,</b> and engines were of wood. Each car had a single-cylinder air-cooled engine mounted at the rear, with friction drive. Brakes were fitted on the right rear wheel only, and the cars had tiller steering.|$|E
25|$|One Heaver-bodied {{coach for}} City Coach Company, Romford and two deck {{and a half}} airport coaches bodied by the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board for their own use were built to a twin-steering three-axle {{specification}} with the second <b>steering</b> <b>axle,</b> which had 17-inch rather than 21-inch wheels, designed to be readily removed once 30ft length on two axles was legal. City had pre-war operated the largest fleet of the Leyland Gnu twin-steering single decker, switching to them from conventional six-wheeled Tigers.|$|R
30|$|Assuming that AS {{can just}} be applied on one axle, it can be {{activated}} hydraulically as electronic trailer steering system. The tire sideslip angle limit of the front <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> can be reached easily. Therefore, the AS system of this four-axle truck can act on any axle except the front axle. Several assumptions are made: (1) The AS angle is within ±[*] 8 °. (2) The AS system can respond so fast that the system states can be assumed to be invariant during each time interval.|$|R
30|$|For active {{steering}} control: (1) To generate an extra outward yaw moment, if {{active steering}} acts on the axles before the CG point, the steering angle {{needs to be}} outward and vice versa. (2) The extra yaw moment depends on the vertical forces of tires and distance of the active <b>steering</b> <b>axle</b> to the CG. (3) During the steering period, an extra detrimental lateral acceleration is generated, affecting vehicle stability. (4) Regarding the truck in this paper, the best AS control speed is 20 °/s.|$|R
