25|$|The Horthy regime's initial {{years were}} {{occupied}} by putsch attempts by Charles IV, the Austro-Hungarian pretender; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis {{triggered by the}} Trianon territorial changes.

40|$|Exception {{handling}} is a {{well established}} method of error recovery through the alteration of plans in situ. This method relies on recovery routines existing in advance, which - we argue - is simply shorthand for more detailed plan descriptions. However, in practice, agents rarely act alone in their environment - other agents may exist, and potentially provide help in times of need. We argue that <b>social</b> error <b>recovery</b> is a particular class of exception handling that allows agents to resolve erroneous situations that are beyond their direct control. In our opinion, agent oriented programming languages must directly provide agents with abilities like <b>social</b> error <b>recovery.</b> Consequently, we introduce revisions to the AgentFactory framework, and more specifically, the programming language (AF-APL), which facilitate the rapid development of agents with in-built <b>social</b> error <b>recovery.</b> The use of these abilities are illustrated via {{an example of a}} <b>social</b> error <b>recovery</b> scenario for a mobile robot working as an office assistant...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{when the}} long term after effects began to appear, {{it was obvious that}} the social and legal climate was {{inadequate}} since there was little experience in dealing with a major environmental disaster. Scientific and medical personnel needed access to accident-related and toxicologic information to understand the causes and potential consequences of the disaster. Union Carbide, the primary repository of this information, faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, closed down its channels of communication. On the other hand, the extreme sensitivities of the local and national government bodies towards all aspects of the disaster, coupled with the lack of expertise and funds, resulted in an inadequate response on India’s part to meet the urgent health care and <b>social</b> <b>recovery</b> needs of the community. [...] Whereas local health professionals and the interested scientific community abroad expected a flood of information from a disaster of this magnitude, only a trickle resulted.|$|E
2500|$|Harlow {{tried to}} reintegrate the monkeys {{who had been}} {{isolated}} for six months by placing them with monkeys who had been raised normally. The rehabilitation attempts met with limited success. Harlow wrote that total social isolation {{for the first six}} months of life produced [...] "severe deficits in virtually every aspect of social behavior". Isolates exposed to monkeys the same age who were reared normally [...] "achieved only limited recovery of simple social responses". Some monkey mothers reared in isolation exhibited [...] "acceptable maternal behavior when forced to accept infant contact over a period of months, but showed no further recovery". Isolates given to surrogate mothers developed [...] "crude interactive patterns among themselves". Opposed to this, when six-month isolates were exposed to younger, three-month-old monkeys, they achieved [...] "essentially complete <b>social</b> <b>recovery</b> for all situations tested". The findings were confirmed by other researchers, who found no difference between peer-therapy recipients and mother-reared infants, but found that artificial surrogates had very little effect.|$|E

40|$|In {{real world}} applications, agents- be they {{software}} agents or autonomous robots- inevitably face erroneous situations {{that have not}} been planned for. Re-planning can sometimes provide solutions to problems, but it is computationally expensive and rarely practical. We argue that replanning is not necessarily the last resort. Instead, during erroneous circumstances, agents should always take advantage of other agents in their environment. In this paper we report on early work that looks at <b>Social</b> Error <b>Recovery</b> as a particular class of exception handling that allows agents to resolve erroneous situations that are beyond their direct control. We also show how the AgentFactory Framework and its language AF-APL have been directly extended to support a basic model of <b>Social</b> Error <b>Recovery.</b> 1. Socially Recoverable Error...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to inquire into the social {{adjustment}} of patients admitted to the Louisville General Hospital in 1946, diagnosed as schizophrenic, treated there with electroshock therapy and subsequently discharged to their homes or to the Central State Hospital. Schizophrenia, as we know, is considered one of the most serious of personality disturbances and accounts for a high proportion of the admissions to mental hospitals. There are over 20, 000 schizophrenics entering mental hospitals in the United States yearly. Prior to the use of convulsive therapy the prognosis for schizophrenic patients was regarded as poor, and no methods of treatment had ever resulted in much success. About ten to fifteen per cent of hospitalized cases of schizophrenia made spontaneous <b>social</b> <b>recoveries,</b> that is, were able to leave the hospital and more or less maintain themselves even though some mental symptoms were still present...|$|R
40|$|The post-release {{period is}} {{associated}} with a range of adverse outcomes for prisoners, especially those with a mental illness. There is limited research into programmes developed {{to address the needs of}} this population upon release from custody. This paper describes the demographic, mental health and criminal justice characteristics of a cohort of 63 mentally ill prisoners referred to the Queensland Prison Mental Health Transition Coordination Program in 2010 and 2011, who received time-limited transitional support. Established criminological predictors such as age and substance abuse history were related to first re-incarceration. When a multi-event analysis was performed, a broader range of factors were associated with the time before re-incarceration, including duration of <b>social</b> and <b>recovery</b> support and a diagnosis of psychosis. This study found that among those receiving post-release <b>social</b> and <b>recovery</b> support, longer duration of support {{is associated with}} a lower risk of re-incarceration. Other findings of interest include the significant proportion of re-incarcerations for parole breaches. No deaths occurred during the follow-up period...|$|R
