6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> {{wild and}} <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> mute with her shuddering lips half-shut. [...] Toll slowly. [...] Her head fallen as half in swound, hair and knee swept on the ground, [...] <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> wild to stirrup and foot.|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> to her brother's neighbourhood, {{she knew}} not why.|$|E
60|$|As Hetty {{said the}} last words, <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> closer to Dinah, shuddering.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>clung</b> to him, craving so to {{have him}} that he could not be reft away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>clung</b> to the coaming, but he fancied {{that her}} misgivings were vanishing, {{and he spoke}} again.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Claude {{watched her}} as <b>she</b> charmingly <b>clung</b> to the child. [...] "I'm {{so glad you}} really care for her. That's {{so much to the}} good." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to {{him like}} a child wearied with its own naughtiness.|$|E
60|$|He passed on, {{scarcely}} heeding her words, but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> to his arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to {{him with}} a sudden abandon. She was white to the lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fiddlesticks!' said Mrs. Crowley, sharply. 'I {{should have}} liked her much better if <b>she</b> had <b>clung</b> {{to her brother}} and sobbed {{and had to be}} torn away.' ...|$|R
60|$|At night, {{curled up}} on a small bundle of dank straw Yvonne had made vain efforts to snatch a little sleep. Ever since the day {{when she had been}} ruthlessly torn away from the {{protection}} of her dear milor, <b>she</b> had persistently <b>clung</b> to the belief that he would find the means to come to her, to wrest her from the cruel fate which her pitiless enemies had devised for her. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> to that hope throughout that dreary journey from dear England to this abominable city. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> to it even whilst her father knelt at her feet in an agony of remorse. <b>She</b> had <b>clung</b> to hope while Martin-Roget alternately coaxed and terrorised her, while her father was dragged away from her, while she endured untold misery, starvation, humiliation at the hands of Louise Adet: but now--quite unaccountably--that hope seemed suddenly to have fled from her, leaving her lonely and inexpressibly desolate. That small, shrunken figure which, wrapped in a dark mantle, had stood {{in the corner of the}} room watching her like a serpent watches its prey, had seemed like the forerunner of the fate with which Martin-Roget, gloating over her helplessness, had already threatened her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> still <b>clung</b> to the coaming, but he fancied {{that her}} misgivings were vanishing; {{and he spoke}} again: [...] "How are Mrs. Marvin and the little girl? I see you have lighted the stove." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to his {{arm through}} the dim-lighted {{passages}} {{and down the}} narrow stairs.|$|E
60|$|Her mood {{changed at}} once. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to him, {{pressing}} his hand between her own.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to {{him with}} {{suddenly}} swimming eyes. Her lips trembled--her face was very wistful.|$|E
60|$|He {{pressed the}} younger sister to his heart. Released from his embrace, <b>she</b> again <b>clung</b> to her sister; and her eyes, {{with the same}} blended look, again sought those so calm, serene, and cheerful.|$|R
6000|$|Dorothy was delighted, yet not {{altogether}} surprised, for <b>she</b> had <b>clung</b> to {{the hope that}} Ozma would be kind enough to grant her request. When, indeed, had her powerful and faithful friend refused her anything? ...|$|R
60|$|What {{an utter}} desolation {{this must have}} been to the wife, tearing from her the last hold of friendship, and the last refuge to which <b>she</b> had <b>clung</b> in her sorrows, may easily be conceived.|$|R
60|$|He made a {{movement}} to disengage himself, but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> more closely to him, shivering violently.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> {{the closer}} to him, but neither lifted up her face, nor spoke a word.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to my arm, {{and pulled}} at my coat {{in a perfect}} frenzy of fear.|$|E
60|$|Alas! Of what value {{could they}} now ever be to her beloved country? But habit and loyalty were so strong within her that <b>she</b> still <b>clung</b> to the {{determined}} hope of eventually delivering the little packet to her chief.|$|R
60|$|But Momaya, though startled, had wheeled to {{face the}} fearsome thing with all the savage ferocity of a she-tiger at bay. When she saw who it was, she {{breathed a sigh of}} partial relief, though <b>she</b> still <b>clung</b> tightly to Tibo.|$|R
60|$|Far from obeying that {{imperious}} command, Mme. de Plougastel rose to {{her feet}} to cover the Marquis with her body. But <b>she</b> still <b>clung</b> to his arm, clung to it with unsuspected strength that continued to prevent him from attempting to use the pistol.|$|R
60|$|He kissed her, and <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> {{to him as}} if he were {{something}} too precious to release.|$|E
60|$|When they rose, {{her feet}} were so numbed she could hardly stand. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to Siegmund, laughing.|$|E
60|$|But the giddy {{girl had}} darted past him, and, {{face to the}} wall of the cliff, was {{creeping}} along the dangerous path. Rand followed mechanically. Once or twice the trail crumbled beneath her feet; but <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> to a projecting root of chaparral, and laughed. She had almost reached her elected goal, when, slipping, the treacherous chaparral <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> to yielded in her grasp, and Rand, with a cry, sprung forward.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{heard him}} in painful silence. She {{respected}} him, and dreaded his power over her father; but, unwilling to abandon hopes to which <b>she</b> yet <b>clung</b> as to her spring of existence, with a violent effort she determined to throw {{herself on the}} generosity of her lover.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} {{daylight}} in the open, {{but under the}} spreading cottonwoods shadows were obscuring the lanes. Venters drew Jane off from one of these into a shrub-lined trail, just wide enough for the two to walk abreast, and in a roundabout way led her far from the house to a knoll {{on the edge of}} the grove. Here in a secluded nook was a bench from which, through an opening in the tree-tops, could be seen the sage-slope and the wall of rock and the dim lines of canyons. Jane had not spoken since Venters had shocked her with his first harsh speech; but all the way <b>she</b> had <b>clung</b> to his arm, and now, as he stopped and laid his rifle against the bench, <b>she</b> still <b>clung</b> to him.|$|R
6000|$|Blessed Sunday Bells, ringing so tranquilly {{in their}} entranced and happy ears! Blessed Sunday peace and quiet, harmonising with the calmness in their souls, and making holy air around them! Blessed {{twilight}} stealing on, and shading her so soothingly and gravely, as she falls asleep, like a hushed child, upon the bosom <b>she</b> has <b>clung</b> to! ...|$|R
60|$|She looked up, still {{clinging}} to him as <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> to the hope of her better life to come.|$|E
60|$|Agatha's ankles became limp. With {{an effort}} she kept upright until she reached Jane, to whom <b>she</b> <b>clung</b> for support.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>clung</b> to his {{arm with}} unfeigned solicitude in her eager, {{pleading}} face, {{and he could}} not resist it.|$|E
60|$|The man {{tried to}} free himself from her rather {{surprising}} attentions, but <b>she</b> only <b>clung</b> more tightly to him, and suddenly, as {{he recalled that}} he had always heard that one must humor the mentally deficient, {{and at the same}} time seeing in her a possible agency of escape, he dosed his eyes and returned her embraces.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> neither <b>clung</b> to him, nor yet did she try to draw him to her. Her hands grasped his shoulders, and {{she seemed}} to him to be staring into his face in the dark. And now he could see {{something}} of her face, too--an oval without features--and faintly distinguish her person, in the blackness, a form without definite lines.|$|R
60|$|But {{all this}} she forgot, as she knelt beside the lifeless form--the {{last thing on}} earth that belonged to her--the last {{protection}} to which <b>she</b> might have <b>clung.</b>|$|R
