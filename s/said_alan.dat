Even though the Panorama reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping {{to distance themselves from}} the scandal: [...] "What I have to make clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> Pascoe, a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to [...] "do everything we can to co-operate [...] and take this story off the running order". Sebastian Coe, also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured [...] "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process." [...] After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing.|$|E

"Exile in Guyville is miles {{more complex}} than the porn-star {{manifesto}} it was often considered," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> Light (former editor-in-chief of Spin, Vibe, and Tracks) in an essay written for the reissue.

2500|$|He was {{recalled}} to the Australian one day {{team for}} the WSC finals series in 1988–89, as a third spinner. However he bowled poorly, going for 0-62 off 7 overs. [...] "I {{felt sorry for him}} in a lot of ways", <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> Border, [...] "because I gave him a pretty tough task, bowling in that first 15 overs, and then he had to bowl towards the end when their guys were wacking out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit here {{in front}} of me," [...] she <b>said</b> to <b>Alan,</b> [...] "and you, Jeekie, sit at your lord's side, and be silent till I bid you speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is for {{the villain}} Nixon.' she <b>said</b> to <b>Alan</b> Fairford; 'open it without scruple; that boy is his emissary; we shall now see what the miscreant is driving at.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{this is not}} all, Provost Crosbie,' <b>said</b> Mr. <b>Alan</b> Fairford; 'A young gentleman of {{rank and}} fortune has {{disappeared}} amongst their hands--you know him. My father gave him a letter to you--Mr. Darsie Latimer.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On June 26, 2009, Alan {{announced}} that he had assembled a team to acquire the aircraft manufacturer's Vision SF50 single-engine jet program from majority owner Arcapita Bank and produce it under a new company. Dale came out in support of his efforts. Over a month later the attempt failed and Wouters {{announced that}} Alan's contract as Chairman would not be renewed when it expired at the end of August (a decision Wouters <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> had known about for [...] "several months" [...] prior). Alan left Cirrus soon after this while Dale stayed with the company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> [...] "Riach! Well, it was {{him that}} took up the clubs for me, asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment, and, says he 'Dod, I'll put {{my back to the}} Hielandman's mysel'.'

6000|$|... "By all means--Yes," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> {{excessively}} shocked. [...] "But {{you will}} {{let me know}} how she goes on--Richard will be so kind." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Laughter is {{the best}} {{medicine}} and we intend to administer it through cinema. This is a superb initiative which I'm sure will do {{a great deal to}} boost patients' motivation to get well," [...] <b>said</b> Dr. <b>Alan</b> Maryon-Davis, a top health consultant.|$|R
5000|$|Quoted on Dec. 15, 2009, James Rainey of the Los Angeles Times <b>said</b> founder <b>Alan</b> Jacobson's [...] "ebullient {{innovation}} opens a {{door for}} an underserved audience {{and provides the}} kind of incremental revenue that, strand by strand, eventually just might rope journalism back to a financial mooring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, Major," [...] he <b>said,</b> handing <b>Alan</b> one spear {{and taking}} another himself. [...] "Old cannibal quite right, very nice {{night for a}} walk.

6000|$|... "See! There isn't {{another place}} in France where that could happen," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan.</b> [...] "I tell you, {{this is a}} {{magnificent}} country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A warrant against me!' <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> indignantly; 'and at {{that poor}} miserable wretch's instance?--why, {{this is a}} trick, a mere and most palpable trick.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} the utmost {{satisfaction}} to think I had been of the smallest use," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> hiding much under these commonplace words.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the moment}} the door opened, and a trooper in Scotch uniform entered. [...] "I have brought this letter," [...] he <b>said,</b> [...] "from <b>Alan</b> Campbell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{depend upon}} it," [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "we shall {{hear more of}} them ere long. Ye may keep {{a man from the}} {{fighting}} but never from his bottle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good-bye till Saturday," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> {{when he had}} {{received}} the latter, and nodding to them both, he turned and left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope so too,' <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> rather indignantly; 'but I desire more {{certainty}} on that point. You yourself {{wrote my}} father that he had disappeared.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense,' <b>said</b> <b>Alan.</b> 'You can get some. Go and borrow at your tailor's; {{they all}} do it. Or I'll tell you what: pop your watch.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] <b>said</b> Hoseason to <b>Alan,</b> [...] "we'll {{try your}} way of it. But I think I might as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you're right." ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{announcement}} Jeekie rose {{and walked down}} the room, carrying the cold mutton in his hand. Then he returned, replaced it on the table and standing in front of <b>Alan,</b> <b>said</b> earnestly: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} plan was good, but Jeekie shook his head, asking {{what would happen if}} Fahni, finding himself safe upon the water, thought it wisest not to come to fetch them.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a little}} risk certainly, but I don't {{think there is a}} great one. Anyhow, the attempt must be made," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan</b> quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be a}} row over this, dear," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> {{shaking his}} head doubtfully when at last they were alone {{together}} in the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I do it?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> {{turning to}} Margaret, as Ethel frantically {{burst out of}} the room; [...] "perhaps I should have asked leave?" ...|$|E
5000|$|When Sandy {{came back}} in and <b>said</b> that <b>Alan</b> Turner should {{announce}} {{what has happened to}} the village, Pearl asked him not too and said, as she looked at her lifeless fiancé, [...] "Leonard never liked to make a fuss."

6000|$|The captain <b>said</b> {{nothing to}} <b>Alan,</b> {{but he looked}} over at me with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this"; and {{the sound of his voice}} went through me with a jar.|$|R
500|$|Other {{senators}} expressed similar mystification at the agitation {{against the}} bill. Senator Henry M.

6000|$|... "Jeekie," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> [...] "can you {{not find}} a messenger? Have you, who were born of this people, no friend among them at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take that,' <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> passing John the whisky, {{and then}} with a certain {{roughness}} pushed his friend into the bedroom, and closed the door behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Alan,</b> for he {{was anxious}} {{to get to the}} bottom of this man's mind, which {{hitherto}} he had always found so secret.|$|E
6000|$|The captain <b>said</b> {{nothing to}} <b>Alan,</b> {{but he looked}} over at me with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this;" [...] and {{the sound of his voice}} went through me with a jar.|$|R
5000|$|UCITA {{has been}} {{designed}} to clarify issues which were not addressed by existing Uniform Commercial Code. [...] "Few disagree that the current Uniform Commercial Code is ill-suited for use with licensing and other intangible transactions," [...] <b>said</b> practicing attorney <b>Alan</b> Fisch.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be many}} a long day," [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>said</b> to me on {{our first}} morning, [...] "before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must get word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us." ...|$|R
