5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

Later in October he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research. [...] "We {{have to make sure that}} we open up these avenues <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find," [...] he said. In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.|$|E

500|$|On December 3, 2006, Bayh {{announced}} that he would form an exploratory committee in order for him to travel and raise funds more effectively for a presidential run. Upon this declaration, the candidate appeared on This Week, articulating that Americans [...] "need someone who can deal with the dysfunction here in this city (Washington D.C.) <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> government begins to empower our people to fulfill their potential...if I can be that individual, so be it." [...] His spokesman remarked that the committee would help [...] "to put an infrastructure in place" [...] for the campaign. Bayh immediately returned to the campaign trail following his announcement, traveling back to Iowa on December 4 with approximately $10.6 million to continue spreading his message. The next weekend, Bayh visited New Hampshire to discuss his views on energy independence, global warming and the war in Iraq. But due to the two sold out appearances to the state by Barack Obama, who was recently named a potential candidate, Bayh's trip did not garner much media attention.|$|E

500|$|In the New Testament, all Christians are {{referred}} to as saints. However, the use of [...] "saint" [...] as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in Christianity. By the time of the Reformation, the use of [...] "saint" [...] was almost exclusively the restrictive, titular sense. [...] One {{of the effects of the}} Reformation was to eliminate the abuses of the cult of saints, and as a result, it is a common misconception that Lutherans do not have (or rather, do not venerate) saints. However, the confessional documents of the Lutheran Church, particularly the Augsburg Confession, accept both the general and particular use of the word saints. [...] In regards to the titular sense, the Augsburg Confession commends that [...] "it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> faith may be strengthened when we see what grace they received and how they were sustained in faith. Moreover, their good works are to be an example for us, each of us in his own calling." [...] Article XXI of The Apology to the Augsburg Confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to the saints and acknowledgment that the saints pray for the Church. However, the Augsburg Confession opposes prayer to saints, stating, [...] "Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them. For it sets before us Christ alone as mediator, atoning sacrifice, high priest, and intercessor." ...|$|E

When you say the term 'Venus in furs,' people get the image in their mind of a dominant female. <b>So</b> <b>that's</b> <b>our</b> 'evil woman' song. It's a classic doom theme." ...|$|R

2500|$|On August 26, 2006, Harris's {{campaign}} {{released a}} [...] "Statement of Clarification", that stated, “In the interview, Harris {{was speaking to}} a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in Judeo-Christian values."

Rudnick, who stated “As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, I know that she encourages people of all faiths to engage in government <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by our founding fathers, without malice towards anyone.” At an appearance at an Orlando gun show that same day, she said [...] "it breaks my heart" [...] to think people understood her comments as bigoted.

2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E

2500|$|On October 6, 2010, Palin {{spoke with}} reporters and fielded a {{question}} about Social Security. She stated, [...] "e {{are going to have}} to make some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Caslon's type rapidly {{built up}} a {{reputation}} for workmanship, being described by Henry Newman in 1733 as [...] "the work of that Artist who seems to aspire to outvying all the Workmen in his way in Europe, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Printers send no more to Holland for the Elzevir and other Letters which they formerly valued themselves much." [...] Mosley describes Caslon's Long Primer No. 1 type as [...] "type with generous proportions and it was normally cast with letter-spacing that was not too tight, characteristics that are needed in types on a small body. And yet it is so soundly made that words that are set in it keep their shape and are comfortably readable...It is a type that works best in the narrow measure of a two-column page or in quite modest octavos." [...] Caslon sold a French Canon face he did not engrave that may {{to have been the}} work of Joseph Moxon with some modifications, and his larger-size faces follow this high-contrast model. Compared to the more delicate, stylised and experimental designs that developed in Europe during Caslon's life, notably the romain du roi type and the work of Fleischmann in Amsterdam, and the Baskerville type of John Baskerville in Birmingham that appeared towards the end of Caslon's career, Caslon's type was quite conservative. Johnson notes that his 1764 specimen [...] "might have been produced a hundred years earlier". Stanley Morison described Caslon's type as [...] "a happy archaicism".|$|E
