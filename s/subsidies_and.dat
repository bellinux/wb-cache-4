5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E

China cut its coal subsidy from $750million in 1993 to $240million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland moved a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E

His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing.

5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove <b>subsidies,</b> <b>and</b> the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, Indiana {{completed}} {{the removal of}} the Native American tribes. The majority of the Potawatomi voluntarily relocated to Kansas in 1838. Those who did not leave were forced to travel to Kansas in what came to be called the Potawatomi Trail of Death, leaving only the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians in the Indiana area. The majority of the Miami tribe left in 1846, although many members of the tribe were permitted to remain in the state on lands they held privately {{under the terms of the}} 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's. The other tribes were also convinced to leave the state voluntarily through the payment of <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> land grants further west. The Shawnee migrated westward to settle in Missouri, and the Lenape migrated into Canada. The other minor tribes in the state, including the Wea, moved westward, mostly to Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Romney {{helped develop}} and then {{signed into law}} the Massachusetts health care reform legislation, {{the first of its}} kind in the nation.

He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and closing corporate tax loopholes. He did not seek re-election in 2006, instead focusing on his campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Though he won several primaries and caucuses, the eventual nominee was Senator John McCain. Romney's considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190–250million, helped finance his political campaigns prior to 2012.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, <b>subsidies</b> <b>and</b> insurance exchanges.

Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by <b>subsidies,</b> <b>and</b> further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
