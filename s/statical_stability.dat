The authors have developed a procedure for obtaining a workable method giving satisfactory accuracy in preliminary ship design for predicting the curve of <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> of a vessel when only the principal dimensions and hull coefficients of the vessel are known. The stability data upon which the development is based was obtained by mechanically integrating a parent hull form from Taylor's Standard Series and expanding the resulting righting are data to cover a range of ship forms. The methods of data expansion were those suggested in the 1949 thesis by Church and Robinson entitled "The estimation of transverse <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> from form coefficients and principal dimensions", but modified as considered desirable to improve accuracy and convenience of application.

Stability is an important constraint in power system operation and control.

40|$|We present {{methods of}} <b>statical</b> and {{dynamical}} <b>stability</b> analysis of elastic {{systems in the}} postcritical area, including both linear and nonlinear analysis, {{as well as the}} discussion on how it can be used based on the study of oscillations with large amplitudes and phase trajectories. Analysis is performed on single and double pendulum loaded with axial force and supported by angular springs. Linear analysis is used to determine critical points, and nonlinear analysis is used to determine behaviour of the system after the loss of stability. The results of calculation of buckling eigenmodes are used to simplify nonlinear analysis and to obtain approximate analytic equations of postbuckling trajectory and phase trajectories, as well as frequencies of small vibrations around current secondary equilibrium position. Increase of the amplitude of vibrations around the primary equilibrium position changes frequencies of these vibrations. Equations presented in this paper show also that this well known fact can be used in the analysis of postcritical behaviour of observed systems...|$|R

40|$|This work {{summarizes}} {{the effort to}} introduce high–fidelity methods in aircraft design process. Flight dynamic characteristics are crucial in aircraft design. Simulation tools evaluate the aircraft <b>statical</b> and dynamical <b>stability</b> and manoeuvrability usually {{are based on a}} previously computed tabular aerodynamic model. During the conceptual design phase, the aerodynamic database is usually computed with semi–empirical methods. These tools rely on existing configurations databases (statistical methods) or linear aerodynamic hypothesis (e. g. vortex lattice method), and so are not suitable for innovative designs. The exploitation of such methods may lead to evaluation errors in the design process, which can be found only in the following steps and so may be very expensive to rectify via additional work, wind tunnel and flight testing, enlarging the time–to–market and increasing the whole life cycle product cost. The adoption of high–fidelity, physical based aerodynamic models starting from the very first steps of the aircraft design would reduce the uncertainty of current design procedures and prevent costly aircraft retrofitting. Computational fluid dynamics may be utilized to achieve the required high–fidelity, but, because of the substantial computational cost, it is currently used only during ensuing design steps. In this thesis the steps towards an autonomous high–fidelity flight dynamics analysis are presented. A tool for generating the aerodynamic tables with the semi–empirical United States air force stability and control digital compendium with the common parametric aircraft configuration schema is developed. The function for the flow solver Edge is updated and both scripts are implemented and validated inside the computerised environment for aircraft synthesis and integrated optimisation methods. Reduced order models to overcome computational fluid dynamics limitations for automated generation of aerodynamic tables are then presented. Two methods are developed in order to obtain a more efficient approach for samples positioning inside the flight envelope domain. Emphasis is given on the ability to capture nonlinearities appearance in the flow field with only a few computations over the whole flight envelope. The methods rely on Kriging interpolation, and are validated for semi–analytical functions and for real test cases. This may permit {{to reduce the number of}} required computational fluid dynamics solutions to use the flight simulator of a factor of some tens, without compromising the main aircraft statical and dynamical behaviour results. A test case is then presented, showing the statical and dynamical aircraft stability comparison between different geometry configurations, by use of reduced order models and with a low computational budget. The limitations of a derivatives based aerodynamic model are then presented for a test case, highlighting the differences with a computational fluid dynamics and flight dynamics full–coupled model. A blocks software architecture is used to obtain a tool open and customizable. A computational fluid dynamics based optimization loop is then used to analyse the longitudinal trim conditions of a test case, presenting the derivatives aerodynamic model limitations. The geometry optimization feasibility, considering the aircraft stability as objective, is assessed. A model based on aerodynamic derivatives is assumed for the representation of the aerodynamic loads, because traditionally used by flight dynamics tools. Advances in this direction are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of the "Preliminary report on free flight testing" (report no. NACA-TR- 70), presents a detailed theoretical analysis of <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> with free and locked controls and also the results of many free flight test on several types of airplanes. In developing the theory of stability with locked controls an expression for pitching moment is derived in simple terms by considering the total moment as the sum of the moments due to wings and tail surface. This expression, when differentiated with respect to angle of incidence, enables an analysis to be made of the factors contributing to the pitching moment. The effects of slipstream and down wash are also considered and it is concluded that the C. G. Location has but slight effect or stability, and that stability is much improved by increasing the efficiency of the tail surfaces, which may be done by using an "inverted" tail plane. The results of free flight tests with locked controls are discussed at length and it is shown that the agreement between the experimental results and theory is very satisfactory. The theory of stability with free controls is not amendable to the simple mathematical treatment used in the case of locked controls, but a clear statement of the conditions enables several conclusions to be drawn, one of which is that the fixed tail surfaces should be much larger than the movable surfaces...|$|E

The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to study the static and dynamic behaviour of a tension leg platform in the intact condition and after partial or total loss of tether at any corner. The exercise involves formulating the statics and dynamics of column stabilised structures with taut moorings and implementing the same in appropriate computer softwares. Formulations are also made to calculate the equilibrium tensions after a loss of tether. [...] The computer program for hydrostatics is capable of generating the standard hydrostatic information as well as locating the equilibrium configuration of the floating body under a given set of external static loads. This is {{used to assess the}} <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> of the tension leg platform in damaged cases and compare the same with its various other configurations. [...] Under the category of hydrodynamic analysis, two major types of approaches, namely 'frequency domain’ and 'time domain' are employed. In the frequency domain approach, wave amplitudes and all displacements are assumed to be small. Also, integration of the hydrodynamic forces is carried out over the mean wetted surface of the body. The wave excitation forces are calculated via a 'Morison type' formula and an iterative scheme is adopted to handle the nonlinear drag term. This analysis is used to compute the 'response amplitude operators' (RAOs) in intact and damaged conditions. Significant responses are also computed using these RAOs and Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectra for chosen wind speeds. In the time domain analysis, though assumptions similar to frequency domain analysis are made regarding the incident wave. However, no restriction is put on the motion of the body. The excitation and the reactive forces are calculated over the instantaneous wetted surface and at the displaced position. Nonlinear equations of motion are integrated using Adam's method. This analysis is used to obtain time-series data of motion and tension responses in order to study the variation of steady state amplitudes in intact and damaged conditions as well as transients following a loss of tether. [...] A special study of the occurrence of Mathieu type dynamic instability in tension leg platforms is also undertaken. A formulation to calculate unstable combinations of wave height and frequency is developed based on Floquet theory for periodic systems. The effect of various pertinent parameters including loss of tether on instability is also investigated. [...] Furthermore, a 1 : 100 scale model of a representative tension leg platform is designed and fabricated. Experiments are conducted in regular and irregular waves in both intact and damaged configurations and the experimental observations are compared with those predicted by the theoretical models. [...] It is seen that a complete loss of tether at any corner can reduce the <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> of a tension leg platform drastically. A loss of tether, in general, is found to increase the platform motions in vertical planes as well as the static and dynamic tensions in the remaining intact tethers. Total loss of tether at one corner induces snap loads in one or more corners. Depending on the wave height and frequency, these snap loads could be high enough to trigger further tether failures. With regard to Mathieu type dynamic instability, even a 25 % loss of total axial stiffness of the tethers is seen to have insignificant effect on the occurrence of such instability...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> {{analysis of}} a ship, which is presented by the righting arm curve, is well known by its simplicity. Unfortunately, the existing stability criteria, {{which is based on}} conventional approach does not demand extensive analysis of dynamic effect especially wave forces that is the main cause of capsize. For this reason, in the present study, a safe design guideline of small vessel travelling in waves is proposed to further improve the existing stability criteria. The motion of small vessel in astern seas condition is selected as the most critical situation, where the wave forces can strongly affect its stability and more generally its safety. When a vessel encounters waves from astern, non-linear modes of capsizing is usually observed. Due to the strong influence of non-linearity on the ship motion, Time Domain Simulation approach is required to obtain the ship motion in steps of time. In the analysis, hydrostatic effect is considered as the most important contribution to the ship motion. The hydrostatic terms are calculated up to the free surface. The hydrodynamic forces, which are considered less significant, are predicted by empirical formulas. Two hull forms, namely V bottom hull and round bilge hull are selected to represent the basis hull of small vessels. The reason is the two hull forms are known to have different roll damping and thus have significant effect on roll motions. The well-known Ikedaâ€™s method is studied and modified, so it {{can be used as a}} general roll damping prediction method for small vessels. A systematic procedure of parametric study using time domain simulation is presented and the method is used to compare the effect of hull form and environmental parameters on the ship stability. As a conclusion, this study successfully presented safe design guidelines for small vessels operating in astern seas condition and also the effect of ship design parameters on the ship stabilit...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with multiple equilibrium path generation and imperfection sensitivity of elastic conservative systems, the behaviour {{of which may be}} described using a finite number of discrete displacement coordinates and which, in the ideal case, exhibit compound or m-fold branching points. A review of previous work has been made, including that on specific systems, distinct critical points, compound critical points, optimisation and stochastic approaches. An appreciation of the role of Catastrophe Theory in problems of elastic stability has been included. The literature relevant to two particular mechanical systems, examined in detail later in the Thesis, is discussed. Simple criteria, which govern the existence of post-buckling equilibrium paths passing through a symmetric type of m-fold branching point, have been developed. Explicit expressions for the initial curvatures and initial post-buckling stiffnesses of these paths, where they exist, have been found. Quantitative means for assessing the <b>statical</b> <b>stability</b> of paths have been devised. The equilibria and critical equilibria of ideal and imperfect two-fold doubly-symmetric branching points have been examined in great detail. A classification of this type of system has been suggested, which includes a distinction between non-hysteresis and hysteresis behavior. General algebraic forms for the critical load-displacement and imperfection sensitivity surfaces have been derived and their qualitative appearances suggested. A non-approximate numerical technique for calculating the equilibria, deriving the complete critical load-displacement and imperfection sensitivity surfaces of two-fold doubly-symmetric branching systems has been applied to two particular mechanical systems, namely: an axially loaded pin-ended strut on a linear Winkler-type elastic foundation; and a thin simply-supported rectangular plate subjected to proportional bi-axial in-plane compression. The strut problem was modelled by means of a two-mode Rayleigh-Ritz procedure applied to a suitable higher-order total potential energy expression. The plate problem was modelled using a two-mode Galerkin integral technique applied to the von Karman large deflection equations. The role played by the two major imperfections and the imperfection sensitivity surface in dynamic mode-jumping and buckling load degradation respectively was elucidated. The general conclusions reached in this Thesis are broadly supported by other analytical, numerical and experimental work from the literature...|$|E
