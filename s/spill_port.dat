40|$|The IEEE Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics {{community}} {{has created a}} roadmap for producing unmanned systems that could be adopted by the Public Safety sector within 10 years, given appropriate R&D investment especially in human-robot interaction and perception. The five applications expected to be of highest value to the Public Safety community, highest value first, are: assisting with routine inspection of the critical infrastructure, “chronic emergencies” such as firefighting, hazardous material <b>spills,</b> <b>port</b> inspection, and damage estimation after a disaster. The technical feasibility of the applications were ranked, with the most attractive scenario, infrastructure inspection, rated as the second easiest scenario; this suggests the maturity of robotics technology is beginning to match stakeholder needs. Each of the five applications were {{discussed in terms of}} the six broad enabling technology areas specified in the current National Robotics Initiative Roadmap (perception, human-robot interaction, mechanisms, modeling and simulation, control and planning, and testing and evaluation) and nine specific capabilities identified by the community as being essential to commercialization (communication, alerting, localization, fault tolerance, mapping, manpower needs, plug and play capabilities, multiple users, and multiple robots). The community believes that perception and human-robot interaction are the two biggest barriers to adoption, and require more research, given that their low technical maturity (3 rd and 6 th rank respectively). However, each of the specific capabilities needed for commercialization are being addressed by current research and could be achieved within 10 years with sustained funding.   Accepted for Publication. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{major oil}} <b>spill</b> {{occurred}} at <b>Port</b> Bonython during the berthing of the tanker Era in 1992.

50|$|Port Bonython is the {{location}} of a deepwater port and proposed minerals precinct adjacent to Point Lowly in the Upper Spencer Gulf region of South Australia. It lies 16 km east-northeast of Whyalla, South Australia and approximately 370 km north-west of Adelaide, the State's capital city. The existing wharf is 2.4 kilometres long and is capable of berthing small Capesize ships with a maximum capacity of 110,000 tonnes. The wharf was established in 1982 and named after John Bonython, the founding chairman of Santos Limited. The structure is leased to Santos by the South Australian Government and is used for the export of hydrocarbon products. An oil <b>spill</b> at <b>Port</b> Bonython in 1992 resulted in loss of bird life and damage to mangrove habitats to the west and southwest of Port Pirie.|$|R
50|$|The port safety {{function}} {{has a long}} history in the Coast Guard. It was expanded during the 20th century to include the protection of ports, harbors, vessels, and waterfront facilities against accidents, negligence, and sabotage. These responsibilities have been assigned to the COTP primarily through the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. This Act resulted from several major groundings and oil <b>spills</b> and provided <b>port</b> safety authority for the COTP to protect the use of port transportation facilities, and to enhance efforts against the degradation of the marine environment.|$|R

50|$|Encountering {{engine trouble}} on the way, which {{lengthened}} the trip, Pelican began to have difficulty making way against the conditions, with only one working engine. The weather changed suddenly as the squall line approached, with a strong northeast wind developing against an outgoing tide. The wind has been estimated at 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 km/hr) and the waves as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters) in the rip tides near Montauk Point. While rounding Montauk Point at approximately 2:00 PM, Pelican was hit by two successive waves on the starboard quarter and capsized to <b>port,</b> <b>spilling</b> most of her passengers and crew into the water while trapping others inside the cabin. The vessel then foundered. The accident occurred within sight of Montauk Lighthouse, approximately one nautical mile (1.15 miles; 1.85 km) north off {{the point in the}} area known as Endeavor Shoals.|$|R
50|$|Fuel {{had been}} <b>spilling</b> from the <b>port</b> wing {{from the moment}} the first loud noise was heard. That fuel had ignited on contact with flames emanating from the hole in the engine {{combustion}} chamber as the aircraft began to decelerate on the runway. When the aircraft came to a stop, fuel was still leaking from a 42 in2 opening at a rate of 2 - 3 US gallons per second, feeding a growing fire. By about this time, the fire had already penetrated the aluminum alloy skin of the aircraft below the level of the floor in the passenger compartment. (The AAIB estimated that it took between five seconds before and thirteen seconds after the aircraft stopped for fire to penetrate the fuselage skin.) Passengers seated {{on the left side of}} the aisle and toward the rear felt intense radiant heat from the fire, and were very impatient to escape, many of them standing and moving into the aisles while the aircraft was moving.|$|R
40|$|The routine {{surveillance}} of oil <b>spills</b> in major <b>ports</b> is important. However, existing techniques and sensors {{are unable to}} trace oil and micron-thin oil films {{on the surface of}} seawater. Therefore, we designed and studied a coastal-mounted sensor, using ultraviolet-induced fluorescence and fluorescence-filter systems (FFSs), to monitor oil spills and overcome the disadvantages of traditional surveillance systems. Using seawater from the port of Lingshui (Yellow Sea, China) and six oil samples of different types, we found that diesel oil’s relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) was significantly higher than those of heavy fuel and crude oils in the 180 – 300 nm range—in the 300 – 400 nm range, the RFI value of diesel is far lower. The heavy fuel and crude oils exhibited an opposite trend in their fluorescence spectra. A photomultiplier tube, employed as the fluorescence detection unit, efficiently monitored different oils on seawater in field experiments. On-site tests indicated that this sensor system {{could be used as a}} coastal-mounted early-warning detection system for oil spills...|$|R
40|$|Under the Australian National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil {{and various}} State and {{regional}} supplements, an extensive framework for oil spill {{response has been}} established. The National plan has been in effect since 1973. During that period {{there have been no}} major (on a world scale) oil spills in Australian waters. There have. however, been a number of minor <b>spill</b> incidents in <b>ports</b> and ha&ours and in coastal (territorial) waters. There have been very few incidents on the high seas. Despite the low incidence of spills and the estimated low probability of major incidents, there is a strong case for preparedness. The Australian coastal zone and offshore waters are the focus {{of a wide range of}} uses, including fishing, recreation, tourism, urban and industrial development, agriculture, aquaculture/mariculture and conservation.

40|$|Reliable {{oil spill}} detections in {{satellite}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery require {{the analysis of}} many different factors. In many cases the categorisation of the monitored area based on environmental ancillary information {{is essential for the}} definition of the reliability of oil spill detections in SAR imagery. This study introduces the advantages of using geospatial analysis of vessel traffic as a supplementary information source for the oil spill probability assessment in SAR imagery. Because of the leak of free accessible Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data and their limited coverage the concept {{of this study is to}} analyse the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) within a geographic information system (GIS) to identify the main shipping lanes, weight them by importance and categorise the observed area in low, medium and high probability for oil <b>spill</b> detections. Additionally <b>port</b> locations were also accounted for the analysis. The derived oil spill probability categorisation was finally applied to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) ¿s Oil Spill Database for the Mediterranean Sea and the concentration of oil spill detections confirms the strong link with shipping lanes.

40|$|In January 2006, 25 tonnes {{of heavy}} fuel oil <b>spilled</b> into the <b>Port</b> of Gladstone in Queensland, Australia, from the {{breached}} hull of a bulk carrier ship. Over the following days, approximately 18 tonnes of the oil was recovered, however {{a certain amount of}} oil was deposited in the intertidal areas of Port Curtis leaving a highly visible, viscous residue. The objectives of this research were to assess the immediate impacts on the intertidal habitat and to gain baseline information for future comparative assessments. Sediment PAH and metal concentrations, mangrove communities and intertidal macroinvertebrates were assessed within one month post-spill at oil-impacted sites; adjacent sites which were not visibly impacted; and reference sites which were located outside the recorded distribution of the oil spill. Highest PAH concentrations were found at the impacted sites, with concentrations of some PAHs exceeding Australian and New Zealand Sediment Quality Guidelines (ANZECC/ARMCANZ, 2000). These sites contained very few or no crab holes in the high intertidal area, indicating a low crab density in comparison to reference sites. Little immediate impact was evident on the mangrove and macrobenthic communities, however future surveys may show evidence of longer-term impacts on these communities...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{infrastructure}} {{projects such as}} ports can {{have a significant impact}} on the development of nearby cities. While economic benefits of the <b>port</b> <b>spill</b> over to other regions, often internationally operating firms, port-cities experience negative externalities like environmental and land use issues and traffic congestion. Traditional port impact studies are expensive, and offer a static picture that doesn’t take into account the complex adaptive nature of the port-city system. There is a need for a comprehensive dynamic model of port-city development, incorporating beneficial and negative externalities of port infrastructure development on the city and peri-urban green space. A system dynamics modelling study is performed using the case study of Tema and its port on the Gulf of Guinea in Ghana, to evaluate interventions for sustainable port-city development in an African context. A model is conceptualized and specified, based on Forrester’s Urban Dynamics model, fit to cope with relative scarcity of available data. It incorporates and explicitly models road transport congestion, informal settlement and green space encroachment, as well as port infrastructure. Model testing and use show that the model is fit for the purpose of exploring the long term impacts of port infrastructure investments on the port-city system. Interventions aiming at sustainable development are simulated and evaluated for their performance. Recommendations regarding interventions and the potential future use of the model with stakeholders are made. Complex Systems Engineering and Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The Ideal Drycleaners site {{consists}} of an abandoned and demolished former drycleaning facility. The facility is situated in downtown Livingston on about 0. 4 acres (17, 300 ft 2) in a mixed-use, residential and commercial block. The drycleaner property is flat; however, the grade {{of the street and}} adjacent properties is such that runoff drains south, then west to a storm water network which is routed to a channelized tributary of Town Creek. Ideal began drycleaning operations in the 1940 's and ceased in 1983. The facility mainly used stoddard solvent but also used tetrachloroethylene (PCE) during its operation. It also operated a fuel island for its fleet of delivery trucks. No records of solvent usage rates, wastes, or disposal for the operation were found. During demolition, three aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) were observed, and two underground storage tanks (USTs) were discovered at the site. One UST was ruptured and released its contents to the soil and drainage network. Four additional USTs were later found at the site. PCE in free-product form was detected in one tank, all others contained mostly water contaminated with petroleum products, including stoddard solvent. Historical releases are assumed to have occurred through leaking tanks, the leaking pipes, and <b>spills</b> around filling <b>ports</b> and distribution points.
