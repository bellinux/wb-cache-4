50|$|Sinn formed Ultronic Systems Corp. in December 1960, and was {{president}} and CEO from then until {{he left the}} company in 1970. By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first desk units (<b>Stockmaster)</b> in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The <b>Stockmaster</b> desk units offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and General Telephone (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company Reuters signed a joint venture agreement to market <b>Stockmaster</b> worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information. Ultronics invented time division multiplex equipment to utilize Reuters’ voice grade lines to Europe and the Far East to transmit U.S. stock and commodity information plus Reuters’ teletype news channels.|$|E
50|$|When Ultronics {{introduced}} their <b>Stockmaster</b> desk {{units in}} 1961 they priced the service at {{approximately the same}} price as the Quotron desk units. They did not want a price competition only a performance competition. All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges. The cost of the system, desk units and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote desk units at prices significantly less than <b>Stockmaster</b> or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their <b>Stockmaster</b> and Quotron systems. The Telequote desk units never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their price cutting did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S.. Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this price cutting was not a factor.|$|E
50|$|Telerate was a US company {{providing}} {{financial data}} to market participants, specialising in commercial paper and bond prices. It {{was a pioneer}} in the electronic distribution of real-time market information in the 1970s. With its main innovation being to extend the technology that was used to obtain live stock prices, via Telequote, Quotron or <b>Stockmaster</b> to other sectors of the financial industry, such as corporate debt, currencies, interest rates and commodities.|$|E
50|$|The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis blocked Ultronics {{from winning}} a {{historic}} first. In July 1962 AT&T launched {{the first commercial}} satellite (Telstar) to transmit television and telephone voice channels between the U.S. and England and France. This was a non-synchronous satellite which circled the earth in an elliptical orbit of about 2.5 hours, such that it gave only about 20 minutes of communication between the U.S. and Europe on each pass. Ultronics arranged with AT&T {{to use one of}} its voice channels to transmit U.S. stock prices to Paris in October 1962. All of the arrangements were made-a <b>Stockmaster</b> unit was installed in the Bache brokerage office on Rue Royale and all of the American Stockbrokers and the press and television were ready for this historic event. About two hours before the pass the stock transmission was cancelled because U.S. president John Kennedy was going to use the pass to send his speech to France concerning the Cuban missile crisis.|$|E

Stock-Master uses a three-tier architecture. The tiers include an applet which interfaces with a server-side application, {{which in turn}} accesses a database/quote server. Use of design patterns, extensible object-oriented programming methods, and database design {{are discussed in the}} context of designing the project. ...|$|E
