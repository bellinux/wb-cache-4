40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>shattering</b> (or pod dehiscence, {{or fruit}} shedding) is {{essential}} for the propagation of their offspring in wild plants but is a major cause of yield loss in crops. In the dicot model species, Arabidopsis thaliana, pod dehiscence necessitates a development of the abscission zones along the pod valve margins. In monocots, such as cereals, an abscission layer in the pedicle is required for the <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> process. In the past decade, great advances have been made in characterizing the genetic contributors that are involved in the complex regulatory network in the establishment of abscission cell identity. We summarize the recent burgeoning progress in the field of genetic regulation of pod dehiscence and fruit shedding, focusing mainly on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana with its close relatives and the fleshy fruit species tomato, as well as the genetic basis responsible for the parallel loss of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> in domesticated crops.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{occurrence of}} herbicide resistance, along with no new herbicide modes of action developed in over 30 years, {{have increased the}} need for non-herbicidal weed management strategies and tactics. Harvest weed seed control (HWSC) practices have been successfully adopted in Australia to manage problematic weeds. For HWSC to be effective, {{a high proportion of}} weed seeds must be retained on the plant at crop maturity. This 2 -year (2014, 2015) study evaluated <b>seed</b> <b>shatter</b> of wild oat (Avena fatua L.), green foxtail (Setaria viridis L. Beauv.), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.), and cleavers (Galium spp.) in an early (field pea, Pisum sativum L.) and late (spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L.) maturity crop in field experiments at Scott, Saskatchewan as well as producer fields (including canola, Brassica napus L.) in Saskatchewan. In producer fields, kochia (Kochia scoparia L. Schrad.) and wild buckwheat, (Polygonum convolvulus L.) were also investigated. <b>Seed</b> <b>shatter</b> was assessed using shatter trays collected once a week during crop ripening stage, as well as at two crop harvest stages (swathing, direct-combining). In the small-plot experiments, <b>seed</b> <b>shatter</b> differed among weed species, but was similar between field pea and wheat at maturity: ca. 30 % for wild oat, 5 % for cleavers, < 2 % for wild mustard, and < 1 % for green foxtail. Similar results were observed in producer fields: 22 - 30 % for wild oat, and generally < 10 % for the other species. <b>Seed</b> <b>shatter</b> of weeds in canola at swathing, including that of wild oat, was uniformly low (< 5 %). Overall, <b>seed</b> <b>shatter</b> of wild oat occurred sooner and at greater levels during the growing season compared with the other weeds.

40|$|A key step during crop {{domestication}} is {{the loss}} of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering.</b> Here we show that <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> in sorghum is controlled by a single gene, Shattering 1 (Sh 1), which encodes a YABBY transcription factor. Domesticated sorghums harbor three different mutations at the Sh 1 locus. Variants at regulatory sites in the promoter and intronic regions lead to a low level of expression, a 2. 2 -kb fragment deletion causes a truncated transcript that lacks the second and third exons, and a GT-to-GG splicing variant in the intron 4 results in removal of the exon 4. The distributions of these non-shattering haplotypes among sorghum landraces suggest three independent origins. The function of the rice ortholog (OsSh 1) was subsequently validated with a shattering resistant mutant, and two maize orthologs (ZmSh 1 - 1 and ZmSh 1 - 5. 1 +ZmSh 1 - 5. 2) were verified with a large mapping population. Our results indicate that Sh 1 genes for <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> were under parallel selection during sorghum, rice, and maize domestication.

40|$|Abstract A {{critical}} evolutionary step during rice domestication was {{the elimination}} of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering.</b> Wild rice disperses seeds freely at maturity to guaran-tee the propagation, while cultivated rice retains seeds on the straws to make easy harvest and decrease the loss of production. The molecular basis for this key event during rice domestication remains to be eluci-dated. Here we show that the <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> is con-trolled by a single dominant gene, Shattering 1 (SHA 1), encoding {{a member of the}} trihelix family of plant-speciWc transcription factors. SHA 1 was mapped to a 5. 5 kb genomic fragment, which contains a single open reading frame, using a backcrossed population between cultivated rice Teqing and an introgression line IL 105 with the <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> habit derived from perennial common wild rice, YJCWR. The predicted amino acid sequence of SHA 1 in YJCWR and IL 105 is distinguished from that in eight domesticated rice culti-vars, including Teqing, by only a single amino acid sub-stitution (K 79 N) caused by a single nucleotide change (g 237 t). Further sequence veriWcation on the g 237 t mutation site revealed that the g 237 t mutation is pres-ent in all the domesticated rice cultivars, including 92 indica and 108 japonica cultivars, but not in any of the 24 wild rice accessions examined. Our results demon-strate that the g 237 t mutation in SHA 1 accounts for {{the elimination of}} <b>seed</b> <b>shattering,</b> and that all the domesti-cated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha 1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity. In addition, our data support the theory that the non-shattering trait selection during rice domesti-cation occurred prior to the indica–japonica diVerenti-ation in rice evolutionary history...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Seed</b> <b>shattering,</b> or shedding, is an {{important}} fitness trait for wild and weedy grasses. U. S. weedy rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly shattering weed, thought to have evolved from non-shattering cultivated ancestors. All U. S. weedy rice individuals examined to date contain a mutation in the sh 4 locus associated with loss of shattering during rice domestication. Weedy individuals also share the shattering trait with wild rice, but not the ancestral shattering mutation at sh 4; thus, how weedy rice reacquired the shattering phenotype is unknown. To establish the morphological basis of the parallel evolution of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice and wild, we examined the abscission layer at the flower-pedicel junction in weedy individuals in comparison with wild and cultivated relatives. Results Consistent with previous work, shattering wild rice individuals possess clear, defined abscission layers at flowering, whereas non-shattering cultivated rice individuals do not. Shattering weedy rice from two separately evolved populations in the U. S. (SH and BHA) show patterns of abscission layer formation and degradation distinct from wild rice. Prior to flowering, the abscission layer has formed in all weedy individuals and by flowering it is already degrading. In contrast, wild O. rufipogon abscission layers have been shown not to degrade until after flowering has occurred. Conclusions <b>Seed</b> <b>shattering</b> in weedy rice involves the formation and degradation of an abscission layer in the flower-pedicel junction, as in wild Oryza, but is a developmentally different process from shattering in wild rice. Weedy rice abscission layers appear to break down earlier than wild abscission layers. The timing of weedy abscission layer degradation suggests that unidentified regulatory genes may {{play a critical role}} in the reacquisition of shattering in weedy rice, and sheds light on the morphological basis of parallel evolution for shattering in weedy and wild rice. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Buckwheat is {{a species}} prone to lodging {{which is one}} of the reasons of {{lowering}} the size of buckwheat seeds yield; the other is never-ending vegetation, which favours uneven seeds maturation and <b>seeds</b> <b>shattering</b> before harvesting.

The height of a stalk and its thickness are features which are positively correlated with stiffness and energy of cutting stalks. Energy necessary for cutting stalks decreases along with the plant height and is rather low. Key words: buckwheat, stalk, stiffness, energy of cutting, lodgin...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a {{combination}} of the need for rotational crops and an increased desire for biofuel production created interest in planting Brassica napus (canola). However, questions were raised arisen over the potential damage canola production could have on the preexisting Brassica vegetable seed industry. To address these concerns three studies were conducted to: 1.) Determine the potential of gene flow and hybridization via pollen from Brassica napus to related Brassica vegetable crops; 2.) Evaluate whether transgenes will be detectable in harvested Brassica vegetable seed; 3.) Evaluate the potential for volunteer canola to become a contaminant in the Brassica vegetable seed crops. Crossing experiments were conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2009 using Brassica rapa or Brassica oleracea inbred line receptor plants placed within conventional B. napus fields. Once seed set occurred on the receptor plants, each was harvested individually and the seed germinated in a growth chamber. Flow cytometry, morphological and molecular analyses were performed on the seedlings. Hybridization between B. napus and B. rapa inbreds was 74 % in 2007, 89 % in 2008, and 15 % in 2009. However, no hybridization occurred between B. napus and the B. oleracea inbred lines. Experiments were conducted using transgenic B. napus and the previously mentioned vegetable species, to quantify outcrossing rates in a greenhouse environment. Transgenes were detectable in both germinable and non-germinable seed produced on non-transgenic plants. Following B. napus harvest at the field sites, <b>shattered</b> canola <b>seed</b> was collected from both windrow and non-windrow locations. Approximately 30 days after the shatter samples were taken, canola seedling recruitment counts were made in quadrats placed immediately adjacent to the location of the <b>seed</b> <b>shatter</b> samples. Results of this volunteer assessment indicated differences in <b>seed</b> <b>shatter</b> between fields and windrow vs. non-windrow locations, but seedling recruitment only differed by fields.

Information is needed to measure the impact of this problem and to provide proper management strategies. Studies were conducted to investigate the problem of shattering in MG IV soybean, the dominant soybean group in ESPS, in 2006 and 2007. The objectives of this study were to determine the pattern and critical period of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> of MG IV soybeans under various climatic and production conditions in the Mississippi Delta. A total of 56 and 80 MG IV soybean varieties were evaluated in the experiments in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The varieties were all selected from a Mississippi Soybean Variety Trial and the study was carried out at Stoneville Mississippi. In 2006, only the April planting (April 19) under irrigation was investigated. In 2007, experiments were conducted on both irrigated and non-irrigated fields. On the irrigated tests, both April (April 23) and May (May 15) planting were examined. Results from both years have indicated that most pods of early MG IV soybean varieties can hold seeds relatively well for the first three weeks after maturity (WAM). However, differences were noted starting from the fourth WAM. Non-irrigated soybean shattered faster than irrigated soybean after three weeks. Irrigated soybean held seeds longer than non-irrigated soybean during the fourth week; however, <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> became greater after four weeks even in the irrigated study. When comparing early- and late-planted soybean under irrigated conditions, the later maturing pods held seeds better within the same period after maturity (up to 6 weeks or longer).

C. tinctorius can cross with a number of its wild relatives, creating the possibility of gene flow from safflower to weedy species. In this study we looked at the introgression potential between different members of the genus Carthamus, measured the fitness of the parents versus the F 1 hybrids, followed the segregation of a specific transgene in the progeny and tried to identify traits important for adaptation to different environments. Results Safflower hybridized and produced viable offspring with members of the section Carthamus and species with chromosome numbers of n = 10 and n = 22, but not with n = 32. The T-DNA construct of a transgenic C. tinctorius line was passed on to the F 1 progeny in a Mendelian fashion, except in one specific cross, where it was deleted at a frequency of approximately 21 %.

Wuyujing- 7 (japonica), showed a spreading panicle, which was different significantly from that of Wuyujing- 7 with an erect compact panicle. The gene controlling a spreading panicle {{is referred to as}} Spr 3, and is mapped on chromosome 4. To uncover the genetic basis of Spr 3, a large F 2 population derived from cross between SG- 64 andWuyujing- 7 was constructed for finemapping of the Spr 3 locus. The high-resolution linkage analysis revealed that the Spr 3 locuswas narroweddown to a 4. 6 -kb region. The delimited genomic DNA regions ofWuyuj-ing- 7 and CG- 14 were sequenced and compared. Sequence mutations between Wuyujing- 7 and CG- 14 were evident and the candidate genes for the locus were predicted. Publicly available databases were searched for homologous cDNA sequences. However, any coding regions or other meaningful sequences for the Spr 3 locus were not found within this delimited region. This result suggested that Spr 3 is an unknown genetic factor in controlling the outspreading of the primary branches in rice inflorescence. In addition, NIL(Spr 3) exhibited <b>seed</b> <b>shattering.</b> The formation of spreading panicle was accompanied by a fewundesirable traits and the spreading panicle linkswith <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> suggest that the spread-ing panicle was likely lost during the domestication and selection for high seed productivity of cultivated rice.

Accessions PI 383309 and PI 381607 were chosen for this study because of their superior yield characteristics. The effects of pre-storage drying of harvested plant materials on the yields and seed germination were studied in the second year of the experiment. Both accessions responded similarly to all treatments. The effects of harvest dates on the yield components and seed germination were comparable in the two years of the study except for the seed yield. The difference for the seed yield was due to earlier capsule maturity in 1979 that resulted in earlier <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> in that year. Drying of the harvested plant materials in a dryer immediately after harvest did not significantly affect the oil and thebaine yields or the percentage of seed germination. Although the data for the thebaine concentration of the capsules in 1978 were of questionable accuracy, capsule thebaine yield was not significantly different for the harvest dates later than four weeks after petal opening. Seed oil yield was not significantly affected by the harvest dates in 1978. However, in 1979, seed oil yield for the harvests later than seven weeks after petal opening were significantly lower than that on the earlier harvest dates. While seed oil content was very stable, <b>seed</b> <b>shattering</b> was responsible for the decline of seed oil yield on the later harvest dates in both years of the study. <b>Seed</b> <b>shattering</b> was more pronounced in the second year of the study when plants produced larger capsules and more seeds.

Seeds were found to be viable four weeks after petal opening, or earlier, although they continued to develop in the capsules for two to three weeks after that date. Seven weeks after petal opening was found to be the optimum capsule harvest date under the climatic conditions of the experimental site. Thebaine yield of approximately eight kilograms per hectare was calculated for the capsules harvested on that date. Forty-five kilograms of oil were obtained fromthe seeds of capsules harvested seven weeks after petal opening in 1978. This yield was significantly higher in 1979 when it exceeded sixty-five kilograms of oil per hectare.

Field experiments were conducted at Stoneville MS from 2007 to 2009 to investigate the shattering patterns of 80 - 132 MG IV soybean varieties each year. Results from 2007 and 2008 indicated that, when April-planted MG IV soybeans matured in mid- to late August, pods of most soybean varieties did not shatter within the first three weeks after maturity (WAM) and there was no significant shattering effect on final yields. However, differences in pod shattering among the varieties became apparent in the fourth WAM. Late-planted MG IV soybeans, which matured in early September, had a low shattering rate and could hold seeds up to 6 WAM before reaching a critical shattering point. Most soybean varieties planted in April 2009 did not show significant pod shattering {{by the end of the}} fourth WAM. The critical point of shattering was not reached until 6 - 7 WAM. Relatively lower temperatures and abundant rainfall during the late growing season in 2009 may be the main reasons causing delayed shattering in April-planted MG IV soybeans.

Description Grass Family (Poaceae). Common reed is a warm-season, rhizomatous, stoloniferous perennial, native to the U. S. The height ranges from 6 to 12 feet. The leaf blade is flat; smooth; 1 / 2 to 2 inches wide; and 6 to 18 inches long. The seedhead is an open panicle with a purplish or tawny and flaglike appearance after <b>seed</b> <b>shatter.</b> Common reed is readily identified by its height. It is the tallest grass in southern marshes and swamps. Management This grass cannot withstand prolonged heavy grazing. Its upright growth {{makes it easy for}} livestock to remove all the leaves. For maximum production, no more than 50 percent of current year's growth by weight should be grazed off during growing season. Common reed tolerates burning if water is above soil surface. Burning is not essential for management. Water control that lowers the water level, but does not drain the area, increases production. Grazing deferments of 60 to 90 days every 2 to 3 years during the growing season improve plant vigor...|$|R
30|$|Incidences of weedy rice {{continuously}} {{occurred in}} paddy fields because its <b>shattering</b> <b>seeds</b> {{were able to}} over-winter. In this research, the seed deterioration of weedy rice was investigated compared with cultivated rice, and the wintering characteristics of {{these two types of}} rice were investigated with the field wintering test, freezing resistance test, and accelerated aging test.|$|R
30|$|With similar {{objectives}} as described above, CSSLs {{have also been}} developed {{in the background of}} an indica cultivar with donor segments from japonica varieties. These populations include HJX 74 (indica, recurrent parent) × four japonica donors (Suyunuo, IRAT 261, Lemont, and JAPAR 9) developed to map QTLs for different traits including days to heading and grain length (Xi et al. 2006); Zhenshen 97 B (indica recurrent parent) × Nipponbare (japonica donor) to map QTL alleles enhancing the culturability of indica rice (Zhao et al. 2009); and ‘ 93 – 11 ’ (indica recurrent parent) × Nipponbare (Japonica donor) to detect QTLs for panicle number per plant and grain yield under low nitrogen and phosphorus conditions (Wang et al. 2009) and <b>seed</b> <b>shattering,</b> grain length, and grain width (Zhu et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|As {{an example}} of the {{quantitative}} nature of domestication traits, I have chosen the example of <b>seed</b> <b>shattering.</b> Several major QTLs have been reported for this trait in rice [16]. Two of them, sh 4 and qSH 1, have been cloned [16, 19]. Since the selected sh 4 allele was found in all examined landraces and modern cultivars of both indica and japonica rice, the sh 4 mutation is likely to have been utilized during the very early stages of the rice domestication process. Note that the defective sh 4 allele was also found in some O. rufipogon, and would thus represent standing variation. In contrast, qSH 1 appears to be a mutation that originated at least 3, 000  years ago and that is found only in a subset of temperate japonica [16].|$|E
30|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>shattering</b> {{was also}} {{demonstrated}} to be a QTL-controlled trait {{with at least}} 4 loci (Cai and Morishima 2000). In addition to sh 1 and sh 4 used in the current study, sh 2 (Oba et al. 1995, chr. 1), sh 3 (Eiguchi and Sano 1990, chr. 4) and sh 5 (Cubry et al. 2018, chr. 5) {{also contribute to the}} control of shattering. Detailed studies of sh 2 and sh 3 are not available yet. Loss-of-function sh 5 is present mainly in African cultivated rice Oryza glaberrima (Cubry et al. 2018). In the present study, all accessions have the same sh 4 haplotype, and all except Nipponbare have the same Sh 1 haplotype. However, the shattering degree of these accessions varies (Table  3 and Additional file  3 : Table S 1): thus, other genes than sh 1 and sh 4 must be responsible for the observed differences in degree of shattering.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} species of Crotalaria that are popularly {{consumed}} by human populations throughout the world. The wild and domesticated landraces of Crotalaria tetragona, colloquially known as “Tum-thang,” are grown and eaten by the tribal communities of the Mizoram state of North-east India. The flowers and pods of Crotalaria tetragona are eaten as vegetables, the flowers and buds are used as garnishing, and the seeds are eaten as pulse. In the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa, the wild and cultivated lines of Crotalaria brevidens, also known as “mitoo,” are harvested and eaten as a leafy vegetable in many popular cuisines. Its wide consumption is mainly due to its nutritional value as {{a rich source of}} β-carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin A. Crotalaria longirostrata, also known as [...] "longbreak rattlebox" [...] or “chipilín,” is found in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Oaxaca and is a popular addition to many local dishes. The edible portions of the plant are the leaves and shoots, which are cooked and served as a leafy green vegetable or desiccated and utilized as an herb. The comestible foliage contains high amounts of calcium, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and ascorbic acid, while the seeds and roots are considerably toxic. Crotalaria longirostrata is considered a “noxious weed” in the United States since it is avoided as a source of consumption by many animals and since its <b>seeds</b> <b>shatter</b> and spread over a wide range.|$|R
40|$|The Breeder’s Dilemma - The Conflict Between Yield and Nutrition” {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} breeding for highly nutritious grains when yield is the predominant selection criterion (Morris and Sands, 2006). Perennial grasses, in particular those {{that have already been}} used as food sources by indigenous peoples, offer an opportunity to develop sustainable and nutritious grain crops from genetic resources that have not been subjected to rigorous selection for yield. To date, our team has developed and commercialized two perennial grass crops and evaluated their nutrition profiles. Indian Rice Grass (IRG, Achnatherum hymenoides) was used by indigenous people in the western United States. Grain from this perennial grass was consumed as a staple as early as 7 000 years ago, long before maize was cultivated. The grains are smaller, and much higher in protein and essential amino acid content compared to wheat. These <b>seeds</b> <b>shatter</b> and have a vernalization trait that suggests that they have not been domesticated in the modern agronomic sense. The grain can be ground into dark and flavourful, gluten-free flour that was marketed as Montina™. Another perennial grass product that has made it to market is Timtana™ flour, derived from Timothy grass seed (Phleum pratense). It is also high in protein, gluten-free and flavourful when used in baking. Both of these grains have a higher level of essential amino acids in their protein. With much of the world covered by perennial grains prior to agricultural development, there should be many more crops to develop as “new” emerging crops. A promising search strategy might be to focus on sites where baking ovens or ancient villages were once located. Collection of seeds of perennial plants from such locations may be particularly rewarding. Selection criteria might include several nutritional traits including high protein value, low glycaemic index, low phytic acid content, high omega- 3 levels and absence of amylase-trypsin inhibitors...|$|R
5000|$|Hairy vetch {{is widely}} used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of {{atmospheric}} nitrogen. [...] Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture {{are related to the}} crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to <b>shatter</b> <b>seed</b> early in the season - leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production.|$|R
