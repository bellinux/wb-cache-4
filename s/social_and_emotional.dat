5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> abilities in later life.|$|E

In many cultures, there are strong <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

40|$|The current thesis {{examined}} the effects of anxious/avoidant attachment on depression and anxiety and the potential role of <b>social</b> acceptance <b>and</b> partner-specific <b>emotional</b> reactivity as mediators or additive mechanisms in the relations between insecure attachment and psychological maladjustment. Couples completed self report measures of anxious and avoidant attachment <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> reactivity <b>and</b> rated themselves and their partners on perceived <b>social</b> acceptance <b>and</b> depression/anxiety. Anxious attachment predicted more depression and anxiety and was related to lower <b>social</b> acceptance <b>and</b> higher <b>emotional</b> reactivity scores. Depression and anxiety also predicted lower <b>social</b> acceptance <b>and</b> higher <b>emotional</b> reactivity. Rather than operating as mediators, <b>social</b> acceptance <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> reactivity had additive effects on depression and anxiety. Thus, anxious attachment, <b>social</b> acceptance, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> reactivity all explained significant increments in anxiety and depression variance. ...|$|R

Camps represent environments where children can develop their <b>social</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence insofar as camp activities teach {{children how to}} build positive relationships and to relate to others emotionally that lead to positive outcomes. Little research has examined children’s <b>social</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> the relationship between them. Using a longitudinal dataset, {{this study examined the}} change of <b>social</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence experienced by campers. Findings revealed that increases in social capital caused increases in emotional intelligence. Differences were found based on gender. Furthermore, residential camps were found to have a stronger effect on the relationship between <b>social</b> capital <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence than day camps. This study lends itself to furthering the understanding of the development of <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> the importance of camp in children’s development...|$|R
40|$|Children {{learning}} English as {{an additional}} language (EAL) often experience lower academic attainment than monolingual peers. In this study, teachers provided ratings of English language proficiency <b>and</b> <b>social,</b> <b>emotional,</b> <b>and</b> behavioral functioning for 782 children with EAL and 6, 485 monolingual children in reception year (ages 4 – 5). Academic attainment was assessed in reception and Year 2 (ages 6 – 7). Relative to monolingual peers with comparable English language proficiency, children with EAL displayed fewer <b>social,</b> <b>emotional,</b> <b>and</b> behavioral difficulties in reception, were equally likely to meet curriculum targets in reception, {{and were more likely}} to meet targets in Year 2.

5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.|$|E
5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional,</b> including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E

40|$|Cross {{cultural}} {{training is}} widely believed to make a positive contribution to expatriate adjustment. In practice, however, it is very costly and sometimes ineffective for expatriates.

To do so we blend ideas drawn from <b>social</b> capital theory <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence to develop the structure that underlies the logic of this paper.

25|$|C-PTSD is also {{characterized}} by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive insecure, or disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD {{do not include}} insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts. Although {{the great majority of}} survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> development if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment.|$|E
