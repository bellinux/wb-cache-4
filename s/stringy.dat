5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} <b>stringy,</b> like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are <b>stringy,</b> and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but <b>stringy</b> when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
25|$|Samphire {{is usually}} cooked, either steamed or microwaved, and then coated in butter or olive oil. Due to its high salt content, {{it must be}} cooked without any salt added, in plenty of water. It has a hard, <b>stringy</b> core, and after cooking, the edible flesh is pulled off from the core. This flesh, after cooking, resembles seaweed in color, and the flavor and texture are like young spinach stems or asparagus. Samphire is often used as a {{suitably}} maritime accompaniment to fish or seafood.|$|E
500|$|Ground {{sassafras}} leaf, {{known as}} filé, {{is generally not}} added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and {{have been removed from}} the heat source. [...] If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly <b>stringy</b> texture.|$|E
500|$|To give Pam {{the proper}} look, the makeup {{department}}, headed by Cheri Montesanto-Mecalf, applied mascara under Hamilton's eyes and then smudged it {{to give her}} a [...] "haunted" [...] look. Pam's <b>stringy</b> and multi-hued hairstyle was Hamilton's creation. Dena Green, the hair department head, was tasked with creating an exact wig replica to be worn by Hamilton's stunt double.|$|E
500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of it is tough or <b>stringy.</b> It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E
500|$|Trees {{that are}} {{infected}} by A.luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both {{above and below}} ground. Above the ground, {{the base of the}} tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes white rot, a fungal wood decay process where the cellulose and lignin of the sapwood are both broken down, leaving the wood <b>stringy.</b> The bark of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to [...] above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear {{at the base of the}} tree in autumn. Crowns may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted sapwood, and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.|$|E
500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so <b>stringy</b> that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E
500|$|Up to [...] in diameter, the cap is convex to {{flattened}} {{in shape}} {{with a central}} umbo (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded gills are [...] and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins. The stem is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to [...] long by [...] thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that {{run up and down}} its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like ring which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The flesh is white, and in the stem has a woolly or <b>stringy</b> consistency. Although it has a hot-bitter taste, Armillaria luteobubalina is edible, and cooking removes the bitterness.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, <b>stringy</b> locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E
500|$|At Regent's Park David {{made little}} {{professional}} progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David {{was restricted to}} bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. According to an interview with Chaney, [...] "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved." [...] David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried {{to put a stop}} to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a <b>stringy</b> piece of meat into a good dish.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{buildings}} were constructed of timber slabs and <b>stringy</b> bark, later wattle and daub became common. Plentiful sandstone {{in the area}} led to significant buildings being constructed of that material.|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} for straining the woody fibre of the dried 'ava root is {{obtained from the}} bark of the fau tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). [...] This bark is stripped off and the outer skin removed. The remaining inner bark is then shredded and forms a type of <b>stringy</b> and fibrous mesh used to mix and strain the beverage in the wooden bowl.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, [...] "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little <b>stringy,</b> but not too tough or <b>stringy</b> to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{environment}} is classed as sclerophyll open forest and {{is divided into}} [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "wet" [...] sclerophyll forest. Factors shape this habitat are primarily bushfires, low phosphorus/nitrogen levels, intense summer heat and low water levels. Resulting in a diverse floristic assembly of flora and fauna with apparently divergent paths in similar habitats, for example scribbly gums (Eucalyptus racemosa/sclerophylla/haemastoma) have smooth barked trees in a manner which reduces their chance of catching on fire while <b>stringy</b> barks (Eucalyptus sp.) have bark which easily catches alight {{clearing the way for}} its fire-stimulated seedlings.|$|E
2500|$|The Mendocino cypress {{is highly}} {{variable}} in growth form, depending on soil conditions. In the pygmy forest plant community on poor, acidic, nutrient-starved podsol soils with drainage impeded by an iron hardpan, it is a stunted tree from 0.2–5meters in height at maturity. When occurring in its pygmy form, {{it is sometimes}} called pygmy cypress. [...] When growing on deep, well-drained soils {{it can be a}} large tree up to 30–50meters in height and 1–2.4m in trunk diameter. The bark is dark gray-brown, with <b>stringy</b> texture, and fissured on old trees.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{accounts}} {{record that}} the creature {{appeared to have}} [...] "no visible arms" [...] due to its incredible speed, while others reported long, <b>stringy</b> arms, protruding {{from the front of}} its body, with long, claw-like fingers. The creature {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Lizard Monster" [...] on the March 10, 2010, episode of MonsterQuest. Some witnesses reported seeing a large, pulsating red ball of light that hovered above or rested on the ground. Ufologists believe that it may have been a powered craft that the entity had piloted.|$|E
2500|$|Oaxaca cheese {{originated}} {{in the state of}} Oaxaca, but it is now made and eaten in just about all of Mexico and is generally found only in Mexico. It is a soft, stretched-curd cheese, made with cows’ milk much like asadero, but the cheese’s pH is modified to 5.3 to get the <b>stringy</b> texture. The cheese is then formed into ropes which are then wound into balls. [...] The cheese can be melted especially for quesadillas, but it is often eaten pulled apart or shredded on top of prepared dishes. Oaxaca cheese can be used in place of mozzarella in salads.|$|E
2500|$|The drill {{offers an}} ancient method of {{starting}} fire without matches or a lighter, {{a method that}} applies friction to generate heat. The heat eventually produces an ember in the burnt sawdust. The ember is tiny, smaller than {{the head of a}} cigarette, and fragile. Once the ember is formed it is carefully placed into a [...] "tinder bundle" [...] (a bird's type nest of <b>stringy,</b> fluffy, and combustible material). Once the ember is in the tinder bundle it is then carefully nurtured and coaxed into flame. Once the tinder bundle bursts into flame, it is placed into the fuel that has been assembled ready for ignition.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{conjunctivitis}} {{causes the}} rapid onset of conjunctival redness, {{swelling of the}} eyelid, and mucopurulent discharge. [...] Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days. [...] Bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria causes marked grittiness/irritation and a <b>stringy,</b> opaque, greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep. [...] Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur. [...] The gritty and/or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye. [...] The more acute pyogenic infections can be painful. Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis is involved.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States and Canada, {{chicken soup}} often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of [...] "chicken noodle soup". The term {{may have been}} coined in a {{commercial}} for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a [...] "chicken soup with noodles", {{but when it was}} advertised on the Amos 'n' Andy radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as [...] "chicken noodle soup". Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and <b>stringy</b> to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incubation}} period for {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} has a range between one and 12 days. The disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly {{after two or three}} days, blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of <b>stringy</b> or foamy saliva and to drooling, and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness. [...] Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, as well as swelling in the testicles of mature males, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly. [...] Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals. [...] Some infected ruminants remain asymptomatic carriers, but they nonetheless carry FMDV and may be able to transmit it to others. Pigs cannot serve as asymptomatic carriers.|$|E
2500|$|For her part, Pixie Lott cited French screen goddess Brigitte Bardot and Edie Sedgwick as her fashion icons – and Factory Girl as her {{favourite}} film – {{and defined}} her look as [...] "vintage clothes, which I mix with contemporary stuff, or I'll be indie and hippie, with accessories such as rings, chains and headbands ... I {{like to wear}} girlie things, but only if I can rock them up with biker boots or a jacket". Author and critic Bruce Dessau wrote of American-British actress and singer Juliette Lewis that [...] "there is something odd about [...] attractive boho-chic appearance in a <b>stringy</b> black vest, vintage beads and blue skirt that I cannot quite locate". In 2007 London Lite contrasted the [...] "gay glamour" [...] of American actress Goldie Hawn with the [...] "more relaxed, boho look" [...] of her daughter, actress Kate Hudson, noting that [...] "keeping the colours neutral, 's careful not to break any style rules, with classy knitwear and good-quality accessories".|$|E
2500|$|Soon after 2:35a.m., {{a man who}} {{was later}} given the {{pseudonym}} Alan Masters was driving through an intersection {{a few blocks from the}} park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle that sped through the intersection without its headlights activated as the driver ignored a red light. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face, dark, long, <b>stringy</b> hair, several days' growth of dark whiskers on his face, and wearing a blue jacket. Masters was upset and he neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought that it might have been a New Jersey rather than a New York plate. Violante encountered a very similar man, because he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before they were shot. Violante described him as a [...] "grubby-looking hippy" [...] with whiskers, wiry hair over his forehead, dark eyes, and wearing a denim jacket.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz {{were part}} of the Far Eastern Party, a three-man {{sledging}} team with Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis, to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their [...] return journey. Their meat was tough, <b>stringy</b> and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition hypervitaminosis A because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.|$|E
2500|$|Radio City Music Hall {{selected}} {{the film to}} be its Easter attraction. The film was a US box-office failure and many reviews, particularly those for Ball, were particularly brutal; the movie has a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Time Magazine said, [...] "The movie spans about 20 years, and seems that long in running time [...] [...] [...] Miss Ball has been molded over the years {{into some sort of}} national monument, and she performs like one too. Her grace, her timing, her vigor have all vanished." [...] Time Out London declared she [...] "simply hasn't the drive and steel of a Rosalind Russell, an Angela Lansbury or a Ginger Rogers, all of whom played the part before her," [...] and said of Saks, [...] "When he's not ogling his star in perpetual soft focus and a $300,000 fashion parade, [...] fails to get enough retakes, match his shots, or inject the essential vim." [...] Pauline Kael in The New Yorker wondered, [...] "After forty years in movies and TV, did she discover in herself an unfulfilled ambition to be a flaming drag queen?" [...] The New Republics Stanley Kauffman, though he pointed out that Ball would have made a perfect Mame had she played the role [...] "fifteen years earlier," [...] described her as [...] "too old, too <b>stringy</b> in the legs, too basso in the voice, and too creaky in the joints." [...] Virtually every critic took notice of the heavy-handedness in photographing Ball out of focus, Rex Reed {{going so far as to}} suggest, albeit jokingly, that chicken fat was put over the lens. Some regarded this as evidence that those executives responsible for signing Ball, and Ball herself, knew from the outset that she was too old for her role. In her defense in regards to her lack of singing ability, Ball told one interviewer [...] "Mame stayed up all night and drank champagne! What did you expect her to sound like? Julie Andrews?" ...|$|E
