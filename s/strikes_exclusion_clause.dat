50|$|The {{doctrine}} of fundamental breach has been “laid to rest” by the Supreme Court of Canada in Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways). In its place, the Court {{has created a}} three-step test to evaluate the application of <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> The {{first step is to}} evaluate the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> in the factual context of each case to determine if it applies to the material circumstances. The second step is to evaluate if the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> was unconscionable at the time of incorporation. The final step is to evaluate whether the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> should not be enforced on public policy grounds.|$|R
500|$|The Act is {{designed}} to prevent the avoidance of implied terms through <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> It provides (in Section 4) that any attempt to exclude a seller in consumer sales from Sections 2 and 3 is void. In non-consumer sales an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is void [...] "to {{the extent that it}} is shown {{that it would not be}} fair or reasonable to allow reliance on the term". The burden of proof in such situations is on the party seeking to avoid liability through the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause.</b> For determining whether it is [...] "fair or reasonable" [...] to allow the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> five tests are used; 1) whether the parties were of equal bargaining strength, 2) whether the buyer was induced to agree to the clause, 3) whether the buyer knew, or ought to have known of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> 4) where the liability is conditional, if the condition is reasonable and 5) whether the goods were supplied as part of a special order. These basic tests were later extended into the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|R

50|$|Bird v Bicknell 1987 2 NZLR 542 is a cited case in New Zealand {{regarding}} fraud merely being {{a factor}} (albeit an important factor) {{in determining whether}} an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is valid or not.

40|$|One of the {{functions}} of contract is to set out the rights, duties and liabilities of {{the parties to the}} contract. When a party fails to perform his duty, he is liable to pay damages to the innocent party. However, it is quite a normal practice for a party to expressly exclude liability in such eventuality. Such a term is generally known as <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause.</b> It essentially means that if he fails to perform the duty that he is expressly or impliedly bound to carry out under the contract, he is not liable to the other party. Exclusion in performing obligations in the event of breach of contract is an issue that often creates a dispute between the contracting parties. It is even more crucial when the contract is wholly drafted only by one party. <b>Exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> are also found in standard forms of construction contracts. But they are worded {{in such a way that}} it is very difficult to determine with certainty that they are in fact <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> They normally exclude the liability of the employers and thus create inequality and unfairness between the contracting parties. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> and their effectiveness in excluding the employers’ liabilities. The scope of this study is limited to the Public Works Department standard forms of contracts. The study was carried out by analyzing the standard contract forms. The effectiveness was evaluated by examining the relevant court cases and opinions of experts. The analysis of the standard forms revealed sixteen <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> In term of their effectiveness, by and large, the research found that, not all the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> were effective to exclude the government’s liability to the contractor in the event of such failure of performance...|$|R
