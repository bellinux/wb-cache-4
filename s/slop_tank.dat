50|$|The {{discharges}} from seawater washing {{were still}} considered {{a problem and}} during the 1960s the load on top approach began to be adopted. The mixture of cleaning water and residue was pumped into a <b>slop</b> <b>tank</b> and allowed to separate by their different densities into oil and water during the journey. The water portion was then discharged, leaving only crude oil in the <b>slop</b> <b>tank.</b> This was pumped into the main tanks and the new cargo loaded on top of it, recovering as much as 800 tons of oil which was formerly discarded.|$|E
2500|$|Tempera has six {{pairs of}} heated, {{partially}} epoxy-coated cargo tanks and {{one pair of}} fully coated <b>slop</b> <b>tanks,</b> all divided by a longitudinal center bulkhead and protected by double hull, with a combined capacity of [...] at 98% filling. For cargo handling she has three electrically driven cargo oil pumps with a capacity of 3,500 m3/h × 130 m and one cargo oil stripping pump rated for 300 m3/h × 130 m. The cargo can be loaded in 10 hours and discharged in 12 hours. Each cargo tank has two and both <b>slop</b> <b>tanks</b> one automated tank cleaning machines as well as holes for portable tank cleaning machines.|$|R
50|$|After the Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} disaster, when that ship {{grounded}} on Bligh Reef outside {{the port of}} Valdez, Alaska in 1989, the US Government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull. However, {{the damage to the}} Exxon Valdez penetrated sections of the hull (the <b>slops</b> oil <b>tanks,</b> or <b>slop</b> <b>tanks)</b> that were protected by a double bottom, or partial double hull.|$|R
50|$|The ship is {{equipped}} with five manifolds, a discharge capacity of 3,000 m3/hour, a cargo handling capacity of 3,750 m3/hour, one Liebherr hose-handling crane with a reach of 22 m, an Alfa Lawal JWSP-26-C100 freshwater conversion plant with a capacity of 30 m3/day and a Jowa Bio STP3 sewage-treatment plant capable of sustaining 34 people. The ship has ten cargo tanks, two tanks with a capacity of 3,550 m3, four tanks with a capacity of 4,900 m3, four tanks with a capacity of 5,100 m3 and two <b>slop</b> <b>tanks</b> with a capacity of 1,000 m3.|$|R
50|$|Even {{with load}} on top {{there is still some}} oil in the {{discharged}} water from the <b>slop</b> <b>tank.</b> Starting in the 1970s, equipment capable of using crude oil itself for washing began to replace the water-based washing, leading to the current technique of crude oil washing. This reduces the remaining deliberate discharge of oil-contaminated water and increases the amount of cargo discharged, providing a further benefit to the cargo owner.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sample point}} on the {{discharge}} line allows for the analyzer to determine the oil content of the ballast and slop water in PPM. [...] The analyzer is self-maintaining by periodical cleansings with fresh water, and therefore requires a minimum of active maintenance from the crew. [...] The results of the analyzer are sent to a computer, which determines whether the oil content values are to result in overboard discharge or not. [...] The valves that direct the ballast water either over board or to <b>slop</b> <b>tank</b> are controlled by the integrated computer, and a GPS signal further automates the process by including special areas and completes the required input for the Oil Record Book.|$|E
5000|$|Then named Mister Darby, the boat's {{construction}} was completed {{and she was}} delivered to Jackson Marine Corporation on 9 February 1997. [...] Her hull, constructed from ordinary strength steel, has an overall length of 42.9 m, a molded breadth of 6.8 m, and a moulded depth of 6.8 m. [...] The boat has a total of 21 tanks: 12 for fuel oil, 5 for ballast water, 5 for lubricating oil, 7 apiece for fresh- and waste-water, a hydraulic oil tank, a <b>slop</b> <b>tank,</b> and an anchor chain locker. The tug can carry up to 6 cubic meters of fuel, has a gross tonnage of 852 GT and a net tonnage of 205 NT.|$|E
5000|$|The ship {{is powered}} by a Wärtsilä 5RT-flex 50DF engine which can be powered by any of three types of fuel; heavy fuel oil, marine diesel oil or {{liquefied}} natural gas, marking Damia Desgagnés as the first Canadian-registered vessel to use this type of engine. The engine is rated at [...] and drives one controllable pitch propeller, a bow thruster, and a stern thruster. The ship is also equipped with three auxiliary generators and one emergency generator. The ship has a maximum speed of 14 kn. The ship's hull is of double hull design. The vessel has a capacity of [...] and has twelve cargo <b>tanks</b> and two <b>slop</b> <b>tanks</b> and four cargo manifolds that produce a discharge rate of [...] per hour.|$|R
50|$|On 2 July 2006, the Probo Koala {{called at}} Amsterdam port in the Netherlands to {{discharge}} the slops {{contained in the}} vessel's dedicated <b>slops</b> <b>tanks.</b> During the transfer such a foul smell was released onto the city that the disposal company Amsterdam Port Services B.V. (APS) decided to consult {{with the city of}} Amsterdam. After half the waste was transferred APS increased the handling fee 30-fold. APS then informed the ship's master that authorities had given permission for the slops previously removed to be returned to the vessel. The Probo Koala departed Amsterdam on 5 July 2006 for Paldiski, Estonia, with the full knowledge and approval of the Dutch authorities. After taking on unleaded gasoline in Paldiski it left on 13 July 2006 on a previously-planned voyage to Lagos, Nigeria. In Lagos it unloaded the gasoline. Two offers to unload the slops in Lagos were refused by the captain and on 17 August 2006 the vessel sailed for Abidjan.|$|R
50|$|Crude oil washing (COW) is {{washing out}} the residue from the tanks {{of an oil}} tanker using the crude oil cargo itself, after the cargo tanks have been emptied. Crude oil is pumped back and {{preheated}} in the <b>slop</b> <b>tanks,</b> then sprayed back via high pressure nozzles in the cargo tanks onto {{the walls of the}} tank. Due to the sticky nature of the crude oil, the oil clings to the tank walls, and such oil adds to the cargo 'remaining on board' (the ROB). By COWing the tanks, the amount of ROB is significantly reduced, and with the current high cost of oil, the financial savings are significant, both for the Charterer and the Shipowner. If the cargo ROB is deemed as 'liquid and pumpable' then the charterers can claim from the owner for any cargo loss for normally between 0.3% up to 0.5%. It replaced the load on top and seawater washing systems, both of which involved discharging oil-contaminated water into the sea. MARPOL 73/78 made this mandatory equipment for oil tankers of 20,000 tons or greater deadweight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In {{petroleum}} refining and wastewater treatment process, petrochemical enterprises produce {{a large amount}} of oily sludge which mainly comes from the oil separator, flotation pool, biological activated sludge, the tank of crude oil dehydration, oil tank and <b>slop</b> <b>tank</b> etc. Therefore oily sludge can be divided into sludge from oil tank, scum mud and landing mud. The sludge composition is so complex because of containing hydrocarbons, benzene, phenol, anthracene and other substances with the odor and toxicity. It’s generally made up of the oil in water, water in oil and suspended solids. And it has features of full emulsification, larger viscosity and solid hardly completely settling. With the continuous expansion of the scale of production equipment, these enterprises face also more environmental pressure when they make economic benefits. The resource utilization and harmlessness of solid waste is the important content for the construction of saving society. According to the new regulations and standards, it is difficult to meet the requirements for many enterprises in disposal of oily sludge, which results in increased enterprise pollution burden and highlighted environmental pollution problems. In this paper, the research status and development of oil sludge biological treatment technology were reviewed including bioreactor method, bioaugmentation method, biological land tillage method, biological flotation method and so on. All these methods were compared and commented before the future research suggestion were presented. Keywords:- Biodegradation, Oily sludge, Lab experiment, Oil removal rate, Harmless, soil I...|$|E
40|$|Oily {{wastewater}} generated, in {{amounts of}} millions of tons per year, by ships mainly in engine-rooms (bilge waters) and by washing oil <b>tanks</b> (<b>slops)</b> create a major disposal problem throughout the world because of the persistence and accumulation of xenobiotic compounds in the environment. The high salinity levels (up to 25. 000 p. p. m.) and the pollutants concentration limit the chances of discharge into the sewer systems and address the disposal of these waste(water) s to the sea. Tightening effluent regulations and consequent high energy and management costs has generated interest in the introduction of biological phases {{in the treatment of}} these wastewater. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using biological processes with purposely acclimated microorganism for the treatment of high salinity oily wastewaters (slops). Specifically both the bio-regeneration of the exhaust Granular Activated Carbons (GAC), loaded with a mixture of compounds occurring in slops, and a BioFilm Membrane BioReactor (BF-MBR) application were examined. Results proved the feasibility of using salt-adapted micro-organisms capable of degrading the main pollutants contained in slops. 1...|$|R

This situation severely lowers the discharge limits {{for most of the}} “sensible” parameters, such both COD and hydrocarbons. Slops are usually treated by ASP with pretreatment of oil/water separation. There are limited investigations on the treatment of these wastewaters using MBR technology. However tightening effluent regulations has generated interest in the treatment of wastewater of petrochemical origin with the advanced MBR process. The objective of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of treating slops to meet the applicable discharge limits consistently using BF-MBR technology. With this aim in mind, a BF-MBR pilot plant has been realized, characterized by an hybrid MBBR compartment followed by a membrane unit. The obtained results showed good removal performances, although the biofilm compartment seemed not to give a crucial contribution to the performances...|$|R
