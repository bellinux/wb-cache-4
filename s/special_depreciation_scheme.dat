40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of {{investment}} allowances outlined below would be preferable to the present system of <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers. (3) Furthermore, it appears that low-income farmers are not always aware of the existence of <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances. (4) Their effectiveness is even further reduced by this ignorance. The article is in four sections. Section 1 contains a description of <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances and of the proposed scheme of investment allowances. In the remaining sections the impact of both schemes on investment is analysed for different situations, and the relative merits of the two schemes are assessed. Agricultural Finance,...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to {{elaborate}} a model relating Tobbin's q corrected for taxes to the rate of capital accumulation in order to evaluate the impact of fiscal incentives on corporate investment expenditure in Switzerland. The estimation of the model on the basis of post-war data reveals that taxation has so far played only a minor role in the investment process in Switzerland. Moreover, the simulation of the model under various hypotheses of fiscal reform shows that while the traditional instruments, namely the manipulation of corporate tax rates and fiscal <b>depreciation</b> <b>schemes</b> tend to have a relatively small impact, the use of the investment tax credit, not yet implemented in Switzerland, can be a rather efficient means of influencing business investment. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} and compare several generic depreciation methods {{to assess the}} effectiveness of possible policy measures {{with respect to the}} depreciation schedules for investments in combined heat and power plants in the United States. We assess the different depreciation methods for CHP projects of various sizes (ranging from 1 MW to 100 MW). We evaluate the impact of different depreciation schedules on the tax shield, and the resulting tax savings to potential investors. We show that a shorter depreciation cycle could have a substantial impact on the cost of producing power, making cogeneration more attractive. The savings amount to approximately 6 - 7 % of capital and fixed operation and maintenance costs, when changing from the current system to a 7 year <b>depreciation</b> <b>scheme</b> with switchover from declining balance to straight line depreciation...|$|R
40|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) {{have the potential}} to reduce green house gas emissions from the transport sector. However, the limited electric range of PEVs could impede their market introduction. Still some potential users are willing to pay more for PEVs. The combined effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are unclear. Here, we study the market evolution of PEVs in Germany until 2020. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of PEVs due to external conditions and the users’ willingness to pay. We find the future share of PEVs in German passenger car stock to range from 0. 4 % to almost 3 % by 2020. Energy prices have a large impact on PEV market evolution as a 25 % increase in fuel prices would double the number of PEVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1000 Euro as the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. The high uncertainty of the market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of PEVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{cultural}} differences in risky choices between Australian and German students. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to challenge the wide-spread view that investment in residential property in East Germany after unification has turned out to be a financial disaster in most cases by calculating (1) the after-tax return an investor in real property might have expected at the beginning of the 1990 s and (2) the after-tax return that has been realized ten years after. We compare investments by a high-income investor resident in Germany in an average individually-owned flat in three major cities in East Germany and two cities in West Germany. The result of our study is that tax subsidies have protected investors from loosing money in a real estate investment. Therefore, it was indeed the taxpayers not the investors who have borne the cost of reconstructing East Germany. But taxpayers have spent a lot more on subsidising the much bigger West German housing market where property prices and tax subsidies per average investment were much higher. real-estate investment, after-tax return on investment, tax subsidies, Assisted Area Law (Fördergebietsgesetz), empirical study, income tax reduction, loss offset, <b>special</b> <b>depreciation,</b> return on equity capital (ROE), property prices...|$|R
40|$|In Egypt, {{electric}} energy coming from fossil fuels represents around 85 % of total electricity requirements. However, {{the supply of}} energy in the Arab world is expected to run dry in the coming 30 - 50 years. With the increase in energy needs, rise in fossil fuel prices, and the swelling of green house gas emissions, the use of renewable and more environment-friendly energy sources to supply power is gaining increased attention. Being a country on the Sunbelt, Egypt has great potential in utilizing solar energy to generate energy products and electricity. However, solar energy is still abandoned in Egypt due to its high costs. This paper first aims to examine the relative significance of several accounting and economic related variables to reduce solar energy costs. To be more specific, the paper seeks to examine the effect of using accounting and finance-based factors, related to <b>depreciation</b> <b>schemes</b> and financing options, to decrease solar energy costs. These factors are considered as a substitute for direct subsidies which are difficult to implement because of the narrow financial scope of the Egyptian government. The results of the study provide a number of policy implications that can be applied to make solar energy closer to cost-competitiveness and contribute to solve the energy problem in Egypt. Solar Energy, Cost Efficiency, Government Incentives...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have the}} potential to reduce green house gas emissions from the transport sector. However, the future market evolution of EVs strongly depends on several influencing factors such as battery and oil prices as well as their future evolution. The effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are uncertain, yet policy makers need an empirical basis to take decisions impacting the future market evolution. Here, we study the market evolution of EVs in Germany until 2020 and perform a model-based assessment of influencing factors and different monetary policy measures. We use an agent-based model with a utility maximising decision function for several thousand individual private and commercial vehicle owners. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of EVs due to external conditions and the users’ willingness-to-pay for this new technology. Energy prices have a large impact on EV market evolution as a 25 % increase in fuel prices would double the number of EVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1, 000 Euro per vehicle to be the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. Furthermore, the high uncertainty of framework conditions and the EV market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of EVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions...|$|R
40|$|Half {{a century}} ago, in the Housing Act of 1949, Congress {{declared}} optimistically that every American {{should have access}} to safe, decent, affordable housing. 3 In an effort to realize that ambitious objective, federal lawmakers have devised and bureaucrats have implemented a wide array of housing schemes. One commentator has provided nine categories for what he deems the ‘bewildering variety of housing-related programs:’ 1. a federally regulated mortgage finance system; 2. mortgage insurance; 3. interest rate subsidies to home owners, developers, and landlords; 4. tax deductions for mortgage interest; 5. <b>special</b> <b>depreciation</b> allowances for rental housing; 6. low-rent public housing; 7. rent supplements for low-income households; 8. subsidy packages for central city redevelopment; and 9. anti-discrimination measures. To this list, we can add urban homesteading, Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants, housing vouchers, Housing Development Grants, and other recent variations on the affordable housing theme. While observers of federal housing initiatives may disagree strongly about the wisdom and efficacy of {{one or more of these}} varied approaches, the fact remains that the goal of decent housing for all has not yet been reached. Nor, in the light of recent revelations, investigations and admissions, can we accurately state that the federal officials responsible for overseeing and administering the means for achieving that goal have performed at acceptable levels of competence and responsibility. This article highlights two acute crises that face the nation as we seek to renew our national commitment to decent housing: the widening gap between housing costs and household income, and the recent scandal over federal housing programs that has embroiled (and threatens the future effectiveness of) the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s lead agency in this crucial area—the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD, H. U. D. or Department). The author 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is straightforward: only after appreciating the breadth of these two formidable challenges can we proceed to shape and effectively implement a federal housing agenda for the 1990 s—the goal of liberals and conservatives alike in the legislative and executive branches. It makes little sense to proceed with active implementation and full funding of an ambitious National Affordable Housing Act—particularly the new Home Investment Partnership, National Homeownership Trust Fund, and Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) initiatives—before we address and redress the shortfalls and failures of the recent past. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{regulation}} for emissions, pollution, etc., {{is becoming}} stricter, the Australian rail freight industry is still locked in to using {{large numbers of}} existing rolling stock, e. g., locomotives and wagons. Much of this rolling stock is no longer efficient. Largely {{as a result of}} infrastructure constraints, it is not feasible for operators to dispense with their old technology at regular intervals, even though they will need to pay more to use older technology if a carbon price eventuates. This thesis seeks to ascertain the viability of promoting investment incentives for newly acquired locomotives, wagons and other equipment. It analyses the impact of an accelerated <b>depreciation</b> <b>scheme</b> on the investment behaviour of above-rail operators and offers a comparison with alternative incentives or mechanisms. These schemes, if their efficacy is demonstrated, could potentially provide tools to encourage re-equipment of the aging rail fleet and facilitate the provision of sustainable rail freight growth in Australia. A three-stage sequential mixed methods approach was designed to investigate the investment implications of accelerated depreciation in the rail freight sector. In the first stage, an in-depth interview technique was employed to contextualise the rolling stock replacement decisions among rail freight firms. In the second stage, an extended asset replacement model exclusively was developed to examine whether accelerated depreciation and other tax concessions could significantly reduce the optimal time to replace rolling stock in the Australian rail freight industry. In the final stage, a focus group technique was applied to examine the findings from the first two stages and provide in-depth expert assessments of their implications. This thesis concludes that accelerated depreciation alone is unlikely to be sufficient to assure a desired level of investment in cleaner technologies. The scheme should be part of a whole suite of initiatives to stimulate investment, and should not be the primary mechanism. The main obstacle is the incompatibility between the existing below-rail infrastructure in Australia and the modernised above-rail equipments. This implies that even though accelerated depreciation successfully offers them the incentive to replace their old fleets with newly acquired rolling stock, it is impossible, for example, to run the new train on the existing track. Improving the below-rail infrastructure therefore has been identified as the only way to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the rail freight sector in terms of overall energy efficiency. Nevertheless, upgrading the infrastructure is a difficult task. To encourage greater energy efficiency within the rail freight sector in the short term, some other instantaneous initiatives should be provided. A two-pronged approach to energy efficiency in the rail freight sector has been proposed. In particular, some incentives to buy new equipment combined with a ‘cash for clunkers’ scheme with a refurbishment option to make existing assets more energy efficient are needed to deliver appropriate outcomes in the short term. Incentives aimed at buying new equipment are particularly crucial for regions where the rail networks have already been upgraded to suit modern energy-efficient equipment, whereas programs targeting the refurbishing of older assets are necessary for track that is not suitable for modern equipment, which is generally heavier than the older equipment. Apart from its implications for managerial practices within the rail freight sector and implications for policies pertaining to rail freight operation, another major highlight of this thesis is the derivation of the extended asset replacement model under taxation, inflation, and technological progress environment. The novelty of this model is its comprehensiveness. The effects of technological advancement, taxes, and inflation have been analysed by previous replacement studies. The literature, however, indicates that these three factors have not been incorporated into the replacement model simultaneously. This thesis also makes a significant contribution to the research methodology in finance. Combining a qualitative method and a quantitative approach, or in other words, using mixed methods in finance has not proved to be very popular. This thesis shows that it is justifiable in instances where the likelihood of a policy being useful to stakeholders is being assessed, and where the context of the policy and the context of the area in which it is applied are important...|$|R
