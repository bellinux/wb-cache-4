5|$|Genevieve Lhermitte {{was born}} on November 16, 1966 in Brussels to Michel Lhermitte, a {{businessman}} and student, and Marina Schoevaert, a nurse. Lhermitte had two younger sisters: Catherine in 1969, and Mireille in 1972. Though she struggled with her coursework and self-confidence during her secondary studies, Lhermitte graduated in 1991 with a diploma in French and History from the Educational Institute of <b>Social</b> <b>Promotion</b> of the French Community (IEPSCF) in Uccle. It was during the 1988-1989 year at IEPSCF that Lhermitte met her future husband, Bouchaib Moqadem, who was studying mathematics and physics but did not complete his studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory against}} the British invasions brought forth great changes in the {{politics}} of Buenos Aires. The viceroy Sobremonte was discredited by his management of the conflict, and the Cabildo increased its influence; as such, it removed the viceroy and appointed Liniers as replacement, an unprecedented action. The local criollos, who had limited chances of <b>social</b> <b>promotion</b> in the system of castas, got such a chance with the increased influence of the militias. Cornelio Saavedra, head of the biggest crioolo militia, thus became a highly influential man {{in the politics of}} Buenos Aires. He resented the weak support from the Spanish monarchy to the war effort, compared with the strong one received from the cabildos of other cities in the Americas. As a result, he was loyal to the new viceroy, of French ancestry, considering him to be less subject to the internal disputes of the House of Bourbon.|$|E

He raised the salaries of teachers by fifteen percent while the test scores of students in the city and the graduation rate rose as well.

He favors after-school programs to help students who are behind. As mayor, Bloomberg strengthened the cell-phone ban in schools.|$|E

Wilson promoted standardized testing of all students, increased teacher training, and a longer school year. However, it was Wilson's uncompromising stance on reducing education spending {{that led to}} the budget impasse of 1992, leaving state workers without paychecks from July until September, when the California Supreme Court forced the Governor and the legislature to agree to terms that ended the sixty-three-day stand-off.|$|E

Religious historians Ian and Jane Linden described him as [...] "more passionate and perhaps compassionate" [...] than Kayibanda and other Hutu ex-seminarians, but [...] "often erratic and sometimes fanatical". Unlike Kayibanda, Gitera called for forceful action against the [...] "oppression" [...] of the monarchy as early as 1957; however, his rhetoric focussed less on the Hutu-Tutsi divide than on the emancipation of the poor.|$|E

Bloomberg opposed <b>social</b> <b>promotion,</b> and favored after-school and summer-school programs to help schoolchildren catch up, rather than allowing them to advance to the next grade level where they may be unprepared. Despite often tense relations with teachers' unions, he avoided a teacher strike by concluding a contract negotiation in which teachers received an average raise of 15% in exchange for givebacks and productivity increases.

2500|$|Advancement {{based on}} achievement: There is no <b>social</b> <b>promotion</b> from one grade {{to the next}} from year to year; nor are there {{traditional}} letter grades. Rather, student work is assessed based on whether it meets the standard and students move between divisions when they assemble a portfolio of work proving that they can produce work that meets the standards of that division (typically after 1½–2½ years). Work that does not yet meet standards is assessed as [...] "incomplete", [...] "just beginning" [...] or [...] "approaching" [...] the standard and {{students are expected to}} revise their work continually to show improvement. When students have completed a portfolio of [...] "meets" [...] or [...] "exceeds" [...] work, they complete a [...] "gateway" [...] presentation highlighting their learning and showing they are ready to move forward.|$|E

Two small landowners, who were careful, practising Catholics, willingly undertook to represent that strict church-goer Camille Burt; while the profligate but apparently powerful Count Gregory found friends in an energetic local doctor who was ready for <b>social</b> <b>promotion</b> and an accidental Californian tourist who was ready for anything. As no particular purpose could be served by delay, it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards. And when this was settled the whole community, as it were, turned over again in bed and thought no more about the matter. At least there was only one member of it who seemed to be restless, and that was she who was commonly most restful. On the next night Madeleine Durand went to church as usual; and as usual the stricken Camille was there also. What was not so usual was that when they were a bow-shot from the church Madeleine turned round and walked back to him. [...] "Sir," [...] she began, [...] "it is not wrong of me to speak to you," [...] and the very words gave him a jar of unexpected truth; for in all the novels he had ever read she would have begun: [...] "It is wrong of me to speak to you." [...] She went on with wide and serious eyes like an animal's: [...] "It is not wrong of me to speak to you, because your soul, or anybody's soul, matters so much more than what the world says about anybody. I want to talk to you about what you are going to do." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{think she}} once prized {{money for the}} ease and comfort it could bring, the showy vanities it could furnish, and the <b>social</b> <b>promotion</b> it could command; for {{we have seen that}} she was born into the world with little ways and {{instincts}} and aspirations and affectations that are duplicates of our own. I do not think her money-passion has ever diminished in ferocity, I do not think that she has ever allowed a dollar that had no friends to get by her alive, but I think her reason for wanting it has changed. I think she wants it now to increase and establish and perpetuate her power and glory with, not to add to her comforts and luxuries, not to furnish paint and fuss and feathers for vain display. I think her ambitions have soared away above the fuss-and-feather stage. She still likes the little shows and vanities--a fact which she exposed in a public utterance two or three days ago when she was not noticing--but I think she does not place a large value upon them now. She could build a mighty and far-shining brass-mounted palace if she wanted to, but she does not do it. She would have had that kind of an ambition in the early scrabbling times. She could go to England to-day and be worshiped by earls, and get a comet's attention from the million, if she cared for such things. She would have gone in the early scrabbling days for much less than an earl, and been vain of it, and glad to show off before the remains of the Scotch kin. But those things are very small to her now--next to invisible, observed through the cloud-rack from the dizzy summit where she perches in these great days. She does not want that church property for herself. It is worth but a quarter of a million--a sum she could call in from her far-spread flocks to-morrow with a lift of her hand. Not a squeeze of it, just a lift. It would come without a murmur; come gratefully, come gladly. And if her glory stood in more need of the money in Boston than it does where her flocks are propagating it, she would lift the hand, I think.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{advertising}} for gambling and specifically marketing via social media {{have increased in}} recent years, and the impact on vulnerable consumers, including moderate-risk and problem gamblers, is unknown. <b>Social</b> media <b>promotions</b> often fall outside of advertising restrictions and codes of conduct and may have an inequitable effect on susceptible gamblers. This study aimed to investigate recall of exposure to, and reported impact on gamblers of, gambling promotions and marketing content on social media, {{with a focus on}} vulnerable users currently experiencing gambling problems. Gamblers who use social media (N = 964) completed an online survey assessing their exposure to and engagement with gambling operators on social media, their problem gambling severity, and the impact of <b>social</b> media <b>promotions</b> on their gambling. Gamblers at moderate risk and problem gamblers {{were significantly more likely to}} report having been exposed to <b>social</b> media gambling <b>promotions</b> and indicated actively engaging with gambling operators via these platforms. They were more likely to self-report that they had increased gambling as a result of these promotions, and over one third reported that the promotions had increased their problems. This research suggests that gamblers at moderate risk or those experiencing gambling problems are more likely to be impacted by <b>social</b> media <b>promotions,</b> and these may play a role in exacerbating disordered gambling. Future research should verify these self-reported results with behavioral data. However, the potential influence of advertisements via these new platforms should be considered by clinicians and policymakers, given their potential role in the formation of this behavioral addiction. © 2016 American Psychological Association.
