We select a sample of 18 SA observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis. Their seismic properties and surface rotation are well constrained from previous studies. About 53 hours of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained to derive fundamental parameters and A(Li). These values were combined and confronted with <b>seismic</b> <b>masses,</b> radii and ages, as well as surface rotation periods. We identify a total of 6 binary systems. A well-defined relation between A(Li) and rotation was obtained. With models constrained by the characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we identify a sequence of three SA with similar mass (~ 1. 1 Mo) and stellar ages ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of ~ 7 % for the mass uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We present A(Li) for a consistent spectroscopic survey of SA with a mass of 1. 00 +/- 0. 15 Mo, and characterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on Kepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and P_rot supports the gyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun. The consensus between measured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated onto the Sun's chemical properties suggests that these targets share the same internal physics.

The proof mass, used as the seismic detection components for gyroscopes, is levitated by the presented micro-coil actuator so that the concerns that mechanical fatigue, asymmetry and misalignments, which are inevitably present in the traditional mechanical springs design, can be ruled out. In addition, the limited range of dual-axis motion of the proof mass is completely relaxed and therefore the resolution and sensitivity of the gyroscope can be greatly upgraded. That is, the proof mass can be much at higher frequencies and the stroke of the sense-mode motion can be more enlarged, {{in comparison with the}} conventional design (i. e., mechanical springs). In addition, self-sensing technique is employed to replace the gap sensors which provide the feedback signal for position regulation of the proof mass, for the sake of cost-down for mass production.

Aims: We explore the relation between surface rotation, A(Li), and age {{in a sample of}} seismic solar-analogue stars, and we study their possible binary nature. Methods: We selected a sample of 18 solar-analogue stars observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis. Their seismic properties and surface rotation rates are well constrained from previous studies. About 53 h of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained to derive fundamental parameters from spectroscopy and A(Li).

Results: Based on radial velocities, we identify and confirm a total of six binary star systems. For each star, a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 ≲ S/N ≲ 210 was typically achieved in the final spectrum around the lithium line. We report fundamental parameters and A(Li). Using the surface rotation period derived from Kepler photometry, we obtained a well-defined relation between A(Li) and rotation. The seismic radius translates the surface rotation period into surface velocity. With models constrained by the characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we identify a sequence of three solar analogues with similar mass (1. 1 M⊙) and stellar ages ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of 7 % for the mass uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We found a scatter in ages inferred from the global seismic parameters that is too large when compared with A(Li).
