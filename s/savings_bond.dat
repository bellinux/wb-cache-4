40|$|<b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> {{have always}} served {{multiple}} objectives: funding the U. S. government, democratizing national financing, and enabling families to save. Increasingly, the authors write, that last goal has been ignored. A series of efficiency measures introduced in 2003 make these bonds less attractive and less accessible to savers. Public policy {{should go in}} the opposite direction: U. S. <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> should be reinvigorated to help low- and moderate-income (LMI) families build assets. More and more, those families’ saving needs are ignored by private-sector asset managers and marketers. With a few relatively modest changes, Tufano and Schneider explain, the <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> program can be reinvented to help those families save, while still increasing {{the efficiency of the}} program as a debt management device. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> provide market-rate returns, with no transaction costs, and are a useful commitment savings device. The authors’ proposed changes include (a) allowing federal taxpayers to purchase bonds with tax refunds; (b) enabling LMI families to redeem their bonds before 12 months; (c) leveraging private-sector organizations to market savings bonds; and (d) contemplating a role for <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> in the life cycles of LMI families...|$|R

After purchase, the holder must wait at least twelve months before cashing it in, {{when they will}} receive the capital plus some interest. The {{maturity}} periods can vary. For example, {{if you buy a}} bond with a value of $50 for $25, you'll have to wait at least 17 years to get back your investment from the government, depending on the interest rate. The longer you wait, the greater interest you earn, however <b>savings</b> <b>bonds</b> have a 30-year maximum of interest accrual. After that the bond no longer accrues interest. <b>Savings</b> <b>bonds</b> are protected because they are secured by the U.S. government.
