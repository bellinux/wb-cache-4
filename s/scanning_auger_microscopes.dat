50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{electron}} microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>microscopes</b> (SAM) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images. SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The intensity map is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, sputtering is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition. Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the Auger process makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs. Theoretically, Auger spectra can also be utilized to distinguish between protonation states. When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this. In general, as a molecule becomes more protonated, the ionization potentials increase and the kinetic energy of the emitted outer shell electrons decreases.|$|E

40|$|Highly focused {{electron}} beams {{have been}} scanned across chemical edges of different surface structures in a <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>microscope</b> with a field emission gun. For {{the case of}} a fracture plane across a multilayer structure with 100 nm Ta and 100 nm Si layers, a resolution of 35 nm for the Ta signal was found. In contrast to these flat samples, analytical problems in semiconductor technology require analysis of submicrometre features with high aspect ratios. Under these conditions, the <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> microscopy (SAM) resolution is drastically affected by electron scattering. To study these effects, we used x-ray mask structures consisting of 0, 6 mym high Au on Si (100) fabricated by x-ray lithography. We scanned over a heterogeneous step of this kind with the three different electron beam energies 10, 20 and 30 keV and measured the lateral intensity distribution of the Si signal. This signal does not stop at the edge but extends into the gold plane over a distance that increases with be am energy as expected. When analysing small features, this effect leads to a misinterpretation of the Auger spectra. This problem becomes more severe as the feature size is reduced. This has been demonstrated for gold bars of different widths and different sized columns. To minimize the contribution of nearby regions to the spectrum, the lowest beam voltage is recommended, which is sufficient to achieve the required beam diameter...|$|R

30|$|The samples {{consist of}} Ge stripes (width ~ 3 ÷ 5 μm) {{obtained}} by a photolithographic patterning of pure Ge thin films (thickness ~ 50 nm), grown on a Si(100) substrate by Low Energy Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (LEPECVD) [10]. The sample surface {{close to the}} stripe region has been patterned with a squared two-dimensional array of circular pits (diameter ~ 150 nm, depth ~ 25 nm, period ~ 1 μm) with an overall width of about 10 μm from the stripe edge, obtained by means of Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) and reactive Ion Etching (RIE). Removal of native silicon oxide and germanium oxide has been obtained by using a diluted HF solution at 10 % for 30 s at room temperature. Surface contaminations have been removed by in situ low-temperature outgassing (T ≤ 500 °C) and a mild Ar+ ion sputtering. A PHI 660 <b>Scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>Microscope</b> (SAM) {{has been used for}} in situ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and spatially resolved chemical characterization at the sample surface before and after thermal diffusion. The stripes act as Ge sources directly placed on the sample surface, and self-assembled SiGe islands spontaneously originate along a continuous diffusion profile after annealing at high temperatures in UHV. The samples have been annealed by direct Joule heating running a DC current through the Si substrate. The temperature stabilization takes less than 30 s, and the temperature spatial distribution is highly uniform in the investigated area. The base pressure during the annealing time was always better than 1 × 10 − 9 torr. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for ex situ analysis of the nucleated islands has been performed using a Veeco Innova microscope operated in tapping mode with ultra-sharp tips (nominal tip radius about 2 nm). Statistical analysis of AFM data has been performed using freely available software tools [11].|$|R
40|$|Anodic {{oxidation}} of p-type Si in methanol {{was compared}} to that in glycol with emphasis {{on the influence of}} water and different anions on the growth characteristics. Voltage-time plots were registered uring constant-current anodization of the p-Si electrode. Ellipsometric measurements were performed in situ and in air on the anodically formed oxides. Concen-tration profiles of foreign elements in the oxide films were obtained by sputtering with Ar in a <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> <b>microscope.</b> Impedance measurements were made on MOS structures fabricated with the films as the oxide. The results show that the growth characteristics as well as the nature of the films depend strongly on the solvent. Anodic oxidation of p-Si by holes leading to SiO 2 layer formation has been found to occur successfully in organic solvents such as N-methyl-acetamide (N 1 VIA), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), and ethylene gly-col (EG) containing an inorganic salt that was in most cases KNOs (1 - 3). A small percentage of water, often added to the solutions mentioned, {{does not seem to be}} essential for oxide growth. Indeed, it has been shown that most of the oxygen for oxidation of Si in NMA and glycol stems from "water " originating from a de-composition reaction of these solvents at the anode; the rest of the oxygen in SiO 2 stems then from the NO~-Although part of the oxygen in SiO 2 (~ 20 %) has been found to originate from NO 3 -, the amount of nitrogen incorporated in SiO 2 was less than 2 nitrogen atoms per 1000 oxygen atoms (4). In view of the possible role of the solvent as a donor of oxygen, it looked interesting to investigate the anodic behavior of p-Si in methanol, a solvent anal-ogous to water but which is not expected to give off oxygen easily. Hence, in this work, a comparative study has been made on the influence of different anions and of the water content on the growth charac-teristics of SiO 2 in methanol and in glycol...|$|R

40|$|Rh {{nanoparticles}} {{supported on}} ZrO 2 powder were prepared by adsorbing Rh- 4 (CO) (12) clusters from hexane solution under Ar atmosphere. Four samples with Rh content ranging from 0. 25 Rh wt. % up to 4. 10 Rh wt. % were studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD), {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> microscopy (SAM), and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-STMS). TEM measurements show, for all the samples, Rh particles with a size of about 50 Angstrom. The 4. 10 Rh wt. % sample also shows some agglomerates of Rh nanoparticles and only for this sample Rh metallic phase was detected by XRD. The profile analysis of the XRD lines indicates an average size of the Rh crystallites of about 60 Angstrom. XPS studies show only a single spectral component for the Zr 3 d(5 / 2) core line at 182. 2 eV. Instead, at least, two components at 307. 2 eV and 308. 5 eV are detected for the Rh 3 d(5 / 2) core Line. These results suggest that Zr is present only as oxidized state, whereas nonoxidized and oxidized Rh are both observed. A nonoxidized Rh state is also suggested by the XPS valence band electron removal spectrum which exhibits a significant emission within the ZrO 2 band gap assigned to Rh 4 d bands. A further support to this finding arises from <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> maps of O-KVV and RhM 45 N 23 V where nonoxidized Rh is observed. Finally <b>scanning</b> <b>Auger</b> maps using the OKVV and the ZrM 45 N 23 V emissions show surface regions where only the Zr Auger lines are detected, whereas on pure ZrO 2 powder this effect is not observed.
