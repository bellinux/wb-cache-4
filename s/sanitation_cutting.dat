5000|$|In {{forestry}} and silviculture, a sanitation harvest or <b>sanitation</b> <b>cutting</b> is {{a harvest}} of trees {{for the purpose}} of removing insects or diseases from a stand of trees. [...] Sanitation harvesting is used to prevent the diseases or pests from spreading to other nearby trees. [...] It is a form of intermediate management and is used in order to improve an already existing stand of trees.|$|E

30|$|While {{suggesting}} {{to shorten the}} rotation length in production forests, we point at the effects of present management regulations on the age structure which is highly unbalanced. Shortening the rotation length, for instance by skipping the current no-cut period, would help to avoid clear cuttings, and to limit the illegal flow of timber coming from uncontrolled <b>sanitation</b> <b>cuttings.</b> In Germany the open canopy cover of old stands allows for natural regeneration before harvest rather than of plantations after felling of dense old stands. Thus, with proper management, the clear felling could be abandoned even in Norway spruce stands (Thueringen 2015). An increased productivity would also mean that more forest could be put under protection by land-sharing without affecting the country-level wood supply.|$|R

40|$|Mountain {{pine beetle}} populations {{developed}} to epidmic level on the Bozeman-Gallatin Ranger District in 1969. Approximately 146, 000 acres are currently infested. Since 1969, over 350 MMBF have been killed. It is predicted that over 4 million trees could {{be killed in}} 1978. Infestation is predicted to intensify in high-hazard stands. Populations have declined in areas where infestation first developed in 1969. Potential losses can be reduced through an accelerated program of (1) <b>sanitation</b> salvage <b>cutting</b> and (2) silvicultural management. High hazard stands should receive first priority...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{pine beetle}} populations {{increased}} to epidemic levels on the Kootenai National Forest in 1972. Nearly 397, 000 trees containing almost 32 million board feet have been killed. More than 84, 000 trees {{will probably be}} killed in 1978. Infestation {{has the potential to}} intensify in high hazard stands, and some increase may occur in stands of low and moderate hazard. Potential losses can be reduced through an accelerated program of (1) <b>sanitation</b> salvage <b>cutting</b> and (2) silvicultural management. High-hazard stands should receive first priority...|$|R
40|$|Cassava can be {{propagated}} by {{true seeds}} and vegetative material. Obtaining true seeds {{is difficult and}} resulting plants have longer life cycles, rendering lower tuber production. Thus cuttings are preferred. Recommendations on the optimal length of cuttings vary greatly. Factors involved in using cuttings are plant age, planting <b>sanitation,</b> length of <b>cuttings,</b> planting distance, cutting viability and orientation of cuttings when planted. (CIAT...|$|R
5000|$|... the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department is [...] "an {{estimated}} $5 {{billion in}} debt and {{has been the subject}} of privatization talks ... it says half of its 323,000 accounts are delinquent and has begun turning off the taps of those who do not pay bills that total above $150 or that are 60 days late. Since March, up to 3,000 account holders have had their water cut off every week."Activists have criticized these actions, saying [...] "Detroit is trying to push through a private takeover of its water system at the expense of basic rights." [...] The Blue Planet Project has filed a [...] "submission to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and <b>sanitation</b> regarding <b>cutting</b> off water to Detroit residents.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{sanitization}} {{and storage}} on fresh-cut beetroots (Beta vulgaris L.) were evaluated following sanitation – peeling - cutting (SPC), peeling – <b>sanitation</b> – <b>cutting</b> (PSC) and peeling – <b>cutting</b> – <b>sanitation</b> (PCS) methods with (Cl), or without (TW), 100 ppm chlorine solution, then packaged in polyethylene bag and stored at 5 °C {{for up to}} 14 days. Chroma values of fresh-cut beetroots significantly declined whereas whiteness index and titratable acidity values increased, however, texture and total soluble solid contents showed no significant variation. Betalain contents decreased gradually and total phenol content showed inconsistence trend. PCS-Cl treated samples accounted for higher betalains decline and received lower visual quality scores despite its lower total aerobic bacterial count. Minimum microbial population was observed in PSC-Cl methods along {{with higher levels of}} betalain contents. Considering pigment retention, microbial and visual qualities, beetroots sanitized with chlorine water following PSC method was the best processing way for fresh-cut beetroots and therefore, PSC-Cl treatment could commercially be used for processing of fresh-cut beetroots...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Control {{strategies}}== [...] Control {{strategies for}} cassava mosaic disease include sanitation and plant resistance. In this case, <b>sanitation</b> means using <b>cuttings</b> from healthy plants {{to start with}} a healthy plot and maintaining that healthy plot by identifying unhealthy plants and immediately removing them. This strategy does not protect them from being inoculated by whiteflies, but research shows that the virus is more aggressive in plants infected from contaminated cuttings than by insect vectors. There are also specific varieties that fare better against some viruses than others, so plant resistance is possible. For example, hybrids that are a result of crossing cassava and other species, such as Manihot melanobasis and M. glaziovii, have been shown to have considerable resistance to CMV.|$|R
