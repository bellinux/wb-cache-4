40|$|Drying is an {{important}} process {{for a variety of}} industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and chemicals, and produce products with low bulk density, good shelf stability, economical storage and transport, and in some cases unique structural qualities. Of the various drying methods available, freeze-drying is the most beneficial for heat sensitive products that susceptible to thermal degradation. Freezedrying also confers a porous structure on the material result from the voids left after subliming the ice crystals. Freeze-drying however is used mainly for high value products due to the high capital and operational costs. The cycle time of such a drier may take several hours. The spray-freeze-drying process has evolved in an attempt to shorten the freezedrying process time. The process atomises a liquid feed to increase the heat and mass transfer surface area. The spray is then frozen in a very cold gas or a cryogenic liquid to form solid particles, which are then freeze-dried. Some processes incorporate a - fluidised bed freeze-drier to reduce the drying time by forced convection heat and mass transfer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying produces an inhalable solid dispersion powder in which Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is stabilised. Solutions of THC and inulin in a mixture of tertiary butanol (TBA) and water were <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> dried. Drug loads varied from 4 to 30 wt. %. Various powder characteristics of the materials were determined. Stability of THC was determined and compared with freeze dried material. The powders, dispersed with an inhaler based on air classifier technology, were subjected to laser diffraction analysis and cascade impactor analysis. Highly porous particles having large specific surface areas (about go m(2) /g) were produced. At high drug loads, THC was more effectively stabilised by <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying than by freeze drying. Higher cooling rates during <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying result in improved incorporation. Fine particle fractions of up to 50 % were generated indicating suitability for inhalation. It was concluded that <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying from a water-TBA mixture is a suitable process to include lipophilic drugs (THC) in inulin glass matrices. High cooling rates during the freezing process result in effective stabilisation of THC. The powders can be dispersed into aerosols with a particle size appropriate for inhalation.

40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} {{have spent}} more money on nanotechnology between 1997 and 2005 than on the Apollo project. The spending trend is still going upwards. Drying is an indispensable operation in the fabrication of nanosized materials. Hence, {{it is no surprise}} to rind a large number of papers published in the past decade on drying and nano-related materials. This article reviews the literature and highlights the opportunities and challenges of freeze drying in nanotechnology. Freeze drying has found application in the production of nanoparticles for electrochemical, environmental, engineered materials, and pharmaceutical industries. The retention of the homogenous properties typically found in a solution, the small size of particles produced, and the long shelf life obtained for pharmaceutical applications are the primary reasons for choosing freeze drying. The relatively cheap operation cost compared to supercritical fluid extraction is another reason. Freezing was found to be a very important step in obtaining desired particle size and properties. Primary drying of solvent sublimation should be carried out at a temperature below the collapse temperature. Cryoprotectants are frequently necessary in preserving the original properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients. <b>Spray</b> <b>freezing</b> into liquid was found to be an optimal operation in order to minimize the air-liquid interfacial loss of bioactivity.

A series of highly porous mannitol, lysozyme, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) particles were produced, varying only the solute concentration in the liquid feed, cs, from 1 to 5 wt%. The particle sizes of mannitol, BSA, and lysozyme powders were independent of solute concentration, and depend only on the drop size produced by atomization. Both mannitol and lysozyme formulations showed a linear relationship between the computed Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and the square root of cs, which is proportional to the particle density, ρ, given a constant particle size dg. The FPF decreased with increasing cs from 57. 0 % to 16. 6 % for mannitol and 44. 5 % to 17. 2 % for lysozyme.

40|$|Author: House Ear Institute ### Preparative Techniques for the TEM For routine {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM), it is generally accepted that specimens should be thin, dry and contain molecules which diffract electrons. Biological specimens, which are large and consist of large amounts of water, also do not defract electrons and are therefore difficult {{to see in the}} TEM. Preparing biological specimens for the TEM, whilst retaining the structural morphology of the material, is a challenge. However, researchers have been looking at biological material for many years, and many protocols exist which allow us to look at biological material in many different ways. Below is a brief outline of some of the more common ways of looking at biological samples in the TEM. ### Whole mounts Small or very thin objects can be examined directly by mounting them onto a support film and introducing them directly into the electron beam. Contrast is provided by heavy metal precipitation in one of three ways. 1. Positive staining: The object is chemically stained with a solution of the metal salt and appears dark on a bright background. - Negative staining: The object remains unstained but is embedded in a dried film of the heavy metal salt. The specimen appears light on a dark background. This method of visualization has been used extensively in the study of virus particles but is also useful for cell fractions (e. g. coated vesicles). More details can be found [here]([URL] - Shadowing: A thin layer of heavy metal atoms is deposited on the specimen by evaporation in a vacuum chamber. Shadowing from one direction only produces a pseudo-three-dimensional image. Rotary shadowing, where the specimen is uniformly coated with heavy metal, is used to visualize nucleic acids and proteins. ### Ultrathin sectioning The most popular technique for examining biological materials is to embed the material under study in plastic and cut ultrathin sections that can be examined in a TEM. The material is stabilized by chemical fixation (usually with aldehydes such as formaldehyde or gluteraldehyde), contrasted with solutions of heavy metal salts (osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate), dehydrated in ethanol or acetone, and embedded in plastic (epoxy resin). Ultrathin sections (60 nm) cut with glass or diamond knives using an ultramicrotome are floated on water, transferred to specimen support grids and examined in the TEM. Often the sections are further contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination in the microscope. In some cases, macromolecules can be specifically labelled prior to embedding and sectioning. For example, the location of some enzymes can be visualized by incubating the tissue with a substrate whose reaction with the enzyme leads to the local deposition of electron opaque material. Alternately, antibodies can be coupled to such enzymes, and the electron opaque reaction product is used to localize the antigens recognized by the antibodies. Some embedding resins (e. g. Lowicryl resins and LR White resin) have been designed to enable antibodies and electron opaque markers (such as colloidal gold particles) to be applied to the ultrathin sections. In this way, subcellular antigens recognized by the antibodies can be localized with the TEM. Another sectioning technique that is increasing in popularity is [cryosectioning]([URL] (the sectioning of vitrified, frozen material). After chemical fixation, the tissue is immersed in cryo-protectant (usually sucrose) and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cryo-protectant allows the biological material to be frozen without the formation of ice crystals, which would damage ultrastructure. This type of freezing, or vitrification, is possible in the absence of cryo-protectants but is technically demanding. Sections cut from the vitrified block can be thawed and incubated with antibodies specific to subcellular antigens. Electron opaque markers allow the antibodies to be seen in the TEM. [Colloidal gold]([URL] coupled to protein A (a protein from bacterial cell walls which binds to the Fc portion of some immunoglobulins) has been used extensively in recent years to localize antibodies on resin and [frozen sections]([URL] of biological materials. The ability to produce homogeneous populations of colloidal gold with different particle sizes has enabled researchers to use these probes to colocalize different structures on the same section. ### Cryofixation It is possible to freeze biological material fast enough to vitrify the water present inside the cells. Vitrification of water occurs when the freezing has occurred so fast that ice crystals have no time to form. Vitrified biological material can be sectioned at low temperatures. Thin films of vitrified water and sections of vitrified material can be examined in transmission electron microscopes that are equipped with specimen stages that can be kept cold. ### Rapid Freezing Methods There are seven main rapid freezing methods presently available. They are: 1. immersion freezing - the specimen is plunged into the cryogen. - slam (or metal mirror) freezing - the specimen is impacted onto a polished metal surface cooled with liquid nitrogen or helium. - cold block freezing - two cold, polished metal blocks attached to the jaws of a pair of pliers squeeze-freeze the specimen. - <b>spray</b> <b>freezing</b> - a fine spray of sample in liquid suspension is shot into the cryogen (usually liquid propane). - jet freezing - a jet of liquid cryogen is sprayed onto the specimen. - [high pressure freezing]([URL] - freezing the specimen at high pressure to subcool the water. - excision freezing - a cold needle is plunged into the specimen, simultaneously freezing and dissecting the sample. ### Freeze-fracture followed by freeze etch and replication If, for some reason, the object to be studied cannot be examined in the TEM, then a thin replica can be made. This is usually made by evaporating a thin layer of a heavy metal (usually platinum) onto the specimen and then coating this with a thin layer of carbon. The object and the replica are separated either by floating off the replica or by digesting away the object. There are four basic steps to follow 1. The specimen is frozen (often without regard to [vitrification]([URL] - The specimen is fractured, while still frozen, under vacuum. - The fractured specimen can then be etched by leaving it frozen and under vacuum. Depending on the time of exposure, more or less water sublimes from the specimen (freeze drying). - A replica of the fractured surface is made which is then examined in the electron microscope. A recent modification of this method employs rapid freezing achieved by slamming cells against a copper block cooled to - 269 °C with liquid helium. If these frozen cells are then exposed to extensive freeze drying (deep etching), very impressive images of the internal structures of cells are uncovered...|$|E

40|$|We {{formulated}} cetrorelix acetate, as an adhesive mixture {{for use in}} {{dry powder}} inhalation. To achieve the highest possible deposition efficiency we investigated both the influence of different micronization techniques and different inhalers. The Novolizer with an air classifier as the powder de-agglomeration principle and the ISF inhaler were used for in vitro deposition experiments (cascade impaction). Micronization by milling as the classical approach and micronization by spray drying and <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying as advanced particle engineering techniques were investigated to determine whether advanced techniques are necessary to obtain high fine particle fractions (FPF) for this specific drug. It {{was found that the}} effects obtained with a certain micronization technique depended on the complex interaction of the physical characteristics of the drug substance with the type of formulation chosen, {{as well as with the}} de-agglomeration principle used. The combination of particle engineering by spray drying and the use of the air classifier technology resulted in a fine particle fraction of 66 %, while <b>spray</b> <b>freeze</b> drying yielded extremely fragile particles resulting in a FPF of only 25 %. The behaviour of the milled material showed similar trends as the spray dried material but FPF values were lower. It was concluded that when a drug is to be formulated as a powder for inhalation with high fine particle fractions, it is profitable to use advanced particle engineering techniques, however the applied technique should be tuned with the characteristics of the formulation type and process as well as with device development.
