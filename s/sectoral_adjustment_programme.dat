This paper considers normative fiscal policy implications of <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs in a two-sector model with overlapping generations. Fiscal deficits benefit present generations by depleting foreign assets and slowing down the adjustment process. We show that despite no nominal rigidities, temporary fiscal deficits increase social welfare if adjustment costs prevent immediate sectoral reallocation of inputs. If there are no adjustment costs, the case for fiscal deficits vanishes. fiscal policy, <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment,</b> intergenerational welfare...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{empirical}} evidence on the growth rates of maize production in three sub - periods in Nigeria namely pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period, Structural <b>Adjustment</b> Program period and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period. Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period (1970 to 1985), Structural Adjustment period (1986 to 1994) and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme,</b> Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> and post - Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> periods respectively. The higher compound growth rate of maize production in the Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> period implies that the policy reforms in the period was more effective in ensuring increased growth of maize production over that of other periods in Nigeria. Therefore, despite the myriads of {{problems associated with the}} programme in Nigeria, it was beneficial to maize production in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we compare welfare effects {{and the extent}} of <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the member {{countries}} under alternative free trade agreement (FTA) sequencings in the Asia-Pacific region using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. If a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement under one sequencing and an East Asian FTA (EAFTA) under another sequencing will enter into force at the same time, followed by more enlarged FTAs, then a larger number of countries are expected to realize greater welfare gains under the Asia-track sequencing. However, given the uncertainty about the establishment of an Asia-wide FTA in the near future, the TPP-track sequencing appears to be an attractive option for most countries in the Asia-Pacific region. With respect to <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustments,</b> there seem to be no significant differences among the alternative sequencings considered in this study...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 The first essay, {{entitled}} "Sectoral Adjustment Costs and Real Exchange Rate Dynamics in a Two-Sector Dependent Economy," investigates {{dynamics of}} real exchange rates in a two-sector model with both capital accumulation and capital reallocation. Instead of choosing {{one of the}} extreme assumptions regarding production structure (gradual capital accumulation with instantaneous reallocation versus no reallocation), we allow the movement of capital across sectors but with costs. By appropriately parameterizing this cost, {{we find that the}} standard Heckscher-Ohlin and the sector-specific capital models emerge as two polar cases. We also get persistence of the deviation of the real exchange rate, with the persistence, and possible overshooting, of the real exchange rate increasing with the magnitude of the intersectoral adjustment costs, consistent with the evidence. The second essay, entitled "Sectoral Adjustment Costs and The Rate of Convergence in a Two-Sector Endogenous Growth Model" investigates the speed of convergence in a Lucas type two-sector model with <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. In two-sector endogenous growth models of Lucas vintage all variables converge to their respective long-run equilibrium at the same constant rate. By introducing <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs we obtain stable dynamic adjustment paths as two-dimensional manifolds. So, convergence speeds vary over time and among variables. Also, the time path of the rate of convergence depends {{on the size of the}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. As different countries have different <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, the cross-country variations in convergence profile can be addressed using this framework. The third essay, entitled "How Big Is the Border Effect in Developing Countries? A Case Study of Bangladesh and India" investigates the nature and extent of the failure of the Law of One Price in developing countries. Disaggregated price data from two developing countries, Bangladesh and India, are used to test the proposition that the variation of the prices in equidistant cities located in two countries is systematically larger than that for the cities in the same country. For Bangladesh and India, the extent of failure of LOP in the short-run is found to be very significant...|$|R

In this paper we compare welfare effects and the extent of <b>sectoral</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the member countries under two alternative FTA sequencings in the Asia-Pacific region, Asian-track and Trans-Pacific-track sequencings, using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Under the assumption that both an East Asian FTA (EAFTA) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement will enter into force in 2013, followed by more enlarged FTAs, most member countries are expected to realize larger welfare gains under the Asian track.

40|$|Following {{a severe}} balance of {{payments}} crisis in mid- 1990, in July 1991 the Government of India embarked on a far-reaching stabilisation and structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme.</b> To support this effort, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank subsequently provided financial assistance under a Stand-by arrangement of the former, and Structural <b>Adjustment</b> and <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Facilities of the latter. The Indian adjustment rested on policies to restrain the growth of domestic demand and on structural reforms to augment supply through an improved allocation of resources. The reforms, aimed at opening up the economy and promoting its reliance on market forces. These structural reforms were supported by mutually reinforcing macroeconomic stabilisation efforts comprising restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. The structural reforms consisted primarily of the following: broad-based price liberalisation, including market determination of exchange and interest rates; trade liberalisation; liberalisation of the exchange and payments systems; financial sector reform; streamlining of non-financial public enterprises; and comprehensive tax reforms. Thus, besides moving toward external and domestic stability, India has been undergoing a market-oriented transformation. The objective of this dissertation is to analyse {{the impact of this}} stabilisation and structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme</b> of the early 1990 s. The reform programme has been successful in quickly stabilising prices and restoring external sector balance. However, in line with the experiences of conventional adjustment policies, a significant tradeoff could be observed in terms of decline in output growth and volume of investment. In part, this decline is the consequence of stabilisation measures. The decline in output growth was subsequently arrested successfully. Simultaneously, considerable {{progress has been made in}} initiating structural reform measures, most notably trade, foreign investment, and industrial policy reforms, although it will take some time before these reforms are fully implemented. However, the impact of these structural changes has yet to be realised. The eventual growth of investment and real output is predicated on completing structural reforms, such as the development of financial markets and the safeguarding of their stability, streamlining of public sector enterprises, minimising government interference with economic forces, and the imposition of a realistic budget constraint...|$|R

This is made worse by drastic declines in production in key sectors and increasing rates of unemployment and overall poverty.

The aftermath of these programmes is so profound that almost every aspect of life is affected.
