50|$|The Atlantic saury (<b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus)</b> is a fish of {{the family}} Scomberesocidae found in the Atlantic Ocean, in the seas near Australia, {{and also in the}} Mediterranean. The fish grow to about 35 cm in length, with a maximum of 50 cm, and have beaklike jaws and a row of finlets behind their dorsal and anal fins. Atlantic sauries live near the surface, and will often jump above the surface.|$|E

40|$|The stomach {{content of}} 113 {{individuals}} of shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus was analyzed. Individuals were sampled at landing in Vigo (Spain) and captured by sea-surface long-liners {{in the vicinity}} of the Azores Archipelago and between Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, in March and October 2012, and March 2013. Teleosts constituted the dominant item, mainly Atlantic saury <b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus</b> (87 % of teleost prey). Among them, 94 % were deprived of both head and the caudal fin, while the flesh and bones of the body were preserved. The presence of eye’s lenses, the number of which was consistent with the number of fish remains, likely rules out the elimination of the heads before ingestion. There is no obvious explanation for this unexpected and unrecorded pattern of digestion...|$|E
40|$|Species composition, {{size range}} and some {{behavioral}} notes about drifting flotsam associated fish of the Balearic Islands are presented, and more detailed observations on Seriola dumerili, Naucrates ductor, Coryphaena hippurus and <b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus</b> are also given. 25 fish species belonging to 18 families were identified, 12 {{of these species}} and the individuals of the family Mugilidae were recorded {{for the first time}} associated with floating objects in the western Mediterranean. Most of the specimens collected were juveniles, which suggests the importance of floating objects as a nursery, and thus in the recruitment and redistribution of fishes. Analisis of two drift floating material samples show that objects of anthropogenic origin were most abundant (83. 5 % and 63. 5 %) and suggests that at present, human refuse may have taken over the role of the floating remains of marine plants for fishes in the western Mediterranean pelagic environment...|$|E
40|$|The coastal fringe off {{northern}} Chile (18 º- 23 ºS) is {{inhabited by}} numerous neritic fish species of which 249 are commonly observed during normal and cold La Niña (LN) conditions. During El Niño (EN) the ichthyofauna of northern Chile changes significantly due to about 100 invading fish species normally inhabiting lower latitudes, named “septentrional invaders” and “tropic-equatorial fishes”. This {{results in a}} composition including 15 fish families and 86 genera. Analyses showed that species affected by EN were not the same between the last three EN events revealing that only the epipelagic species Anchoa naso, Albula vulpes, Atherinella nocturna and <b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus</b> stolatus behaved consistently. Off northern Chile, EN 1982 / 83, 1986 / 87, 1991 / 92, 1997 / 98, 2002 / 2003 and the not clearly EN defined 2004 / 2005 period with their aligned thermal abnormalities of each particular event were {{directly related to the}} number of invading/affected species.

40|$|The diet of Cory’s shearwater Calonectris diomedea in the Azores was {{studied in}} four {{islands of the}} {{archipelago}} over four breeding seasons, using stomach flushings from 959 birds. Fish were identified from flesh, otoliths and vertebrae and cephalopods from flesh and lower beaks. The frequency of occurrence of prey taxa, and the numerical frequency of fish and cephalopods, showed marked variations both spatially, across the breeding cycle and between years. Overall, cephalopods from 37 species representing 17 families and fish from 33 species representing 18 families were identified, representing over 70 prey species and trebling what was previously known. Histioteuthidae, Ommastrephidae and Cranchiidae were the only cephalopod families present every year and represented {{two thirds of the}} cephalopods’ consumption by number. Blue jack mackerel Trachurus picturatus was the most abundant prey species present in 1998 and 2002 but was absent in 1999 and 2000, representing on average 57. 2 % of prey by number in the years it occurred. Apart from blue jack mackerel, most fish species were present in very low numbers with the exception of Cubiceps gracilis, <b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus</b> and Maurolicus muellerii. Diaphus adenomus, was recorded for the first time for the Azores archipelago...|$|E
40|$|Almost half of Ireland’s {{commercial}} stocks face overexploitation. As traditional species decrease in abundance and become less profitable, {{the industry is}} increasingly turning to alternate species. Atlantic saury (<b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus</b> saurus (Walbaum)) {{has been identified as}} a potential species for exploitation. Very little information is available on its biology or population dynamics, especially for Irish waters. This thesis aims to obtain sound scientific data, which will help to ensure that a future Atlantic saury fishery can be sustainably managed. The research has produced valuable data, some of which contradicts previous studies. Growth of Atlantic saury measured using otolith microstructure is found to be more than twice that previously calculated from annual structures on scales and otoliths. This results in a significant reduction of the expected life span from five to about two years. Investigation of maturity stage at age indicates that Atlantic saury will reproduce {{for the first time at}} age one and will survive for one or at most two reproduction seasons. It is concluded that a future Irish fishery will target mostly fish prior to their first reproduction. Finally the thesis gives some insights into the population structure of Atlantic saury, by analysis of otolith morphometric. Significant differences are detected between Northeastern Atlantic and western Mediterranean Sea specimens of the 0 + age class (less than one year old). The implications of these results for the management of an emerging fishery are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} different quality fish species and reductions in their abundance {{in the growth of}} Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) chicks in the Azores. An energetic balance model was developed, which accounts for the energy available from ingested fishes and the energy expenditure by the chicks. Fish species ingested by Roseate Tern chicks were mainly Trachurus picturatus, <b>Scomberesox</b> <b>saurus,</b> Macroramphosus scolopax and Capros aper. Energy expenditure was defined by the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which depends on chick's weight, plus a multiple of BMR, obtained by calibration and accounting for unspecified energetic losses. Real data obtained in June-July of 1996 and 1995 were used to calibrate and validate the model, respectively. Regressions between observed and predicted data showed a higher fitting level for 1996 than for 1995, which seems to be related with the need for more accurate estimations of assimilation efficiency and energy expenditure parameters. Of the four main prey species, T. picturatus was the most energetically favourable because of its high length-weight regression and to the capacity of chicks to swallow T. picturatus with an average length of 8. 71 Â cm. C. aper had a higher length-weight relationship, but chicks were only able to ingest items < 5 Â cm because this species is wider than T. picturatus. S. saurus and M. scolopax were energetically less efficient because they had a lower length-weight relationship. Observations suggest that the availability of less energetic fish (e. g. M. scolopax) leads to higher delivery rates by the parents and, consequently, to higher ingestion rates by the chicks. However, both observations and predictions suggest that the growth efficiency is lower than when the chicks were fed with T. picturatus with an average length of 8. 71 Â cm. Additionally, the model predicts that chicks with 23 days of age will attain 85 and 56 Â g, according to a 25 % reduction in prey within a year of energetically more and less favourable prey, respectively. Chicks in the first situation are still likely to fledge, while in the second case, chick survival is certainly compromised. In summary, the growth of Roseate Tern chicks in the Azores will be significantly reduced in response to a decrease in energy intake resulting from provisioning of low quality fish species and chick survival is compromised whenever this factor is associated with a significant (25 %) reduction in fish stocks. This model proved to be a highly dynamic tool in assessing variations in postnatal growth of Roseate Terns in response to variations in food quality and quantity and it should be of interest in the conservation strategy of this species.
