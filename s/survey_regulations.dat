It provides a variety of rights, depending on the traditions at the country but the legalistic cadastre system and land law are still using 2 D geometric in legal and law expression for land and property tenure and have not been prepared to register in 3 D situation. For example, as we notice that National Land Code 1965, Strata Title Act 1985, <b>Survey</b> <b>Regulation</b> 1976, Sale and Purchase Agreement, Property Valuation Report as well as Cadastral Map which as a binding and legal document do not give enough volume and height information for strata and stratum objects.

40|$|Abstract Background Administration of {{a single}} {{physiological}} dose of 17 beta-estradiol (E 2 : 40 microg/kg) to the ovariectomized immature rat rapidly induces uterine growth and remodeling. The response is characterized by changes in endometrial stromal architecture during an inflammatory-like response that likely involves activated matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). While estrogen is known as an inducer of endometrial growth, its role in specific expression of MMP family members in vivo is poorly characterized. E 2 -induced changes in MMP- 2, - 3, - 7, and - 9 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed to <b>survey</b> <b>regulation</b> along an extended time course 0 - 72 hours post-treatment. Because E 2 effects inflammatory-like changes that may alter MMP expression, we assessed changes in tissue levels of TNF-alpha and MCP- 1, and we utilized dexamethasone (600 microg/kg) {{to better understand the}} role of inflammation on matrix remodeling. Methods Ovariectomized 21 day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered E 2 and uterine tissues were extracted and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mRNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR, protein extraction and Western blot, or gelatin zymography. In inhibitor studies, pretreatment compounds were administered prior to E 2 and tissues were harvested at 4 hours post-hormone challenge. Results Using a novel TEM method to quantitatively assess changes in stromal collagen density, we show that E 2 -induced matrix remodeling is rapid in onset (Conclusion The data demonstrate that E 2 -regulated endometrial remodeling is rapid in onset (< 1 hour) and peak expression of MMPs and inflammatory mediators correlates temporally with the period of lowest stromal collagen density during uterine tissue hypertrophy. </p...|$|R

40|$|As the {{dependency}} on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in surveying {{has been growing}} over the years, the need for legal traceability of GNSS measurements has become a significant matter. In Malaysia, {{with the advent of}} the Malaysia Real-time Kinematic Network (MyRTKnet), GNSS surveying has revolutionised land survey and mapping. Correspondingly, the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) amended and published standard regulations and guidelines concerning cadastral survey, i. e., Cadastral <b>Survey</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2009, to include GNSS measurements. However, these regulations and guidelines has not comprehensively incorporated legal traceability of GNSS measurements; which is a prerequisite for cadastral surveys as it requires reliable and conclusive evidence for issues such as boundary disputes.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of coastal erosion on coastal boundaries and to determine the rights, obligations and limitations attached to that land with respect to both the private land owner and the general public. The effects of coastal erosion along urbanised foreshores has seen the loss of land to private property by title {{as well as physical}} loss of land to the ocean, while public land is disappearing as erosion forces its natural coastal boundaries landward towards private fixed-line boundaries. As Australia continues to urbanise along its coastline, the value of coastal land near large cities in Australia is continually increasing, further highlighting the importance of resolving issues that surround coastal property boundaries. These issues have been demonstrated through a literature review. The collection and critical review of current legislation, case law, <b>survey</b> <b>regulations</b> as well as investigation into examples of coastal remedial works (both successful and unsuccessful) was then applied to a primary research study, located at Collaroy- Narrabeen Beach, within the local government area of Warringah, NSW. A detail survey was conducted of the foreshore and adjoining properties along the described length of Collaroy-Narrabeen Beach, as well as boundary survey to define the cadastral boundaries between the beach reserve and private properties that it adjoins. This study revealed significant deficiencies that continue to see the loss of land along the foreshore, affecting both private land owners and public beach users. This study has proven that there are serious and concerning issues surrounding coastal erosion, and its effect on coastal property boundaries. As Australia’s stunning and iconic coastline continues to urbanise, the importance of collective and responsibly considered actions which successfully manage the delicate balance between protecting privately owned land and public interests from coastal erosion in New South Wales has never been more significant. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. The Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Namibia is {{responsible}} for all land issues. The resettlement of landless farmers, of the previous disadvantaged groups, {{is one of the}} issues. The Agricultural (Commercial) Land Reform Act (Act 6 of 1995) applies to the commercial land parts of the country. Under this act the government of Namibia has the first option on the purchase of commercial farms when these are offered for sale. These purchased farms will then be used to resettle the landless farmers from the communal areas. These applicants may obtain a long-term lease over the purchased commercial farms. Long-term leases are legally required to be registered in the Deeds Office. A cadastral lease diagram is required for registration. The government, through the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, has bought approximately 130 farms for resettlement purposes. On June 2003 approximately 13 of these resettlement farms were surveyed and cadastral lease diagrams prepared for registration in the Deeds Office. The author argues that many factors have affected the slow progress of the resettlement in Namibia including the time required for the preparation of the cadastral lease diagram. The current field survey techniques, Total Stations or/and GPS, are very reliable, but are slow. The use of digital orthophotos has been shown to shorten the time to prepare the cadastral lease diagrams. The Author further argues that because digital orthophotos are available at the Surveyor-General's Office means, there are no cost implications. The cost of the cadastral lease diagrams by using digital orthophotos is only a third of the cost of using the current field survey techniques. Replacing current survey techniques with digital orthophotos or including the use of digital orthophotos, as a surveying technique would require the revision of the Land Survey Act (Act 33 of 1993) and the <b>Survey</b> <b>Regulations,</b> under section 5 of the said Land Survey Act - Government Notice No. 58 of 2002...|$|E
40|$|Digital camera {{systems are}} a key {{component}} {{in the production of}} reliable, geometrically accurate, high-resolution geospatial products. These systems have replaced film imaging in photogrammetric data capturing. Today, we see a proliferation of imaging sensors collecting photographs in different ground resolutions, spectral bands, swath sizes, radiometric characteristics, accuracies and carried on different mobile platforms. In addition, these imaging sensors are combined with navigational tools (such as GPS and IMU), active sensors such as laser scanning and powerful processing tools to obtain high quality geospatial products. The quality (accuracy, completeness, consistency, etc.) of these geospatial products is based on the use of calibrated, high-quality digital camera systems. The new <b>survey</b> <b>regulations</b> of the state of Israel specify the quality requirements for each geospatial product including: maps at different scales and for different purposes, elevation models, orthophotographs, three-dimensional models at different levels of details (LOD) and more. In addition, the regulations require that digital camera systems used for mapping purposes should be certified using a rigorous mapping systems certification and validation process which is specified in the Director General Instructions. The Director General Instructions for digital camera systems certification specify a two-step process as follows: 1. Theoretical analysis of system components that includes: study of the accuracy of each component and an integrative error propagation evaluation, examination of the radiometric and spectral response curves for the imaging sensors, the calibration requirements, and the working procedures. 2. Empirical study of the digital mapping system that examines a typical project (product scale, flight height, number and configuration of ground control points and process). The study examine all the aspects of the final product including; its accuracy, the product pixels size on the ground (spatial resolution), its completeness (missing pixels and striping affect), its radiometric properties (e. g., relative edge response) and its spectral characteristics (e. g., histogram spread, bands misalignment). This methodology was tested on a number of medium to large format digital cameras. The certification process is a basic stage in the mapping chain in Israel.
