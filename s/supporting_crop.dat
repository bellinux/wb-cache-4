40|$|Due to {{inadequate}} feed {{supplies for}} livestock production, farmers throughout the tropics and sub-tropics are being encouraged to supplement low quality basal diets with leguminous forage and concentrates. The varying quality (e. g. nitrogen, lignin and polyphenol content) of these diets will influence feed digestibility, partitioning of nutrients to ruminant tissues and partitioning of nitrogen between urine and faeces. Many reviews {{have been conducted}} on the nutritive value of legume species for livestock production (e. g. Lowry et al, 1996) and the classification of the polyphenols they contain (e. g.

In this farm model, pepper (Piper nigrum) is integrated with livestocks (cows) and the crops of cattle feed grown as a hedge crop or as intercrop in alley cropping. The increase of global demand for pepper along with the price gives a great oppotunity to the development of this integrated model to revive farmers’s motivation in the Province of Bangka Belitung to manage their crops in a eco-friendly manner, which is in turn can also increase the region's economy.

40|$|Despite its {{vital role}} in <b>supporting</b> <b>crop</b> production, a key {{question}} that has often been posed is whether sufficient amounts of manure are available to permit adequate food production and improvement of soil quality on a long-term basis. While this question can be addressed at a regional, national, village or household level, this paper examines it at the household, village, and national level using data from Niger. Its aim is to assess the adequacy of available manure for food crop production, and to determine the role that manure and other soil amendments can play in the future intensification of agricultural production in SAWA. A three-step approach was adopted for this study. First, the amount of manure required to replace nutrients taken up from croplands at various yield levels was estimated. Second, the number of animals (and the feed resources) needed to produce this level of manure was estimated and compared {{with the level of}} livestock holdings found in village and national studies. Third, the gap in manure supply was calculated and the amount of inorganic fertilizer needed to meet the manure shortfall was determined...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the linkages between livestock and crop farming activities {{and provides a}} comparative analysis of the profitability of different livestock activities in the highlands of Ankara. The data was collected from 52 sample farms in the Nallıhan, Aya¸s, Güdül and Beypazarı districts of Ankara {{by way of a}} questionnaire, where the farms have, on average, 20. 7 ha of land and are thus regarded as small family farms. Insufficient irrigated land and working capital, weak market relations and the pressure of high population brings about a requirement to strengthen crop-livestock interaction. Production on the farms is generally carried out in extensive conditions, with goat, sheep and cattle husbandry in addition to crop production. Crop production makes up for 20. 8 % of the total gross production value on the farms. Of this figure, the entire yields of wheat, barley, pulses, straw and fodder crops are used for own consumption by the households, along with 74 % of the wheat and 77 % of the barley produced. The research results indicate that the current management systems may be defined as mixed farms in terms of crop–livestock linkages. The average total income of the households surveyed is 9, 412. 0 USD, of which 63. 4 % comes from farming activities. Every 1 USD invested in animal husbandry provides an income of 1. 12 USD from dairy cattle breeding, 1. 13 USD from Angora goat breeding, 1. 16 USD from sheep breeding and 1. 27 USD from ordinary goat breeding. It has been found that ordinary goat breeding, which provides the greatest relative profitability for the farms, offers many advantages, and that the transition from Angora goat breeding to ordinary goat breeding through the breeding of ordinary male goats into the Angora herd has occurred in recent years. The results of the survey indicate that <b>supporting</b> <b>crop</b> production with animal husbandry is considered a requirement in order to maintain economic and social sustainability in the farms and to support rural development...|$|E

40|$|Seed vetches (Vicia sativa L.) are {{currently}} grown mainly in catch crop mixtures. They {{are characterized by}} a high biomass production with a good rooting intensity and good weed suppressing effect. However, common vetches can be cultivated as a grain legume, {{but in this case}} only as an intercrop together with a <b>supporting</b> <b>crop.</b> The seeds of common vetch have a high protein content and a good amino acid composition, {{so that it can be}} used as a high protein, on-farm produced feedstuff. Mechanical weed control is difficult in common vetch cultivation. So the weed suppressing effect of different vetch-oat-mixtures was investigated. Field trials were conducted at the Thünen-Institute of Organic Farming with the vetch cultivars Berninova, Ina, Jaga, Toplesa and Slovena in pure stands and in intercrops with oat in the years 2011 and 2012. The intercrops were sown in three different seed density ratios (75 % vetch with 25 % oat, 50 % vetch with 50 % oat, 25 % vetch with 75 % oat of the respective sole seed density). During the growing season weed biomass was harvested, once at the time of flowering of common vetch and another sample was taken at the time of harvest. The evaluation of the two-year results showed interactions between the tested cultivars and the seed density ratios as well as between cultivars and the sampling time. Weed biomass showed in the different mixtures within a cultivar in most cases comparable graduations. The highest weed biomass, with the exception of the cultivar Slovena, was determined in pure stands, the lowest one in the mixture with a share of 75 % oat. In pure stands, Toplesa showed due to their less leafy and upright growth type as well as a lower field emergence, the significantly highest weed biomass, followed by the cultivar Ina. The cultivar related differences decreased with increasing amounts of oat in the seed mixture, so that no significant differences were evident in the mixtures with 50 % and 75 % oat...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} make {{agriculture}} more sustainable {{it is important to}} enhance the natural processes <b>supporting</b> <b>crop</b> production, including pollination and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, {{there was no evidence that}} yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c. 12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50 % of the total area could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0. 4 tonnes ha- 1 were identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem services...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of fallowing the Vertisols in Madhya Pradesh, Central India {{during the rainy}} season (kharif) and growing crops on residual soil moisture thereafter (postrainy season or rabi) has been in vogue for several years. After the successful introduction of soybean in the state, which accounts for 87 % of the area and 83 % production of the crop in the whole country, it was assumed that rainy season fallow has declined. To delineate rainy season fallows in the state, data obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite were analyzed. A deductive approach including delineation of agricultural land and forests from temporal satellite data was employed to identify kharif fallow. Three sets of satellite data corresponding to three periods, namely mid-kharif, late kharif, and rabi season were used. While mid-kharif season satellite data provides the information on agricultural lands, which were lying unutilized along with those agricultural lands that have been <b>supporting</b> <b>crops,</b> the satellite data of rabi season, on the other hand, exhibits the spatial distribution pattern of the land <b>supporting</b> rabi <b>crops.</b> These lands include the areas, which were lying fallow during kharif season, and are now <b>supporting</b> <b>crops.</b> In contrast, the satellite data acquired during late kharif season showed the agricultural lands that were lying fallow during kharif season and the areas where kharif crops were planted...|$|R

40|$|U. S. farm policy {{reforms in}} 1996 {{produced}} significant overproduction of <b>supported</b> <b>crops,</b> with prices falling to levels that were often below average farm production costs. Among {{the beneficiaries of}} the policy shift were the largest corporate purchasers of <b>supported</b> <b>crops,</b> as they saw {{a steady supply of}} low-priced inputs. Industrial livestock firms were among the most significant buyers of U. S. corn and soybeans, the main components of livestock feed. Filling an important gap in the literature, this paper estimates the savings to industrial hog operations between 1997 and 2005 from feed components priced at levels below their production costs. The savings are found to be significant. We also find that industrial hog companies benefited from weak federal regulation of environmental pollution from livestock operations. We estimate the costs to industrial hog firms of compliance with new environmental regulations regarding mitigation of surface-water contamination from excess manure concentrations. This cost is also found to be significant. We assess the implications of these findings for the continued consolidation and industrialization of the industry. We find that mid-sized diversified farms that grow their own feed may well be able to compete on cost with large-scale industrial operations if the latter pay full cost for their feed and have to pay for just one part of their externalized pollution costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Forests {{and other}} tree-based {{systems such as}} {{agroforestry}} contribute to food and nutritional security in myriad ways. Directly, trees provide a variety of healthy foods including fruits, leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds and edible oils that can diversify diets and address seasonal food and nutritional gaps. Forests are also sources of {{a wider range of}} edible plants and fungi, as well as bushmeat, fish and insects. Treebased systems also support the provision of fodder for meat and dairy animals, of “green fertiliser” to <b>support</b> <b>crop</b> production and of woodfuel, crucial in many communities for cooking food. Indirectly, forests and tree-based systems are a source of income to support communities to purchase foods and they also provide environmental services that <b>support</b> <b>crop</b> production. There are, however, complexities in quantifying the relative benefits and costs of tree-based systems in food provision. These complexities mean that the roles of tree-based systems are often not well understood. A greater understanding focuses on systematic methods for characterising effects across different landscapes and on key indicators, such as dietary diversity measures. This chapter provides a number of case studies to highlight the relevance of forests and tree-based systems for food security and nutrition, and indicates where {{there is a need to}} further quantify the roles of these systems, allowing proper integration of their contribution into national and international developmental policies.

40|$|International audienceAs the Anthropocene advances, {{understanding}} the complex web of interactions between species {{has become a}} central theme in the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and agricultural systems. Plant-flower visitor networks yield insights into how natural vegetation <b>supports</b> <b>crop</b> pollination. Although <b>crops</b> themselves also <b>support</b> pollinators, the importance of spillover of flower-visiting pollinators from natural vegetation into croplands is increasingly appreciated. Natural vegetation not only provides forage and nesting sites, but can also <b>support</b> <b>crop</b> flower visitors when the crop is not flowering. We evaluated indirect effects between mango (the dominant tropical fruit crop globally) and wild plant species in neighbouring vegetation, and the factors determining these indirect effects, by constructing flower visitor networks. We constructed these networks for transects that included mango fields and neighbouring natural vegetation in northeastern South Africa. Surveys were conducted before, during and after mango flowering, to allow evaluation {{of the importance of}} pollinator <b>support</b> when the <b>crop</b> was not in flower. Network analysis showed that potential indirect effects of other plant species on mango increased with flower abundance of those species, although this increase was less marked for species growing in natural vegetation. The cumulative (total, i. e. indirect effects summed) effect of natural vegetation on mango flower visitation was greater both during mango flowering and when it was not flowering. This is likely because of the greater plant diversity in natural systems, and because the combination of these species provided flowers over a protracted period. These positive indirect effects among plants flowering over extended periods of time have to date rarely been considered in crop pollination studies. Given the rapid expansion of high-intensity, high-yield monoculture plantings, such effects warrant further investigation...|$|R
