50|$|The {{condition}} was first described by researchers from Boston, Massachusetts and Bethesda, Maryland (including Dr Frederic Bartter) in two patients with lung cancer. Criteria {{were developed by}} Schwartz and Bartter in 1967 and have remained essentially unchanged since then. The condition is occasionally referred to by {{the names of the}} authors of the first report - <b>Schwartz-Bartter</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Schwartz-Bartter</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (synonyms: {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} secretion of antidiuretic hormone syndrome of inappropriate secretion of vasopressin, anti-diabetes insipidus) - {{this is a}} rare disease characterized by excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary, or other source, resulting in developing hyponatremia and water intoxication. Hyponatremia dilutions at <b>Schwartz-Bartter</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is usually non-specific symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting and confusion. Marked reduction in blood sodium levels may lead to seizures or even coma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Primary {{laryngeal}} {{small cell}} neuroendocrine carci-noma (SCNC) {{is an unusual}} malignancy accounting for < 0. 5 % of laryngeal carcinomas. To date, approximately 200 cases of primary and 5 of secondary SCNC of the larynx have been reported. This tumor most often presents in the sixth and seventh decades in men who are heavy cigarette smokers. The lesion {{may be associated with}} different paraneoplastic syndromes (ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome, <b>Schwartz–Bartter</b> <b>syndrome</b> or syndrome of inappropriate secre-tion of antidiuretic hormone, and Eaton–Lambert myasthenic syndrome) or with ectopic hormone production. The diagnosis is based essentially on the histologic appearance of the tumor, confirmed by immunocytochemical investigations. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens offer potential for long-term sur-vival. This tumor is biologically aggressive, and the extent of the disease is the most significant independent prognostic factor of survival. The survival rate is similar to that with pulmonar...|$|E

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} for [8 -arginine]-vasopressin (AVP), {{previously described}} (Czernichow et al. 1975) {{has been used}} for the determination of antidiuretic hormone in a 4 ml urine sample. AVP is extracted from acidified urine with a cation exchanger (Amberlite CG 50) with an overall recovery of 72 %. The blank value measured in extracted samples of urine was 0. 29 pg/ml +/- 0. 21 (SEM) and calculated by extrapolation of the regression line of the recovery experiment was 0. 49 pg/ml. The coefficient of variation within-assay was 13 % and between-assay 18 %. Addition of the amounts of AVP found in each specimen of urine voided gave results nearly identical to those of the amounts found in 24 h pool of urine, indicating that the assay was not affected by changes in concentration of the other urinary components during the day. The daily urinary excretion of AVP measured in 34 subjects was found to be 34 ng in 17 women and 70 ng in 17 men, a significant difference. Urinary concentration and excretion rate of AVP rose during thirst test and during Carter-Robbins test performed in 13 healthy subjects. In the latter test it was observed that the women displayed a strikingly more pronounced AVP elevation after the osmolar stimulus than the men. In both sexes a significant correlation was found between AVP excretion rate and plasma osmolality as well as free water clearance. Three cases of complete or incomplete diabetes insipidus and potomania could be clearly differentiated according to the total output of AVP during the thirst test. Extremely high values of AVP were found in the urine of 5 subjects with <b>Schwartz-Bartter</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with bronchogenic tumours...|$|E
