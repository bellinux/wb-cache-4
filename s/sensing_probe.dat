2500|$|An {{exception}} to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally {{is seen in the}} previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade oxygen sensor with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically. [...] As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials, nanoparticle formulation and the creation of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

During science class, Lunella is attacked by robot drones until she is saved by Riri Williams. They follow the drones to a nearby alley, where Moon Girl encounters Doctor Doom. After Doom escapes, Moon Girl and Ironheart go to Moon Girl's secret lab, where they discover that the energy signatures of the drones are mystic in origin. While tracing Doom's location, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur arrive at the Sanctum Sanctorum and are found by Doctor Strange. Waking up from a dream, Lunella is reunited with Devil, who was shrunk down by Strange. While walking back home, Moon Girl and two of her classmates are attacked by Doctor Doom and his Doombots. Moon Girl uses an enlargement potion on herself to help Doctor Strange fight Doom and his robots.

Nine <b>sensing</b> <b>probes</b> of the phantom dosimeter were fabricated identically by connecting a plastic scintillating fiber (PSF) to a plastic optical fiber (POF). To measure the planar dose distribution on a chest phantom according to exposure parameters used in clinical practice, we divided {{the top of the}} chest phantom into nine equal parts virtually and then installed the nine <b>sensing</b> <b>probes</b> at each center of the nine equal parts {{on the top of the}} chest phantom as measuring points. Each scintillation signal generated in the nine <b>sensing</b> <b>probes</b> was transmitted through the POFs and then intensified by the image intensifier because the scintillation signal normally has a very low light intensity. Real-time scintillation images (RSIs) containing the intensified scintillation signals were taken by the CMOS image sensor with a single lens optical system and displayed through a software program. Under variation of the exposure parameters, we measured RSIs containing dose information using the multichannel all-in-one phantom dosimeter and compared the results with the absorbed doses obtained by using a semiconductor dosimeter (SCD). From the experimental results of this study, the light intensities of nine regions of interest (ROI) in the RSI measured by the phantom dosimeter were similar to the dose distribution obtained using the SCD. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the planar dose distribution including the entrance surface dose (ESD) can be easily measured by using the proposed phantom dosimeter system...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} large surveys of Affymetrix GeneChip {{data in the}} public domain to conduct a study of {{antisense}} expression across diverse conditions. We derive correlations between groups of probes which map uniquely to the same exon in the antisense direction. When there are no probes assigned to an exon in the sense direction we find that many of the antisense groups fail to detect a coherent block of transcription. We find that only a minority of these groups contain coherent blocks of antisense expression suggesting transcription. We also derive correlations between groups of probes which map uniquely to the same exon in both sense and antisense direction. In some of these cases the locations of <b>sense</b> <b>probes</b> overlap with the antisense <b>probes,</b> and the <b>sense</b> and antisense <b>probe</b> intensities are correlated with each other.

40|$|Overhead {{lines are}} the {{backbone}} of electrical power transmission. In most cases, the overhead line provides the best economic and practical solution for energy transmission. Nevertheless, overhead lines suffer more faults due to {{the vulnerability of the}} overhead lines to adverse weather condition, transient overvoltage and falling trees. An extensive literature review of existing condition monitoring and impulse a voltage measurement technique of overhead lines are covered in this work, and ultimately leads {{to the development of the}} proposed voltage transducer. Although conventional transducers such as voltage transformers and voltage dividers are widely used for monitoring and voltage measurement, yet they have several drawbacks in terms of their size and cost. These are the key factors that limit their widespread deployment for monitoring and measuring voltage on overhead lines and, in particular, rural areas. The proposed transducer is based on a non-contact capacitive voltage probe developed at Cardiff University. However, the proposed transducer uses a high voltage conductor rather than the ground as a measurement reference. The proposed transducer is based on a cylindrical-shaped in order to avoid sharp edges, which can initiate a partial discharge effect. Commercial numerical field computation software packages are used to assist in the development of the proposed transducer for simulation of the electric field distributions around the HV conductor and the transducer. The computed electric field magnitudes obtained on the <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> surface are then used for calibration of the proposed transducer. The proposed transducer is developed using low cost materials and tested in a laboratory environment with a low amplitude impulse supply using a surge generator and the corresponding output voltage amplitude obtained from the transducer was validated against a low ac voltage supply using variable output voltage source. The effects of variation in the input voltage, the integrating capacitor inserted between the HV conductor and the <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> and height of the transducer above ground on the output voltage amplitude are also investigated. The developed transducer is subsequently tested in field experiments using test overhead lines with low and high voltage supplies. Only a single-phase measurement setup was used in this test as there is only one voltage transducer fabricated in this work. Therefore, each phase of the overhead line was tested individually. Results obtained from the laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated the suitability of the developed transducer for measuring both ac and impulse voltages, which would be useful for fault monitoring on the high voltage overhead lines. However, the computed results obtained from the simulation demonstrated the presence of end-effects at the transducer <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> edges. Therefore, an improved design was proposed in this work by introducing a floating electrode between the <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> and the guard electrode, with the aim to reduce the fringing effects by preventing the <b>sensing</b> <b>probe</b> from sensing unwanted electric field. The physical development of this improved transducer design is yet to be initiated, and is thus proposed for future work...|$|E
