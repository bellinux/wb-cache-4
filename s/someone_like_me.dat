5|$|His early {{stand-up}} career led {{to supporting}} roles on television shows, {{during which he}} developed {{the character of a}} hapless middle-class bachelor. In 1993, Carey had a small role in the film Coneheads as a taxi passenger. In 1994, Carey co-starred with John Caponera in The Good Life, a short-lived sitcom on NBC. After the show was cancelled, Bruce Helford, a writer on the show, hired Carey as a consultant for the television show <b>Someone</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
5|$|After their stint on <b>Someone</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me,</b> Carey and Helford {{developed}} and produced the storyline for The Drew Carey Show. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, {{as he took}} on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E

Joss always said he was intrigued that <b>someone</b> who looked <b>like</b> <b>me</b> and talked <b>like</b> <b>me</b> was <b>like</b> the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|R

Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters.

Actress Sissy Spacek, who played Carrie in de Palma's adaptation, expressed an opinion on the choice of Lohan for the character of Carrie White, stating that she [...] "was like, 'Oh my God, she's really a beautiful girl' and so I was very flattered that they were casting <b>someone</b> to look <b>like</b> <b>me</b> instead of the real Carrie described in the book.

40|$|One {{potentially}} valuable use {{of cloning}} {{is to provide}} a source of tissues or organs for transplantation. The most important objection to this use of cloning is that a human clone would be the sort of entity that it would be seriously wrong to kill. I argue that entities of the sort that you and I essentially are do not begin to exist until around the seventh month of fetal gestation. Therefore to kill a clone prior to that would not be to kill <b>someone</b> <b>like</b> you or <b>me</b> but would be only to prevent one of us from existing. And even after one of us begins to exist, the objections to killing it remain comparatively weak until its psychological capacities reach a certain level of maturation. These claims support the permissibility of killing a clone during the early stages of its development in order to use its organs for transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Perhaps nothing strikes more fear {{into the}} hearts of all tenure-track professors than the process itself. Are four papers in this journal good enough? Are eight papers in another okay? What if <b>someone</b> doesn’t <b>like</b> <b>me</b> or my area of research? These issues have plagued academia since the first essay was penned by the first {{researcher}} hundreds of years ago. While personal bias and journal preference continue to infect honest tenure reviews, solutions exist. This does not mean we have a magic bullet to solve issues of bullying or elitism. However, if we are honest in our desire to improve the Academy, we should avail ourselves of every possible tool for improvement. This essay {{is based on a}} survey sent to 2, 500 mass communication educators. Of the almost 500 respondents, roughly 10 % took the time to express emotions that ranged from fear and confusion to outright rage and anger, all because what ought to be clear is not. The author offers 10 ideas of how academia can improve its evaluation of new faculty, as well as a few suggestions regarding the unnecessary inclusion of personal issues in a process that ought to be about creating better researchers and teachers...|$|R

Teenage sex and sexual promiscuity are other uncomfortable issues that are dealt with. It is fiction but it has also struck a raw nerve because it is telling an unpalatable truth. As a rural TD and as a parent, I believe what we are facing is a ticking time bomb in rural Ireland, where our young people feel increasingly dislocated from their community, where a lack of recreational and social outlets is fuelling the increase in drink and drug use. The last 20 years has brought unprecedented economic growth and social change across Ireland. What we must now do is face up to the social challenges.|$|E
