5|$|The Wells {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality. Nevertheless, {{it continues to}} compel critical attention, to provoke strong identification and intense emotional reactions in <b>some</b> <b>readers,</b> and to elicit {{a high level of}} personal engagement from its critics.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> {{to visit}} Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E

50|$|Two Suburban World {{papers were}} closed, however, {{prompting}} <b>some</b> <b>reader</b> backlash in Millis and Norfolk.

5|$|The {{condemnation}} {{with which}} Candaules was met meant it remained a controversial piece. When Samuel Carter Hall was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched The Art Journal, he considered {{it important to}} promote new British artists, {{even if it meant}} illustrations which <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> considered pornographic or offensive. In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the 157 paintings which Vernon had given to the nation but declined to distribute reproductions of Candaules, despite his willingness to publish reproductions of other provocative Etty nudes such as Female Bathers Surprised by a Swan.|$|E
5|$|For <b>some</b> <b>readers,</b> Arthur C. Clarke's more {{straightforward}} novelization of {{the script}} is key to interpreting the film. Clarke's novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key respects from the film, it perhaps should not {{be regarded as the}} skeleton key to unlock it.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
30|$|Assuming the {{variation}} in workload which follows such a time-related pattern is predictable, by virtualizing the Reader Tier of TerraFly we can easily save resources when the workload intensity is low by simply turning off <b>some</b> <b>Reader</b> VMs, and as the workload intensity increases, we can bring back them online to process the additional requests.|$|R
60|$|And thus, O {{circular}} philosopher, I hear <b>some</b> <b>reader</b> exclaim, {{you have}} arrived at a fine pyrrhonism,[713] at an equivalence and indifferency of all actions, and would fain teach us {{that if we are}} true, forsooth, our crimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the temple of the true God.|$|R
50|$|ORACLE also {{encouraged}} <b>some</b> <b>reader</b> {{involvement with the}} soap. Readers would sometimes be invited to vote by phone to decide on story outcomes, and {{there was at least}} one competition asking readers to suggest ideas for new characters and stories for Park Avenue. Viewers were also able to purchase printouts of episodes, with seven episodes typically costing £2.|$|R
5|$|Moonraker is {{the third}} novel by the British author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added {{the passage of the}} bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In {{the latter half of the}} novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from <b>some</b> <b>readers,</b> complaining about the lack of exotic locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed {{to defend the}} division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|E

25|$|The {{temptation of}} Christ {{is one of}} the notable {{omissions}} in the Gospel of John. However <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> have identified parallels inside John which indicate that the author of John may have been familiar with the Temptation narratives in some form.|$|E
25|$|The {{title was}} chosen {{late in the}} poem's gestation; {{it refers to the}} {{youngest}} of the three Parcae (the minor Roman deities also called The Fates), though for <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> the connection with that mythological figure is tenuous and problematic.|$|E
25|$|The 1st edition also {{featured}} 160 copperplate illustrations engraved by Bell. Three of the engravings {{in the section}} on midwifery, depicting childbirth in clinical detail, were sufficiently shocking to prompt <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> to tear those engravings out of the volume.|$|E

25|$|Giants are {{referred}} to {{only a few times}} by Tolkien, leading <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> to debate whether they existed at all or if they were simply Ents or metaphorical descriptions of the power of nature.

25|$|Vos Savant commented that, {{though some}} {{confusion}} {{was caused by}} <b>some</b> <b>readers</b> not realizing that {{they were supposed to}} assume that the host must always reveal a goat, almost all of her numerous correspondents had correctly understood the problem assumptions, and were still initially convinced that vos Savant's answer ("switch") was wrong.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>readers</b> of Herodotus {{believe that}} his habit of tying events back to {{personal}} motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action.
