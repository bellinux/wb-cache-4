5000|$|In {{evaluating}} the SiTF curve, the <b>signal</b> input <b>and</b> <b>signal</b> output are measured differentially; meaning, the differential of the input <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> differential of the output <b>signal</b> are calculated <b>and</b> plotted against each other. An operator, using computer software, defines an arbitrary area, with a given {{set of data}} points, within the <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> background regions of the output image of the infrared sensor, i.e. of the Unit Under Test (UUT), (see [...] "Half Moon" [...] image below). The average <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> background are calculated by averaging the data of each arbitrarily defined region. A second order polynomial curve is fitted to the data of each line. Then, the polynomial is subtracted from the average <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> background data to yield the new <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> background. The difference of the new <b>signal</b> <b>and</b> background data is taken to yield the net signal. Finally, the net signal is plotted versus the signal input. The signal input of the UUT is within its own spectral response. (e.g. color-correlated temperature, pixel intensity, etc.). The slope of the linear portion of this curve is then found using the method of least squares.|$|R
