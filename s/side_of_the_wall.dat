5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built on the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> leading from the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

25|$|Experts posit {{that the}} {{construction}} of the wall {{was the result of the}} work of Nguyễn Dynasty soldiers and collaboration between the Viet and the H're minority, who seldom had peaceful relations.

25|$|Raking {{courses in}} monk bond may—for instance—be {{staggered}} {{in such a}} way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.|$|E

The movie earned him a nomination for the Blue Ribbon Awards, but he declined this nomination. Nevertheless, he still got awarded the Ishihara Yujiro New Actor Award at Nikkan Sports Film Award for his role in Hana.
