40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{framework}} for analysis of harmonics in a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) caused by non-sinusoidal conditions in the rotor as well as unbalance in stator. Non-sinusoidal rotor voltages are decomposed into harmonic components and their corresponding sequences are identified. Then induced harmonics in rotor and stator are analyzed and computed, from which the torques pro-duced by these interactions between stator and rotor harmonic components can be found. During unbalanced stator conditions, symmetric component theory is applied to the stator voltage to get positive-, negative and zero- sequence components of stator and rotor currents. The steady-state negative <b>sequence</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> for a DFIG is derived based on reference frame theory. Harmonic currents in the rotor are computed based on the positive and negative <b>sequence</b> <b>circuits.</b> In both scenarios, the har-monic components of the electromagnetic torque are calculated from the interactions of the harmonic components of the stator and rotor currents. Three case studies are considered, namely, (i) non-sinusoidal rotor injection, (ii) an isolated unbalanced stator load scenario and (iii) grid-connected operation. The analysis is verified with results obtained through numerical simulations in Matlab/Simulink. The second case is verified using experiments.

It is necessary for distance relay not to mal-operate under the fault conditions, which results in loss of stability {{of the system and}} defeats the purpose of installing a STATCOM. As STATCOM type FACTS devices have faster response and their functional and control schemes introduce dynamic changes during fault conditions in a transmission line, it is important for distance relay to perform conect, irrespective of dynamics changed during the fault.

40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{this study}} was to compare total work volume, number of repeti-tions and rate of {{perceived}} effort performed in two different <b>sequences</b> of <b>circuit</b> training sessions. Eleven recreationally trained men (24. 0 ± 4. 8 years, 76. 1 ± 8. 5 kg, 1. 75 ± 0. 06 m)  performed two different <b>sequences</b> of <b>circuit</b> training sessions. All sessions consisted of eight stations (exercises) of three sets in circuit, performed to volitional fatigue, alternating upper and lower body exercises, with 1 -minute rest interval between exercises. Sequence A began with multiple joint exercises and progressed to single joint exercises, whereas sequence B was performed with the opposite exercise order. Number of repetitions and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were compared by repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (repeated measures MANOVA). Total work volume (TWV) was compared by paired t-test. There were no differences between exercise order for TWV (p= 0. 47) and RPE of all exercises (p> 0. 05). For both sequences, number of repetitions was greater when exercise was performed first (p< 0. 05). These results indicate that during a circuit training session, exercises order influenced the number of repetition, but did not influence TWV and RPE. These findings may suggest that for those who aim overall muscular gains, similar results will be obtained with single and multiple joint, upper and lower body circuit training exercise orders. Similarly, exercise intensity will be similarly perceived regardless of exercise sequences. For those who aim specific muscle group gains, priority exercises must be performed first...|$|R
