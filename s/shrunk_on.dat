2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with <b>shrunk</b> <b>on</b> aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|E

2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran {{across the top of}} the cap and {{terminated}} at front and back. It was made of [...] "D-sectioned" [...] tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted [...] "U-shaped" [...] piece into which a [...] "flat bottom strip" [...] was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or <b>shrunk</b> <b>on</b> to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered. A tracer (a [...] "rather blunt chisel [...] [...] [...] used chiefly for outlining") was used to provide a grooved border on each side. Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and surrounded by niello. Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were chased [...] "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge." [...] This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge. Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head, or adorned with silver or niello, the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded, which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been [...] "applied by the fire-gilding technique." ...|$|E
60|$|Whether or not {{the decay}} of the imprisoned animals is an any way hastened, {{it is certain that}} matter is absorbed from them by the quadrifid and bifid processes. The {{extremely}} delicate nature of the membrane of which these processes are formed, and the large surface which they expose, owing to their number crowded over the whole interior of the bladder, are circumstances all favouring the process of absorption. Many perfectly clean bladders which had never caught any prey were opened, and nothing could be distinguished with a No. 8 object-glass of Hartnack within the delicate, structureless protoplasmic lining of the arms, excepting in each a single yellowish particle or modified nucleus. Sometimes two or even three such particles were present; but in this case traces of decaying matter could generally be detected. On the other hand, in bladders containing either one large or several small decayed animals, the processes presented a widely different appearance. Six such bladders were carefully examined; one contained an elongated, coiled-up larva; another a single large entomostracan crustacean, and the others from two to five smaller ones, all [page 412] in a decayed state. In these six bladders, a large number of the quadrifid processes contained transparent, often yellowish, more or less confluent, spherical or irregularly shaped, masses of matter. Some of the processes, however, contained only fine granular matter, the particles of which were so small that they could not be defined clearly with No. 8 of Hartnack. The delicate layer of protoplasm lining their walls was in some cases a little <b>shrunk.</b> <b>On</b> three occasions the above small masses of matter were observed and sketched at short intervals of time; and they certainly changed their positions relatively {{to each other and to}} the walls of the arms. Separate masses sometimes became confluent, and then again divided. A single little mass would send out a projection, which after a time separated itself. Hence there could be no doubt that these masses consisted of protoplasm. Bearing in mind that many clean bladders were examined with equal care, and that these presented no such appearance, we may confidently believe that the protoplasm in the above cases had been generated by the absorption of nitrogenous matter from the decaying animals. In two or three other bladders, which at first appeared quite clean, on careful search a few processes were found, with their outsides clogged with a little brown matter, showing that some minute animal had been captured and had decayed, and the arms here included a very few more or less spherical and aggregated masses; the processes in other parts of the bladders being empty and transparent. On the other hand, it must be stated that in three bladders containing dead crustaceans, the processes were likewise empty. This fact may be accounted for by the animals not having been sufficiently decayed, or by time enough not having been allowed for the generation of proto- [page 413] plasm, or by its subsequent absorption and transference to other parts of the plant. It will hereafter be seen that in three or four other species of Utricularia the quadrifid processes in contact with decaying animals likewise contained aggregated masses of protoplasm.|$|E
