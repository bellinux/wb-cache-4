50|$|Surge {{relief valves}} {{are known for}} their quick speed of response, {{excellent}} flow characteristics, and durability in high pressure applications. Surge relief valves are designed to have an adjustable set point that {{is directly related to the}} max pressure of the pipeline/system. When the product on the inlet of the valve exceeds the set point it forces the valve to open and allows the excess surge to be bled out in to a breakout tank or recirculated into a different pipeline. So in the event of the surge, the majority of the pressure is absorbed in the liquid and pipe, and just that quantity of liquid which is necessary to relieve pressures of unsafe proportions is discharged to the <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> <b>tank.</b> Some valve manufactures use the piston style with a nitrogen control system and external plenums, while others use elastomeric tubes, external pilots, or internal chambers.|$|E
50|$|A highly {{accurate}} and reliable approach to controlling the nitrogen pressure on a gas-loaded <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valve {{is to use}} an electronic control system to add and vent nitrogen pressure from the gas-loaded <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valve. This technique assures the required set point accuracy and repeatability needed in this critical application.|$|R

50|$|The {{nitrogen}} {{pressure has}} traditionally been controlled using mechanical regulators. Regulators are designed to operate under flowing conditions. When used in the closed end plenum system of a <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valve, it must also perform an on/off function to correct for thermal expansion and contraction. Being a pressure control device designed for use under flowing conditions, it is not well suited to perform the on/off function needed in a closed-end system such as a <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valve plenum.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic surges {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. Hydraulic surges can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. <b>Surge</b> <b>relief</b> systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system. Methods for controlling hydraulic surges include utilizing a gas-loaded <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valve, spring-loaded pressure safety valves, pilot-operated valves, surge suppressors, and rupture disks.|$|R

40|$|The {{pressurizer}} <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> is {{a pressure}} vessel provided in typical {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) primary systems to condense and cool the discharge from the pressurizer safety and relief valves. Discharges from small relief valves located inside the containment may also be piped to the tank. Tank capacity {{is based on a}} requirement to absorb the pressurizer discharge during a specified step load decrease. The review of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank,</b> as described in the applicant's Safety Analysis Report (SAR), includes the tank, the piping connections from the tank to the pressurizer relief and safety valves, the tank spray system and associated piping, the nitrogen supply piping, and piping leaving the tank to the cover gas analyzer and to the reactor coolant drain <b>tank.</b> The pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> system is nonsafety related; the review is primarily directed toward assuring that its operation is consistent with transient analyses of related systems and that failure or malfunction of the system could not adversely affect essential systems or compo-nents in accordance with applicable criteria. The review covers the following specific areas: 1. The seismic design classification of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> and its supporting systems. I 2. The quality standards to which the tank and its supporting systems will be designed, fabricated, erected, and tested. 3. The measures taken in the design to prevent system performance degradation below acceptable levels as a result of failures of other nearby systems or {{as a result of the}} tank failure during an anticipated abnormal occurrence...|$|R
25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} {{relief valve}} still open, the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer <b>relief</b> <b>tank</b> ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|R
50|$|Surge control {{products}} {{have been used}} in many industries to protect the maximum working pressure of hydraulic system for decades. Typical applications for <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> equipment is in pipelines at pump stations, receiving manifolds at storage facilities, back pressure control, marine loading/off loading, site specific applications where pressure surges are generated by the automation system, or any location deemed critical by an engineering firm performing a surge analysis.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} approaches to controlling <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> equipment. It all starts with the technology used in the specific application. Spring-loaded pressure safety valves and pilot-operated valves are controlled mechanically using the pressure from a compressed spring. Typically there is an adjustment stem that allows for minor adjustments on the set point by compressing or decompressing the spring. This design {{is limited by the}} pressure that can be generated by the spring in the valve.|$|R
50|$|Pilot {{operated}} <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valves {{are typically}} {{used to protect}} pipelines that move low viscosity products like gasoline or diesel. This style of valve is installed downstream of the pump/valve that creates the surge. The valve is controlled by an external, normally closed pilot valve. The pilot will be set to the desired set point of the system, with a sense line that runs up stream of the valve. When the upstream process conditions start to exceed the pilot set point, the valve begins to open and relieve the excess pressure until the correct pressure is met causing the valve to close.|$|R
50|$|Surge {{suppressors}} perform <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> {{by acting}} as a pulsation dampener. Most suppressors have a metal tank with an internal elastic bladder in it. Within the tank they pressurize {{the top of the}} bladder with a compressed gas while the product comes {{in the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The gas in the bladder is supplying the system with its set point. During normal operation, as the process conditions begins to build pressure; the internal bladder contracts from the pressure gain allowing liquid to move into the surge suppressor pressure vessel adding volume to the location. This increase in physical volume prevents the pressure from rising to dangerous levels.|$|R

50|$|Piston-style gas-loaded <b>surge</b> <b>relief</b> valves {{operate on}} the {{balanced}} piston design {{and can be used}} in a variety of applications because it can handle high and low viscosity products while maintaining a fast speed of response. An inert gas, most commonly nitrogen, is loaded on the back side of the piston forcing the valve closed. The nitrogen pressure on the back side of the piston is actually what determines the valves set point. These valves will remain closed until the inlet pressure exceeds the set point/nitrogen pressure, at which time the valve will open from the high pressure and remain open as long as the process pressure is above the nitrogen pressure. Once the process pressure starts to decay, the valve will start to close. Once the process pressure is below the nitrogen pressure, the valve will go closed again.|$|R

For a recent vintage plant, the {{information related to}} the reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant system is contained in Chapter 5, “Reactor Coolant System and Connected Systems, ” of the plant’s final safety analysis report (FSAR), consistent with the Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (NUREG- 0800) (Ref. 1). For older plants, the location of applicable information is plant-specific because their FSAR may have predated NUREG- 0800. The reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant system includes the reactor vessel and internals. Also included for BWRs are the reactor coolant recirculation system and portions of other systems connected to the pressure vessel extending to the first isolation valve outside of containment or to the first anchor point. These connected systems include residual heat removal, low-pressure core spray, high-pressure core spray, low-pressure coolant injection, high-pressure coolant injection, reactor core isolation cooling, isolation condenser, reactor coolant cleanup, feedwater, and main steam.

2500|$|In June 1942, the {{division}} {{was moved to}} defend the Kholm-Zhirkovsky ridge northwest of Bely. At the beginning of July German troops began Operation Seydlitz. Under heavy pressure from German troops Kabitsin's battalion retreated to [...] Pushkar and then to Yegorye. On 5 July the German troops met at Pushkar and Kabitsin's battalion was trapped in the encirclement. On 9 July Kabitsin was slightly wounded, but was able to break out at Nesterovo and then moved to Maximova Gora. In the fall of 1942, the newly reinforced 135th Division, as part of 39th Army, fought in Operation Mars. In this battle Kabitsin was officially still commissar but served as battalion commander almost from the first day.

40|$|This article {{examines}} supply chain operations in volatile and fragile environments. Salient existing literature {{can be divided}} into two broad groups: commercial vulnerability, when uncertainties in a business environment cause demand fluctuation, and noncommercial vulnerability, when uncertainties are dramatic and are derived from an external shock such as terrorism or natural events (e. g., earthquakes). The objective {{of this article is to}} examine the operation of aid supply chains in the extreme conditions that prevailed immediately following the Rwandan civil war and during the more stable period that followed. In particular the aim is to carry out an assessment of the effectiveness of the movement of emergency aid to and within Rwanda in the post?Rwandan civil war period (1994 to 1996), with specific reference to road-based logistics and port operations in Kenya, the workings of Tanzania railways, and the role of other service providers in and around Rwanda. Internal and external barriers to distribution, which are both physical and nonphysical, are highlighted. Three surveys were carried out in 1994 / 1995, 1997 / 1998, and 2004 / 2005 covering the initial <b>relief</b> <b>surge</b> period, the rebuilding phase, and the post-crisis recovery period, respectively. It is clear that the region suffers from fragile physical logistics systems (poor road surfaces, unstable railtrack bedding, weak bridges) and volatile operating conditions (fluctuating freight rates, unpredictable transit schedules through Kenya and Tanzania), and a wide range of other uncertainties such as political instability. Nonetheless it is shown that opportunities for service development arise from the uncertain operating conditions, and these are exploited by companies willing to bear high levels of risk. Their response is typically to charge a risk premium for services, consistent with the behaviour of companies that focus mainly on nonemergency environments...|$|R
