5|$|Although {{calls for}} a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into <b>special</b> <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> in April 1882. The session agreed {{to build a new}} capitol building. Near the end of the <b>special</b> <b>session,</b> the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only two years. He declined to run again.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any <b>special</b> <b>session</b> was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into <b>special</b> <b>session</b> in late August.|$|E

5|$|Governor Evan Bayh {{called a}} <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of the General Assembly in 1992 because no budget {{had been passed}} in the regular session.

5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill.

5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off his call for a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial call for a <b>special</b> <b>session.</b> In response, Willis called a second <b>special</b> <b>session,</b> and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E

Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife at home for an extended period {{for the first time in}} years, when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of Congress in October 1881.|$|E

5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into <b>special</b> <b>session</b> in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the <b>special</b> <b>session,</b> Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of {{the state board of education}} were named as defendants in the case.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition.

Taft called a <b>special</b> <b>session</b> of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E
