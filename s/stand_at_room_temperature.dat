The free radical scavenging activity was determined by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazil (DPPH) method. The antioxidant activity (AOA) ranged from 91. 59 to 38. 42 %. The total carotenoid content (TCC) varied from 5. 10 to 27. 30 mg/ 100 g. The reducing power ranged from 9. 52 to 50. 59 %. The results show that Solanum macrocarpon and Corchorus olitorius are good sources of antioxidants with the later exhibiting higher antioxidant properties than the former.

On standing for eight days <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> milk would develop high acidity and {{it would seem that}} more than 11 parts per million should be dissolved since solutions of greater acidity dissolve nickel faster than neutral or alkaline solutions. Drinker points out that analyses of small amounts of nickel made before the development of the colorimetrie method utilizing potassium di-thio oxalate are open to question. Donauer states that sweet milk at the pasteurization temperature dissolves 0. 07 mg. of nickel per sq. cm. of surface exposed in 24 hours. A most thorough review of the literature by Drinker et al. (1), concern ing the occurrence, biologic and physiologic action, and toxicology of nickel and its various compounds, fails to shed any light upon its ability to catalyze the destruction of vitamins. The use of nickel as a catalyst in the hydrogÃ©nationof oils suggests that it might also catalyze the de struction of vitamins during the pasteurization of milk. Furthermore, the work of Hess (3) suggested, and the later work of Hess and Wein stock (4) indicated, a catalytic destruction of vitamin C in milk by copper. Since nickel is being used more extensively in industrial machinery, and especially in dairy manufacturing equipment, it seemed important to investigate the possibility of such a destruction. If only a comparatively small per cent of the vitamin content of milk or other foods were destroyed by such a catalysis, this would in the aggregate be of very great importance in human nutriton.

40|$|The {{inactivation}} of filtrable viruses by adsorption on particulate {{or colloidal}} suspensions {{has been the}} subject of a number of communications. This paper presents observations on the inactivation of poliomyelitis virus by aluminum hydroxide and on the effect of virus so treated, when used for the production of active immunity. Levadifi and Nicolau (1), in 1923, reported that they were able to render vaccine virus non-infectious by treatment with precipitated bismuth and thorium. Lewis and Andervont (2) made an extensive study of this phenomenon in 1927. They employed the viruses of vaccinia, fowl-pox, and Rous sarcoma, adsorbed on kaolin, kieselguhr, charcoal, carmine, and aluminum hydroxide. These substances were investigated for both adsorbing and inactivating power and all were found to be effective, although the degree of activity varied somewhat. No attempts to induce immunity by the use of such non-infectious material were reported. The experiments recorded in this communication were part of a series carried out in a study of various methods for the production of an immunity to experimental poliomyelitis in monkeys. Method The aluminum hydroxide preparation employed was that described by Willstutter (3) as Type C to contain 22. 5 gin. of aluminum per liter. Since this suspension is relatively unstable, only freshly prepared material was used. The virus was a Berkefeld N filtrate of fresh monkey poliomyelitic spinal cord, made to a 5 per cent suspension in physiological saline, the strain being the "pooled mixed virus " described in previous communications (4). Mixtures containing various proportions of virus and suspension were prepared and shaken in a mechanical device for 30 minutes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the hydration-over-time behaviour of ovine intervertebral discs and intact joints in a saline bath at body temperature {{and the effect}} this has on their stiffness compared to air at ambient temperature. DESIGN: The hydration-over-time behaviour and stiffness of the ovine functional spinal unit and disc were quantified. BACKGROUND: The fluid content of an intervertebral disc is not constant but varies with external load and load history. The stiffness of ovine functional spinal units in a hydrated environment and how this compares to testing in air have not been quantified. METHODS: Intervertebral discs and functional spinal units were weighed and soaked in a saline water bath at 37 degrees C and reweighed each hour for 6 h. They were then allowed to <b>stand</b> in air <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> while the time to return to initial weight was recorded. Functional spinal units {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. Axial compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial torsion tests were performed on both the intact functional spinal unit and isolated disc. Group 1 was tested in air then in a saline water bath at 37 degrees C with the testing order reversed for Group 2. RESULTS: Hydration of the disc reached a plateau after an average 3 - 4 h of soaking with the largest increase seen in the first hour. Four hours, standing in air <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> was required to return specimens to their initial weight. The functional spinal unit stiffness was significantly lower for those specimens tested in the bath compared to air. CONCLUSIONS: Ovine intervertebral discs show similar hydration-over-time behaviour when compared to human discs. Stiffnesses in different modes of loading were significantly different when tested in a hydrated environment compared with the standard method of testing in air. RELEVANCE: It has been shown that there are biomechanical and biochemical similarities between sheep and human intervertebral discs. Despite these similarities, no studies have looked at how ovine intervertebral discs behave over time in a hydrated environment. In humans, hydration levels are an important aspect of intervertebral disc degeneration. There is also a relationship between decreased hydration levels and increased stiffness. This study demonstrates the similarities between human and ovine hydration-over-time behaviour. The importance of intervertebral disc hydration and its effects on stiffness under different modes of loading were also demonstrated and have not been previously shown using the ovine model. In this context, the results from this study provide further support {{for the use of the}} ovine model. John J Costia, Trevor C Hearn, Nicola L Fazzalar...|$|R

O. D.) or a method based on the estimation of chemical oxygen demand (C. O. D.) ? In an attempt to compare and correlate the results of experiments with B. O. D. and C. O. D., the author carried out tests on both B. O. D. and C. O. D. of the organic matter contained in the samples of sea water, river water, sewage and night soil. The results are summarized as follows : (1) Both B. O. D. and C. O. D. of the samples of river water obtained at low tide were higher than those of the samples obtained at high tide. At both low and high tides, the samples of the surface water of a river showed higher B. O. D. and C. O. D. values than those of the water obtained from its bottom. It appeared that a slight shower caused B. O. D. and C. O. D. of river water to fall, a medium rainfall caused them to rise and prolonged rain lasting several days caused them to fall. (2) Like samples of river water, those of sea water showed higher B. O. D. and C. O. D. values at low tide than at high tide. (3) Tests for comparison of B. O. D. and C. O. D. of the samples of sewage and those of the 1 : 2 dilution of identical samples, both kept to <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> a <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> showed that the decrease of B. O. D. and C. O. D. and the decrease of the ratio B. O. D. / C. O. D. were more marked in the latter than in the former. (4) It was shown that the degree of dilution of any samples of raw night soil and its supernatant paralleled the fall in the values of their B. O. D. and C. O. D. the rate of fall being a little smaller than the degree of dilution. (5) Tests in which samples of supernatant of night soil and their dilutions were kept standing at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ in incubators showed that B. O. D. and C. O.

40|$|The static {{dielectric}} constant of the heavily doped silicon <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> is considered. By using phosphorus as an example, the existing expression for the static {{dielectric constant}} at low temperatures is recast {{into a form}} suitable for the application <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is done by {{taking into account the}} contribution of non-ionized impurities <b>at</b> <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> to the static dielectric constant behavior...|$|R
