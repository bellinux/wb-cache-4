5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another <b>suspect.</b> <b>They</b> obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E

The main bright spots on the defense were safeties, {{brothers}} Lyle and Glenn Blackwood, along with Pro Bowl inside linebacker A. J. Duhe, Pro Bowl nose tackle Bob Baumhower, and defensive end Doug Betters. Glenn Blackwood had picked off 6 passes during the season and returned them for 169 yards, while Betters recorded 14 sacks and a fumble recovery. Linebacker Charles Bowser was also a big contributor, recording 9 sacks and one fumble recovery.|$|E
25|$|In the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco, a {{large number}} of stone spheres, many of which are almost {{perfectly}} spherical, can be found. Their generally spherical shape led people to <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> were manmade stone balls, called petrospheres, created by an unknown culture. In 1967, Stirling examined these stone spheres in the field. As a result of this examination, he and his colleagues hypothesized that they were of geological origin. A later expedition and subsequent petrographic and other laboratory analyses of samples of the stone balls confirmed this suspicion. Their interpretation of the data collected in both field and laboratory is that these stone balls were formed by high temperature nucleation of glassy material within an ashfall tuff, as a result of tertiary volcanism.|$|E
500|$|As the world's {{worst in}} a 2004 report on {{countries}} with poor earthquake engineering, Iran is especially prone to earthquakes. In addition, poor construction practice has exacerbated death tolls; 1 in 3,000 Iranians has {{died in an}} earthquake-related incident. Roger Bilham, {{a professor at the}} University of Colorado declared that [...] "Most of Iran needs rebuilding. If the population of Iran had a choice between spending oil revenues on munitions or houses that won't kill them, I <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> would choose a safe home. It's all a matter of earthquake education." [...] The United Nations developed a Common Country Assessment for Iran, stating, [...] "While adequate building regulations exist for large cities, it is generally believed that they are not rigorously adhered to... most of those who have suffered in recent major earthquakes have lived in small towns and villages. Earthquake-proof construction is very rare in those areas and adequate building regulations are not yet in place".|$|E

500|$|Following a tip, Dunham and Scott {{are sent}} to a storage {{facility}} where they uncover a biochemical laboratory, which explodes when detonated by a <b>suspect</b> <b>they</b> are chasing. Scott {{is affected by the}} chemicals released in the explosion, and is placed into an artificial coma to slow the progression of the chemical reaction. While investigating a possible cure to Scott's condition, Dunham blackmails Peter Bishop (Jackson) to gain access to his father Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), whose top-secret work at Harvard in [...] "fringe science" [...] resulted in him being sent to a mental institution. Dunham manages to release Walter from the institution; however, he becomes enraged when he discovers his laboratory in Harvard has been shut down. Broyles reopens the laboratory, where Dunham transfers Scott's body. To identify the man from the storage facility, Walter synchronizes Dunham's brainwaves with the comatose Scott's so that she can read his mind. Walter claims that syncing brainwaves, and even reanimating the dead, can be accomplished up to six hours after death. With the help of Dunham's assistant, federal agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), the experiment succeeds. Dunham identifies the man in Scott's memory, Morgan Steig, as a passenger on the plane. The team learns Steig's twin brother, Richard Steig, was an employee of Massive Dynamic, a company founded by William Bell, Walter's old lab partner.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, Norman Hastings {{built on}} Berry's {{hypothesis}} proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 {{years after the}} Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee librarian Euan Macpherson published books and articles popularising Bury as a Ripper <b>suspect.</b> <b>They</b> highlighted that the canonical five Whitechapel murders ended in November 1888, which roughly coincided with Bury's departure from Whitechapel. There was graffiti at Bury's Dundee flat that implied that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson supposed this was written by Bury {{as a form of}} confession. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is believed to have taken rings from victim Annie Chapman. Bury was persistently violent to his wife, threatened her with a knife, and cut open her abdomen after death in a manner not dissimilar to the Whitechapel murderer. In a conversation with her neighbours, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop above the Burys' Prince's Street flat in Dundee, asked them [...] "What sort of work was this you Whitechapel folk have been about, letting Jack the Ripper kill so many people?" [...] Bury did not answer her, but Ellen replied [...] "Jack the Ripper is quiet now." [...] She reportedly told another neighbour, [...] "Jack the Ripper is taking a rest." [...] Beadle and Macpherson argued that Ellen's comments might indicate that she had knowledge of the Ripper's whereabouts.|$|E

The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.|$|E
