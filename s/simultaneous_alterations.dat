60|$|It is the {{frequency}} of the latter kind of change, and the comparatively simple nature of the laws governing the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> of appearances in such cases, that have made it possible to treat a physical object as one thing, and to overlook {{the fact that it is}} a system of particulars. When a number of people at a theatre watch an actor, the changes in their several perspectives are so similar and so closely correlated that all are popularly regarded as identical with each other and with the changes of the actor himself. So long as all the changes in the appearances of a body are thus correlated there is no pressing prima facie need to break up the system of appearances, or to realize that the body in question is not really one thing but a set of correlated particulars. It is especially and primarily such changes that physics deals with, i.e. it deals primarily with processes in which the unity of a physical object need not be broken up because all its appearances change simultaneously according to the same law--or, if not all, at any rate all from places sufficiently near to the object, with in creasing accuracy as we approach the object.|$|E

Roberts, Florey and Joklik (1952), using large doses of cortisone in mice observed a reduction in desoxyribosenucleic acid (DNA) /unit weight of liver and a corre-sponding reduction in protein.

Further studies with one of the glutamine-requiring mutants revealed that the rifampin resistance of this strain is due to the resistance of ribonucleic acid polymerase itself and that a single mutation is responsible for both rifampin resistance and the glutamine requirement.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that midbrain dopamine neurons innervating the striatum, release their neurotransmitter through an exocytotic process triggered by the neural ®ring and involving a transient calcium entry in the terminals. Long ago, it had been proposed, however, that another mechanism of release could co-exist with classical exocytosis, involving the reverse-transport of the cytosolic amine by the carrier, ordinarily responsible for uptake function. This atypical mode of release could be evoked directly at the preterminal level by multiple environmental endogenous factors involving transient alterations of the sodium gradient. It cannot be excluded that this mode of release participates in the ®ring-induced release. In contrast with the classical exocytosis of a preformed DA pool, the reverse-transport of DA requires <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> of intraterminal amine metabolism including synthesis and displacement from storage compartment.

40|$|Objective: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is {{released}} into the bloodstream after food intake. In addition to stimulating insulin release, it causes satiety and contributes to the termination of food intake. In this study, we investigated whether endogenous GLP- 1 affects food-related brain activity and hunger. Methods: Twenty-four volunteers (12 lean; 12 obese) underwent a 75  g oral glucose tolerance test that promotes GLP- 1 secretion. Food cue-induced brain activity was assessed by {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and GLP- 1 concentrations were measured before, 30, and 120  min after glucose intake. Results: The significant increase in GLP- 1 levels negatively correlated with a change in the food cue-induced brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a major reward area. This association was independent of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> in insulin and glucose concentrations. The association was present in lean and overweight participants. By contrast, postprandial insulin changes were associated with orbitofrontal activations in lean individuals only. Conclusions: The postprandial release of GLP- 1 might alter reward processes in the orbitofrontal cortex and might thereby support the termination of food intake and reduce hunger. While obese persons showed brain insulin resistance, no GLP- 1 resistance was observed.

40|$|Recombinant human tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) alpha {{decreased the}} expression of ERBB 2 mRNA by stimulating p 55 TNF receptors of pancreatic tumor cells. This decrease contrasts {{with an increase in}} epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA. Both effects were selectively achieved by TNF-alpha or -beta, whereas interferon alpha or gamma or transforming growth factor beta showed no such effects. The inverse regulatory effects of TNF on ERBB 2 and EGFR mRNA levels were evoked by different signaling pathways of p 55 TNF receptors. The TNF-mediated ERBB 2 mRNA decrease was followed by a reduction in protein. Four of five pancreatic tumor cell lines exhibited this down-regulation. This decrease of ERBB 2 is a singular example of a modulation of this growth factor receptor by TNF. Overexpression of ERBB 2 has been reported to cause resistance to TNF and other cytotoxic cytokines.

40|$|Crystallographic {{studies have}} offered {{understanding}} of how receptor tyrosine kinases from the ErbB family are regulated by their growth factor ligands. A conformational change of the EGFR (ErbB 1) was shown to occur upon ligand binding, where a solely ligand-mediated mode of dimerization/activation was documented. However, this dogma of dimerization/activation was revolutionized by the discovery of constitutively active ligand-independent EGFR mutants. In addition, other ligand-independent activation mechanisms may occur. We have shown that oxidative stress (ox-stress), induced by hydrogen peroxide or cigarette smoke, activates EGFR differently than its ligand, EGF, thereby inducing aberrant phosphorylation and impaired trafficking and degradation of EGFR. Here we demonstrate that ox-stress activation of EGFR is ligand-independent, does not induce "classical" receptor dimerization and is not inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 1478. Thus, an unprecedented, apparently activated, state is found for EGFR under ox-stress. Furthermore, this activation mechanism is temperature-dependent, suggesting the simultaneous involvement of membrane structure. We propose that ceramide increase under ox-stress disrupts cholesterol-enriched rafts leading to EGFR re-localization into the rigid, ceramide-enriched rafts. This increase in ceramide also supports EGFR aberrant trafficking to a peri-nuclear region. Therefore, the EGFR unprecedented and activated conformation could be sustained by <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> in membrane structure under ox-stress...|$|E

We identified 23 somatic non-synonymous small nucleotide variants with WES. We identified the BRAF V 600 E mutation and possible functional changes in the mutated genes, ISL 1 and NDRG 2. Copy number alteration analysis revealed gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. We found loss of heterozygosity and focal homozygous deletion on 9 q 21, which includes CDKN 2 A and CDKN 2 B. In addition, WTS revealed that CDK 6, MET, EZH 2, EGFR, and NOTCH 1, which are located on chromosomes 7 and 9, were over-expressed, whereas CDKN 2 A/ 2 B were minimally expressed.

Despite identical growth rates, apparent rates of DNA and RNA synthesis (incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine or [3 H]uridine) were reduced up to 15 -fold in log phase by 1 mM cyclic nucleotide. [3 H]Deoxycytidine incorporation was much less sensitive to dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Uptake studies with [3 H]thymidine demonstrated an inhibition of transport rate dependent on the concentration of dibutyryl cyclic AMP in the growth medium. The rate of thymidine uptake at 1 ° was decreased 21 -fold by 1 mM cyclic nucleotide; half-maximal inhibition occurred at 6 μM.

Whereas the YaeT-YfiO interaction needs NlpB and SmpA for complex stabilization, the YaeT-YfgL interaction does not. Using bioinformatics, genetics, and biochemical approaches, we have identified three residues, L 173, L 175, and R 176, in the mature YfgL protein that are critical for both function and interactions with YaeT. A single substitution at any of these sites produces no phenotypic defect, but two or three <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> produce mild or yfgL-null phenotypes, respectively.

In addition, WTS revealed that CDK 6, MET, EZH 2, EGFR, and NOTCH 1, which are located on chromosomes 7 and 9, were over-expressed, whereas CDKN 2 A/ 2 B were minimally expressed. Fusion gene analysis showed 14 candidate genes that may be functionally involved in R-GBM, including TWIST 2, and UPK 3 BL. The BRAF V 600 E mutation, CDKN 2 A/ 2 B deletion, and EGFR/MET copy number gain were observed. These <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> are very rarely found in GBM. Moreover, the NDRG 2 mutation was first identified in this study as it has never been reported in GBM. We observed a unique genomic signature in R-GBM compared to conventional GBM, which may provide insight regarding R-GBM as a distinct disease entity among the larger group of GBMs...|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} and the expression of cytoskeletal proteins involved in determining cell contact and shape were analyzed in granulosa cells during their differentiation on extracellular matrix (ECM) -coated culture plates. Rat granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles displayed an epithelial shape on ECM and formed multilayered aggregates with numerous gap junctions between neighboring cells. These cells had few actin cables and often only a diffuse pattern of actin and a low amount of vinculin in very thin focal adhesion sites. In contrast, cells grown on plastic formed a monolayer of flat cells with a reduced number of gap junctions but with numerous stress fibers and abundant large vinculin-containing focal contacts. On ECM, the cells were stimulated to produce high levels of progesterone, while only trace amounts of the steroid accumulated in cells on plastic dishes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of [35 S]methionine-labeled cells revealed a dramatic decrease in vinculin, alpha-actinin, and actin synthesis in cells grown on ECM, as compared to cells grown on plastic, while the synthesis of the tubulins and of the intermediate filament protein vimentin remained unchanged. RNA blot analysis showed a marked decrease in actin mRNA levels in cells from ECM plates, while the level of tubulin mRNA remained essentially unchanged. It is concluded that the differentiation of granulosa cells on ECM in vitro is associated with changes in cell shape and cell contacts and that such changes in cell morphology are accompanied by <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alterations</b> in the {{organization and}} expression of cytoskeletal proteins {{that are involved in}} determining these cellular structures...|$|E
40|$|Electronic devices {{based on}} organic {{thin-film}} transistors (OTFT) {{have the potential}} to supply the demand for portable and low-cost gadgets, mainly as sensors for in situ disease diagnosis and environment monitoring. For that reason, poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) as the active layer in the widely-used bottom-gate/bottom-contact OTFT structure was deposited over highly-doped silicon substrates covered with thermally-grown oxide to detect vapor-phase compounds. A ten-fold organochloride and ammonia sensitivity compared to bare sensors corroborated the application of this semiconducting polymer in sensors. Furthermore, P 3 HT TFTs presented approximately three-order higher normalized sensitivity than any chemical sensor addressed herein. The results demonstrate that while TFTs respond linearly at the lowest concentration values herein, chemical sensors present such an operating regime mostly above 2000 ppm. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>alteration</b> of charge carrier mobility and threshold voltage is responsible for pushing the detection limit down to units of ppm of ammonia, as well as tens of ppm of alcohol or ketones. Nevertheless, P 3 HT transistors and chemical sensors could compose an electronic nose operated at room temperature for a wide range concentration evaluation (1 – 10, 000 ppm) of gaseous analytes. Targeted analytes include not only biomarkers for diseases, such as uremia, cirrhosis, lung cancer and diabetes, but also gases for environment monitoring in food, cosmetic and microelectronics industries...|$|R

40|$|Tra 1 is an {{essential}} component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA and NuA 4 complexes. Using targeted mutagenesis, we identified residues within its C-terminal phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) domain that are required for function. The phenotypes of tra 1 -P 3408 A, S 3463 A, and SRR 3413 - 3415 AAA included temperature sensitivity and reduced growth in media containing 6 % ethanol or calcofluor white or depleted of phosphate. These alleles resulted in a twofold or greater change in expression of ∼ 7 % of yeast genes in rich media and reduced activation of PHO 5 and ADH 2 promoters. Tra 1 -SRR 3413 associated with components of both the NuA 4 and SAGA complexes and with the Gal 4 transcriptional activation domain similar to wild-type protein. Tra 1 -SRR 3413 was recruited to the PHO 5 promoter in vivo but gave rise to decreased relative amounts of acetylated histone H 3 and histone H 4 at SAGA and NuA 4 regulated promoters. Distinct from other components of these complexes, tra 1 -SRR 3413 resulted in generation-dependent telomere shortening and synthetic slow growth in combination with deletions of a number of genes with roles in membrane-related processes. While the tra 1 alleles have some phenotypic similarities with deletions of SAGA and NuA 4 components, their distinct nature may arise from the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>alteration</b> of SAGA and NuA 4 functions...|$|R
