5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a <b>scythe,</b> a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the <b>scythe,</b> which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Derby {{passed through}} Leigh again in 1651, when {{he spent his}} {{last night in the}} King's Arms, before going on to his {{execution}} outside Ye Olde Man & <b>Scythe</b> Inn in Bolton.|$|E
5|$|A {{charter to}} hold a market in Churchgate was granted on 14 December 1251 by King Henry III of England. Bolton became a market town and borough by a charter from the Earl of Derby, William de Ferrers, on 14 January 1253, and a market was held until the 18th century. Burgage plots were laid out on Churchgate and Deansgate in {{the centre of the}} medieval town close to where Ye Olde Man & <b>Scythe</b> public house, dating from 1251, is {{situated}} today.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>scythes</b> {{is still}} {{widespread}} today as many pastures are too steep for modern farm machinery so <b>scythes</b> {{are used to}} cut grass or bracken. Working <b>scythes</b> have blades between 0.9-0.95m long but competition <b>scythes</b> range from 1.18-1.24m in length. A decent segalari can manage some 5000m2 in a day.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scythes</b> {{is thought}} by some writers, {{including}} Perizonius, {{to have been}} the father of Cadmus of Kos. [...] Others, such as Lodewijk Caspar Valckenaer, suppose that <b>Scythes</b> was the uncle of another <b>Scythes</b> in Kos, who was the father of Cadmus.|$|R
50|$|The {{coat of arms}} was {{introduced}} in 1987 and was designed by Petter Eide. It shows three silver blades of <b>scythes</b> on a blue background. Historically, farming and blacksmithing were vital industries in Hornindal. At one point, there were as many as 200 blacksmiths in the area. There was also a rich tradition of making handmade <b>scythes</b> and this was very symbolized by putting <b>scythes</b> on the coat-of-arms.|$|R
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's <b>scythe</b> and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the <b>scythe,</b> but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a <b>scythe.</b> However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

50|$|Pitchforks and <b>scythes</b> have {{frequently}} {{been used as}} weapons by {{those who could not}} afford or did not have access to more expensive weapons such as swords, or, later, guns. As a result, pitchforks and <b>scythes</b> are stereotypically carried by angry mobs or gangs of enraged peasants.|$|R
5|$|Stretford Urban District {{became the}} Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough {{status in the}} United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre {{represents}} John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from {{the arms of the}} de Trafford family; the <b>scythe</b> is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's <b>scythe</b> (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E

25|$|The <b>scythed</b> chariot {{was invented}} by the King of Magadha, Ajatashatru around 475 BCE. He used these chariots against the Licchavis. A <b>scythed</b> war chariot had a sharp, sickle-shaped blade or blades mounted on {{each end of the}} axle. The blades, used as weapons, {{extended}} horizontally for a metre {{on the sides of the}} chariot.|$|R
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn <b>scythe</b> with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E

In the subsequent story, it is revealed that <b>Scythe</b> is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment back when he was in infancy during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, <b>Scythe</b> was allowed to live. Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Alan sustained have rendered him paralyzed, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.|$|E

It was destroyed by Mahendra Baahubali.|$|R

25|$|Historical harvest methods {{involved}} cutting with a <b>scythe</b> or sickle, and threshing {{under the}} feet of cattle.
