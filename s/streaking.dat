40|$|Slope <b>streaks</b> are {{surficial}} mass {{movements that}} are {{abundant in the}} dust-covered regions of Mars. Targeting of slope <b>streaks</b> seen in Viking images with the Mars Orbiter Camera provides observations of slope <b>streak</b> dust activity over two to three decades. In all study areas, new and persisting dark slope <b>streaks</b> are observed. Slope <b>streaks</b> disappeared in one area, with persisting <b>streaks</b> nearby. New slope <b>streaks</b> {{are found to be}} systematically darker than persisting <b>streaks,</b> which indicates gradual fading. Far more slope <b>streaks</b> formed at the study sites than have faded from visibility. The rate of formation at the study sites was 0. 03 new slope <b>streaks</b> per existing <b>streak</b> per Mars year. Bright slope <b>streaks</b> do not presently form in sudden events as dark slope <b>streaks</b> do. Instead, bright <b>streaks</b> might form from old dark slope <b>streaks,</b> perhaps transitioning through a partially faded stage...|$|R
50|$|Bright slope <b>streaks</b> are <b>streaks</b> {{that have}} a lighter tone (about 2%) than their surroundings. (See F in Photo Gallery.) They are much rarer than dark slope <b>streaks,</b> but both types of <b>streaks</b> have similar morphologies and occur in the same regions of Mars. Evidence {{suggests}} that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are older than dark slope <b>streaks.</b> New bright slope <b>streaks</b> have never been observed, and dark slope <b>streaks</b> can be seen overlying bright slope <b>streaks</b> in some images, indicating that the former are younger than the latter. It is likely that bright slope <b>streaks</b> form from old dark slope <b>streaks</b> that have transitioned past a partially faded stage. This supposition is supported by geographical evidence indicating that bright slope <b>streaks</b> are slightly more common in regions where the formation rate of new dark slope <b>streaks</b> is low. In other words, areas with relatively many bright <b>streaks</b> {{tend to be less}} active and contain a higher population of old dark <b>streaks.</b>|$|R

5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, <b>streaking</b> the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple <b>streaking</b> on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{prominent}} <b>streak</b> discovery in sequence data. Given a sequence of val-ues, a prominent <b>streak</b> is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large (small) values, e. g., consec-utive games of outstanding performance in sports, consecutive hours of heavy network traffic, consecutive days of frequent mentioning of a person in social media, and so on. Prominent <b>streak</b> discovery provides insightful data patterns for data analysis in many real-world applications and is an enabling technique for computational journalism. Given its real-world usefulness and complexity, the research on prominent <b>streaks</b> in sequence data opens a spectrum of challenging problems. A baseline approach to finding prominent <b>streaks</b> is a quadratic algorithm that exhaustively enumer-ates all possible <b>streaks</b> and performs pairwise <b>streak</b> dominance comparison. For more efficient methods, we make the observation that prominent <b>streaks</b> are in fact skyline points in two dimensions – <b>streak</b> in-terval length and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges upon the idea to separate the two steps in prominent <b>streak</b> discovery – candidate <b>streak</b> generation and skyline operation over candidate <b>streaks.</b> For candidate generation, we propose the concept of local prominent <b>streak</b> (LPS). We prove that prominent <b>streaks</b> are a subset of LPSs {{and the number of}} LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence, in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by the brute-force baseline method.

5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the <b>streaking</b> warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} <b>streaking</b> on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E

40|$|Photometric {{studies of}} crater related bright and dark <b>streaks</b> have {{strongly}} supported {{the hypothesis that}} the bright <b>streaks</b> are excess dust deposits and dark <b>streaks</b> are erosional windows in a partial dust cover.

Red-violet plots of bright <b>streaks</b> are most easily explained by mosaics of optically thick dust and plains material. Lengths of bright <b>streaks</b> are independent of their contrasts.

5|$|Difficult {{conditions}} {{greeted the}} teams upon their {{arrival at the}} Silverstone Circuit, as parts of the Midlands received a month's rainfall {{in the space of}} two days. The torrential rain lasted throughout the weekend, forcing qualifying to be suspended for ninety minutes, before race day dawned clear. The circuit was declared dry, allowing the drivers to start on the tyre compound of their choice, with Alonso on the harder tyre <b>streaking</b> away at the start while Paul di Resta crashed at Aintree on the first lap after making contact with Romain Grosjean. As the leaders settled into a rhythm, Pastor Maldonado and Sergio Pérez collided at Brooklands, prompting an angry response from the Mexican driver. Perez's team mate Kamui Kobayashi also ran into trouble, locking his tyres as he entered his pit box and hitting three members of his pit crew, though none were seriously injured. The race was ultimately decided by the choice of tyre in the first stint as Alonso moved onto the softer option and Webber onto the harder prime for the final phase of the race. Webber caught Alonso with five laps to go, passing him on the Wellington Straight. Webber held on for his second win of the season, with Vettel third and Felipe Massa in fourth, his best result since achieving a podium in South Korea in 2010. The result meant Webber closed to within thirteen points of Alonso's championship lead, with both drivers breaking away from third-placed Vettel.

40|$|Low-speed <b>streaks</b> are {{involved}} in bypass transition, yet they can interact with Tollmien-Schlichting waves to delay transition. Recent progress concerning <b>streak</b> stability has used the model of an Optimum <b>streak</b> computationally, or <b>streaks</b> from roughness elements experimentally. Questions remain concerning the characteristics of <b>streaks</b> which originate from the free-stream. This thesis provides insight into the origin of steady vortical free-stream disturbances, creation of <b>streaks,</b> and their influence on boundary layer transition.   Computational results are co-validated with published experimental observations of steady <b>streaks,</b> generated by {{the wake of a}} wire upstream. The largest <b>streak</b> occurs when the wire is placed upstream of the wind tunnel contraction. Flow through the contraction creates streamwise vorticity in the test-section via tilting and stretching of the normal vorticity in the wake. The computational results reinterpret the original experiment as a receptivity experiment, demonstrating the boundary layer is more receptive to streamwise vorticity. The sensitivity of normal vorticity receptivity to the leading edge attachment is also shown. More than 30 years ago, Morkovin highlighted issues of spanwise variation (<b>streaks)</b> in wind tunnels and called for establishing the link with settling chamber screens. This thesis uses CFD to link screens with boundary layer <b>streaks</b> assuming steady, laminar flow. The screen is modelled by a zither of wires. The effects of zither open-area ratio and geometric imperfections are examined. The computational results mirror experiment with zithers of decreasing open-area ratio and greater imperfection creating larger <b>streaks.</b> For example, an imperfect zither with an open-area ratio of 50 % can create a <b>streak</b> causing 80 % variation of boundary layer thickness. The free-stream flow angle is only 0. 1 degrees. The <b>streaks</b> have the same attributes as Klebanoff <b>streaks.</b> A PSE- 3 D analysis suggests the <b>streaks</b> will stabilise Tollmien-Schlichting waves. Large <b>streaks</b> have been attributed to an “instability” downstream of screens that leads to “coalescence of jets”. Current results demonstrate and attribute <b>streak</b> formation to increasing drag variation across the zither. Drag variation modifies the wake decay rate, creating a stronger wake. The stronger wake passing through the contraction generates increased streamwise vorticity, creating larger <b>streaks.</b> A published analysis is tested for predicting zither wake strength and wavelength. New zither wake decay rates are derived based on drag variation. “Coalescence of jets” {{is considered to be a}} symptom rather than a cause. <b>Streaks</b> are computationally generated near the leading edge using free-stream normal or streamwise vorticity. BiGlobal stability analysis in the early boundary layer shows normal vorticity <b>streaks</b> favour the growth of high frequency disturbances while streamwise vorticity <b>streaks</b> favour lower frequencies. Both <b>streaks</b> stabilise the boundary layer further downstream. A model using the spanwise mean and the first Fourier mode of the <b>streak</b> is used to investigate stability. <b>Streaks</b> can destabilise or stabilise depending on modification of the mean-flow wall-normal profile by the <b>streak,</b> the <b>streak</b> width relative to the boundary layer thickness, and the relative amplitude of the mean-flow modification. These characteristics depend on the free-stream source and nonlinear growth of the <b>streak...</b>|$|R
