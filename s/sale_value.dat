5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total <b>sale</b> <b>value</b> of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its <b>sale</b> <b>value</b> but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

25|$|The chilli thrips {{or yellow}} tea thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood, is an {{extremely}} successful invasive species of pest-thrips which has expanded rapidly from Asia over the last twenty years, and is gradually achieving a global distribution. It has most recently been reported in St. Vincent (2004) Florida (2005), Texas (2006), and Puerto Rico (2007). It is a pest of economic significance with a broad host range, with prominent pest reports on crops including pepper, mango, citrus, strawberry, grapes, cotton, tea, peanuts, blueberry, and roses. Chilli thrips appear to feed preferentially on new growth, and infested plants usually develop characteristic wrinkled leaves, with distinctive brown scarring along the veins of leaves, the buds of flowers, and the calyx of fruit. Feeding damage can reduce the <b>sale</b> <b>value</b> of crops produced, and in sufficient numbers, kill plants already aggravated by environmental stress.

40|$|SIGNIFICANCE: The tobacco {{industry}} argues that tobacco sales {{are important to}} small retailers’ business. We examined 1) tobacco gross margins, sales, and profits in small shops, 2) differences by area deprivation and smoking prevalence, and 3) the role of e-cigarettes. METHODS: Sales data from 1447 shops covering two 2 -week periods in 2015 (weeks starting 1 June, 8 June, 14 Sept, 21 Sept) recorded by electronic point of sale systems (EPOS) in small shops in the UK were obtained from an EPOS company. Data were aggregated into weekly tobacco, non-tobacco, and e-cigarette <b>sales</b> <b>values,</b> gross margins, <b>sales</b> quantities, and transactions. RESULTS: For the week starting 21 Sept (N= 1416), mean gross margins on tobacco products were 6. 6 % (SD= 2. 2) and 24. 1 % (SD= 4. 9) on non-tobacco products. Mean total <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> (tobacco+non-tobacco <b>sales)</b> =£ 14, 893. 58 (SD= 8543. 91) while mean tobacco sales=£ 3, 716. 17 (SD= 2087. 16), thus tobacco accounted for 26. 0 % (SD= 0. 08) of total sales. Mean total gross profits=£ 2, 894. 54 (SD= 1788. 81) while mean gross profits from tobacco were only £ 241. 80 (SD= 165. 41), thus tobacco accounted for 9. 1 % (SD= 0. 05) of total profits. Area smoking prevalence and deprivation were both positively correlated with tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> and tobacco gross profits, but negatively correlated with tobacco gross margins (p< 0. 0001 for all). N= 550 shops {{had at least one}} e-cigarette transaction, with a mean of 3. 2 (SD= 5. 3) transactions and mean gross margins of 43. 4 % (SD= 10. 5). Week 4 (N= 1416) was chosen for presentation because it was the most current and had fewer EPOS errors. Findings across the 4 weeks were similar although small differences were found, including tobacco and total <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> (p< 0. 0001). Tobacco gross margins did not differ (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high <b>sales</b> <b>values,</b> tobacco has low gross margins compared to other products. Tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>values</b> are higher in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas. The lower gross margins on tobacco in more deprived/higher smoking prevalence areas suggest that more smokers in these areas smoke cheap discount brands.
