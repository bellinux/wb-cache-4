The vegetable based cutting fluid (VBCFs) doesn’t affect the environment, diminish the harmful effects to the operator and also enhance the machining performances such as surface roughness, tool life, minimum vibration and cutting forces. In this work, the performances of four different VBCFs like palm, coconut, sunflower, <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oils,</b> and a commercial type of CFs were considered to analyze the influence of cutting fluids while measuring the cutting force and vibration signatures during milling of 7075 –T 6 hybrid aluminium metal matrix composite with carbide insert tool.

As long ago as 1801, precursor firms to Jardines had secured the first licences from the East India Company to exports teas to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land and when the East India Company's trade monopoly was overturned in 1834, the firm lost no time in expanding its tea business. By the 1890s Jardines were exporting large quantities of Keemun. Soochong, Oolong, Gunpowder, and Chun Mee tea. Ocean steamers laden with these cargoes departed from Fuzhou and Taiwan, as well as from the firms godowns (warehouses) on the Shanghai Bund bound for Europe, Africa, and America. Silk played a prominent role as a commodity during Jardine's first century of operation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of duodenal and ileal infusion of nutrients on small intestinal transit of digesta, {{measured by the}} passage of phenol red marker, was studied in twelve pigs fitted with duodenal and ileal catheters, and a terminal ileal cannula. Changes in gastrointestinal motility were observed by electromyography and by use of an X-ray image intensifier {{in four of the}} pigs fitted additionally with nichrome wire electrodes in the gut wall and in seven pigs fitted only with a gastric catheter. Small intestinal transit time was unaffected by intestinal catheterization per se, or by duodenal or ileal infusion of glucose or peptone. It was reduced by duodenal infusion of fat or of some of the products of fat digestion including oleic acid and a monoglyceride containing unsaturated fatty acids (monoglyceride LS) but was not affected by infusion of glycerol, stearic acid or a monoglyceride containing saturated fatty acids (monoglyceride P). Ileal transit time was greatly reduced by ileal infusion of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> mixed with bile salts and lipase and by monoglyceride LS but not by <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> alone. Total small intestinal transit time was reduced to a lesser degree by ileal infusion of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> mixed with bile salts and lipase and by monoglyceride LS and was unaffected by <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> alone. The level of irregular spiking activity of the small intestine was greatly reduced by both duodenal and ileal infusion of fat, but rapidly propagated spike bursts were initiated from the point of infusion (identified radiologically as peristaltic rushes) many of which travelled right through to the ileo-caecal junction. It is concluded that intestinal infusion of fat accelerates small intestinal transit in pigs by induction of peristaltic rushes; that since the ileal transit times were more severely reduced than total small intestinal transit times by ileal infusion of fat the response is probably only seen over those areas of intestine in direct contract with the fat; and that the effect depends upon the presence of fat digestion products, i. e. the fatty acid and the monoglyceride, although probably only those containing unsaturated fatty acids...|$|E

With this purpose, a total of 450 10 -day-old birds were allocated to 15 cages (30 birds/cage) and received three dietary treatments: a Control diet (C) and two diets (H 1 and H 2) corresponding to 10 % and 15 % H inclusion levels, respectively (H substituted 28. 4 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> and 16. 1 % soya bean meal for H 1, and 100 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> and 24. 8 % soya bean meal for H 2, respectively). At 28 days of age, quails were slaughtered, carcasses were weighed, breast muscles were then excised from 50 quails/treatment, weighed, and ultimate pH (pHu) and L*, a*, b* colour values were measured. Breast muscles were then cooked to assess cooking loss and meat toughness. For the digestibility trial, a total of 15 28 -day-old quails {{were assigned to the}} three feeding groups. The excreta samples were subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis. The same 15 quails were then simultaneously provided with C and H 2 diets for a 10 -day feed choice trial. Productive performance, mortality and carcass traits were in line with commercial standards and similar in all experimental groups. With the exception of ether extract digestibility, which was lower in H 1 group compared with C and H 2 (P= 0. 0001), apparent digestibility of dry matter, CP, starch and energy did not differ among treatments. Microbial composition of excreta was also comparable among the three groups. Feed choice trial showed that quails did not express a preference toward C or H 2 diets. Breast meat weight and yield did not differ among C, H 1 and H 2 quails. Differently, the inclusion of H meal reduced meat pHu compared with C. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that H. illucens larvae meal can partially replace conventional soya bean meal and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> in the diet for growing broiler quails, thus confirming to be a promising insect protein source for the feed industry. Further research {{to assess the impact of}} H meal on intestinal morphology as well as on meat quality and sensory profile would be of utmost importance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of heated vegetable oils in estrogen deficient rats. Eighty female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into eight groups and given treatment as follows: (I) intact (non-ovariectomised), basal diet (control group); (II) ovariectomised, basal diet; (III) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) fresh <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> (FSO); (IV) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> heated once (1 H-SO); (V) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> heated five times (5 H-SO); (VI) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) fresh palm oil (FPO); (VII) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) palm oil heated once (1 H-PO); (VIII) ovariectomised, basal diet fortified with 15 % weight/weight (w/w) palm oil heated five times (5 H-PO). Duration of treatment was 6 months. Blood was taken at baseline and monthly interval for 6 months for determination of serum lipid profiles and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Serum homocystein and interleukin- 6 were assayed at baseline and after 6 months of study. At {{the end of the study}} the rats were killed and consistent segments of the ascending aorta were taken for histopathological examination. The specimens were sectioned transervely and stained with haematoxylin-eosin and Verhoeff van Gieson for light microscopy. Measurements of the intimal thickness and the ratio between tunica intima / tunica media were calculated using computerised image analyser. Heated and fresh palm oil cause transient changes in lipid profiles, whereas soya oil; fresh, heated once and heated five times as well as heated once palm oil caused an increase in serum LDL-cholesterol. Fresh and heated vegetable oils diet did not alter the ratio between tunica intima and tunica media, serum MDA and homocystein level. Histological study showed no obvious focal or diffuse atherosclerotic plague formation with an intact internal elastic lamina and no evidence of smooth muscle cell migration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was {{to find out the}} effects of rapeseed oil and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil</b> added into the feed during late gestation and lactation on the piglet production, the composition of milk, and the condition of sows. The sows farrowed in the experiment two times. There were four feeding groups: control (no added fat), 4 % and 8 % rapeseed oil, and 4 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>oil.</b> The experimental diets were supplemented with extra vitamin E. The sows in all groups fed with the same basic mixture during {{the first three months of}} gestation. During late gestation and lactation, the sows received the same amount of digestible raw protein daily, but different amounts of energy depending on the oils added into the feed. The adding of oil into the feed during late gestation and lactation had a positive effect on the number of pigs born alive and on the birth weight of piglets. No direct effect was found on the weight gains of piglets. Oil inclusion in the feed for sows increased slightly the fat content of colostrum and milk. The highest oil level seemed to improve the condition of sows at weaning. Reduced weight losses during lactation probably led to a shorter interval between weaning and the next oestrus. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{proximate}} and {{sensory analysis}} of the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> and wheat flour composite cake has been performed. This was done to determine the nutritional content and the general acceptability of the composite cake {{as compared to the}} pure wheat flour cake. The analysis revealed that the protein and fat content of the cake increased with the addition of the <b>soya</b> <b>bean.</b> Thus the composite cake is more nutritious than the pure wheat flour cake. The sensory analysis also revealed that the cake with 70 % wheat flour and 30 % <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> was more acceptable than the pure wheat flour cake. However, cake with more than 30 % <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> was not generally acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the bioavailability of selenium (Se) from milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> a plant protein, to lambs after various degrees of heat treatment. Thirty Dohne Merino lambs (ca. 25 kg live weight, 4 months old) were allocated randomly within sex and weight groups into three treatment groups. During the experimental period, they were fed a diet consisting of a large proportion of milled <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> as their main source of Se and other feeds low in Se to balance the diet. Blood was drawn during this period and analysed for Se and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Chemical and Se analyses were performed on the feed and <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> samples as well as on the organs, wool and rumen fluid of the lambs. Although the ADIN concentration of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> increased with increasing heat treatments, more heat damage could have been inflicted on it to differentiate the different <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> fractions in comparison to each other. On average, the in sacco disappearance of the dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and Se was higher for the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared to the two processed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> fractions. As a result, the lambs receiving the unprocessed <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (control group- C-group) had a significant higher rumen bacterial Se concentration than the lambs receiving the heat¬treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Despite this higher concentration, the liver Se concentration of this group was statistically significantly lower compared to the two heat-treated groups. This can be interpreted that the heat processing of the <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> enhanced its Se fraction to be taken up by the liver. However, those differences were biologically not significant. The average liver Se concentration between the lambs receiving the over- ¬processed- (a-group) and those receiving the ideal treated <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (I-group), did not differ, indicating that the excessive heat treatment did not influence the amount of Se reaching the lower digestive tract of the a-group. Although the Se concentration of the heart muscle of the a-group was statistically significantly lower than for the I-and C-groups, those differences biologically were not significant. Despite an increase in the erythrocyte GSH-Px activity over the duration of the trial in all three the treatment groups, no significant differences between the three treatment groups were observed at any stage. It is concluded from this study that the heat treatment of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> has not influenced the incorporation and the bioavailability of its Se fraction to any significant degree.

30|$|The {{rapidly growing}} global demand for energy and {{industrial}} raw materials from crude {{oil and the}} consequent depletion of crude oil reserves in addition to adverse environmental concerns and unstable nature of the international market make imperative the need to explore alternative sources of fuel and industrial raw materials. There {{has been an increase}} in the world production of oil seeds over the last 30  years. This would appear {{to be related to the}} increasing demand for oil seed products and by-products. Most seeds are cultivated primarily for their oil and meal. The oil from most seeds can be used for edible purposes (example is fluted pumpkin seed <b>oil,</b> <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> seed <b>oil)</b> and about 80  % of the world production of vegetable oil is for human consumption while the remaining 20  % is shared between animals and chemical process industries [1]. As a result of the extensive demand of oil for consumption and industrial uses, analysis of many oils has been carried out. Most vegetable seed oils find wide applications in the production of soaps, paints, varnishes, lacquers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, printing inks, dyes, pesticides, and insecticides [2, 3, 4, 5]. Also, with increase in petroleum prices and uncertainties surrounding petroleum availability, vegetable oil can be employed as an alternative fuel and for biodiesel production which aims to overcome energy crisis problem [6]. Due to the increasing applications of vegetable oils, a number of seed oils have been characterized but the vast majority have not been adequately evaluated and this is particularly valid for gmelina, which falls into this group of under-utilized species of plant. The ability of a particular oil seed to fit into the growing industry depends on its utilization potential, rate of production, and availability of processing technology [7].|$|R
