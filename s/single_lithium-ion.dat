50|$|The {{two most}} recent {{variants}} of the cap lamp are the GEN 4 and GEN 5 models. The GEN 4 model, approved {{for use by}} the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MHSA), uses the headpiece of existing cap lamps, but retrofitted with new LEDs and electronics. The GEN 5 model is very similar to the GEN 4 model except with a more intense spot beam that can illuminate objects that are more than 40 feet away. Since GEN 5 is very similar to GEN 4, it has not been separately approved by MHSA. These lamps will last up to 50 hours with a six-cell battery pack. Energy-saving variants of these models, GEN 4E and GEN 5E, use a <b>single</b> <b>lithium-ion</b> battery.|$|E

The name XD comes from oddly shaped rear lights ("X" [...] shaped) and [...] "D" [...] beginning letter of the company's name. The XD can travel over 250 km on a <b>single</b> charge with <b>Lithium-ion</b> batteries. Car's base-cost will be only â‚¬10,000. Serial production is predicted to start mid-2012.|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} novel cross-needle analogmeter whose scale reads out voltage, current, and time remaining to reach full charge. The design {{is inspired by}} cross-needle Standing Wave Ratio(SWR) meters that read forward and reverse power. Voltage is displayed on an offset-zero linear scale, and current on a logarithmic scale from 1 mA to 10 A. Thisleads {{to a wide range}} of perceptible charge times and pleasantcharge-time contour lines. The prototype is implemented on a single PCB using a cheap PIC micro controller. It is scaled formonitoring a single 18650 lithium cell charged by a small solarpanel. The Novel contribution of this paper is the use of a crossneedleanalog meter with a third scale to measure time remaining to fully charge a <b>Lithium-Ion</b> <b>single</b> cell battery...|$|R
40|$|The Electronic Instrumentation Lab at Delft University of Technology {{desired to}} have a {{demonstrator}} for low-power temperature and humidity sensors they developed, {{in the form of}} a wireless sensor node. This thesis presents the design of the energy management system of this node. The primary design goal was to allow the sensor systems to run for as long as possible, at least a year, without any kind of service or human intervention, doing so in indoor lighting conditions. Using the state of the art of such energy systems in sensor nodes, a concept consisting of energy storage combined with energy conditioning was generated. A <b>single</b> cell <b>lithium-ion</b> polymer battery and an ultra low quiescent current linear voltage regulator (the Texas Instruments TPS 78233) were used to implement this concept. Switching voltage regulators with buck and buck-boost topologies were also considered, as well as combinations of linear and switching voltage regulators, but these ultimately turned out to be highly inefficient when the sensor is idle and the output current is in the order of microamperes. The lithium-ion polymer battery chemistry was chosen because it is widely available in high capacities, it has a relatively low self-discharge current and it can be charged. As the ultimate goal of this design was to let the sensor systems run for as long as possible, and not just a year, energy harvesting techniques were also researched. It was found that amorphous solar cells were the best option for this design, as this was the best commercially available technology for harvesting energy at low light levels at the time. A promising new solar cell technology for this purpose is the dye-sensitized solar cell, however, these were only available as do-it-yourself kits at the time, and project time constraints withheld the usage of this technology because of that. Energy harvesting based on radio-frequency electromagnetic waves was also considered, but it was found that this technology did not provide enough power within the size and budget constraints. As such, a secondary concept was generated, using a 100 x 50 mm amorphous solar panel by Sanyo Energy and a lithium-ion charger circuit based on the Maxim MAX 17710. The charging circuit consists primarily of a largely integrated switching voltage regulator using the boost topology. Both of these systems were implemented on a single circuit board along with the other sensor systems, designed such that it was possible to switch between the two energy systems easily. When this circuit board was completed, measurements were done to determine the average output current of the charger under office light conditions. When it is assumed that these conditions last for about ten hours per day, the average current output was found to be approximately 45 ?A. Furthermore, the average supply current for the sensor was found to be 53. 4 ?A. Using these numbers, the minimum capacity for the battery to run the system for a year was determined to be 1300 mAh when no harvesting system is used, and 213 mAh when the solar panel is used.
