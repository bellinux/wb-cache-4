The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall.</b> The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher, oddly, was {{cared for}} by his sister Esther (Hetty) until his 48th year, when he married Hannah Rodman of Newport, RI, a {{descendant}} of Thomas Cornell, in a hastily arranged ceremony in Newport. He had made her acquaintance on his numerous trips, and had corresponded with her from Philadelphia. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and beautiful, and because Quakers at that time were restricted, as were many other denominations, to marrying [...] "within the Meeting", her choices for marrying in the Newport area were limited.

2500|$|Despite Elizabeth’s volatile, often violent {{reactions}} {{in regards to}} her appearance, the Empress was ebullient in most other matters particularly {{when it came to}} Court entertainment. Elizabeth was renowned throughout and beyond Russia for the balls she held and her fierce commitment to the arts, particularly music, theater, and architecture. It is reported that Elizabeth threw two balls a week. One would be a large event with an average of 800 guests in attendance, most of whom were the nation’s leading merchants, members of the lower nobility, and guards stationed in and around the city of the event. The other ball was a much smaller affair reserved for Elizabeth’s closest friends as well as members of the highest echelons of nobility. These smaller gatherings began as masked balls but evolved into the famous Metamorphoses balls by 1744. At these Metamorphoses balls, guests were expected to dress as the opposite sex, with Elizabeth often dressing up as Cossack or carpenter in honor of her father. The costumes not permitted at the event were those of pilgrims and harlequins, which the Empress considered profane and indecent respectively. Most members of court thoroughly disliked these balls since most looked ridiculous but Elizabeth adored them. As Catherine the Great’s advisor Potemkin posited, this adoration was {{due to the fact that}} she was “the only woman who looked truly fine, and completely a man… As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and powerful, male attire suited her.” [...] Though the balls were by far her most personally beloved and lavish events, Elizabeth often threw children’s birthday parties and wedding receptions for those affiliated with her Court, going so far as to provide dowries for each of her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
