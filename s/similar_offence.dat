25|$|Whether {{the attack}} on the {{liferafts}} was deliberate, or an unfortunate and unintended consequence of a nighttime attack has been heavily debated. Some of the crew of U-552 survived the war, and her captain, Erich Topp, later became an Admiral in the post-war Bundesmarine. No charges were brought against Topp, as happened to Helmuth von Ruckteschell, captain of the raider Widder for a <b>similar</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{person had}} an honour-price, which varied {{depending}} on their rank in society. This honour-price was {{to be paid to}} them if their honour was violated by certain offences. Those of higher rank had a higher honour-price. However, an offence against the property of a poor man (who could ill afford it), was punished more harshly than a <b>similar</b> <b>offence</b> upon a wealthy man. The clergy were more harshly punished than the laity. When a layman had paid his fine he would go through a probationary period and then regain his standing, but a clergyman could never regain his standing.|$|E
25|$|If the Court {{finds the}} accused not guilty, it records {{an order of}} acquittal. If it finds the accused guilty, it passes {{sentence}} on the accused according to law. The High Court is the sole court exercising original criminal jurisdiction that may impose the death penalty. Also, {{when a person is}} convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more and had previously been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere of a <b>similar</b> <b>offence,</b> the Court may, in addition to any other punishment, direct that he or she be subject to police supervision for not more than seven years starting immediately after the sentence passed for the last of these offences expires. In addition, only the High Court and District Courts are empowered to sentence convicted persons to corrective training, reformative training or preventive detention.|$|E

25|$|The Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 {{was passed}} {{in order to protect}} Royal Navy ships, dockyards, and stores from damage; at the time, ships were built of {{flammable}} oak wood and tar, and the naval yards were full of these supplies. Punishment for violating the act was a death sentence. The first section created the offence of arson in the royal dockyards by making it an offence to burn or destroy Royal Navy ships, stores, or ammunition under penalty of death anywhere in the British Empire. The Act also provided that benefit of clergy was not an available defence for the crime. The second section also stated that offenders could be tried if the offence occurred anywhere outside of the realm. The act put a version of arson in statute law for the first time, as all arson previously had been under common law. Though Scotland had its own <b>similar</b> <b>offence</b> of wilful fire raising.|$|E

2500|$|As a bladed article, {{possession}} of a kirpan without valid reason {{in a public place}} would be illegal under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. However, there is a specific defence for a person to prove that he carries it for [...] "religious reasons". There is an identical defence to the <b>similar</b> <b>offence</b> (section 139A) which relates to carrying bladed articles on school grounds. The official list of prohibited items at the London 2012 Summer Olympics venues prohibited all kinds of weapons, but explicitly allowed the kirpan.|$|E

2500|$|Nymphe {{was one of}} {{the ships}} {{involved}} in the Spithead Mutiny of April and May 1797, when the men of the Channel Fleet struck for improved pay and conditions. According to statements by the crew, no particular accusation was brought against Captain Cooke, but his conduct was considered unsatisfactory. The chief complaints were made against the lieutenants, particularly Irwin, the first lieutenant. On one occasion, after receiving a flogging, a seaman was seen to smile. Irwin promptly ordered that he receive an additional 36 lashes for [...] "silent contempt". The lieutenants of the Nymphe made a practice of beating the men themselves if they considered that the boatswain's mates were not putting enough effort into it. They would order floggings for the most trivial offences. On one occasion two men were beaten for [...] "slackness", in not carrying out an order fast enough, both received twelve lashes. For a <b>similar</b> <b>offence</b> another seaman was beaten and kicked so severely that he was advised to go on the sick list. The seaman refused, through fear of the officers. As a result Cooke and his two lieutenants were sent ashore by the mutineers.|$|E
