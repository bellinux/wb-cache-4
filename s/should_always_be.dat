5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so {{precious}} that she <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> attended by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite.

5|$|On 24 January 1674, Bishop Fuller {{issued a}} decree {{dealing with the}} {{recommendations}} of the commissioners—a majority of all the Fellows <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> present at an election, so the Provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On 28 January Provost Say obtained from the King a recommendation for Twitty's election, but it was withdrawn on 13 February, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.|$|E
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> used for safety).|$|E

50|$|In theory, {{the courts}} <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{impartial}} and independent from any interference. Judges were not elected through election, but {{the members of}} the Legislative Council were. Thus, the Legislative Council would be in a better position than the courts to determine what the society would need. The courts should recognise and appreciate that fact. Therefore, the courts should let the legislature deal with public policy. And this would be the margin of appreciation doctrine.|$|R

5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|Official {{regulation}} {{states that}} the flag must never touch the ground or water, or {{be used as a}} drapery in any form. The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.|$|E
5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E

5|$|The Yorkshire {{captaincy}} {{affair of}} 1927 arose from a disagreement {{among members of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club over {{the selection of a}} new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur Lupton. The main issue was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post. It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> amateurs. At Yorkshire, a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s, on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities, although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers. None lasted long; after Lupton's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long-term basis.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it <b>should</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> {{on the right}} (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must {{be placed on the}} speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E
