Another major success was the program Su nägu kõlab tuttavalt (Your Face <b>Sounds</b> <b>Familiar),</b> a musical parody show, that premiered in April 2013 on TV3 and became an instant hit with the viewers. In 2014, he created a role in the TV movie The last round, which the cast also took to {{theatrical}} tour in 2015. Sander has often been compared to the American talk show host Conan O'Brien, based on both their physical resemblance as well as their razor sharp wit and wicked sense of humour. To this Sander has characteristically replied that Conan is obviously imitating him, as his career has been lasting twice as long as that of Conan O'Brien (even though Conan O'Brien is older, Sander began his TV career at the age of 7).|$|E

500|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Voyage Homes sound designer. He {{described}} it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many <b>sounds</b> <b>familiar</b> to Star Trek had been established—the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.—Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne, who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at {{the climax of the}} film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after more than a dozen attempts, the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural [...] "wub-wub-wub" [...] response, distorted it with [...] "just the tiniest bit of dressing", and used it as the final sound.|$|E

Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E

60|$|It was {{a stormy}} night. The rain {{cascaded}} upon the canvas in torrents, with the dull, drum-like <b>sound</b> <b>familiar</b> to dwellers in tents. As the whooping blasts charged upon it the frail structure shook and swayed and strained at its confining stakes and ropes.|$|R

60|$|At {{that moment}} there came an {{extra-heavy}} {{gust of wind}} and the steamer rocked violently. Dave was thrown on his side and fell headlong over {{the end of a}} sofa. As he went down he heard several cries, one in a voice that <b>sounded</b> <b>familiar</b> to him.|$|R

60|$|He {{was sitting}} alone in a bare little room, which communicated by a glazed door with a surgery. Hideous {{coloured}} diagrams of the ravages of hideous diseases decorated the barren buff-coloured walls. A book-case filled with dingy medical works, and ornamented at the top with a skull, {{in place of the}} customary bust; a large deal table copiously splashed with ink; wooden chairs of the sort that are seen in kitchens and cottages; a threadbare drugget {{in the middle of the}} floor; a sink of water, with a basin and waste-pipe roughly let into the wall, horribly suggestive of its connection with surgical operations--comprised the entire furniture of the room. The bees were humming among a few flowers placed in pots outside the window; the birds were singing in the garden, and the faint intermittent jingle of a tuneless piano in some neighbouring house forced itself now and again on the ear. In any other place, these everyday sounds might have spoken pleasantly of the everyday world outside. Here, they came in as intruders on a silence which nothing but human suffering had the privilege to disturb. I looked at the mahogany instrument case, and at the huge roll of lint, occupying places of their own on the book-shelves, and shuddered inwardly as I thought of the <b>sounds,</b> <b>familiar</b> and appropriate to the everyday use of Ezra Jennings' room.|$|E
