Inhibition of glial activation and inflammatory processes may represent a therapeutic target to alleviate neurodegeneration. <b>Securinine,</b> a major natural alkaloid product from the root of the plant Securinega suffruticosa, has been reported to have potent biological activity and is used in the treatment of neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, poliomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of neuroprotection elicited by <b>securinine,</b> particularly its anti-inflammatory effects in glial cells. Our results demonstrate that <b>securinine</b> significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the nitric oxide production in microglia and astrocytic cultures. In addition, <b>securinine</b> inhibited the activation of the inflammatory mediator NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated BV 2 cells. Additionally, <b>securinine</b> also inhibited interferon-γ- (IFN-γ-) induced nitric oxide levels and iNOS mRNA expression. Furthermore, conditioned media (CM) from <b>securinine</b> pretreated BV 2 cells significantly reduced mesencephalic dopaminergic neurotoxicity compared with CM from LPS stimulated microglia.

40|$|As the {{defining}} feature of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a maturation arrest, a highly desirable therapeutic {{strategy is to}} induce leukemic cell maturation. This therapeutic strategy {{has the potential of}} avoiding the significant side effects that occur with the traditional AML therapeutics.

40|$|<b>Securinine,</b> a GABA(A) {{receptor}} antagonist, {{has been}} reported to enhance monocyte cell killing of Coxiella burnetii without obvious adverse effects in vivo. We employed multiplex 2 D gel electrophoresis using Zdyes, a new generation of covalently linked fluorescent differential protein detection dyes to analyze changes in the monocyte proteome in response to <b>Securinine.</b> <b>Securinine</b> antagonism of GABA(A) receptors triggers the activation of p 38. We used the differential protein expression results to guide a search of the literature and network analysis software to construct a systems biology model of the effect of <b>Securinine</b> on monocytes. The model suggests that various metabolic modulators (fatty acid binding protein 5, inosine 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and thioredoxin) are at least partially reshaping the metabolic landscape within the monocytes. The actin bundling protein L-plastin, and the Ca(2 +) binding protein S 100 A 4 also appear to have important roles in the immune response stimulated by <b>Securinine.</b> Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP 5) may be involved in effecting lipid raft composition, inflammation, and hormonal regulation of monocytes, and the model suggests that FABP 5 may be a central regulator of metabolism in activated monocytes. The model also suggests that the heat shock proteins {{have a significant impact on}} the monocyte immune response.

40|$|The Securinega-type {{alkaloids}} {{occur in}} plants belonging to Euphorbiaceae family. One {{of the most}} widely distributed alkaloid of this group is <b>securinine,</b> which was identified next to allosecurinine in Phyllanthus glaucus (leafflower). Recently, some Securinega-type alkaloids have paid attention to its antiproliferative potency towards different cancer cells. However, the cytotoxic properties of allosecurinine have not yet been evaluated. The cytotoxicity of the extract, alkaloid fraction obtained from P. glaucus, isolated <b>securinine</b> and allosecurinine against HeLa cells was evaluated by real-time xCELLigence system and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V and 7 -amino-actinomycin (7 -AAD) staining and confirmed with fluorescent Hoechst 33342 dye. The assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the level of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2), caspase- 3 / 7 activity and cell cycle analysis were measured by flow cytometry. The enzymatic activity of caspase- 9 was assessed by a luminometric assay. The expression of apoptosis associated genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. The experimental data revealed that <b>securinine</b> and the alkaloid fraction were significantly potent on HeLa cells growth inhibition with IC 50 values of 7. 02 ± 0. 52 μg/ml (32. 3 μM) and 25. 46 ± 1. 79 μg/ml, respectively. The activity of allosecurinine and Phyllanthus extract were much lower. Furthermore, our study showed that the most active <b>securinine</b> induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the tested cells, increased the percentage of ROS positive cells and depolarized cells as well as stimulated the activity of ERK 1 / 2, caspase- 9 and - 3 / 7. <b>Securinine</b> also induced cell cycle arrest in S phase. Real-time PCR analysis showed high expression of TNFRSF genes in the cells stimulated with <b>securinine.</b> <b>Securinine</b> induces apoptosis and activates cell cycle checkpoints in HeLa cells which is associated with oxidative stress.

40|$|Abstract: Innate immune cell {{stimulation}} repre-sents {{a complementary}} approach to vaccines and antimicrobial drugs to counter infectious disease. We have used assays of macrophage activation and in vitro and in vivo phase II Coxiella burnetii in-fection models to {{compare and contrast}} the activity of a novel innate immune cell agonist, <b>securinine,</b> with known TLR agonists. As expected, TLR ago-nists, such as LPS (TLR 4) and fibroblast-stimulat-ing lipopeptide- 1 (FSL- 1; TLR 2), induced macro-phage activation and increased macrophage killing of phase II C. burnetii in vitro. FSL- 1 also induced accelerated killing of C. burnetii in vivo. Securi-nine, a -aminobutyric acid type A receptor antag-onist, was found to induce TLR-independent mac-rophage activation in vitro, leading to IL- 8 secre-tion, L-selectin down-regulation, and CD 11 b and MHC Class II antigen up-regulation. As seen with the TLR agonists, <b>securinine</b> also induced acceler-ated macrophage killing of C. burnetii in vitro and in vivo. In summary, as predicted by the literature, TLR agonists enhance macrophage killing of phase II C. burnetii in vitro, and at least for TLR 2 ago-nists, this activity occurs in vivo as well. <b>Securinine</b> represents a novel macrophage agonist, which has similar effects as TLR agonists in this model yet apparently, does not act through known TLRs. Se-curinine has minimal toxicity in vivo, suggesting it or structurally similar compounds may represent novel, therapeutic adjuvants, which increase resis-tance to intracellular pathogens. J. Leukoc.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel synthetic route towards the Securinega alkaloids, <b>securinine</b> 1 and virosecurinine 2. The key reaction in this innovative approach is the l, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition between pyridinium stabilised ylides 169 and γ,δ-unsaturated butenolides 142, to form spirocyclic dihydropyridines 168 as single diastereoisomers. The Introduction chapter introduces the Securinega alkaloids and describes previous syntheses of <b>securinine</b> 1. This section also reports on developments in the field of l, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition chemistry, with particular emphasis on the cycloadditions of pyridinium stabilised ylides 169. Cycloadditions of γ,δ -unsaturated butenolides 142 with azomethine and other ylides are also described. The Results and Discussion section describes investigations which were conducted towards the total synthesis of <b>securinine</b> 1 and virosecurinine 2. A number of routes to γ,δ -unsaturated butenolides 191 were evaluated and are discussed. The optimum route was found to be a three step procedure from propargyl alcohols 193, via Johnson-Claisen rearrangement to 13 - allenic esters, which were hydrolysed and then cyclised under transition metal catalysis. γ,δ -unsaturated butenolides 191 were then employed in l, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions with pyridinium stabilised ylides 169. Dihydropyridines 168 formed in the cycloaddition step were found to be unstable and as such, strategies for the stabilisation of these compounds are discussed. Reduction afforded stable intermediates 229 prompting investigation to deliver intermediates {{that could be used to}} carry out the remaining cyclisation required for the synthesis of tetracyclic structures. Attempts at a variety of such ring closing reactions are described, the most advanced intermediates being committed to an intramolecular Heck reaction. Finally, expansion of the scope of the key cycloaddition reaction is described and opportunities for further developments are discussed. The Experimental section describes all procedures which were used to synthesise compounds disclosed in this thesis. Full spectroscopic data and characterisation is also provided.

HIE may have beneficial effects on type 1 and 2 diabetes, as the mechanism of development of both the diabetes involve oxidative stress. However, the animal model used represents only type 1 diabetes. Traditional plant remedies have been used in the treatment of diabetes but only a few have been scientifically evaluated [24]. Methanolic extract of H. indicus roots contained high quantity of flavanoid and triterpenoid than phenolic content and contributes to the observed antioxidant potential of the extract. The LC-MS analysis coupled with putative identification of compounds indicated the presence of phenolic and flavanoids such as DL- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl glycol, catechin, amiloxate (cinnamic acid derivative); 4 -methyldaphnetin (coumarin), terpenoid such as punctaporin B and podocarpatriene derivative.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite that infects warm blooded animals {{the world}} over. In the host, the parasite exists as either rapidly growing tachyzoites or immunologically protected slowly dividing bradyzoites. While tachyzoites are generally cleared by the host 2 ̆ 7 s immune system, bradyzoites persist for life. If {{the immune system}} becomes compromised, bradyzoites reconvert to tachyzoites and cause severe illness. Bradyzoites develop in response to stressful stimuli, therefore discovering factors that modulate bradyzoite conversion as well as determining how Toxoplasma 2 ̆ 7 s stress response pathways operate are essential to understanding parasite disease. In this work, the plant alkaloid <b>securinine</b> as well as ten pyrrolidine derivatives were shown to have in vitro anti-Toxoplasma activity in the micromolar range. These compounds act in different capacities, either restricting parasite 2 ̆ 7 s invasion or by reducing the parasite 2 ̆ 7 s rate of replication. One {{of the hallmarks of}} the bradyzoite life stage is slowed replication. When tested, only <b>securinine</b> induced bradyzoite formation at comparable levels to treatment with alkaline media, suggesting that it initiates a stressful stimulus. When in the bradyzoite stage, Toxoplasma induces a global translational repression allowing for the remodeling of the transcriptome. However it remains unclear how certain transcripts are maintained throughout the long term translational repression seen in bradyzoites. Analysis of one such transcript, lactate dehydrogenase 1, showed a 40 nucleotide cis-acting element with its 52 ̆ 7 UTR responsible for this activity. The formation of 16 nucleotide regulatory RNA hairpin is necessary for inducing sustained translational repression in bradyzoites, suggesting that it acts as a recognizable feature. Characterization of the transcript reveals that its poly(A) tail does not shorten in bradyzoites, indicating that it is likely targeted for long term storage instead of degraded under stress. Efforts were made to capture and analyse the protein complement interacting with the cis-acting element using RNA aptamer technologies, however they were unfruitful. Using extracellular parasites, it was determined that a rapid induction of stress is insufficient to selectively repress the transcript. This suggests that the reprogramming of the proteome may be necessary for the sustained translational repression of lactate dehydrogenase 1 in Toxoplasma bradyzoites...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNew Reactions and Synthetic Strategies toward Indolizidine Alkaloids and Pallavicinia DiterpenesbyAlison Rae Hardin NarayanDoctor of Philosophy in ChemistryUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Richmond Sarpong, ChairStrategies toward indolizidine {{alkaloids}} and pallavicinia diterpenes {{have been}} established. The first six chapters of this thesis {{are devoted to}} the development and execution of approaches toward N-fused bicycles and their application to the synthesis of indolizidine alkaloids. The final chapter details efforts toward the synthesis of pallavicinin and related diterpenes. An overview of the indolizidine alkaloids is provided, including the major structural distinctions of the subclasses of these alkaloids {{as well as their}} known biological activity. This sets the stage for a discussion of our synthetic approach toward this class of natural products, aiming to build these molecules from indolizine and indolizinone precursors. Several methods were developed to rapidly access indolizines and indolizinones. Specifically, the platinum-catalyzed cycloisomerization of propargylic esters to 2, 3 -disubstituted indolizines was realized. The nuances of the effect of the substrate's electronic properties on the reaction pathway were studied and this knowledge was utilized to develop a reaction selective for the formation of 2, 3 -disubstituted indolizines over the 1, 3 -disubstituted products. Subsequently, a metal-free version of a previously established metal-catalyzed cyclization was identified for the formation of 1, 3 -disubstituted indolizines and indolizinones. With methods in place to form substituted indolizines and indolizinones, these bicycles were employed in the synthesis of indolizidine alkaloids. First, indolizine precursors were used to accomplish a five-step total synthesis of indolizidine 209 D and a formal synthesis of <b>securinine.</b> Next, the innate reactivity of indolizinones was explored and applied to the synthesis of tricyclic marine alkaloids. From indolizinone building blocks, two routes were established to the tricyclic cylindricine core. The first approach toward the cylindricines featured a ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis to assemble the cis- 6, 6 -ring fusion conserved throughout this family of natural products. The second approach toward the cylindricines employed a ring-contractive cyclization to form a tricyclic indolizinone, which served as a common intermediate to both the cylindricine and the closely related lepadiformine alkaloids. The ring-contractive cyclization approach led to the synthesis of the cylindricine core in eight steps. Additionally, progress toward lepadiformine C from an intermediate accessed in the cylindricine synthesis has been achieved. Finally, a strategy toward pallavicinin and related diterpenes has been tested. The approach features a gold-catalyzed cyclization to construct the [3. 2. 1]bicycle of pallavicinin and an Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement to form a key carbon-carbon bond. This strategy has been successful for the formation of the 8, 9 -epi,epi-pallavicinin tetracycle...|$|E
