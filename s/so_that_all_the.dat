Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> states would endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving him just more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|Financing of {{the venue}} was officially {{granted by the}} Parliament of Norway in April 1990. The International Skating Union wanted to locate all skating in Hamar, and in October 1990, LOOC {{confirmed}} that they would reallocate the events <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> all skating events would take place in Hamar, and that a separate Olympic Village would be built in Hamar for skaters. The original plans for the Olympic Amphitheatre called for a capacity for 4,500 and construction to cost NOK65. By June 1991, LOOC decided to {{increase the size of}} the venue, as IOC would only allow the venue host figure skating if its spectator capacity was raised to 6,000. Financing of the expansion was granted in August, with the cost rising to NOK83.3 million. Early plans called for the venue to be built in concrete, but a research project coordinated by the Norwegian Institute of Technology made it possible to cover the venue's exterior and interior in wood panel. This solution was hailed as aesthetical by architects, and as a technical innovation by the Norwegian construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as {{he was too busy}} with other engineering projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the Muslim Wakf {{authority}} {{controlling the}} Islamic structures atop the Temple Mount began illegally excavating {{large amounts of}} fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf would put it, restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque. Material dug from the site was dumped in the Kidron Valley, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> important information {{which could have been}} acquired through proper excavation of the material in its archaeological context has been lost forever. Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E
5|$|September 3rd – I {{went and}} saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – I went this morning on foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, {{one of the most}} antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E

25|$|Where such a {{restriction}} {{is imposed}} in a one-innings game, {{it is said}} to be a limited overs match.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, an {{official}} Lebanese government report stated that the total number of casualties for these battles was put at 3,781 dead and 6,787 injured in the fighting between Amal and the Palestinians. Furthermore, the number of Palestinians killed in inter-factional clashes between pro-Syrian and pro-Arafat organizations was around 2,000. The real number is probably higher because thousands of Palestinians were not registered in Lebanon and the blockade meant that no officials could access the camps, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> casualties could not be counted.|$|E

25|$|What was {{at stake}} in this debate, which pitted the {{administration}} against the grantees {{at the end of}} the 1820s and the beginning of the next decade, was whether there remained land to be distributed. The authorities wished to open new concessions in the Cirque of Salazie, which was done in 1830, but also in the heart of La Plaine-des-Palmistes and of the Plaine des Cafres, which happened in 1834. The farmers considered that their parcels extended up to the summit of the island's highest mountain, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> concessions met at a single point.|$|E
