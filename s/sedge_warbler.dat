5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler</b> also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
25|$|Otters have {{recently}} recolonised {{the upper reaches}} of the river, however the water vole is now confined to a few isolated populations. Notable species of invertebrates include uncommon mayflies. There is a diverse breeding bird community including lapwing, snipe and redshank. Wildfowl such as mallard and mute swans may also be seen, along with yellow wagtail, <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler,</b> reed warbler and reed bunting.|$|E
500|$|The main reedbed on {{the site}} is known as Newlands, an {{extensive}} area forming {{the eastern end of}} the reserve. [...] Together with other areas in the West Marsh, the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares (61 acres). A wind-powered water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare (22 acre) area near the Visitor Centre. This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1,200 hectare (3,000 acres) of reedbed nationwide. The reedbeds support a number of acrocephalid warblers such as the reed warbler, <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler</b> and marsh warbler as well as others such as grasshopper warbler, {{and it was the first}} recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti's warbler. There is a long-term plan to have an endangered species, the Eurasian bittern, breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred, with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009. [...] A new hide overlooking Newlands, named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009, was opened in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Summer migrant species include: the swift, swallow and martin; willow, <b>sedge</b> and {{grasshopper}} <b>warbler,</b> blackcap and chiffchaff. Exotic sightings include cuckoos, white stork, {{black swan}} and a flamingo.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has long}} been a pool on the {{northern}} part of the site and this has attracted some birds as it is currently one of the few standing open waters in East Lothian. Waterbirds regularly seen here include mute swan*, mallard*, common teal, wigeon, tufted duck, little grebe*, moorhen* and coot* (* confirmed breeding since 2008 [...] ). Gadwall also bred in 2012 with two broods seen in 2014. Regular counts are undertaken for BTO Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) monitoring. [...] Other characteristic birds of the site include grey partridge*, common kestrel, common buzzard, stock dove, skylark*, common grasshopper <b>warbler,</b> <b>sedge</b> warbler*, tree sparrow, reed bunting* and yellowhammer*, with altogether 29 species confirmed to breed in the period 2008-2013, with 17 [...] "probable" [...] breeders and a further 9 [...] "possible" [...] breeders (using BTO Atlas classifications [...] ). Scarcer species recorded include little egret, northern shoveler, greater scaup, smew (drake plus 3 redheads, Feb 2012), marsh harrier (occasional extended presence), common quail, wood sandpiper, spotted redshank, black-tailed godwit, short-eared owl and barn owl. There is rich insect fauna too with nine species of dragonfly and damselfly having been recorded including red-veined darter and there is a colony of grayling and narrow-bordered five-spot burnet moth, which is currently on the edge of its UK range in this part of Scotland (photo, right).|$|R
2500|$|The area to {{the west}} of the Gowy, {{including}} the westernmost bridge, has been converted into a nature reserve which is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust in an agreement with Grosvenor (Eaton) Estates. [...] The nature reserve covers an area of about [...] and access is by permit only. The reserve includes a trail (the Mill Trail), and habitats include a poplar plantation, reedbed and species-rich wet meadows. The poplar plantation is sparse and its wet nature has created an unusual stand of common reed at the ground layer. The reserve is also rich in bird life, with over 64 species recorded, including three species of summer visiting warblers, including <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler.</b> Otters have been recorded along the banks of the Gowy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{western edge}} of Coimbra is covered by the Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila (Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve), which is {{designated}} both as a Special Protection Zone (...) and Special Conservation Zone (...) , coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Paul de Arzila or marsh of Arzila). It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and the Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.|$|E
60|$|It is rightly classed by F. and Y. {{with the}} Warblers. Gould strangely puts {{it with his}} rock-birds, 'saxicolinæ,'--in which, however, he also {{includes}} the <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
60|$|A mocking-bird (Mimus orpheus), {{called by}} the {{inhabitants}} Calandria, is remarkable, from possessing a song far superior to {{that of any other}} bird in the country: indeed, it is nearly the only bird in South America which I have observed to take its stand for the purpose of singing. The song may be compared to that of the <b>Sedge</b> <b>warbler,</b> but is more powerful; some harsh notes and some very high ones, being mingled with a pleasant warbling. It is heard only during the spring. At other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious. Near Maldonado these birds were tame and bold; they constantly attended the country houses in numbers, to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or walls: if any other small bird joined the feast, the Calandria soon chased it away. On the wide uninhabited plains of Patagonia another closely allied species, O. Patagonica of d'Orbigny, which frequents the valleys clothed with spiny bushes, is a wilder bird, and has a slightly different tone of voice. It appears to me a curious circumstance, as showing the fine shades of difference in habits, that judging from this latter respect alone, when I first saw this second species, I thought it was different from the Maldonado kind. Having afterwards procured a specimen, and comparing the two without particular care, they appeared so very similar, that I changed my opinion; but now Mr. Gould says that they are certainly distinct; a conclusion in conformity with the trifling difference of habit, of which, however, he was not aware.|$|E

60|$|Just out {{of hearing}} of the {{grasshopper}} warblers, there was a good-sized pool {{of water on the}} common, probably an old gravel-pit, its bottom now overgrown with rushes. A <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler,</b> the only one on the common, lived in the masses of bramble and gorse on its banks; and birds of so many kinds came to it to drink and bathe that the pool became a favourite spot with me. One evening, just before sunset, as I lingered near it, a pied wagtail darted out of some low scrub at my feet and fluttered, as if wounded, over the turf for a space of ten or twelve yards before flying away. Not many minutes after seeing the wagtail, a reed-bunting--a bird which I had not previously observed on the common--flew down and alighted on a bush a few yards from me, holding a white crescent-shaped grub in its beak. I stood still to watch it, certainly not expecting to see its nest and young; for, as a rule, a bird with food in its beak will sit quietly until the watcher loses patience and moves away; but on this occasion I had not been standing more than ten seconds before the bunting flew down to a small tuft of furze and was there greeted by the shrill, welcoming cries of its young. I went up softly to the spot, when out sprang the old bird I had seen, but only to drop to the ground just as the wagtail had done, to beat the turf with its wings, then to lie gasping for breath, then to flutter on a little further, until at last it rose up and flew to a bush.|$|E
6000|$|To {{some who}} have glanced at a little dusty, out of shape mummy of a bird, {{labelled}} [...] "Dartford Warbler," [...] in a museum, or private collection, or under a glass shade, it may seem that I speak too warmly of the pleasure which {{the sight of the}} small furze-lover can give us. They have never seen it in a state of nature, and probably never will. When I consider all these British Passeres, which, seen at their best, give most delight to the æsthetic sense--the jay, the [...] "British Bird of Paradise," [...] as I have ventured to call it, displaying his vari-coloured feathers at a spring-time gathering; the yellow-green, long-winged wood wren, most aërial and delicate of the woodland warblers; the kingfisher, flashing turquoise blue as he speeds by; the elegant fawn-coloured, black-bearded tit, clinging to the grey-green, swaying reeds, and springing from them with a bell-like note; and the rose-tinted narrow-shaped bottle-tit as he drifts by overhead in a flock; the bright, lively goldfinch scattering the silvery thistle-down on the air; the crossbill, that quaint little many-coloured parrot of the north, feeding on a pine-cone; the grey wagtail exhibiting his graceful motions; and the golden-crested wren, seen suspended motionless with swiftly vibrating wings above his mate concealed among the clustering leaves, in appearance a great green hawk-moth, his opened and flattened crest a shining, flame-coloured disc or shield on his head,--when I consider all these, and others, I find that the peculiar charm of each does not exceed in degree that of the furze wren--seen at his best. He is of the type of the white-throat, but idealised; the familiar brown, excitable Sylvia, pretty as he is and welcome to our hedges in April, is in appearance but a rough study for the smaller, more delicately-fashioned and richly-coloured Melizophilus, or furze-lover. On account of his excessive rarity he can now be seen at his best only by those who are able to spend many days in searching and in watching, who have the patience to sit motionless by the hour; and at length the little hideling, tired of concealment or overcome by curiosity, shows himself and comes nearer and nearer, until the ruby red of the small gem-like eye may been seen without aid to the vision. A sprite-like bird in his slender exquisite shape and his beautiful fits of excitement; fantastic in his motions as he flits and flies from spray to spray, now hovering motionless in the air like the wooing gold-crest, anon dropping on a perch, to sit jerking his long tail, his crest raised, his throat swollen, chiding when he sings and singing when he chides, like a refined and lesser <b>sedge</b> <b>warbler</b> in a frenzy, his slate-black and chestnut-red plumage showing rich and dark against the pure luminous yellow of the massed furze blossoms. It is a sight of fairy-like bird life and of flower which cannot soon be forgotten. And I do not think that any man who has in him any love of nature and of the beautiful can see such a thing, and exist with its image in his mind, and not regard with an extreme bitterness of hatred those among us whose particular craze it is to [...] "collect" [...] such creatures, thereby depriving us and our posterity of the delight the sight of them affords.|$|E
