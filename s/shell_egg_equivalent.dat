40|$|ABSTRACT The {{suitability}} of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> as a calcium source in layer diets was examined by comparing pulverized and crushed sterilized <b>egg</b> <b>shells</b> against oyster shell, limestone grit, and pulverized limestone, as calcium supplements. These calcium sources were fed in appropri-ate amounts to obtain diets with 3 % total calcium. Breaking {{strength of the}} eggs, determined at 90 and ISO days of feeding, showed that eggs from the hens fed the diets containing oyster <b>shell,</b> pulverized <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> and limestone grit were significantly stronger (P< 0. 01) than eggs from hens fed diets containing pulverized limestone as the calcium source. Crushed <b>egg</b> <b>shells</b> as a dietary source of supplemental calcium promoted <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> quality <b>equivalent</b> to that obtained with pulverized limestone. The results of a second experiment indicated that oyster shell pro-duces a greater improvement in the shell quality of the second, third and subsequent eggs in the clutch than it does upon the first egg in the clutch. These {{results indicated that the}} pres-ence of particles of calcium carbonate in the diet are more important for hens in very high production than for those in low egg production. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that most of the changes responsible for differences in shell breaking strength apparently take place in the palisade layer, while the mammillary layer remains approximately constant. I t appeared that the palisade layer contributes most of the strength in the shell. As the palisade layer decreased in thickness and in concentration, there was a closely predictable decrease in breaking strength of the eggs. Evidence was ob-tained indicating a poor correlation between breaking strength and total shell thickness. Breaking strength is a superior measure of <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> quality because it takes into consideration both the thickness and the concentration of the palisade layer around the crystalline mam-millary portion of the <b>egg</b> <b>shell...</b>|$|R

Gluten-free rolls containing 30 % of fresh <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> or <b>equivalent</b> of <b>egg</b> products and 10 % of CGF on a flour basis were evaluated against a control (no egg, no CGF). The feasibility of partial baking of rolls was studied on control as well as fresh eggs and carob germ flour formulas during 5 baking times (0, 8, 10, 12 and 18 minutes). Breads were evaluated for crumb and crust color, specific volume, cell profile, Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and consumer acceptability. Results showed that rolls containing egg ingredients had higher specific volumes than control (p< 0. 05) with an increase from 1. 45 cm[superscript] 3 /g to 1. 96 cm[superscript] 3 /g. Carob germ flour did not {{have a significant effect on}} specific volume. Eggs also improved cell elongation and produced significantly darker crust (p< 0. 05).

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of different combination calcium sources and particle size on performance and <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> quality in layer hens. In the experiment, 198 brown laying hens at 44 week of age were randomly assigned into 11 treatments groups. The experimental diets consisted of different calcium sources (Fine limestone, large limestone, large oyster <b>shell</b> and large <b>egg</b> <b>shell)</b> and their different combination. The experimental unit consisted of a groups of three hens, thus each treatment was replicated six times. Different calcium sources and particle size addition to the laying hens diet had no significantly effect on body weight gain, egg production, egg mass, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, egg specific gravity, <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> weight, <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> thickness and <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> breaking strength but egg weight had significantly affected by the treatments. The significantly highest egg weight was found in laying hens fed with 50 % fine limestone and 50 % large limestone. Dietary different Ca sources had a significant effect on Ca, P and Mg as mineral contents of eggshell and tibia. In the present study, when dietary large calcium sources (limestone, oyster <b>shell</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>shell)</b> had no effect on performance and eggshell quality parameters in laying hens. However, dietary containing at least 50 % large calcium sources had positive effect on mineral contents of tibia...|$|R
