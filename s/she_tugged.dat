60|$|A pretty {{position}} was this for me!--luckily it endured not. The girl roused herself from her momentary weakness, and, seizing the cord, <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> it violently. The coach drew up.|$|E
50|$|On Guy Fawkes Night, Jodie {{climbs up}} to the tower of the gothic building, dressed as a ghost. While the window is open, <b>she</b> <b>tugs</b> at her hair too hard, falls out of the tower, causing her neck to break and die tragically.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Smith {{published}} Artful, a book {{based on}} her lectures on European comparative literature delivered the previous year at Saint Anne's College, Oxford. Much more than a work of literary criticism, it is a book about what art can do. Artful was well-received, with one reviewer commenting that, [...] "...her new book, in which <b>she</b> <b>tugs</b> at God’s sleeve, ruminates on clowns, shoplifts used books, dabbles in Greek and palavers with the dead, is a stunner." ...|$|R
60|$|She swept {{down the}} steps and passed him. Before he could reach her side <b>she</b> was <b>tugging</b> at the handle of the {{carriage}} door.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no getting}} away, {{but she was}} very indignant. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> at her aunt's hand more than perhaps she knew, and there was {{something}} of a flouncing as she flung into the drawing-room and demanded--- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{some people}} had as much brains as a horse," [...] muttered Miss Calthea, [...] "it {{would be better for}} them. Back, Sultan! Do you hear me! Back!" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> with all her {{strength}} upon the reins.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but please, you mustn't!' <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> at the car's side. 'Wouldn't {{you like}} some flowers or some orchids? We've really splendid orchids, and'--she clasped her hands--'there are Japanese goldfish--real Japanese goldfish, with four tails. If you don't care for 'em, perhaps your friends or somebody--oh, please!' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had brought}} in two cups, two plates. For herself, a {{straight}} chair, but for the guest the big wing-chair, which <b>she</b> pantingly <b>tugged</b> to the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>tugging</b> at a knot. [...] "Buckingham {{has been}} wanting a {{sacrifice}} {{ever since he}} killed Wettin, that he might slay my mother and take Victory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{other girls}} said," [...] <b>she</b> began, <b>tugging</b> at the button, [...] "that you was a 'cirkiss'"--another tug--"'a nigger minstrel'"--and a third tug--"'a agent with samples'--but that showed all they knew!" ...|$|R
60|$|Quickly {{she came}} to his side and motioned him to rise while <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> at the knots which held the bonds in place about his arms. Once she stopped long enough to recross the room {{and close the door}} which she had left open when she entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} too provoking," [...] said Katherine, as <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> at an obstinate shawl strap, [...] "that Ned should be {{transferred}} here now, just when I'm going away. The {{powers that be}} might have waited until vacation was over. Ned won't know a soul here and he'll be horribly lonesome." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{helped them}} to move Adolph into the kitchen. The man {{was in such a}} funk that he would not use his legs. He was heavy, and smelled of sweat and the stable. But she put her arm about his waist, her sleek head by his chest; <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> at him; she clicked her tongue in {{imitation}} of Kennicott's cheerful noises.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] <b>she</b> cried, <b>tugging</b> at his arm. [...] "I {{know the}} man: he will kill you. Come, for the Virgin's sake, or for my sake, for I cannot go {{and leave you}} here." ...|$|R
50|$|Assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron under Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter, Dahlia was {{put into}} service with Acting Ensign T. Wright in command. <b>She</b> {{provided}} <b>tug</b> services in the Mississippi River and its tributaries until 17 August 1865.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely <b>she's</b> a <b>tug</b> what's got {{blown out}} to sea," [...] Bob replied {{as he went}} into the cabin for a glass; and when he came on deck again the boys waited impatiently to learn what could be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's settled: Thursday afternoon. We must wrap up," [...] {{she called}} gaily through her {{descending}} veil. [...] "This treacherous month! It {{has come in}} like a lamb, but"--and <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> at her gloves, still scrutinizing me fixedly beneath her eyelids, [...] "but it will probably go out like a lion." [...] As if to illustrate this prediction, she swept away to the door, leaving Mrs Bowater's little parlour and myself to gather our scattered wits together as best we could, while her carriage rolled away.|$|E
60|$|After which, <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> at {{his coat}} with both hands, {{and pulled him}} all askew in {{buttoning}} that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket, and then tied her dimples into her bonnet-strings in a very knowing way, and took him back to London. Arrived at Mr Boffin's door, she set him with his back against it, tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles for her purpose, and kissed him until he knocked muffled double {{knocks at the door}} {{with the back of his}} head. That done, she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her {{as though she was}} an {{agreeable}} discovery. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> her hand free and fluttered, [...] "I must go out to the kitchen and help Mrs. Marbury." [...] She did not speak to him again till, after she had heated the rolls and passed the paper napkins, Mr. Marbury captured her with a loud, [...] "Oh, quit fussing now. Come over here and sit down and tell us how's tricks." [...] He herded her to a sofa with Dr. Kennicott, who was rather vague about the eyes, rather drooping of bulky shoulder, as though he was wondering what he was expected to do next. As their host left them, Kennicott awoke: ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{overhaul}} at Norfolk Navy Yard {{in early}} 1865, Martin {{returned to the}} sounds of North Carolina, in late February. <b>She</b> continued <b>tug</b> and picket duties through May before sailing north in June, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for decommissioning. Martin was sold there 10 August.|$|R
60|$|Gavin {{arrived at}} the well in time to offer Babbie the loan of his arms. In her {{struggle}} she had taken her lips into her mouth, but in vain did <b>she</b> <b>tug</b> at the stone, which refused {{to do more than}} turn round on the wood. But for her presence, the minister's efforts would have been equally futile. Though not strong, however, he had the national horror of being beaten before a spectator, and once at school he had won a fight by telling his big antagonist to come on until the boy was tired of pummelling him. As he fought with the stone now, pains shot through his head, and his arms threatened to come away at the shoulders; but remove it he did.|$|R
50|$|USS Glance (1863) was a {{steamship}} {{acquired by}} the Union Navy during the American Civil War.

60|$|Shortly he {{was joined}} by Mrs. Goldy. Compared with her {{handsome}} husband she was very modestly dressed. She wore more brown than black, and where the orange color appeared it was rather dull. She {{wasted no time in}} singing. Almost instantly her sharp eyes spied a piece of string caught in the bushes almost over Peter's head. With a little cry of delight she flew down and seized it. But the string was caught, and though <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> and pulled with all her might she couldn't get it free. Goldy saw the trouble she was having and cutting his song short, flew down to help her. Together they pulled and tugged and tugged and pulled, until they had to stop to rest and get their breath.|$|E
60|$|Then the overpowering {{scent of}} the blossom began to make her head reel. How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white {{inflorescence}} swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must not. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had panted {{for a moment in}} the fresh air, she had a brilliant inspiration. She caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows {{at the end of the}} green-house. Then she re-entered. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> now with renewed strength at Wedderburn's motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor. It still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open air.|$|E
60|$|It {{was said}} that the line that day was three miles long, {{reaching}} from the high ground {{on the right of}} where the people stood to the turnpike road on the left. After the review came a sham fight, during which action the crowd dispersed more widely over the downs, enabling Widow Garland to get still clearer glimpses of the King, and his handsome charger, {{and the head of the}} Queen, and the elbows and shoulders of the princesses in the carriages, and fractional parts of General Garth and the Duke of Cumberland; which sights gave her great gratification. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> at her daughter at every opportunity, exclaiming, 'Now you can see his feather!' 'There's her hat!' 'There's her Majesty's India muslin shawl!' in a minor form of ecstasy, that made the miller think her more girlish and animated than her daughter Anne.|$|E
5000|$|... “In {{her long}} public career {{she had learned}} great {{efficiency}} and … she never let our witnesses run over their time. Just as we were swinging along briskly <b>she</b> invariably <b>tugged</b> at a coat and passed over a little slip - ‘time up in one minute.’” ...|$|R
5000|$|USS Awatobi (YTB-264) was a harbor tugboat {{acquired}} by the U.S. Navy during the close of World War II. She was outfitted with two [...]50-caliber machine guns and assigned to the San Francisco Bay area where <b>she</b> provided <b>tug</b> services, and other harbor services as required.|$|R
50|$|On 6 November she {{captured}} and burned the schooner Ada at Corrotman Creek and, on the 8th, seized the ammunition storage ship Urbana. At midmonth she {{was ordered to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, where <b>she</b> assumed <b>tug</b> and patrol duties which took her into 1862. In October 1862 she moved up to Washington, D.C. for repairs, after which she got underway for Port Royal, South Carolina, and duty in Samuel Francis Du Pont's squadron, then blockading Charleston, South Carolina. Rescue arrived at Port Royal early in November. Through the summer of 1863, <b>she</b> performed <b>tug</b> and patrol duties in the anchorage area and in September shifted to Charleston. In October she returned to Port Royal to continue tug and patrol duties there until June 1864 when she was ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs.|$|R
6000|$|That {{night there}} was little rest on board the Pharos. Everyone who has been [...] "at sea" [...] {{knows what it is}} to lie in one's berth on a stormy night, with the planks of the deck only a few inches from one's nose, and the water swashing past the little port that always leaks; the seas {{striking}} against the ship; the heavy sprays falling on the decks; and the constant rattle and row of blocks, spars, and cordage overhead. But all this was as nothing compared with the state of things on board the floating light, for that vessel could not rise to the seas with the comparatively free motions of a ship, sailing either with or against the gale. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> and strained at her cable, as if with the fixed determination of breaking it, and she offered all the opposition of a fixed body to the seas.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Pull, Maiwa, pull,' I gasped, and she {{certainly}} did pull. Maiwa {{was a very}} muscular woman, and never before did I appreciate {{the advantages of the}} physical development of females so keenly. <b>She</b> <b>tugged</b> at my left arm, the savage below tugged at my right leg, till I began to realize that something must give way ere long. Luckily I retained my presence of mind, like the man who threw his mother-in-law out of the window, and carried the mattress down-stairs, when a fire broke out in his house. My right hand was still free, and in it I held my revolver, which was secured to my wrist by a leather thong. The pistol was cocked, and I simply pointed it downwards and fired. The result was instantaneous--and so far as I am concerned, most satisfactory. The bullet hit the man beneath me somewhere, I am sure I don't know where; at any rate, he let go of my leg and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath to join Gobo. In another moment I was {{on the top of the}} rock, and going up the remaining steps like a lamplighter. A single other soldier appeared in pursuit, but one of my boys at the top fired my elephant gun at him. I don't know if he hit him or only frightened him; at any rate, he vanished whence he came. I do know, however, that he very nearly hit me, for I felt the wind of the bullet.|$|E
6000|$|This {{afternoon}} I was the {{not altogether}} passive spectator of a curious scene in natural history. My feet encased in stout [...] "tackety" [...] boots, I had waded down two of Waster Lunny's fields to the glen burn: in summer the never-failing larder from which, with wriggling worm or garish fly, I can any morning whip a savoury breakfast; in the winter-time {{the only thing}} in the valley that defies the ice-king's chloroform. I watched the water twisting black and solemn through the snow, the ragged ice on its edge proof of the toughness of the struggle with the frost, from which it has, after all, crept only half victorious. A bare wild rosebush on the further bank was violently agitated, and then there ran from its root a black-headed rat with wings. Such was the general effect. I was not less interested when my startled eyes divided this phenomenon into its component parts, and recognized in the disturbance on the opposite bank only another fierce struggle among the hungry animals for existence: they need no professor to teach them the doctrine of the survival of the fittest. A weasel had gripped a water-hen (whit-rit and beltie they are called in these parts) cowering {{at the root of the}} rose-bush, and was being dragged down the bank by the terrified bird, which made for the water as its only chance of escape. In less disadvantageous circumstances the weasel would have made short work of his victim; but as he only had the bird by the tail, the prospects of the combatants were equalized. It was the tug-of-war being played with a life as the stakes. [...] "If I do not reach the water," [...] was the argument that went on in the heaving little breast of the one, [...] "I am a dead bird." [...] "If this water-hen," [...] reasoned the other, [...] "reaches the burn, my supper vanishes with her." [...] Down the sloping bank the hen had distinctly the best of it, but after that came a yard of level snow, and here <b>she</b> <b>tugged</b> and screamed in vain. I had so far been an unobserved spectator; but my sympathies were with the beltie, and, thinking it high time to interfere, I jumped into the water. The water-hen gave one mighty final tug and toppled into the burn; while the weasel viciously showed me his teeth, and then stole slowly up the bank to the rose-bush, whence, [...] "girning," [...] he watched me lift his exhausted victim from the water, and set off with her for the schoolhouse. Except for her draggled tail, she already looks wonderfully composed, and so long as the frost holds I shall have little difficulty in keeping her with me. On Sunday I found a frozen sparrow, whose heart had almost ceased to beat, in the disused pig-sty, and put him for warmth into my breast-pocket. The ungrateful little scrub bolted without a word of thanks about ten minutes afterwards to the alarm of my cat, which had not known his whereabouts.|$|E
