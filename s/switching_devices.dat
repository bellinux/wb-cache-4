25|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, capacitors {{are used for}} power factor correction. Such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase load. Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads {{but rather as a}} reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (var). The purpose is to counteract inductive loading from devices like electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive. Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic <b>switching</b> <b>devices)</b> may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility substation.|$|E
500|$|Conceptually, {{perhaps the}} {{simplest}} switched capacitor configuration is that shown schematically in figure 5. [...] Here two capacitors are simultaneously charged {{to the same}} voltage in parallel. [...] The supply is then switched off and the capacitors are switched into series. [...] The output is taken from across the two capacitors in series resulting in an output double the supply voltage. [...] There are many different <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> {{that could be used}} in such a circuit, but in integrated circuits MOSFET devices are frequently employed.|$|E

The circuit also includes a storage circuit for storing energy. The storage circuit has a resonating frequency. A controller is provided for operating the <b>switching</b> <b>device.</b> In operation, energy is transferred from the energy storage device to the storage circuit while the <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> is in the open state, and returned from the storage circuit to the energy storage <b>device</b> while the <b>switching</b> <b>device</b> is in the closed state. This energy transfer causes warming of the energy storage device...|$|R

500|$|It is {{possible}} to use the simple diode-capacitor circuits described above to double the voltage of a DC source by preceding the voltage doubler with a chopper circuit. [...] In effect, this converts the DC to AC before application to the voltage doubler. [...] More efficient circuits can be built by driving the <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> from an external clock so that both functions, the chopping and multiplying, are achieved simultaneously. [...] Such circuits are known as switched capacitor circuits. [...] This approach is especially useful in low-voltage battery-powered applications where integrated circuits require a voltage supply greater than the battery can deliver. [...] Frequently, a clock signal is readily available on board the integrated circuit and little or no additional circuitry is needed to generate it.|$|E
500|$|VFDs are {{available}} with voltage and current ratings covering {{a wide range of}} single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690V. While motor-application LV drives {{are available}} in ratings of up to the order of 5or6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. [...] Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> such that any given voltage rating is {{greater than or equal to}} one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16kV (60Hz) or 3.3/6.6kV (50Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12kV switching. In some applications a step-up transformer is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications [...] greater than between about 375kW (500HP) and 750kW (1000hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications. The power rating of MV drives can reach 100MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{converters}} for HVDC {{are divided}} into two main categories. Line-commutated converters (HVDC classic) are made with electronic switches {{that can only be}} turned on. Voltage-sourced converters are made with <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> that can be turned both on and off. Line-commutated converters (LCC) used mercury-arc valves until the 1970s, [...] or thyristors from the 1970s to the present day. [...] Voltage-source converters (VSC), which first appeared in HVDC in 1997, use transistors, usually the [...] Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT).|$|E

2500|$|Demand {{response}} {{refers to}} the use of communication and <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> which can release deferrable loads quickly, or absorb additional energy to correct supply/demand imbalances. Incentives have been widely [...] created in the American, British and French systems for the use of these systems, such as favorable rates or capital cost assistance, encouraging consumers with large loads to take them off line or to start diesels whenever {{there is a shortage of}} capacity, or conversely to increase load when there is a surplus.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the HVDC {{systems in}} {{operation}} today {{are based on}} line-commutated converters (LCC). [...] The term line-commutated indicates that the conversion process relies on the line voltage of the AC system to which the converter is connected in order to effect the commutation from one switching device to its neighbour. Line-commutated converters use <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> that are either uncontrolled (such as diodes) or {{that can only be}} turned on (not off) by control action, such as thyristors. Although HVDC converters can, in principle, be constructed from diodes, such converters can only be used in rectification mode and the lack of controllability of the DC voltage is a serious disadvantage. [...] Consequently, in practice all LCC HVDC systems use either grid-controlled mercury-arc valves (until the 1970s) or thyristors (to the present day).|$|E
2500|$|As a polymath, {{he wrote}} nearly two hundred {{professional}} papers, gaining renown in fields from computer science and artificial intelligence to epistemology, and researched high-speed electronics and electro-optics <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> as a physicist, and in biophysics, {{the study of}} memory and knowledge. He worked on cognition based on neurophysiology, mathematics, and philosophy and was called [...] "one of the most consequential thinkers {{in the history of}} cybernetics". He came to the United States, and stayed after meeting with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, where he received funding from The Pentagon to established the Biological Computer Laboratory, which built the first parallel computer, the Numa-Rete. Working with William Ross Ashby, one of the original Ratio Club members, and together with Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann and Lawrence J. Fogel, Heinz von Foerster was an architect of cybernetics and {{one of the members of}} the Macy conferences, eventually becoming editor of its early proceedings alongside Hans-Lukas Teuber and Margaret Mead.|$|E
30|$|Future {{work should}} also {{consider}} {{details of the}} <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Different patients are able to use different muscles to control a <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> A person who uses eye blinks (Bauby, 1997), a sip-puff headset, or manipulates EEG signals (Serby, Yom-Tov & Inbar, 2005) may produce very different error probabilities than what is reported here and thus would require different keyboard designs. Future work should also explore easier methods of estimating and modeling a user’s ability to use the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Koester & Simpson (2014) simply measured how well users could trigger single, double, and triple clicks of the <b>switch</b> <b>device.</b> Such an approach would be much faster than the empirical approach used here. Likewise, Simpson, Koester and LoPresti (2007) proposed that an appropriate cursor duration is one that generates a ratio of the user’s reaction time and the cursor duration equal to 0.65. If true in general, then it should be easy to model error probabilities. Regardless of the empirical method, once the error probabilities for a user’s ability with a <b>switch</b> <b>device</b> are identified and modeled, the optimization algorithm described here can be readily applied.|$|R

2500|$|Italian {{railways}} {{were the}} first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3kV 15Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as [...] "the Italian system". Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives. During the period of electrification of the Italian railways, tests were made as to which type of power to use: in some sections there was a 3,600V Hz three-phase power supply, in others there was 1,500VDC, 3kVDC and 10kVAC45Hz supply. After WW2, 3 kVDC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system. 1,500 V DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50Hz is used by high-speed trains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
