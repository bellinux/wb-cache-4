The primary {{aim of this study}} was to develop a new method for devulcanizing waste automotive EPDM rubber powder by using shearing action and chemical additive and recycle the devulcanized powder. A semi-industrial twin screw extruder with a shearing action and reactor along with 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole-disulfide (MBTS) chemical were used to devulcanize the waste powder at two different feed screw speeds and main rotor speeds at a constant temperature of 220 °C. To recycle the devulcanized powder, different amounts of the devulcanized powder were mixed with a commercial EPDM-based automotive rubber <b>strips</b> <b>compound</b> to produce blends. The blends, commercial compound and devulcanized powder were cured with a semi-efficient (SEV) vulcanization system and their viscosity, cure and mechanical properties measured. For the blends, the Mooney viscosity was unchanged with 40 wt%, crosslink density with 20 wt%, tensile strength and elongation at break with 10 wt%, and compression set with 20 wt% of the devulcanized powder. Interestingly, the hardness benefitted from 50 wt% of the devulcanized powder in the blends. The scorch and optimum cure times shortened and the cure rate index rose when the loading of the devulcanized powder in the blends was raised.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results and lesson learned from several two-phase extraction tests and system operations data from the last three years. The paper provides an outline for the proprietary and non-proprietary two-phase extraction methods, designing and implementing effective pilot tests, performance monitoring, and design considerations for volatile hydrocarbons stripping and minimizing the friction losses. Two-phase extraction is an effective method for the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile hydrocarbons. Two-phase extraction removes both groundwater and soil vapor in a common stream while enhancing biodegradation of the hydrocarbons in the vadose and the saturated zone. The method should be used after serious consideration for the water lifting mechanism of the vacuum, and the friction losses due to handling large volume of water. In most applications, a conventional vacuum blower system with a carefully designed knockout and piping system can perform {{as well as a}} liquid ring pump system. The success of two-phase extraction depends on the ability of the piping design to deliver maximum vacuum to the wellhead with minimal friction loss in the extraction pipe. One major challenge is to lift the water in the well from depths greater than 33 feet. There are several proprietary and non-proprietary methods available presenting their own challenges and benefits. Another major challenge is to measure the vapor flow at the individual wellhead when extracting from more than one well. A flow splitter was developed to overcome the difficulty of measuring flow of water and vapor separately.

40|$|Purpose: This is a {{guide to}} using in situ air {{sparging}} as a remediation technology. In situ air sparging is {{a process in which}} a gaseous medium (commonly air) is injected into groundwater through a system of wells. As the injected air rises to the water table, it can <b>strip</b> volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (VOCs) from groundwater and the capillary fringe. The process also oxygenates groundwater, enhancing the potential for biodegradation at sites with contaminants that degrade aerobically. The DNR developed this guidance for environmental professionals who investigate contaminated sites and design remedial systems. Designing an in situ air sparging system is a multidisciplinary process; the designer should have a working knowledge of geology, hydrogeology and basic engineering to design an effective system. The majority of this guidance is intended for smaller VOC contaminated sites; however, some of the guidance is appropriate for larger sites. Designers may need to deviate from the guidance in some circumstances because each site has unique contaminants, access constraints, size, hydrogeology, and other characteristics.

An alternative purification technique {{is the use}} of ultrasonic waves combined with oxidants, leading to an advanced oxidation process (AOP). This study evaluates the use of high frequency ultrasonic waves as a singular AOP by comparing the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH’s), i. e., fluorene and phenanthrene, and the azo dye methyl orange. Tertiair butanol (TBA) was added as a radical scavenger to determine a general degradation mechanism for these pollutants. In addition, the effect of frequency (583, 860, 1040 kHz) and dissolved gas (air, argon, oxygen) has been studied. The study generally indicates that the ultrasonic process is a useful method to degrade volatile hydrophobic compounds. Furthermore, results demonstrate that compounds degrade by a combined mechanism of radical attack and combustive reactions, whereat the proportion of each reaction type is indirectly determined by the volatility and hydrophobicity of the compound.

40|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulates}} are {{the subject}} of increasingly severe legislation controlling mass emissions throughout the world. Other emissions, which are currently unregulated, are also receiving closer scrutiny. In particular, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), some of which are known carcinogens, are being studied. A total exhaust solvent scrubbing apparatus (TESSA) has been constructed to sample diesel exhaust hydrocarbons, using a solvent mixture to <b>strip</b> organic <b>compounds</b> from exhaust gases. This avoided adsorption of hydrocarbons onto particulates, when fitted close to the exhaust port, and minimised the formation of sampling artifacts. TESSA yielded new information, enabling lighter more volatile organics such as 2 - and 3 -ringed PAC to be characterised, these could not be collected by a dilution tunnel filter, which trapped particulates effectively but did not sample the hydrocarbons which had remained in the gas-phase. TESSA has proved itself to be uniquely suitable for the sampling of gaseous hydrocarbons with which there is currently an increased interest. Experiments using TESSA have confirmed that there is a contribution to the exhaust from small amounts of fuel passing through the combustion chamber substantially unchanged, as well as from partially burnt or pyrolysed products of combustion. New techniques have been developed to aid the interpretation of data obtained from high resolution gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in order to assess the origin of specific groups of compounds within the highly complex samples obtained from diesel exhaust. Naphthalene and phenanthrene were shown to increase their concentration relative to their alkylated derivatives in an exhaust sample when compared to the relative concentrations found in the fuel. These parent compounds were being formed within the combustion chamber, as well as surviving in unburnt fuel. Nitro-PAC were detected only at considerably lower concentrations than had previously been found on dilution tunnel filter samples. Two new methods for assessing the contribution of lubricating oil to diesel exhaust emissions have been developed, and involved matching common peaks in a sample and a lubricating oil standard. The results demonstrated that lubricating oil makes a significant contribution to the total particulates. Increased control of lubricating oil leakage to the exhaust would help to reduce particulate emissions to below the new stringent limits. Perkins Engineering, Peterboroug...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon wastes, with emphasis on chlorinated aromatic compounds, in an anaerobic/aerobic bioprocess environment was made. A reactor configuration was developed consisting of linked anaerobic and aerobic reactors which served {{as the model for}} a proposed bioremediation strategy targeting subterranean soil/sediment/aquifer chlorinated phenol-contaminated environments. Here oxygen is frequently limited and sulphate is readily available, as occurs especially in marine sediment and intertidal habitats. In the anaerobic system the successful transformation and mobilization of the model contaminant, 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol, was shown to rely on reductive dechlorination by a sulphate-reducing dependent dechlororespiring co-culture. This was followed in the aerobic system by degradation of the pollutant and its metabolites, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, 4 -chlorophenol and phenol, by immobilized white-rot fungi. The strategy was initially investigated separately in laboratory bench- and intermediate scale reactors whereafter reactors were linked to simulate the integrated biodegradation strategy. The application of the fungal reactor to treat an actual waste stream by degrading complex mixtures of hydrocarbons in a waste oil recycling effluent was also investigated. The mineralization of phenol and 2, 4, 6 -TCP by immobilized fungal cultures was studied in pinewood chip and foam glass bead-packed trickling reactors. The reactors were operated in sequencing batch format. Removal efficiency increased over time and elevated influent phenol and TCP (800 and 85 mg. L⁻¹) concentrations were degraded by > 98 % in 24 – 30 h batch cycles. Comparable performance between the packing materials was shown. Uptake by the packing was negligible and <b>stripping</b> of <b>compounds</b> induced by aeration had a minimal effect on biodegradation efficiency. Reactor performances are discussed in relation to sequencing batch operation and nutrient requirements necessary to sustain fungal activity in inert vs. organic material packed systems. It was shown that a co-culture consisting of sulphate-reducing and dechlororespiring bacteria established in fed-batch and soil flasks, as well as pine chip-packed fluidized bed reactors. Results showed reductive dechlorination of 2, 4, 6 -TCP to be in strict dependence on the activity of the sulphate-reducing population, sulphate and lactate concentrations. Transformation to 2, 4 -DCP, 4 -CP and phenol was enhanced in sulphate deficient conditions. Dechlororespiring activity was found to be dependent on the fermentative activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria, and the culture was also shown to mobilize and dechlorinate TCP in soils contaminated with the pollutant. Linking the systems achieved degradation of the compound by > 99 % through fungal mineralization of metabolites produced in the dechlororespiring stage of the system. pH correction to the anaerobic reactor was found to be necessary since acidic effluent from the fungal reactor inhibited sulphate reduction and dechlorination. The fungal reactor system was evaluated at intermediate-scale using a complex waste oil recycling effluent. Substantial COD reduction (> 96 % in 48 h batch cycles) and removal of specific effluent hydrocarbon components was shown in diluted, undiluted (COD > 37 g. L⁻¹) and 2, 4, 6 -TCP-spiked effluents. Industrial application of the fungal reactor was evaluated in a 14 m³ pilot plant operated on-site at a waste oil processing plant. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{for using the}} crop maize (Zea mays) {{for the production of}} biogas in simple anaerobic leach beds was evaluated. The results showed that leach beds coupled to high-rate methanogenic reactors performed better than other systems on a specific methane yield per gram of substrate added basis while their performance on a volumetric gas yield basis was poorer. Initial experiments using a single stage digester showed rapid acidification due to the low buffering capacity of the system. To overcome this problem, leach beds were used as part of a two-phase system in which the intermediate metabolic products were flushed out and used as substrate for a second stage methanogenic reactor. Further experiments simulated the effect of a hydraulic flush in the leach bed using clean water as the flush liquid. Methane potential of the leachate was estimated based on the cumulative soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) production. Under this operation mode, the effect of substrate to inoculum ratio, fresh substrate load (FSL), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and buffer and trace element addition was tested. The performance of the leach bed was found to be poor compared to conventional digesters where the methane yield is ~ 0. 35 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded and volatile solids (VS) destruction is ~ 85 % and this was thought to be due to the low pH in the reactor. Increasing the FSL improved methane yield but the maximum value obtained was 0. 12 l CH 4 g- 1 VS. Decreasing the HRT allowed the leach bed to operate at a slightly higher pH. In this case, a volatile solids destruction of ~ 50 % and a methane yield of 0. 17 l CH 4 g- 1 VS was achieved using a HRT of 2. 6 days. The addition of buffer (NaHCO 3) to maintain pH ~ 6. 5 increased VS destruction to 89 % and methane yield to 0. 37 l CH 4 g- 1 VS at an HRT of 1. 5 days. This performance was similar at a HRT of 28 days despite the high VFA concentrations. Acid production increased with the addition of buffer as 75 - 97 % of SCOD was converted to this form. Buffering was also shown {{to increase the number of}} culturable anaerobic cellulolytic microorganisms. VS degradation and methane potential were further enhanced by the addition 0. 5 mg l- 1 of cobalt to the buffered flush medium giving an apparent VS destruction of 115 % and a methane yield of 0. 46 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded, which indicated that a proportion of the inoculum was also degraded. In the final part of the research the leach beds were coupled to methanogenic reactors and trials were conducted using different feed cycle durations, in which all the digestate and leachate from the preceding run was used as inoculum, and only the solids destroyed were replaced with fresh feed material. The effect of the methanogenic reactor was multi-fold as it not only <b>stripped</b> out intermediate <b>compounds,</b> according to its primary design function, but also played an important role in stabilising pH, maintaining nutrients and retaining the microbial population in the system. The leach bed operated with a 7 -day feed cycle showed higher substrate degradation and was able to receive a higher OLR of 2. 4 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 than the 14 -day feed cycle at 1. 7 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 and the 28 -day feed cycle at 1. 3 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1. This provided a higher volumetric methane yield the shorter the feed cycle, 0. 839 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1, 0. 618 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 and 0. 482 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 in the 7 -day, 14 -day and 28 -day feed cycle, respectively. However, the specific methane yield obtained from the system was slightly higher in the 14 -day and 28 -day cycles at 0. 434 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded while in the 7 -day cycle it was 0. 418 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded. The retention of the digestate and leachate over successive cycles for a period of ~ 160 days appeared, however, to cause an accumulation of suspended solids (SS) and total and soluble COD in the leachate. This was especially the case in the higher loaded 7 -day feed cycle reactor and was probably the cause of the lower methane production. Initially the methanogenic reactors were responsible for most methane production but with progressive cycles the leach beds themselves became methanogenic and eventually accounted for more than 50 % of the methane generated in the system. The methanogenic and cellulolytic bacteria were shown to be present in the leachate from both reactors and suggested a synergy between them in exchange of microbial consortia.

40|$|Why to use {{packed bed}} micro-reactors for {{catalyst}} testing? Miniaturized packed bed reactors {{have a large}} surface-to-volume ratio at the reactor and particle level that favors the heat- and mass-transfer processes at all scales (intra-particle, inter-phase and inter-particle or reactor level). If the mass-transfer processes are fast in respect to the reaction-rate, then the reaction-rate is under kinetic control over {{the entire range of}} conversion and it is possible to measure intrinsic kinetics, from differential to integral conditions, eliminating extrapolation and improving reliability. For reaction mixtures where the catalyst-deactivation phenomena {{should be included in the}} reaction-rate expression to predict the reactor performance, these continuous reactors allow the measurement of intrinsic kinetics and, independently, catalyst deactivation over long periods of time. When using several reactors in parallel, as in parallel multi-flow experimentation units, a fast evaluation of the reaction-rate dependency on the process variables can be performed. Why to study the hydrodynamics of multi-phase packed bed micro-reactors? Established correlations to evaluate hydrodynamic parameters are based on large-scale trickle beds (Re> 1, dparticle > 1 mm), where inertia and gravity play a prominent role. For multi-phase packed bed reactors the Reynolds number Re is calculated based on the liquid properties and the particle diameter Re= ?LuLdp/?L where ?L is the liquid density, uL is the liquid velocity, dp is the particle diameter, and ?L is the liquid viscosity. There are important differences in flow behavior upon downscaling. When using small volumes and flow velocities (Re 0. 5), the gas-liquid interaction can be boosted by increasing flow-rates, the size of void-channels (inter-pillar or inter-particle space) has a major impact not only on the bed porosity but also on the distribution of the phases inside the bed, and changing from a full wetting condition to a partial wetting condition produces a significant change in flow pattern. It is still difficult to predict accurately the multi-phase flow pattern for micro-fabricated and miniaturized packed beds because many variables (Ca number, contact angle, pore-connectivity, and feed-section design) seem to be important. It is worthwhile to perform visualization or residence time distribution experiments in connection with hot flow experiments to establish the relation between bed packing characteristics and the gas-liquid-solid reaction performance as well as analyzing trends with the parameters. What taught us the mathematical modelling? In chapter VI we described the effect of volatility on residence time distribution and conversion in multiphase reactors. This is relevant for the many processes where substantial vaporization of the liquid feed occurs. The typical situation is that the evaporated molecules not only lower the concentration in the liquid phase but also travel faster through the reactor. This has direct importance in understanding multiphase reactors with light reactants and products (such as HDS), offering insight into practical issues such as bypassing and <b>stripping</b> of relevant <b>compounds.</b> Our complete model uses two mobile zones, one for the liquid phase and one for the gas phase, with dispersion in each zone and mutual mass transfer. We explored the entire parameter space for our model numerically. We learned that the relevant parameters are the velocities and volumetric fluxes of the phases, the thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases, the dispersion behavior of the individual phases and the mass transfer rate between the phases. We described quantitatively how the mean residence time of a component decreases when it significantly evaporates to a faster-moving gas phase. We explored how slow mass transfer contributes to the broadening of the residence time distribution. Experimentally, we validated the model in a more limited parameter space in a gas-liquid micro-packed bed with volatile and non-volatile compounds in different solvents. Additionally, using reactor simulations we developed a simple model to predict the conversion for systems with a volatile reactant at mass-transfer rate values relevant for micro-reactors and trickle-bed reactors. We used a liquid-only reaction to represent the case of a fully wetted heterogeneous catalyst or a homogeneous non-volatile catalyst in the liquid phase. Our results indicate that: for multi-phase continuous micro-reactors with high mass-transfer rates (St ? 100, St=(ka) glØL/uL, where (ka) gl is the gas-liquid mass-transfer coefficient, Ø is the liquid hold-up, L is the reactor length, and uL is the liquid velocity), the volatile compounds have a lower concentration in the reactive phase and the overall residence time for such compounds is lower. These two effects, lower concentration and shorter residence time, are related manifestations of the same phenomenon. Accounting for only the change of concentration reliably predicts the conversion for all reaction orders higher than zero. Liquid by-passing via the gas phase is not important since thermodynamic equilibrium is already reached in the top of the bed. For large scale trickle-beds the typical range of St is 5 - 50, at these intermediate mass-transfer rates the conversion is further reduced due to a significant evaporation of the reactant to the gas phase without re-condensation before leaving the reactor. At even lower mass-transfer rates (St ? 1), too few molecules evaporate before leaving the reactor and the effect of the volatility vanishes. Wherever possible, we extracted from the detailed numerical model practical engineering correlations for average residence time and conversion. The results presented in this work teach whether reactant volatility should be considered in a reactor design.
