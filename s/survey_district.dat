40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorder (IDD) is {{the single}} most important preventable cause of brain damage. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) refer to all of the consequences of iodine deficiency in a population, which can be prevented by taking adequate amount of Iodine. The objectives was to ascertain the prevalence goitre among 6 - 12 year children by clinical examination in Mahasamund district; 2) to document the iodine uptake status reflected by random urinary excretion levels in a sub-sample of 6 - 12 year children covered for clinical examination, and 3) to evaluate the coverage of iodized salt at community level (i. e. at household and retail shop) on-the-spot test by using rapid salt testing kit. Methods: A cross sectional community based survey was done in Mahasamund district during April 2015 to September 2015. The study population was children in the age group of 6 - 12 years. 30 cluster sampling methodology was applied using PPS sampling technique, based on latest survey guidelines of NIDDCP of Govt. of India. The parameters studied were prevalence of goitre, urinary iodine excretion, and iodine content in salt at community level (i. e. household and shop). Results: A total of 2700 children aged from 6 - 12 years were assessed clinically for goitre. The total goitre prevalence was 4. 29 % (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 5. 27). The median urinary iodine excretion (MUIE) was 106. 67 and # 956;g/L (range 11 - 216. 7 and # 956;g /L) among surveyed children. 37. 4 % of the urinary iodine excretion values were < 100 and # 956;g/L. The households consuming inadequately iodized salt (i. e. iodine content and # 8804; 15 ppm) was 20 % in the <b>surveyed</b> <b>district.</b> Conclusions: Although prevalence of goitre and median urinary iodine excretion among surveyed population was found satisfactory against the norms set by NIDDCP in <b>surveyed</b> <b>district</b> but universal salt iodization (USI) is yet to achieve in <b>surveyed</b> <b>district.</b> [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (8. 000) : 3590 - 3594...|$|R

Design: Historical cohort study, based on long term follow up of the Carnegie (Boyd-Orr) survey of diet and health in pre-war Britain (1937 – 1939). Setting: Sixteen urban and rural districts in Britain. Subjects: A total of 4999 children from 1352 families were surveyed in 1937 – 1939. Information on infant feeding and childhood anthropometry was available for 2995 subjects. Main outcome measures: Mean differences in childhood and adult anthropometry between breast and bottle fed subjects. Results: Breast feeding {{was associated with the}} <b>survey</b> <b>district,</b> greater household income, and food expenditure, but not with number of children in the household, birth order, or social class.

40|$|Forest {{surveys of}} Nebraska were {{conducted}} in 1955 and 1977 (Shasby, 1977). These surveys sought to characterize species, total area, and size classes of economically important trees. Information gained from these surveys is very alarming. The counties of Nernaha, Otoe, and Richardson in the southeastern <b>survey</b> <b>district</b> have lost between 34. 7 % and 53. 9 % of their trees during that 22 -yr period. These are critical losses considering that these counties are only 2. 8 % to 5. 5 % forested. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate historical changes in tree vegetation that occurred in Nemaha County. The trees as they occurred in the county when settlers started to colonize this part of Nebraska were studied. For this, the General Land Office surveys were helpful. Information of this type has been used to categorize presettlement forests in several states (Steams, 1949; Spurr, 1951; Shanks, 1953; Bourdo, 1956; Wuenscher and Valiunas, 1967; Leitner and J ackson, 1981). Most of these studies did not concentrate on using available information to define losses in vegetation that occurred since the original surveys. Information in the General Land Office surveys can be used to determine the location, area, size classes, and species of trees that occurred in the past...|$|E
40|$|The {{area under}} {{consideration}} occupies approximately forty square {{miles in the}} Okuku <b>Survey</b> <b>District,</b> 35 to 45 miles NNW of Christchurch; it is situated in hilly country five to ten miles inland from the south-western extension of the Culverden depression. In the west and south-west, it is drained by the Okuku River flowing south to its junction with the Ashley; in the north-west by tributaries of the Waitohi River, {{a branch of the}} Huruni; and in the east by the North, Middle and South Branches of the Waipara River. Access to the northern part is gained by the road to the ‘Virginia country’, ending at ‘Mt. Whitnow’ station twenty miles by road west of the township of Hawarden. A circuitous and little used road joining Whiterock and the north end of Lees Valley by way of Okuku and Lees Passes, affords access to {{the southern part of the}} area during dry weather. Two permanent homesteads are situated in the district, those of ‘Haydon Downs’ and ‘Melrose’ on the Virginia road in the extreme north-east; ‘The Brothers’ Station, on the South Branch of the Waipara near Lees Pass, is occupied intermittently during the summer. Three outlying musterers huts have been used during fieldwork. The country lies between 1500 and 4300 feet above sea level, ridge heights and steepness of slope generally increasing westwards. Sheep are carried over the whole area during the summer, but the higher country cannot safely be stocked during the winter months. A good cover of white tussock, native and exotic grasses is supported over the majority of the country below 3500 feet, but slopes are too steep, and the soil veneer generally too shallow to permit cultivation. Beech forest occurs in strands of up to 800 acres in extent, and becomes increasingly frequent westward; it is continuous over the country about the higher reaches of the Ashley River immediately west of the present area. The forest association is dominated by Mountain beech, with relatively rare strands of broadleaf, totara, houhere, kowhai, and red beech. The present rate of regeneration is inadequate to maintain the forest in all but a few isolated localities, but it is clear that here as elsewhere over the forested areas of Canterbury, decadence has been accelerated rather than originated by the depredations of introduced animals, by burning, and by other processes directly or indirectly associated with colonization...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{sequential}} transformative study was to elucidate the negative experiences of teachers with performance evaluations and to juxtapose the intended use of current popular teacher evaluation reform movements to the evident implementation. One may quickly assume that negative experiences with evaluation {{are a result of}} unsatisfactory teaching practices. However, this may not accurately explain the negative experiences. This study focused on the negative experience of teacher evaluation to provide a broader understanding of the impact of new evaluation policy reform on student achievement and teacher quality. Five data sources were analyzed: PAR policy, a teacher <b>survey,</b> <b>district</b> PAR data, individual interviews, and one group interview. Five teachers, bound by one school district, participated in the interviews. With a paucity of previous research focused on the negative impacts of teacher evaluation, this study addressed the following questions: (1) How does the PAR teacher evaluation process negatively impact teachers? (2) What, if any, parallel traits exist among those teachers who had negative experiences with the PAR evaluation system? (3) How does the intended use of the PAR teacher evaluation process compare to the evident use of PAR? Data were collected and analyzed using the Complementary Analysis Research Matrix Application (CARMA) as an orienting tool to juxtapose data collected in interviews, surveys, and public data sources. CARMA aligned with the overarching theoretical framework of critical multiculturalism by systematically collecting data and analyzing it in an organized approach that hoped to empower participants to share their experiences. The study aligned with critical multiculturalism by giving voice to a marginalized group and empowering underrepresented people. Data revealed dissonance among intent and evident use of the evaluation policy. A disproportionate number of African Americans, women over the age of 55, and teachers higher on the pay scale were referred to PAR. Additionally, data indicated that through the PAR evaluation system, teachers experienced negative health impacts such as, high levels of stress, depression, weight gain, despondence, insomnia, hostility toward family, deteriorating relationships, high blood pressure, and overall distraction. Furthermore, vague policy language was suggested as the impetus for misuse, abuse, and biased implementation at the local level. This study suggests that policy makers and school district officials take heed of multiple perspectives and consider the negative impacts of teacher evaluation reform. Evaluation systems that prioritize teacher learning over accountability are integral to successfully improving student achievement...|$|E
