40|$|There is a {{worldwide}} trend of establishing {{the office of}} ombudsman at sub-national, national, and supra-national levels with general or <b>specialized</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> Since the first establishment of the modern form of ombudsman, the jurisdiction and powers of ombudsman are ever evolving. One major development is to extend its jurisdiction from purely supervision over maladministration by public authorities to human rights infringement committed by public authorities or even private bodies. The aim {{of this article is}} to examine the different models that have been adopted by ombudsmen in different countries in protecting human rights. The human rights situation in a particular jurisdiction, the historical, political, constitutional and cultural environments of the jurisdiction, the institutional design of the ombudsman as well as the self-consciousness and self-perception of the ombudsman will all determine the degree of intensity of human rights issues that the ombudsman will have to encounter and is willing to handle. Six models are identified reflecting the varying degree of involvement by the ombudsman in human rights protection. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Type II governance, {{predominant}} above states, conceives of jurisdictions {{built around}} policy problems. Governance is fragmented into functionally specific pieces—specialized jurisdictions. Each makes a delimited set of authoritative decisions {{on a particular}} problem, task, or issue.

40|$|In {{the debate}} over the {{governance}} of metropolitan areas, consolidationists favour single, area-wide, general purpose jurisdictions, while polycentrists make arguments in support of multiple, scale-specific, <b>specialized</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> This dissertation contributes to this debate through comparisons of municipal and specialized service delivery in two Ontario cities. The cities of London and Hamilton represent positions along a continuum of fragmentation and consolidation, with London being more fragmented and Hamilton more consolidated. Comparisons are undertaken for three local government services: public health, economic development, and watershed management. In London, independent special purpose bodies deliver all three of these services, while in Hamilton the municipality is responsible for public health and economic development and controls the main conservation authority. The central objective of this dissertation is to test the competing claims of consolidationists and polycentrists by comparing the performance of these three functions in the two cities. It looks at such performance measures as efficiency, effectiveness, accountability, coordination, and responsiveness. The results of the comparisons are mixed. On balance, the hypotheses of the consolidationists are supported more often than the hypotheses of the polycentrists, but this debate is overly simplistic. In reality, specialized governments pursue their mandate more single-mindedly than general purpose governments. The policy consequences of this characteristic are more or less pronounced depending upon how autonomous the board is. There are some positive consequences associated with specialized delivery for public health and watershed management, because the benefits of these types of services are enjoyed by most citizens, but they are not always a priority for municipal politicians. However for economic development, the policy consequences were mainly negative. This is because specialization in this functional area enhances the power of business interests. In short, much can be understood about the behaviour of special purpose bodies by how they are controlled and by what function they perform. When applied to more general debates about metropolitan governance, the findings make it clear that even relatively small differences in local government structures can have significant policy consequences...|$|R
50|$|In England {{a simple}} legal fiction {{extended}} {{the jurisdiction of}} the Court of the Exchequer to all types of cases involving debt. The Exchequer was originally a court that had a <b>specialized</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> involving taxes and other obligations to The Crown. The Court had only slight jurisdiction in regards to private matters between litigants. The Exchequer therefore had a much lighter caseload than the King's Bench and other courts in England. Litigants who commenced an action in the Exchequer Court on a debt, therefore, had to plead that they owed money to the King, which they could not pay because their debtor had in turn wrongfully withheld payment to them. It came to pass that the debt owed to the King became a legal fiction in that the original debtor was not entitled to controvert this allegation in order to oust the Exchequer from jurisdiction. The litigant, by using this artifice against the debtor, could bring his case into a court with a substantially lesser caseload.|$|E

40|$|Esta tese apresenta um estudo de dez crimes passionais julgados pelo Tribunal do JÃri brasileiro, sendo quatro os conceitos-chave que orientam a discussÃo: crimes passional, jÃri, honra, veredicto e sentenÃa. Um dos principais objetivos do trabalho foi caracterizar o discurso da honra nas prÃticas escritas e orais da elaboraÃÃo do crime passional, entendendo a honra como o valor do rÃu aos olhos dele mesmo e, mais ainda, Ã Ãptica da sociedade a que pertence. Na anÃlise que se segue, sÃo discutidos os conceitos de honra ligados ao pensamento sociolÃgico, antropolÃgico e jurÃdico, mais especificamente na figura do homicida passional, mediante atravÃs da apresentaÃÃo dos casos de crimes passionais e na anÃlise do argumento da âlegÃtima defesa da honraâ, discurso constituÃdo durante a narraÃÃo dessas mortes, desde a denÃncia do ato atÃ o julgamento pelo Tribunal do JÃri.

This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} ten cases of crimes of passion tried before the Jury Court (Tribunal do JÃri), a Brazilian court with <b>specialized</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over each of certain grave offenses in which a life is taken. A main objective {{of the study was}} to characterize the discourse concerning honor in the written and oral practices in the construction of the crime of passion, understanding honor as a value of the accused, both through their own eyes and through the eyes of the society to which they belong. Concepts of honor are discussed in connection with sociological, anthropological and juridical thought, more specifically in the figure of the passionate murderer within the presentation of cases of crimes of passion and in the analysis of the juridical "legitimate defense of honor", a discourse constructed in the narrative of these deaths throughout the process from the charge of the crime to the verdict of the Jury Court. The development of the text is based upon a typology of the cases using a qualitative approach and descriptive method. The construction of questions guiding the discussion in this thesis takes the following sequence: characterization of the concept of honor, overview of the Jury Court, account of a jury session, description of the cases of crimes of passion and analysis thereof. It can be seen in the conclusions of the analysis that crime of passion, discourse, verdict and sentence all have sociological meaning as expression of social traditions and moral duty, strengthening the discourse concerning honor in the narrative and reinforcing aspects of the construction of the social world...|$|E

40|$|When {{advocating for}} legal reform, judges cross a murky line in congressional-judicial relations: {{lobbying}} is legally permissible, but generally frowned upon. This {{is because there}} are no legal or ethical constraints on judges who lobby, only an ill-defined norm against the practice. Scholars have largely dismissed judicial lobbying efforts as haphazard, one-off events, driven by the unique interests, expertise, or ideology of the individual judge involved. According to scholars, there is nothing we should do—nor is there anything we could do—to reign in judges who lobby. This Article challenges that presumption on two fronts. Theoretically, it argues that judges on specialized courts are more prone to lobbying than are judges on generalist courts. Judicial lobbying occurs, in large part, when the judiciary senses a threat to its <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>Specialized</b> courts—courts whose <b>jurisdiction</b> is defined by subject matter, rather than geography—are {{more likely to engage in}} debates about the substance of that subject matter. Thus, these courts act as both court and agency, straddling the line between permissible advocacy by judges and impermissible lobbying by government employees. It is this agency-like lobbying that we should attempt to eliminate. Normatively, this Article argues that in certain instances judicial lobbying can and should be curtailed, counter to the prevailing wisdom. Judicial lobbying always comes with concerns about tense interbranch relations, but lobbying by specialized courts potentially sacrifices long-held judicial virtues, including due process and impartiality. This Article offers a check on such lobbying that leverages the wisdom of the entire judicial branch to reign in abuses by specialized courts...|$|R
40|$|The {{reallocation}} {{of authority}} upwards, downwards, and sideways from central states has drawn attention from {{a growing number}} of scholars in the social sciences. Yet beyond the bedrock agreement that governance has become (and should be) multi-level, there is no convergence about how it should be organized. This paper draws on various literatures in distinguishing two types of multi-level governance. One type conceives of dispersion of authority to multi-task, territorially mutually exclusive jurisdictions in a relatively stable system with limited jurisdictional levels and a limited number of units. A second type of governance pictures <b>specialized,</b> territorially overlapping <b>jurisdictions</b> in a relatively flexible, non-tiered system with a large number of jurisdictions.

40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised {{regarding}} the role of low-tax offshore jurisdictions in the global financial crisis, based largely on evidence that many problematic asset-backed securities were issued from or listed in the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Ireland, and other ‘offshore’ sites. However, {{there has not been}} a systematic investigation of the offshore geography of crisis-implicated securitization. Here we fill this gap by constructing the first comprehensive jurisdictional map of the largest pre-crisis Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) programs, and examining the rationale for and impacts of this geography in detail. We show that offshore jurisdictions were disproportionately involved in producing the most unstable ABCP classes. However, this is difficult to explain in terms of the traditional role of offshore banking centers as sites for direct avoidance of onshore regulation and transparency. Rather, we propose a Minskian model of pre-crisis offshore ABCP production, wherein these <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>specialized</b> in alleviating incidental institutional frictions (e. g. double taxation) hindering onshore financial innovation. In this context, they could sometimes be legitimately described as improving the institutional ‘efficiency’ of financial markets; however, by facilitating the endogenous evolutionary instability of these markets, this apparently innocuous service had profoundly negative effects. This normative disconnect poses a conundrum for offshore reform...|$|R
40|$|EU Competition Law: Between Public and Private Enforcement’ {{is devoted}} to an {{analysis}} of today’s EU competition law at the intersection between public and private enforcement. The book, which is directed by Prof. Bernardo Cortese, relies on the contribution of several scholars and experts of EU competition law whose essays are to be intended as Chapters of a general and coherent work organized in five parts, each of which is introduced by Introductory Notes putting the different chapters in a clear perspective, and building a constant dialogue between the director of the work and the authors of each chapter. The underlying idea of the book is that private enforcement cannot be effectively addressed without inserting it in the more general framework of EU law enforcement mechanisms, on the one hand, and in the framework of competition law, on the other. This idea is reflected {{in the structure of the}} present work. Part I deals with general problems and notions of EU competition law. By addressing in Chapter 1 the goals of competition law, the book intends to recall first of all the specificity of EU competition law if compared with other antitrust systems. Then, decisive notions of EU competition law are addressed, whose interpretation might be a challenge in private enforcement, but also in decentralized public enforce- ment, because of their autonomous character. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 thus deal with the notion of agreements and concerted practices, with the criterion of effects on interstate trade, and with the notion of undertaking, seen through the lens of the parent subsidiary relationship. In Part I, some basic questions emerge concerning the (not always complete) autonomous character these notions, and their relationship with national legal systems’ notions. Some structural characters of EU competition law are moreover presented, and among them the quasi legislative role the Commission has crafted for itself through the modernization, that make it necessary for national courts and the ECJ to actively exercise their judicial function, to avoid that the system of enforcement might lead to constitutionally unsound results. At the same time the idea is put forward, that EU competition law should not rely too heavily on ECJ case law, but should stand on truly legislative choices. Finally, the exclusion of the European xxv Preface ￼Parliament from the normative process in this field is seen as a substantial limitation to the democratic character of the whole EU economic integration system. Part II addresses different aspects of the cooperation between ECN authorities, and between them and the judiciary. Chapter 5 shows the ‘constitutional’ unbalances of the ECN, against which it advocates a more active involvement of national courts; at the same time, it denounces the threats that the post modernization system poses, in its actual functioning, for uniformity and predictability of EU law application. Chapter 6 deals with the effects of ECN public enforcement decisions in private enforcement judicial proceedings, while Chapter 7 analyses in depth the use of cooperation tools that should enable a fruitful involvement of administrative authorities in private enforcement judicial proceedings, making reference to procedural tools provided both at the EU and at the national level. Moreover, in the Introductory Notes to this Part the need to preserve a central role for the preliminary ruling mechanism is stressed, against the substantial disregard of the CILFIT acte claire doctrine that is shown by supreme courts’ attitudes in this field. Finally, suggestions for reform of the national arms of the EU private enforcement system are put forward, namely the introduction of a certain degree of courts’ specialization, and the introduction or reinforcement of class or representative actions. Part III is specifically devoted to the preliminary ruling mechanism, and to its significance in EU competition law. Chapter 8 analyses in depth the procedural framework of Article 267 TFEU, and shows how it operates in the field of competition law. Chapter 9 depicts the actual contribution of preliminary rulings in shaping the framework of private enforcement at the national level, in the absence of EU legisla- tion, by singling out some ‘pillars’ upon which all national legal systems should be based. Chapter 10 continues the analysis, by making special reference to the issue of access to public enforcement leniency files. The abovementioned analyses make it possible for the director of this work to reflect, in his ssIntroductory Notes to Part III, on some critical aspects of the public/ private enforcement relationship. First of all it is stressed that public and private enforcement should be recognized different nature and goals, but equal dignity in the system. Further, and as a consequence thereof, the need to fully deploy the preliminary ruling potential in this field is underlined. To this end, a less strict approach to the notion of ‘court or tribunal’ under Article 267 TFEU is advocated. Moreover, the case is made for a special procedural regime for competition law preliminary rulings, leading to a more integrated adjudication process between national and European courts, which could be optimally managed by a specialized chamber of the General Court. Part IV deals with the procedural issues that most frequently arise at the national courts’ level in connection with actions for damages. It includes four Reports drafted by senior national judges, members of the Association of European Competition Law Judges, and coming from <b>specialized</b> or supreme <b>jurisdictions</b> of France (Chapter 11), Greece (Chapter 12), Ireland (Chapter 13), and Italy (Chapter 14). Rapporteurs assess the value of cooperation of administrative authorities with civil courts, as well as the role played by general principles of national procedural law, especially on the burden and standard of proof issues, that make sometimes difficult to successfully bring xxvi private enforcement damages actions. In particular, the relevance of the passing on defence is analysed, also in the light of the compensatio lucri cum damno principle, and the scope of res iudicata in the civil/administrative jurisdiction relationship is further assessed. The role of experts, and the procedural tools to preserve the confidential nature of relevant data, as well as simplified approaches to the proof of damages, are also analysed. Part V finally deals with some sectors of economic activity in the internal market in which the relationship between competition law and regulation is at the forefront, thereby dealing with an issue of paramount importance for both public and private enforcement. Chapter 15 deals with the abuse of a dominant position in the form of ‘margin squeeze’ in the sector of telecommunications. Chapter 16 on its turn addresses alternative regulation/competition in the audio-visual industry, having its focus on the need to preserve and foster pluralism. Chapter 17 presents recent case law on pharmaceuticals’ parallel imports, showing how the actual outcome as to the admis- sibility of such practices depend on a case-by-case evaluation, and is thus left to the wide discretion of the competent authority or court. Finally, Chapter 18 offers a picture of recent enforcement practice in the financial sector, showing how growing recourse to (follow-on) private enforcement actions would be possible, provided however that class or representative actions are available...|$|R
