5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} <b>spruce,</b> white <b>spruce,</b> and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue <b>spruce,</b> common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White <b>Spruce,</b> Black <b>Spruce),</b> Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E

50|$|Chrysomyxa ledi de Bary is a fungus. It {{occurs in}} Eurasia {{throughout}} {{the range of}} its broad-leaved hosts. The aecial stage is found on native and exotic <b>spruces</b> in Europe, including white and Engelmann <b>spruces</b> (Crane 2001).|$|R
50|$|Gottesfeld {{could detect}} 21 species, which played a certain role as CMTs. Of utmost {{importance}} is the Western Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), but the yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), <b>spruces</b> (Picea glauca u.a.), hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), pines (Pinus contorta, Pinus ponderosa), in addition Populus tremuloides, Populus trichocarpa and Alnus rubra are also quite frequent. The bark of hemlock and certain <b>spruces</b> {{was important for}} nourishment and medicine. The resin of <b>spruces</b> {{was used as a}} kind of glue.|$|R

5|$|Originally, the <b>Spruce</b> Production Division was {{authorized}} to induct 10,317troops, including both officers and enlisted men. The <b>Spruce</b> Production Division quickly recruited several thousand experienced loggers and mill workers, {{many of whom}} were above the military draft age of 40. In May 1918, the division {{was authorized}} to grow to 28,825personnel.|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus esculentus and S.stephanocystis {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to S.tenacellus. S.esculentus mushrooms have thin, sharp cap margins and only fruit on fallen <b>spruce</b> cones. S.stephanocystis has a yellow-brown to reddish-yellow cap that is not hygrophanous. Baeospora myosura is another small agaric that grows on pine and <b>spruce</b> cones, but it fruits in autumn.|$|E
5|$|The eastern <b>spruce</b> budworm is {{an example}} of a {{destructive}} insect in fir and <b>spruce</b> forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the Trichogramma minutum, a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.|$|E

5|$|The forested {{sections}} {{fall into}} three major climatic zones. The west and northwest {{are dominated by}} <b>spruce</b> and fir and the southwest by redcedar and hemlock; the areas east of the Continental Divide are a combination of mixed pine, <b>spruce,</b> fir and prairie zones. The cedar-hemlock groves along the Lake McDonald valley are the easternmost examples of this Pacific climatic ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{incarnation}} of M-171 {{served as a}} loop route off US23 which departed the main highway east of <b>Spruce,</b> traveled west through <b>Spruce,</b> then north past Hubbard Lake and through Wilson before returning to US23 near Alpena. This roadway was part of US23 before it was redesignated M-171 in 1932. This routing is now occupied by the present day routings of <b>Spruce,</b> Hubbard Lake and Wilson roads. This version of M-171 {{was removed from the}} system in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in <b>spruce</b> forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the <b>spruce</b> is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young <b>spruce</b> forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black <b>spruce</b> (Picea mariana), white <b>spruce</b> (P. glauca), Engelmann <b>spruce</b> (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no <b>spruce</b> occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka <b>spruce</b> (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
5|$|Wallace and Bates {{spent most}} of their first year {{collecting}} near Belém do Pará, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist Richard <b>Spruce,</b> along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from yellow fever), but <b>Spruce,</b> like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.|$|E

5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and <b>spruces</b> (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), <b>spruces,</b> pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While <b>spruces</b> dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|R

5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and <b>spruce</b> forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway <b>spruce)</b> woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. In the Rocky Mountains it associates with Engelmann <b>spruce</b> and blue <b>spruce,</b> and in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway <b>spruce,</b> but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of <b>spruce</b> is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Spruce</b> Production Division was {{a unit of}} the United States Army {{that was}} {{established}} in 1917 to produce high-quality Sitka <b>spruce</b> timber and other wood products needed to make aircraft for the United States' efforts in World War I. The division was part of the Army Signal Corps's Aviation Section. Its headquarters were in Portland, Oregon, and its main operations center was at Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington. Workers in the division were members of the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, a union specifically established to support the army's wood production operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{the headwaters}} of Spring Brook are home to boreal forest trees. These include black <b>spruce,</b> paper birch, and tamarack. Huckleberry, lady's slipper, leather leaf, mountain laurel, pitcher plant, and rhododendron plants inhabit bogs in the area.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>Spruce</b> Production Division {{was quickly}} demobilized after the war, {{there was some}} post-war {{controversy}} over the cost of its operations. Disque, by then a brigadier general, spent months answering to charges that his division had wasted taxpayers' money. Congress was particularly critical of the $4million spent on an unfinished railroad located in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Disque responded that {{it was to be}} used for transporting <b>spruce</b> lumber. Eventually, the charges proved to be unfounded.|$|E
