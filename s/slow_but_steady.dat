It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT With {{the recent}} {{rapid growth of}} the World Wide Web, the advent of {{commodity}} internet access via modems, and the <b>slower</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> proliferation of mobile computing devices, more and more users are accessing internet services from computationally capable machines connected via low-speed communication links. While many such services only offer access to static, unchanging documents, the number of &quot;online &quot; services offering access to frequently updated information is growing rapidly. While systems {{have been developed to}} optimize document access in the presence of constrained communication, their approaches do not handle access to online services well. This thesis examines the problem of designing online services to be accessed over constrained communication links by computationally capable clients. A taxonomy of application classes has been developed to define the distinguishing characteristics of online services, and recognizes that clients and applications often interact not just to exchange data, but also to control each other's actions or resources. This recognition is the basis for two new models of application structure. The two models are proposed as alternatives to established models and form the basis for the application structuring techniques developed and evaluated...|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and almost a third of those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities. Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Russian tsar Alexander I, also newly crowned King of Poland, gave Zajączek on 3 December 1815 the {{position}} of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland (tsar's deputized ruler of the territory, a position similar to that of a viceroy). This nomination surprised many, including Zajączek himself, who is said to have at first refused this position, but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order. Zajączek's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews, both among his contemporaries, as well as among later historians. He was actively interested in economic development of Polish lands, and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom's lands; he {{was also one of the}} founders of the University of Warsaw. He has been criticized, however, for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position, too servile to the wishes of his patron, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland, which contributed to a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> erosion of the country's freedoms and autonomy. Deferential towards the Russian authorities, he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander's commissar, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution, become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom. In recognition of Zajączek's services, Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of 'Prince of Poland' on 27 April 1818.|$|E
40|$|While {{significant}} {{attention has}} been paid to the levels of representation of women in both the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, much less considered has been given to the position within local government. This article addresses that deficit for Scotland. It shows that for twenty-five years following the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in 1974 there was a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> relatively <b>steady</b> increase in the numbers of female candidates and councillors, although more recently this appears to have since plateaued somewhat, together with a similar increase in the number of women councillors taking up more senior roles in Scotland’s councils. The article analyses the representation of women in Scottish local government over the period from 1974 to 2012 against the backdrop of significant change in Scotland, including a further restructuring of local government and the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote for council elections, the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the rise of the SNP and the decline of the Conservative Party...|$|R

40|$|Stem {{cell therapy}} is a rapidly {{evolving}} {{area of research}} in regenerative medicine. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received considerable attention by the scientific community because of their potential of expansion {{and the ability to}} differentiate into various mesodermal tissues. Liposomes are well-established non-viral carrier systems, presenting significant advantages over other nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, namely a high load carrying capacity, a relative safety and an ease of large-scale production, as well as a versatile nature in terms of possible formulation and functionalization. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of growth differentiation factor-releasing liposomes on the induction of MSCs osteogenesis. For that, dexamethasone (Dex) was encapsulated within the liposome bilayer at different lipid formulations. The obtained liposomes showed a monodisperse distribution of particles size, and an increased ζ- potential for the PEGylated liposomes. Dex encapsulation studies demonstrate that the presence of cholesterol (Chol) decreases the Dex loading capacity of the liposome bilayer. The different stabilizing effect of Chol and Dex on the liposomes is due to differences in their interaction with phospholipid molecules. Highly lipophilic Chol gets incorporated between the acyl chains and reduces chain movement increasing rigidity and stabilization the membrane. Dex, being more hydrophilic, interacts differently with phospholipid acyl chains and head groups and destabilizes the membrane. In vitro release study demonstrated an initial burst release within an initial timeframe of 24 hours. Following the initial release, a slower release was observed until 6 days. Afterwards, Dex continues to be released at a <b>slower</b> <b>but</b> <b>steady</b> rate until day 21. The effect of Dex-loaded liposomes on viability, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) was assessed. The results of the biological activity showed that the Dex-loaded liposomes do not have any cytotoxic effect and, more importantly, were able to promote an earlier induction of hBMSCs differentiation into the osteogenic lineage, as demonstrated by the expression of osteoblastic markers at the phenotypic and the genotypic levels. Concluding, Dex-loaded liposomes represent a novel biological or nature-inspired nanoparticle strategy for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications...|$|R

40|$|The global {{diversification}} {{of the class}} Bivalvia has historically received two conflicting interpretations. One is that a major upturn in diversification was associated with, and a consequence of, the Lake Permian mass extinction. The other is that mass extinctions have had little influence and that bivalves have experienced <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> nearly <b>steady</b> exponential diversification {{through most of the}}ir history, unaffected by interactions with other clades. We find that the most likely explanation lies between these two interpretations. Through most of the Phanerozoic, the diversity of bivalves did indeed exhibit slow growth, which was not substantially altered by mass extinctions. However, the presence of "hyperexponential bursts" in diversification during the initial Ordovician radiation and following the Late Permian and Late Cretaceous mass extinctions suggests a more complex history in which a higher characteristic diversification rate was dampened through most of the Phanerozoic. The observed pattern can be accounted for with a two-phase coupled (i. e., interactive) logistic model, where one phase is treated as the "bivalves" and the other phase is treated as a hypothetical group of clades with which the "bivalves" might have interacted. Results of this analysis suggest that interactions with other taxa have substantially affected bivalve global diversity through the Phanerozoic...|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} the VCH falls into three main phases, defined by {{different}} funding regimes: an early phase, 1899-1914, when the project was conceived as a commercial enterprise, and progress was rapid; a second more desultory phase, 1914-1947, when relatively little progress was made; and the third phase beginning in 1947, when, {{under the auspices of}} the Institute of Historical Research, a high academic standard was set, and progress has been <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> reasonably <b>steady.</b> These phases have also been characterised by changing attitudes towards the proper scope of English local history. The early volumes were planned on the model of traditional English county histories, with a strong emphasis on manorial descents, the advowsons of parish churches, and the local landed gentry: a prospectus of c. 1904 stated that [...] "there is no Englishman to whom VCH does not in some one or other of its features make a direct appeal". More recent volumes - especially those published since the 1950s - have been more wide-ranging in their approach, and have included systematic coverage of social and economic history, industrial history, population history, educational history, landscape history, religious nonconformity, and so on: individual parish histories have consequently grown considerably in length and complexity.|$|R
