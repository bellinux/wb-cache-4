25|$|An {{autopilot}} is a mechanical, electrical, or {{hydraulic system}} used to guide a vehicle without assistance {{from a human}} being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but <b>self-steering</b> gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called autopilot. The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved {{the credibility of the}} invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers.|$|E

2500|$|Slocum {{normally}} sailed the Spray {{without touching}} the helm. Due {{to the length}} of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the Spray was capable of <b>self-steering</b> (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the helm fast. He sailed [...] west across the Pacific without once touching the helm.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the SD70ACe and SD70M-2 models, all SD70 {{models were}} {{delivered}} with the <b>self-steering</b> HTCR radial truck. The radial truck allows the axles to steer in curves which reduces wear on the wheels and railhead. [...] With {{the introduction of}} the SD70ACe and SD70M-2 models, EMD introduced a new bolsterless non-radial HTSC truck as the standard truck for these models in an effort to reduce costs. [...] The HTCR-4 radial truck is still an option.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 June 1968 [...] Robin Knox-Johnston left Falmouth in his 32-foot (9.8-metre) boat Suhaili, {{one of the}} {{smallest}} boats to enter the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race. Despite losing his <b>self-steering</b> gear off Australia, he rounded Cape Horn on 17 January 1969, 20 days before his closest competitor Bernard Moitessier. Moitessier had sailed from Plymouth more than two months after Knox-Johnston, but he subsequently abandoned the race and instead sailed on to Tahiti. The other seven competitors dropped out at various stages, leaving Knox-Johnston to win the race and become officially the first person to circumnavigate the globe non-stop and single-handed on 22 April 1969, the day he returned to Falmouth. Knox-Johnston donated his prize money for fastest competitor to the family of Donald Crowhurst, who committed suicide after attempting to fake a round the world voyage.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler <b>self-steering</b> gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep leaning over the counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!" [...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E
60|$|But the Snark sailed. It was {{the only}} way she could get anywhere. She sailed for two years, and never touched rock, reef, nor shoal. She had no inside ballast, her iron keel weighed five tons, but her deep draught and high {{freeboard}} made her very stiff. Caught under full sail in tropic squalls, she buried her rail and deck many times, but stubbornly refused to turn turtle. She steered easily, and she could run day and night, without steering, close-by, full- and-by, and with the wind abeam. With the wind on her quarter and the sails properly trimmed, she steered herself within two points, and with the wind almost astern she required scarcely three points for <b>self-steering.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In cases, when a pure servo {{pendulum}} <b>self-steering</b> gear is not usable (Hydraulic rudder gear, {{very big}} force needed {{to turn the}} rudder), auxiliary rudder systems are used. They consist of a servo pendulum rudder coupled directly to an auxiliary rudder {{which is part of}} the <b>self-steering</b> system. The main rudder in such case is used to [...] "trim" [...] the main course and the <b>self-steering</b> gear steers [...] "around" [...] that main course according to the changes of the apparent wind.|$|E

50|$|<b>Self-steering</b> gear is {{equipment}} used on {{ships and boats}} to maintain a chosen course without constant human action. It is also known by several other terms, such as autopilot (borrowed from aircraft and considered incorrect by some) and autohelm (technically a Raymarine trademark, but often used generically). Several forms of <b>self-steering</b> gear exist, divided into two categories: electronic and mechanical.|$|E
50|$|Modern servo {{pendulum}} <b>self-steering</b> devices with optimized {{transmission and}} low friction mechanics {{are more and}} more used for day sailing and cruising; formerly being used mainly for long distance ocean passages. The increased low wind capabilities of optimized, modern devices enable downwind steering down to 1.3 m/s apparent wind and 1.5 kn of boat speed - properties that make an electronic steering device nearly redundant and enable crossing the doldrums under wind vane <b>self-steering.</b> An increasing number of long distance regatta sailors are using wind vane <b>self-steering</b> because of the fact, that the sails are always kept in optimal angle towards the wind, and hence the speed of the boat is kept at the possible maximum.|$|E
5000|$|Satellite {{tracking}} systems and <b>self-steering</b> antennas are used aboard ships, vehicles, or aircraft to maintain contact with satellites.|$|E

5000|$|Aside of the {{widespread}} mechanical <b>self-steering</b> through a wind vane being mechanically coupled to the rudder or a servo pendulum rudder, {{there is a}} mechanical self steering principle called [...] "sheet-to-tiller". Rollo Gebhard crossed the Atlantic in his 5.6 m long Solveig using such a method. The sheet-to-tiller <b>self-steering</b> consists of {{a connection between the}} spring-loaded tiller and a sheet using the force of the wind in the sail to steer the boat.|$|E
50|$|Yachts {{were also}} {{accepted}} with a two-person crew with <b>self-steering,</b> {{and there were}} handicap concessions for yachts choosing to sail without spinnakers.|$|E

50|$|Hasler {{is known}} as the father of single-handed sailing, owing to his {{invention}} of the first practical <b>self-steering</b> gear for yachts: many sailing vessels continue to rely on systems substantially based on Hasler's work.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} uses standard EMD components - an EMD 710 prime mover, D43 traction motors, radial (<b>self-steering)</b> bogies of patented design, which reduce wheel {{surface and}} flange wear and {{is said to}} improve adhesion and reduce track load.|$|E
50|$|The AC4400CW was {{the first}} GE {{locomotive}} to offer an optional <b>self-steering</b> truck design, intended to increase adhesion and reduce wear on the railhead. This option was specified by Canadian Pacific, Cartier Railway, CSX, Ferromex, Ferrosur, and KCS.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s doctor Herbert Scheffel of the SAR {{experimented with}} <b>self-steering</b> bogies {{which not only}} reduced flange wear on goods wagons, but also opened up the {{possibility}} of running at high speed in passenger service on Cape gauge.|$|E
50|$|Self-propelled modular transporters, some {{featuring}} a dozen and more <b>self-steering</b> axles {{with scores of}} rubber tires to spread out a load, are increasingly being manufactured. The ability of combination and self-propelled heavy haulers to carry loads of 100 tons is not unusual.|$|E
50|$|The race had a {{huge impact}} on ocean sailing, and in {{particular}} solo sailing. Hasler's wind-vane <b>self-steering</b> gear revolutionised short-handed sailing, and his other major innovation — using a junk rig for safer and more manageable shorthanded sailing — influenced many subsequent sailors.|$|E
50|$|Alongside instrumentation, B&G also {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} <b>self-steering</b> gear for sailing yachts. Their autopilots {{have been used}} by many short-handed racers, including Dame Ellen MacArthur during her single-handed circumnavigation race on Kingfisher in the 2000-01 Vendée Globe and her outright single-handed circumnavigation record on Castorama/B&Q.|$|E
5000|$|Howell {{is remembered}} less for his wartime {{achievements}} than for his innovations in ordnance. He invented the <b>self-steering</b> torpedo—the [...] "Howell torpedo"—and also patented torpedo launchers, gyroscopes for {{the guidance of}} torpedoes, explosive shells, a disappearing gun carriage for shore defense emplacement, and an amphibious lifeboat.|$|E
50|$|The {{main goal}} of a {{mechanical}} <b>self-steering</b> gear is to keep a sailboat on a given course towards the apparent wind and to free the helmsman from the steering job. An advantageous side effect is that the sails are kept in optimal angle towards the apparent wind and deliver optimal propulsion force by that. Even in sailboats running under engine, the self steering gear {{can be used to}} keep the boat heading into the wind to easily set or change sails (exception: sheet-to-tiller principle).As wind direction sensors are used a) a wind vane mounted on an axis being tilted more or less towards the horizon (wind vane self-steering)b) the pressure of the wind in the sail(s) and by that the force on the sheet (sheet to tiller <b>self-steering).</b>|$|E
