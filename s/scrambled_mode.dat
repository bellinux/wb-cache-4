40|$|We report herein {{the results}} of a series of {{round-robin}} experiments performed under strict procedures to determine the measurement veracity by which eventual standards may be established for measuring the effects of steady-state ionizing radiation on optical fibers. The responses of step index multimode, graded index multimode, and single-mode optical fibers exposed to ionizing radiations were measured by eight laboratories of the NATO Panel IV Research Study Group 12, Nuclear Effects Task Group, during the period of 1987 - 1989. The studies revealed that fiber wrap diameter, radiation dose rates, and launched power levels significantly influenced the measured radiation-induced attenuation in silica core multimode and single-mode fibers, while variations in these parameters did not affect the responses of Ge-doped silica core multimode fibers as severely. <b>Mode</b> <b>scrambling</b> and <b>mode</b> stripping were found not to be influential factors for increasing the measurement accuracies in either graded or step index fibers. Significant improvement in measurement accuracies from earlier studies was noted by reduction of the measurement deviation among the laboratories from greater than 25 % to less than 7 % of the peak induced attenuation.

40|$|A {{document}} discusses overcoming efficient {{optical coupling}} to high orbital momentum modes by slightly bending the taper dispersive element. This little shape distortion {{is not enough}} to <b>scramble</b> the <b>modes,</b> but it allows the use of regular, free-beam prism coupling, fiber coupling, or planar fiber on-chip coupling with, ultimately, 100 percent efficiency. The Bessel-beam waveguide is bent near the contact with the coupler, or a curved coupler is used. In this case, every Bessel-beam mode can be successfully coupled to a collimated Gaussian beam. Recently developed Bessel-beam waveguides allow long optical delay and very high dispersion. Delay values may vary from nanoseconds to microseconds, and dispersion promises to be at 100 s/nm. Optical setup consisted of a red laser, an anamorphic prism pair, two prism couplers, and a bent, single-mode fiber attached to prisms. The coupling rate increased substantially and corresponded to the value determined by the anamorphic prism pair...|$|R

Data is collected through observation and questionnaires and is analysed in time intervals. Each time interval is then given a control mode. Based on how the control mode changes over time, the performance of the team can be assessed. The protocol was tested in a pilot study where commanding staff exercises were analysed. The results show that the protocol can be used to identify differences in team performance. The study also gives empirical validity to COCOM in that the loss of control in emergencies corresponds to an opportunistic or a <b>scrambled</b> control <b>mode...</b>|$|R

Experiments have demonstrated quantum coherent behaviour in the long-time operation of the D-Wave quantum computer as well. Quantum coherence is the common feature between the two phenomena. An explanations for eight orders of magnitude discrepancy between the single flux qubit coherence time and the long-time quantum behaviour of an array of thousand flux qubits in the quantum computer was suggested within a theory where the flux qubits are coupled to an environment of particles called gravonons of high density of states The coherent evolution is in high dimensional spacetime and {{can be understood as}} a solution of Schroedinger's time-dependent equation. Explanations for the quantum beats observed in 2 D Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex in the green sulfur bacteria are presently sought in constructing transport theories based on quantum master equations where 'good' molecular vibrations ('coloured noise') in the chlorophyll and the surrounding protein scaffold knock the exciton oscillations back into coherence. These 'good' vibrations are claimed to have developed in three billion years of natural selection. These theories, however, face the discomforting experimental observation that "attempts to <b>scramble</b> vibrational <b>modes</b> or to shift resonances with isotopic substitution miserably failed to affect the beating signals".

Meanwhile, the real Garfield is enjoying a relaxing day all to himself, but is captured by Vetvix (who appeared in Comic Strip World earlier), who threatens him for the Klopman Crystal, but to no avil (because Garfield was a cartoon character). Garfield tried to protect the Klopman Crystal by putting it in his lemonade, and drinks it. But eventually Vetvix's guards get it. Garfield is told by Professor Wally to go over to Emperor Jon and him. He tells Garfield to grab the Professor's lens and puts them on the window. The sunlight burns the Emperor and the professor's ropes. Vetvix order her guards to get rid of Garfield, so they throw Garfield down the garbage chute. Back at Comic Studios, the gang is interrupted by Vetvix, who crashes her war ship into Comic Studios, and zombifies most of the characters at the studio. Nermal, Odie, Arlene, Jon, and Garzooka escape to the back alley. Garzooka is wondering why the serums haven't taken effect yet. He notices Garfield falling from sky. Then Odie, Nermal, and Arlene turn into their Pet Force counterparts. They plan to bring down Vetvix's ship using the antenna on top of a tall tower nearby. Vetvix's ship backs up, causing a bill board to break to pieces. The Pet Force hide under one of the broken pieces of the bill board and escape while being chased by zombies and manage to reach the tower by crashing through walls. Garfield, Jon, and a cartoon trash can are the only ones left in the back alley. Eli saves Garfield from Vetvix, by making the air vent suck him. Jon, however, gets scrambled with the trashcan. Vetvix causes chaos, zombifying all of Cartoon World. Eli scolds Garfield for not helping Garzooka and if haven't been so lazy then Vetvix wouldn't have gotten the Klopman Crystal. Eli and Garfield manage to find three survivors: Wally (Neil Ross), Wally's wife Bonita(Jennifer Darling), and Betty. Garfield decides to name himself and the survivors [...] "The Crazy Crew" [...] and form their own plan. Meanwhile, at the tower, Garzooka realizes the zombies are too much for the Pet Force. Luckily Garfield and Wally disguise themselves as Garzooka (Garfield stands on top of Wally to make the fake Garzooka taller)) and get the zombies attention.

The complex structure of the magnetic fleld configuration in the Large Helical Device (LHD), which has a large shear, complicates the analysis of the ECE spectrum. In a sheared magnetic field the propagation of X and O-mode polarization through the plasma are coupled, causing mode conversion and polarization rotation. <b>Mode</b> <b>scrambling</b> is also caused by wall reflections. In this report, this mode conversion in LHD is numcrically analyzed. It was found that at low density <b>mode</b> conversion <b>scrambles</b> the ECE spectra. However, at higher density (n_eo > 1. 0 10 ^ 19 m^- 3) the polarization mode is found to rotate with the sheared magnetic fileld, yielding only a negligible mode conversion.

40|$|Propagation {{of light}} beams through {{scattering}} or multimode systems {{may lead to}} the randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been <b>scrambled</b> into the <b>modes</b> of the scattering system. Here, we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual cross-talk of - 20 dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable {{in a wide range of}} optical applications...|$|R
40|$|For many {{applications}} in telecommunication, sensing and spectroscopy reliable all-solid state laser light sources are desirable. The great variety on ionic {{species of the}} lanthanides with which the host material of fiber lasers may be doped enables to cover the spectral range between 0. 9 and 3 µm. Besides tunability a high output power is often desirable calling for an adaption of the fiber design on the beam parameter product of high power diode laser arrays used as pump sources. The recently developed double clad fibers [1] fulfil these demands. The extraction efficiency of this fibers is very high (> 90 %) but the absorption of the pump light is considerably low due to the unavoidable appearance of gallery modes. Decentred cores. periodical bending or <b>mode</b> <b>scrambling</b> [2] can improve this efficiency up to about 70 %. In order to increase the output power and the absorption of the pump light we have chosen another fiber design which minimises the problems encountered with the gallery modes.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{study of the}} 2 ‐naphthol⋅H 2 O/D 2 O system was performed. Two different rotamers of 2 ‐naphthol (2 ‐hydroxynaphthalene, 2 HN) exist with the O–H bond in cis‐ and trans‐position relative to the naphthalene frame. Using Hartree–Fock (HF) calculations with the 6 ‐ 31 G(d,p) basis set, fully energy‐minimized geometries were computed for both cis‐ and trans‐ 2 HN⋅H 2 O of (a) the equilibrium structures with trans‐linear H‐bond arrangement and Cs symmetry and (b) the lowest‐energy transition states for H atom exchange on the H 2 O subunit, which have a nonplanar C 1 symmetry. Both equilibrium and transition state structures {{are similar to the}} corresponding phenol⋅H 2 O geometries. The H‐bond stabilization energies with zero point energy corrections included are ≊ 5. 7 kcal/mol for both rotamers, ≊ 2. 3 kcal/mol stronger than for the water dimer, and correspond closely to the binding energy calculated for phenol⋅H 2 O at the same level of theory. Extension of the aromatic Π‐system therefore hardly affects the H‐bonding conditions. The barrier height to internal rotation around the H‐bond only amounts to 0. 5 kcal/mol. Harmonic vibrational analysis was carried out at these stationary points on the HF/ 6 ‐ 31 G(d,p) potential energy surface with focus on the six intermolecular modes. The potential energy distributions and M‐matrices reflect considerable <b>mode</b> <b>scrambling</b> for the deuterated isotopomers. For the a' intermolecular modes anharmonic corrections to the harmonic frequencies were evaluated. The β 2 wag mode shows the largest anharmonic contributions. For the torsional mode τ (H 2 O H‐atom exchange coordinate) the vibrational level structure in an appropriate periodic potential was calculated. On the experimental side resonant‐two‐photon ionization and dispersed fluorescence emission spectra of 2 HN⋅H 2 O and d‐ 2 HN⋅D 2 O were measured. A detailed assignment of the bands in the intermolecular frequency range is given, based on the calculations.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{exploitation}} of the cladding pumping technique to scale the output power of rare-earth (Er 3 +, Er 3 +/Yb 3 +, Yb 3 +, and Nd 3 +) doped fibre amplifiers and lasers, and {{on the study of}} alternative pumping schemes and applications. In the first three chapters, the introduction of the cladding pumping scheme, its basic fibre geometries and fundamental analyses of double-clad fibres and their devices are presented. Chapter 4 describes an investigation of various Er 3 +-doped and Yb 3 + co-doped fibre devices. An Er 3 +/Yb 3 +-doped SM fibre amplifier pumped in the 820 nm band can not only avoid the excited state absorption (ESA) peaks of Er 3 + at 800 and 840 nm, but also have a higher ratio of ground state absorption to ESA than that of Er 3 + fibres. This enables a high gain amplifier with a much shorter fibre length. An experimental study of cladding pumped Er 3 +/Yb 3 + fibres in amplifier and laser forms shows the simplicity of power scaling and brightness conversion from high-power large-area multimode laser diodes into a single diffraction-limited fibre mode, and thus scales the output powers. Efficient operation of a three-level Er 3 +-doped double-clad fibre in both laser and amplifier forms is described. The fibre design of a low area ratio of the inner cladding to the core reduces the threshold to an acceptable level. The study of bending effects in large area ratio double-clad fibres indicates that a fibre having a concentric geometry can have nearly as high an efficiency as an eccentric core geometry if periodic bending is employed to promote <b>mode</b> <b>scrambling.</b> In contrast, double-clad fibres with eccentric cores and rectangular inner claddings were found to be relatively insensitive to bending. In order to obtain high-peak-power pulsed sources, various kinds of novel pulsed fibre lasers have been investigated. These include a cladding pumped Nd 3 + Q-switched fibre laser, an enhanced Q-switched double-clad fibre laser, a Q-switched Er 3 + fibre laser double-clad fibre with a large mode-area core, and a picosecond mode-locked Yb 3 +fibre laser. Cladding pumped amplification of short pulses can extract high energy stored in doped fibres, thus obtain pulses with high peak power and energy...|$|R
