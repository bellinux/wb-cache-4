50|$|A ramp-compare ADC {{produces}} a <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>signal</b> that ramps {{up or down}} then quickly returns to zero. When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the ramp voltage matches the input, a comparator fires, and the timer's value is recorded. Timed ramp converters require the least number of transistors. The ramp time is sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple oscillator. There are two solutions: use a clocked counter driving a DAC and then use the comparator to preserve the counter's value, or calibrate the timed ramp. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that comparing a second signal just requires another comparator, and another register to store the voltage value. A very simple (non-linear) ramp-converter can be implemented with a microcontroller and one resistor and capacitor. Vice versa, a filled capacitor can be taken from an integrator, time-to-amplitude converter, phase detector, sample and hold circuit, or peak and hold circuit and discharged. This has the advantage that a slow comparator cannot be disturbed by fast input changes.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe wind driven {{surface of a}} large anechoic tank was used to study forward scattered underwater sound. A 10 kHz <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>signal</b> was used to drive an omnidirectional source to insonify the rough surface. Direct and reflected path sound signals to a point hydrophone were separated by appropriate gating and the reflected path signal was analyzed for up to 2 minutes at 10 and 20 msec, intervals, using digital FFT spectral analysis. Graphs of sound pressure level vs. time for every 10 kHz from 30 kHz to 120 kHz (Surface roughnesses between 1. 1 and 10. 5) are shown. Correlation of the scattered sound pressure with frequency was analyzed. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that, for large roughnesses, the instantaneous scattered sound amplitudes are harmonic functions of sound frequency; that is, there is a consistent frequency separation between instantaneous amplitude maxima at one frequency and minima at another frequency.

40|$|Chaotic {{regimes of}} the {{microwave}} energy absorption are experimentally observed and analyzed for two-dimensional metallorganic antiferromagnet (NH_ 3) _ 2 (CH_ 2) _ 4 MnCl_ 4 at low temperatures under {{the conditions of}} nonlinear antiferromagnetic resonance. Relaxation oscillations of energy absorption are investigated in detail. Their frequency spectra, frequency-amplitude characteristics, and dependences of absorbed power on driving power and static magnetic field are studied. It is shown that the dynamics of relaxation oscillations undergoes a transition to chaos by "irregular periods". Peculiarities of the transition are described consistently. Among other things, the conditions {{for the emergence of}} energy absorption regimes with a spike-like and a <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>signal</b> structure are determined, and the characteristics of chaotic oscillations such as the dimensions of strange attractors are calculated. The chaotic dynamics is found to be high-dimensional with a large contribution from noise which is of deterministic origin in the antiferromagnet under investigation.

40|$|AbstractThree {{different}} multiple-valued logic (MVL) designs {{using the}} multiple-peak negative-differential-resistance (NDR) circuits are investigated. The basic NDR element, {{which is made}} of several Si-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOS) and SiGe-based heterojunction-bipolar-transistor (HBT) devices, can be implemented by using a standard BiCMOS process. These MVL circuits are designed based on the triggering-pulse control, <b>saw-tooth</b> input <b>signal,</b> and peak-control methods, respectively. However, there are some transient states existing between the multiple stable levels {{for the first two}} methods. These states might affect the circuit function in practical application. As a result, our proposed peak-control method for the MVL design can be used to overcome these transient states...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{structure}} of newly formed mineral crystals after electrical stimulation of osteoblast-like cells in vitro. Pulsed electrical stimulation was coupled capacitively or semi-capacitively to primary osteoblast-like cells derived from bovine metacarpals. Computer calculations revealed that the chosen input <b>signal</b> (<b>saw-tooth,</b> 100 V, 63 ms width, 16 Hz repetition rate) generated a short pulsed voltage drop of 100 μV (capacitive coupled mode) and of 350 μV (semi-capacitive coupled mode) across the cell-matrix layer. Stimulated cultures showed an enhanced mineral formation compared to the non stimulated controls. In cultures exposed to capacitively coupled electric fields and in control cultures nodules and mineralized globules were found. Nodules with a diameter of less than 200 nm covered the cell surface, whereas mineral globules with a diameter of up to 700 nm formed characteristic mineral deposits in the vicinity of the cells similar to biomineral formations occurring in mineralizing tissues. In contrast, large rod-shaped crystals were found in cultures stimulated by semi-capacitive coupled electric fields, indicating a non-physiological precipitation process. In conclusion, osteoblasts in culture are sensitive to electrical stimulation resulting in an enhancement of the biomineralization process...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{plane wave}} {{acoustic}} transmission properties, so called two-port data, of flow duct components {{is important in}} many applications. It is an important tool for instance {{in the development of}} mufflers for IC-engines. Accurate measurement of the acoustic two port data can be used not only to determine the transmission loss but also to determine physical properties like flow resistivty as well as speed of sound and impedance. Measurement of two-port data is difficult when the flow velocity in the measurement duct is high because of the flow noise contamination of the measured pressure signals. Techniques to improve the acoustic two-port determination have been tested in this paper. A number of possible configurations for connecting loudspeakers to the flow duct have been investigated. It was found that using a perforate pipe section with about 50 % porosity between the loudspeaker side branch and the duct gave the best signal-to-noise ratio out of the studied configurations. Different signal processing techniques have been tested for reducing the adverse effects of flow noise at the microphones. The most successful techniques require a reference signal which can be either the electric signal being input to the loudspeakers or one of the microphone signals. As a reference technique stepped sine excitation with cross-spectrum based frequency domain averaging was used. This technique could give good results for most cases. Using a periodic <b>signal</b> (<b>saw-tooth)</b> and synchronised time domain averaging good results could be obtained if a sufficient number of averages was used. At flow velocities higher than M= 0. 2 about 10000 averages were needed. Random excitation together with cross-spectrum based frequency domain averaging also gave good result if the same number of averages was used. Ordinary frequency domain averaging is not sufficient at high flow velocities. It was also shown that using cross-spectrum based frequency domain averaging an improvement could be obtained if the microphone with the highest signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency was used as the reference microphone rather than a fixed microphone.

40|$|Experimentat ion: An {{experimental}} {{system was}} set up to evalu-ate the system as shown in Fig. 1 with a length of 50 m high-birefringence fibre (York HB 800). A semiconductor laser (TXCK 1203) was used as the low coherence light source. Like other multimode laser diodes, in the coherence domain it has several side-band peaks. In the experiment, the diode was driven below its threshold so that all the coherence side peaks associated with the required signal peaks were suppressed to below the noise In the preliminary experiment, the spatial scan was simulated by a manual translation stage and a mirror oscillator which, driven by a <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>signal,</b> pro-vided linear spatial scan locally up to several wavelengths peak to peak. The AC interference signal produced was dis-played on a spectrum analyser. The sensors were located by maximising the fundamental signal through adjusting the position of the mirror M 1 in Fig. 1. Without any loss of generality, temperature was used as the measurand. Fig. 2 shows the signal amplitude variation as a function of temperature with the two squeezers 2. 5 cm apart...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} {{a simple and}} fast method to {{estimate}} the radiation-induced traps in P and N-MOS transistors independently. This method is based on standard current-voltage and Charge Pumping (I(V) -CP) to separate the radiation-induced border-traps (N bt) and true interface-traps (N it), where the radiation-induced oxide-traps (N ot) are extracted classically by measuring the threshold voltage (V th) or Mid-Gap (V mg) voltage shift. The charge pumping (CP) curves are measured using {{the rise and fall}} <b>saw-tooth</b> <b>signal</b> for N-and P-MOS transistors respectively, to minimize the border-trap estimation error caused by the difference in the energy band gap scanned by standard I(V) and CP techniques. Emphasis is made on critical comparison between the radiation induced N bt extracted using I(V) -CP and classical method such as OTCP and DTBT. According to experimental data, the I(V) -CP method is more accurate than OTCP and DTBT methods, since it is more sensitive than OTCP method for the extraction of border traps and it can gives all kinds of traps for P and N-MOS transistors separatel...|$|E
