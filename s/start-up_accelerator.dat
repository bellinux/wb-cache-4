40|$|Business accelerators {{are playing}} {{a key role in}} facilitating the process of new venture creation. Start-ups {{generally}} look for the best accelerators to make their long journey short. Media start-ups also look for a supportive mechanism to fasten their start-up experience. In this process, one of the main issues is to shorten their learning curve which is possible by use of <b>start-up</b> <b>accelerators.</b> Therefore, this chapter deals with the idea that which factors are important in this regard. To do so, first, a brief review of the support mechanisms is presented, and it is discussed that how <b>start-up</b> <b>accelerators</b> shorten the learning curve of the start-ups. Then, five media start-ups which were created in accelerators are studied. All of the cases were established after 2014, since the accelerators started working from the same year. According to the findings, there are mainly six reasons for shortening of the learning curve by <b>start-up</b> <b>accelerators,</b> including: (1) Short creation period, (2) Seminars and courses, (3) Co-working space, (4) Divided teams, (5) Cohort peers, and (6) Mentorship...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{hints at}} the accelerator as a new generation incubation model. Accelerators have become an umbrella term for any program providing a service structure of mentorship, networking opportunities and access to funding.

This inductive study investigates 13 accelerators across Europe and adopts a design lens to identify the accelerator model’s key design parameters. We identify five key building blocks and distinguish between three different types of accelerators, taking the primary design theme of the accelerator into account. We contribute to the incubation literature by extending recognition of the heterogeneity of incubation models, by delineating the accelerator as a distinctive incubation model and by introducing the design lens as a useful theoretical framework to investigate incubation models and their evolution...|$|R

Dose monitor linearity was studied at different dose calibration parameter (D 1 _C 0) by measuring ionization at 10 cm depth in a solid water phantom using a 0. 6 cc ionization chamber. Monitor unit stability was studied from different intensity modulated (IM) groups comprising various combinations of MU per field and number of fields.

40|$|The role of star-up {{firms in}} {{economy and the}} {{importance}} of venture capital investors for the growth of start-up firms have been highlighted in recent years. The growth challenges of start-up firms consist of fast changing environment, the availability of venture capital funding and the development of firm management in the growth phase. A growing number of studies have focused on management accounting systems and venture capital in start-up and growth firm context. In this thesis the role of management accounting systems and venture capital investors is considered in the growth phase of firm development. The theoretical objective of this thesis is to construct a theoretical framework in order to describe the importance of management accounting systems and venture capital investors in start-up firms. The practice orientated objective of this thesis is to study the application of management accounting systems and management accounting based information in start-up firms in high-technology industry as well as the impact of venture capital for management accounting system design. In addition, the growth challenges of start-up firms are studied {{in order to understand the}} context in which management accounting systems are used. The research approach of theoretical part is conceptual as the theoretical framework is constructed by combining literature on firm growth, management accounting and venture finance in order to analyse the phenomenon. The action-orientated research approach is appropriate for analysing and describing of the studied phenomenon through empirical evidence. The empirical evidence was collected through interviews with three experts in <b>start-up</b> firm <b>accelerator</b> centers, four representatives of start-up firms and one venture capital investor. The results indicate that the growth challenges of stat-up firms are not related to the development of management accounting systems. Managers of start-up firms expressed a positive attitude towards management accounting systems that improve efficiency of operations. In start-up firms flexible and adjustable management accounting practices, such as budgets, cash flow calculations and future-orientated analysis tools, are applied that support planning and coordination of operations. The results indicate that venture capital investors affect the provision and the quality of management accounting information during the investment process. In addition, venture capital investors enhance the use of management accounting information for internal coordination in start-up firms. By applying the theoretical framework in the analysis, it can be stated that by acting as support function management accounting systems facilitate start-up firms development...|$|R

Monitor unit stability was studied from different intensity modulated (IM) groups comprising various combinations of MU per field and number of fields. Stability of beam flatness and symmetry was investigated under normal and IMRT mode for 20 x 20 cm 2 field under small MU using a 2 D Profiler kept isocentrically at 5 cm depth. Inter segment response was investigated form 1 to 10 MU by measuring the dose per MU from various IM groups, each consisting of four segments with inter-segment separation of 2 cm. In the range 1 - 4 MU, the dose linearity error was more than 5 &#x 0025; (max - 32 &#x 0025; at 1 MU) for 6 MV x-rays at factory calibrated D 1 _C 0 value of 6000. The dose linearity error was reduced to - 10. 95 &#x 0025; at 1 MU, within - 3 &#x 0025; for 2 and 3 MU and &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 0025; for MU &# 8805; 4 when the D 1 _C 0 was subsequently tuned at 4500. For 18 MV x-rays, the dose linearity error at factory calibrated D 1 _C 0 value of 4400 was within &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 0025; for MU &# 8805; 3 with maximum of - 13. 5 observed at 1 MU. For both the beam energies and MU/field &# 8805; 4, the stability of monitor unit tested for different IM groups was within &#x 00 B 1; 1 &#x 0025; of the dose from the normal treatment field. This variation increases to - 2. 6 &#x 0025; for 6 MV and - 2. 7 &#x 0025; for 18 MV x-rays for 2 MU/field. No significant variation was observed in the stability of beam profile measured from normal and IMRT mode. The beam flatness was within 3 &#x 0025; for 6 MV x-rays and more than 3 &#x 0025; (Max 3. 5 &#x 0025;) for 18 MV x-rays at lesser irradiation time &# 8804; 3 MU. The beam stability improves {{with the increase in}} irradiation time. Both the beam energies show very good symmetry (&# 8804; 2 &#x 0025;) at all irradiation time. For all the three segment sizes studied, the nonlinearity was observed at smaller MU/segment in both the energies. When the MU/segment is &# 8805; 4, all segment size shows fairly linear relation with dose/MU. The smaller segment size shows larger nonlinearity at smaller MU/segment and become more linear at larger MU/segment. Based on our study, we conclude that the Primus LA from Siemens installed at our hospital is ideally suited for step-and-shoot IMRT preferably for radiation ON time &#x 00 B 3; 4 MU per segment...|$|R
