40|$|Dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and {{cholesterol}} have a comparable chemical structure. It is generally assumed that cholesterol and <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but quantitative data are lacking. Here, {{we report that}} mice deficient for ATP-binding cassette transporter G 5 (Abcg 5) or Abcg 8, with strongly elevated serum <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels, display dramatically increased (7 - to 16 -fold) <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels in the brain. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) -deficient mice also displayed elevated serum <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels, which was however not associated with significant changes in brain <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels. Abcg 5 - and Abcg 8 -deficient mice were found to carry circulating <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> predominantly in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -particles, whereas ApoE-deficient mice accommodated most of their serum <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) -particles. This suggests an important role for HDL and/or ApoE in the transfer of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> into the brain. Moreover, sitosterol upregulated apoE mRNA and protein levels in astrocytoma, but not in neuroblastoma cells, to a higher extend than cholesterol. In conclusion, dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> pass the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, where they may exert brain cell type-specific effect...|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are {{structurally}} {{related to}} cholesterol {{and can be}} divided into phytosterols and phytostanols, phytostanols being the saturated form of the phytosterols. Scientific studies indicate that consumption of 1. 5 - 3 g of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> per day can significantly reduce the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals if consumed as part of a healthy diet. To take advantage of the cholesterol-lowering effect, an increasing number of food products with added <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> or <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters have become available on the EU market. Unfortunately, the consumption of high doses of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> can also significantly reduce the blood levels of carotenoids. As a prudent precaution it has thus been suggested that intakes of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> should not exceed 3 g per day. Regular consumers of products with added <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> have been estimated to constitute about 10 - 15 % of the population. In general there seems so far to be little over-consumption of food products with added <b>plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> rather the average consumer exposure to <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> is on the low side of what is considered an effective dose. However, {{there seems to be an}} established subgroup of maybe 1 - 4 % of the population with intakes greater than the recommended 3 g of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> sustained for more than a year...|$|R
50|$|Mammalian cells cannot use <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> Normally, <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> {{are poorly}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract; fewer than 5% of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are absorbed compared to approximately 40% of cholesterol absorbed. The liver preferentially excretes <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> over cholesterol. Dietary sterols {{have recently been}} shown to passively enter intestinal cells, and subsequently the vast majority are pumped back into the gut lumen by ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter) proteins.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> such as {{sitosterol}} and campesterol {{are frequently}} administered as cholesterol-lowering supplements in food. Recently, {{it has been}} shown in mice that, in contrast to the structurally related cholesterol, circulating <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> can enter the brain. We questioned whether the accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in murine brain is reversible. After being fed a <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester-enriched diet for 6 weeks, C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl mice displayed significantly increased concentrations of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in serum, liver, and brain by 2 - to 3 -fold. Blocking intestinal sterol uptake for the next 6 months while feeding the mice with a plant stanol ester-enriched diet resulted in strongly decreased <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels in serum and liver, without affecting brain <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels. Relative to plasma concentrations, brain levels of campesterol were higher than sitosterol, suggesting that campesterol traverses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently. In vitro experiments with brain endothelial cell cultures showed that campesterol crossed the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than sitosterol.

40|$|Dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> supplementation {{has long}} been used as an {{effective}} means to reduce cholesterol absorption efficiency and thus lower plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. However, the exact mechanism by which <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> reduce cholesterol absorption has not been identified. Several mechanistic possibilities have been proposed and include <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> disruption of cholesterol solubility in intestinal micelles, plant sterol-cholesterol cocrystallization, and <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> competition with digestive enzymes. With the recent discovery of the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C 1 -Like 1 (NPC 1 L 1), it seems logical that <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> could also reduce cholesterol absorption through regulation of the NPC 1 L 1 pathway. We hypothesized that the beneficial effects of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are, at least in part, due to the altered gene expression of NPC 1 L 1. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed the AIN- 93 diet (control), or the AIN- 93 diet containing sitosterol or stigmasterol (2 g/ 2000 kcal) for 4 weeks. While <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> supplementation dramatically increased fecal neutral sterol excretion, intestinal expression of genes involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism were unchanged. Livers of all mice accumulated <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> primarily {{in the form of}} sitosterol, while <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> supplemented mice accumulated significantly more sitosterol and stigmasterol compared to control mice. In addition to the accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> livers of mice that consumed diets containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> exhibited reduced expression of the transcription factor sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP- 2) and its target gene HMG CoA reductase. In support of these data, we examined the mRNA expression of genes involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism from the intestine-derived cell lines FHs 74 Int and CaCo- 2 following treatment with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> In both cell lines there was a parallel reduction in mRNA expression of NPC 1 L 1 and the SREBP- 2 target gene HMG CoA reductase when treated with <b>plant</b> <b>sterol.</b> Our findings indicate that <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> alter the expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport, thus suggesting an intracellular mechanism—in addition to decreased micellar cholesterol solubility—by which <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and glucomannan on lipid profiles, plasma <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels and glycemic control in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects. Thirteen type 2 diabetic and sixteen non-diabetic individuals participated in a randomized crossover trial consisting of 4 phases, of 21 days each. During the study period, subjects were supplemented with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and/or glucomannan. Overall reductions of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were greater after consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and glucomannan compared to <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> or glucomannan supplementation alone. Plasma lathosterol levels, indicators of cholesterol biosynthesis, were decreased after combination treatment. The results suggest that a combination of glucomannan and <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> substantially improve plasma lipids by reducing cholesterol absorption and synthesis simultaneously.

40|$|Plant sterol-containing food {{products}} {{are known to}} reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, with the degree of placebo-adjusted reduction ranging from 5 % to 15 %. Factors that affect <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> efficacy such as the type of formulation and dosing frequency are still to be determined. Thus, {{the objective of this}} thesis was to investigate the impact of novel <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> preparations, frequency of intake and time of intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on cholesterol kinetics and/or plasma lipid profile. Three randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover, supervised feeding trials were conducted in 75 subjects with LDL levels of > 3. 0 mmol/L. The results from the 3 studies showed that: (i) traditional forms of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> did not reduce LDL levels when given as a single morning dose, thus the efficacy of the novel formulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> could not be confirmed; (ii) consumption of 1. 8 g/d of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> equally distributed over the day lowered LDL, whereas the consumption of the same dose once a day with breakfast did not lower LDL levels, in spite of a reduction in cholesterol absorption efficiency; (iii) cholesterol fractional synthesis rate (FSR) increased when <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> were consumed 3 times/d, but not as a single morning dose, which could be attributed to feedback upregulation of cholesterol FSR in response to reduced cholesterol absorption; and (iv) no overall reduction in LDL levels were observed when a 1. 6 g/d of single dose of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> provided in yoghurt was consumed with breakfast or dinner; however, a reduction in LDL was observed in subjects with low baseline cholesterol absorption efficiency irrespective of time of intake. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis to further identify any factors that could affect the efficacy of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and the results demonstrated that: (i) consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> reduce LDL levels by 0. 31 mmol/L; (ii) the reduction in LDL was greater in studies conducted on individuals with high baseline LDL levels; (iii) <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> incorporated into margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing, milk and yogurt reduced LDL levels to greater extent than <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> incorporated into other {{food products}}; and (iv) <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> consumed as single dose in the morning did not reduce plasma LDL levels. In conclusion, the consumption of single morning dose of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> may not be effective in reducing LDL levels, and that margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing, milk and yoghurt are the best food carrier of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> In addition, subjects' baseline LDL levels and cholesterol absorption efficiency influence the response to <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> Therefore, these findings could be used to improve <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> efficacy, as well as to establish future health claims...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundConsumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and <b>plant</b> stanols reduces low-density {{lipoprotein}} cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. At the same time, plasma <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> concentrations will increase after <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> consumption, but decrease after plant stanol consumption. In contrast to <b>plant</b> stanols, <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> can undergo oxidation and form oxyphytosterols. Findings from in vitro and animal {{studies suggest that}} oxyphytosterols might be atherogenic. ObjectiveThe objective was to examine whether <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> and stanol consumption changes fasting plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations. DesignA randomized, double blind, cross-over study was performed in which 43 healthy subjects (18 – 70 years) consumed for 4 weeks a plant sterol-enriched (3. 0  g/d of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols),</b> a <b>plant</b> stanol-enriched (3. 0  g/d of plant stanols), and a control margarine separated by wash-out periods of 4 weeks. Oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined in BHT-enriched plasma via GC–MS. ResultsCompared to control, serum LDL-C concentrations were reduced after <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> (− 8. 1 %; p <  0. 001) and plant stanol consumption (− 7. 8 %; p <  0. 001). <b>Plant</b> <b>sterol</b> consumption did not change plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations. On the other hand, intake of the plant stanol margarine reduced 7 β-OH-campesterol by 0. 07  ng/mL (∼ 14 %; p <  0. 01) and by 0. 07  ng/mL (∼ 15 %; p <  0. 01) compared with the control and sterol margarines, respectively. When standardized for serum cholesterol, effects on these oxyphytosterols were comparable. In addition, plant stanol intake reduced cholesterol-standardized 7 -keto-campesterol levels compared with <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> intake (p <  0. 05). ConclusionsDaily consumption of a plant sterol-enriched margarine does not increase oxyphytosterol concentrations, while plant stanol consumption may reduce the concentrations of the oxidative <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> metabolites 7 β-OH-campesterol and 7 -keto-campesterol.

40|$|Foods like margarine, milk, yoghurt drinks or bread, {{which have}} been {{fortified}} with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> are for sale on the German market. A health assessment of these foods was undertaken {{in accordance with the}} provisions of the Novel Foods Regulation. From this assessment we know that a maximum reduction in the plasma cholesterol level can generally be achieved by 1 - 2 g <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> daily and that raising the dose not markedly increases this effect. Furthermore, the daily consumption of effective amounts of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> inhibits the intake of certain carotinoids and fat-soluble vitamins from food and leads to an increase in the <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> level in blood plasma. As it still cannot be reliably estimated whether long-term adverse health impairments result from these two effects, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recommended limiting the daily consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> to 3 grams. Research findings from animal experiments from 2006 indicate that the consumption of large amounts of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> may {{have a negative impact on}} health. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has evaluated the results with regard to their importance for the health risk from phytosterols admixed to food. According to the Institute there are, in principle, no new risks linked to <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> The work does, however, highlight for the first time that the consumption of large amounts of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in the space of a few weeks leads to signs of vascular damage in laboratory animals. The establishment of dose-effect relationships concerning the onset of cardiovascular disease caused by the elevated intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> is not possible on the basis of the available studies.

50|$|The {{disorder}} is treated by strictly reducing the intake of foods rich in <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> (e.g., vegetable oils, olives and avocados). However, dietary therapy is never sufficient to control this disease since <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are constituents of all plant-based foods. Statins have been used, and while these lower cholesterol levels and may ameliorate atherosclerotic disease, <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> levels are insufficiently lowered by their use alone.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols {{are added}} to foods such as margarine, milk and bread, because of their {{cholesterol-lowering}} effect. Most foods with such additives are novel foods which must accordingly be assessed and approved {{in terms of their}} potential health risks. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are found in low quantities in all fatty plant-based foods such as oils, nuts, seeds and cereals. For humans, they are not essential and are hardly used in the human metabolism. Plant stanols are hydrolysed <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> which are not naturally present in plant-based foods. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) below assesses a study from the Netherlands which provides valuable information on the unwanted effects of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on human retinal microvessels.

Due to the amount of data available, the extent of this potential risk cannot currently be quantified.

The European Food Safety Agency currently recommends that daily consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols be limited to three grams.

These investigations were performed within the UK European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Norfolk Study and within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). In both studies, dietary intake of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> was estimated with food frequency questionnaires. Reported intake of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> was around 250 mg/day for men and 210 mg/day for women in northern Sweden. In the investigated UK population, the reported intake has previously been shown to be around 300 mg/day for both men and women. In the UK, bread and other cereals, vegetables and added fats were the three most important food sources of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> together contributing with more than 50 % of the total intake. In Sweden, intake of vegetable oil was highly correlated to both absolute and energy-adjusted <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> intake. In Sweden, <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> intake was inversely related to serum levels of total cholesterol in both men and women, and to serum levels of LDL-cholesterol in women. Odds ratio for a first MI was 0. 76 for men in the highest quarter of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> intake compared to men in the lowest quarter, while no effect was seen for women. The present epidemiological studies suggest that dietary intake of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> reduce serum levels of cholesterol and reduce the risk of contracting a first MI. Advice to enhance intake of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> may be incorporated in the nutritional treatment of hyperlipidaemia and into the prevention of CVDs. To firmly establish the effect of naturally occurring <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, intervention studies are however needed...|$|R
40|$|Dietary supplementation with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols,</b> stanols, {{and their}} esters reduces {{intestinal}} cholesterol absorption, thus lowering plasma LDL cholesterol concentration in humans. It was suggested that these beneficial effects are attributable {{in part to}} induction of genes involved in intestinal cholesterol transport, e. g., Abcg 5 and Abcg 8, via the liver X receptor (LXR), but direct proof is lacking. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a purified diet (control), diets containing cholesterol (0. 12 g/ 100 g) only, or in combination with either <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> or stanols (0. 5 g/ 100 g) for 4 wk. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols dramatically increased neutral fecal sterol excretion (2. 2 and 1. 4 -fold, respectively, compared with cholesterol-fed mice; P < 0. 05). Cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were higher in livers of mice fed cholesterol compared with controls (+ 135 % and + 925 %; P < 0. 05). <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols completely prevented cholesterol accumulation as well as induction of LXR target genes in liver. Feeding <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols did not alter intestinal expression of Abcg 5, Abcg 8, or other LXR target genes nor of Npc 1 / 1. Fractional cholesterol absorption in Abcg 5 (-/-) mice was reduced {{to the same extent}} by dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> (49 %) as in wild-type littermates (44 %). <b>Plant</b> <b>sterol</b> and stanol-induced reduction of cholesterol absorption in mice is not associated with upregulation of intestinal LXR target genes nor is it influenced by Abcg 5 -deficiency.

40|$|High serum LDL {{cholesterol}} {{concentration is}} a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. This risk can be lowered by diet. In this respect foods containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> or stanol esters can be useful for mildly- and hypercholesteraemic subjects. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols, which are structurally related to cholesterol, decrease the incorporation of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles. This lowers cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, these components increase ABC-transporter expression, which may {{also contribute to the}} decreased cholesterol absorption. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity increase, which ultimately leads to decreased serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. Animal studies have further shown that these dietary components may also lower atherosclerotic lesion development. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols also lower plasma lipid-standardized concentrations of the hydrocarbon carotenoids, but not those of the oxygenated cartenoids and tocopherols. Also, vitamin A and D concentrations are not affected. Although absorption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols (0. 02 - 3. 5 %) is low compared to cholesterol (35 - 70 %), small amounts are found in the circulation and may influence other physiological functions. However, there is no consistent evidence that <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> or stanols can change the risk of colon or prostate cancer, or immune status. In conclusion, <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols effectively reduce serum LDL cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk. In addition potential effects of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> and stanols on other metabolic processes remain to be elucidated. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: This review discusses the background to <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> use and reviews evidence about its use in clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on supplementing the daily diet with <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester-enriched milk derivatives {{in order to reduce}} LDL-cholesterol levels and, consequently, cardiovascular risk. However, clinical practice guidelines on hypercholesterolaemia state that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend their use in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the efficacy of the intake of 2 g of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters a day in lowering LDL-cholesterol levels in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolaemia. The specific objectives are: 1) to quantify the efficacy of the daily intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters in lowering LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and cardiovascular risk in patients with hypercholesterolaemia; 2) to evaluate the occurrence of adverse effects of the daily intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters; 3) to identify the factors that determine a greater reduction in lipid levels in subjects receiving <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester supplements. Methods/Design Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled experimental trial carried out at family doctors' surgeries at three health centres in the Health Area of Albacete (Spain). The study subjects will be adults diagnosed with "limit" or "defined" hypercholesterolaemia and who have LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dl or over. A dairy product in the form of liquid yoghurt containing 2 g of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester per container will be administered daily after the main meal, for a period of 24 months. The control group will receive a daily unit of yogurt not supplemented with <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters that has a similar appearance to the enriched yoghurt. The primary variable is the change in lipid profile at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The secondary variables are: change in cardiovascular risk, adherence to the dairy product, adverse effects, adherence to dietary recommendations, frequency of food consumption, basic physical examination data, health problems, lipid-lowering medication, physical activity, smoking habits and socio-demographic variables. Discussion If <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester supplements were effective a sounder recommendation for the consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia could be made.

40|$|The ABC {{transporters}} ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 limit absorption {{and promote}} excretion of dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols.</b> It {{is not known}} why <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are so assiduously excluded from the body. Here we show that accumulation of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in mice lacking ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 (G 5 G 8 –/– mice) profoundly perturbs cholesterol homeostasis in the adrenal gland. The adrenal glands of the G 5 G 8 –/– mice were grossly abnormal in appearance (brown, not white) due to a 91 % reduction in cholesterol content. Despite the very low cholesterol levels, there was no compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein receptor expression. Moreover, levels of ABCA 1, which mediates sterol efflux, were increased 10 -fold in the G 5 G 8 –/– adrenals. Adrenal cholesterol levels returned to near-normal levels in mice treated with ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol absorption. To determine which <b>plant</b> <b>sterol(s)</b> caused the metabolic changes, we {{examined the effects of}} individual <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> on cholesterol metabolism in cultured adrenal cells. Addition of stigmasterol, but not sitosterol, inhibited SREBP- 2 processing and reduced cholesterol synthesis. Stigmasterol also activated the liver X receptor in a cell-based reporter assay. These data indicate that selected dietary <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> disrupt cholesterol homeostasis by affecting two critical regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} both {{efficacy and}} safety in humans of long-term consumption of spreads containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters. Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial. Subjects: Hundred and eighty-five healthy volunteers (35 - 64 y). Intervention: Volunteers daily consumed 20 g spread enriched with 1. 6 g <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> as fatty acid esters or a control spread for 1 y. They continued their habitual diet and lifestyle. Outcome measures included efficacy markers such as total and LDL-cholesterol, a large range of safety parameters, and reporting of adverse events. Results: Consumption of the <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> ester-enriched spread consistently lowered total and LDL cholesterol during the 1 y period on average by 4 and 6 %, respectively (0. 01 0. 05). However, carotenoid concentrations changed over time. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterols</b> intake reduced lipid adjusted α- and β-carotene-concentrations by only 15 - 25 % after 1 y, relative to control. Lipid-adjusted fat-soluble vitamin concentrations remained unchanged. <b>Plant</b> <b>sterol</b> concentrations in serum were increased from 2. 76 to 5. 31 (μmol/mmol total cholesterol) for campesterol (P < 0. 0001) and from 1. 86 to 2. 47 (μmol/mmol total cholesterol) for β-sitosterol (P < 0. 0001). The increase in total <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> concentration in {{red blood cells}} (5. 29 - 9. 62 μg/g) did not affect red blood cell deformability. Hormone levels in males (free and total testosterone) and females (luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, β-estradiol and progesterone) {{as well as all}} clinical chemical and hematological parameters measured were unaffected. Adverse events reported were not different between subjects consuming control spread and subjects consuming <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters-enriched spread. Conclusion: Consumption of a <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> esters-enriched spread is an effective way to consistently lower blood cholesterol concentrations and is safe to use {{over a long period of}} time...|$|R

Differences in <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> efficacy between diabetic and nondiabetic persons have not been examined. Objective: The objective was to compare the degree of response of plasma lipid concentrations and glycemic control to <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> consumption in a controlled diet between hypercholesterolemic type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Design: Fifteen nondiabetic subjects and 14 diabetic subjects partici-pated in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled feeding trial. The diet included 1. 8 g/d of either <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> or corn-starch placebo over 21 d, separated by a 28 -d washout period. Results: <b>Plant</b> <b>sterol</b> consumption significantly reduced (P 0. 05) LDL-cholesterol concentrations from baseline in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects by 15. 1 % and 26. 8 %, respectively. The dia-betic subjects had significantly (P 0. 05) lower absolute concen-trations of total cholesterol after treatment than did the nondiabetic subjects; however, {{there was no significant}} difference in the per-centage change from the beginning to the end of the trial. There was also a significant decrease (P 0. 05) in absolute non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations after treatment in both groups.

40|$|Background: Increased {{consumption}} of foods containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> {{has the potential}} to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and thus reduce costs associated with treating that disease in a significant way. This paper reports the results of an investigation of the potential monetary benefits of allowing foods enriched with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> to be marketed in Canada. Objective: The objective of this research was to estimate the annual savings that would accrue to Canada&#x 0027;s single-payer publicly funded health care system if <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> were approved for use. If foods containing <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> are consumed at a sufficient rate, a reduction in CHD should follow. Given the significant costs associated with CHD, approval of <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> in Canada has important public policy implications. Design: This research employs a variation of traditional cost-of-illness analysis entailing four steps: (1) estimation of a &#x 2018;success rate&#x 2019; (proportion of persons who would consume <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> at the necessary rate); (2) presumption of blood cholesterol reduction due to <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> consumption; (3) assumption of reduction in CHD that follows from blood cholesterol reduction; and (4) calculation of cost savings associated with reduced incidence of CHD. Results: Calculations were carried out for four scenarios: ideal, optimistic, pessimistic, and very pessimistic. It was estimated that between &#x 0024; 38 million (very pessimistic scenario) and &#x 0024; 2. 45 billion (ideal scenario) could be saved annually by Canada&#x 0027;s health care system with plant sterol-enriched food products being made available for sale. Conclusion: Significant expenditure reductions within Canada&#x 0027;s publicly funded health care system could be realized with <b>plant</b> <b>sterols</b> approved for sale.
