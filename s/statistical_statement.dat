60|$|But the {{apartment}} as the New-Yorkers now mostly have it, {{was at the}} same time evolving from another direction. The poorer class of New York work-people had for a long period before the war lived, as they still live, in vast edifices, once thought prodigiously tall, which were called tenement-houses. In these a family of five or ten persons is commonly packed in two or three rooms, and even in one room, where they eat and sleep, without the amenities and often without the decencies of life, and of course without light and air. The buildings in case of fire are death-traps; but the law obliges the owners to provide some apparent means of escape, which they do in the form of iron balconies and ladders, giving that festive air to their façades which I have already noted. The bare and dirty entries and staircases are really ramifications of the filthy streets without, and each tenement opens upon a landing as if it opened upon a public thoroughfare. The rents extorted from the inmates is sometimes a hundred per cent., and is nearly always cruelly out of proportion to the value of the houses, not to speak of the wretched shelter afforded; and when the rent is not paid the family in arrears is set with all its poor household gear upon the sidewalk, in a pitiless indifference to the season and the weather, which you could not realize without seeing it, and which is incredible even of plutocratic nature. Of course, landlordism, which you have read so much of, is at its worst {{in the case of the}} tenement-houses. But you must understand that comparatively few people in New York own the roofs that shelter them. By far the greater number live, however they live, in houses owned by others, by a class who prosper and grow rich, or richer, simply by owning the roofs over other men's heads. The landlords have, of course, no human relation with their tenants, and really no business relations, for all the affairs between them are transacted by agents. Some have the reputation of being better than others; but they all live, or expect to live, without work, on their rents. They are very much respected for it; the rents are considered a just return from the money invested. You must try to conceive of this as an actual fact, and not merely as a <b>statistical</b> <b>statement.</b> I know it will not be easy for you; it is not easy for me, though I have it constantly before my face.|$|E

She opened the article by showing the growing prominence of women in American libraries through comparison of three conferences of the American Library Association. “At the first meeting of the Association in Philadelphia, 1876, only 12 of the 103 members present were women; at the Chicago meeting in 1893, 166 of the 305 members present were women; at Magnolia in 1902, the largest conference yet held, 736 out of 1018 members present were women”. To further illustrate her opinion that there was no discrimination in regard to sex in the American Library Association, she refers to Miss Caroline M. Hewins, librarian of the Hartford Public Library, who was the first woman to ask a question before a meeting of the American Library Association in 1877, the association’s second meeting, and Miss Mary A. Bean, the librarian of the Brookline Public Library, who was the first woman to appear on a library program, by reading a paper on “The evil of unlimited freedom in the use of juvenile fiction” in the 1879 meeting in Boston. [...] Cutler Fairchild credits the open-minded attitude {{of the men in the}} library movement for contributing to the lack of self-consciousness displayed by women in association meetings by taking what women said or wrote at its actual value. However, she noted that participation by women in American Library Association meetings was disproportionate to their attendance. Cutler Fairchild continued her evaluation of women in libraries by surveying 100 representative libraries to access the number of professional and non-professional positions and their salaries held by women as compared to those held by men. The results of her inquiries proved that women greatly outnumbered men in the libraries selected, holding a large proportion of administrative positions but with little administrative responsibility, and outnumbered men in non-administrative responsible positions, but seldom held positions with the most responsibility. In addition, women did not hold positions offering the highest salaries, but rather appeared to perform the same level of work for less compensation.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a selective review of some contemporary approaches to program evaluation. One motivation for our review is the recent emergence and {{increasing use of}} {{a particular kind of}} "program" in applied microeconomic research, the so-called Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design of Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). We organize our discussion of these various research designs by how they secure internal validity: in this view, the RD design can been seen as a close "cousin" of the randomized experiment. An important distinction which emerges from our discussion of "heterogeneous treatment effects" is between ex post (descriptive) and ex ante (predictive) evaluations; these two types of evaluations have distinct, but complementary goals. A second important distinction we make is between <b>statistical</b> <b>statements</b> that are descriptions of our knowledge of the program assignment process and <b>statistical</b> <b>statements</b> that are structural assumptions about individual behavior. Using these distinctions,we examine some commonly employed evaluation strategies, and assess them with a common set of criteria for "internal validity", the foremost goal of an ex post evaluation. In some cases, we also provide some concrete illustrations of how internally valid causal estimates can be supplemented with specific structural assumptions to address "external validity": the estimate from an internally valid "experimental" estimate {{can be viewed as a}} "leading term" in an extrapolation for a parameter of interest in an ex ante evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{textbook}} {{presentation of the}} concept of umklapp vs normal phonon-phonon scattering processes in the context of lattice thermal conductivity. A simplistic picture, in which the "momentum conservation" in a normal process leads to the conservation of the heat flux, is only valid within the single-velocity Debye model of phonon dispersion. Outside this model, the simple "momentum conservation" argument is demonstrably inaccurate and leads to conceptual confusion. Whether or not an individual scattering event changes the direction of the energy flow is determined by the phonon group velocity, which, unlike the quasimomentum, is a uniquely defined quantity independent of the choice of the primitive cell in reciprocal space. Furthermore, the statement that normal processes do not lead to a finite thermal conductivity when umklapp processes are absent is a <b>statistical</b> <b>statement</b> that applies to a phonon distribution rather than to individual scattering events. It is also important to understand that once umklapp processes are present, both normal and umklapp processes contribute to thermal resistance. A nuanced explanation of the subject would help avoid confusion of the student and establish a connection with cutting edge research. (C) 2014 American Association of Physics Teachers...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although non-adherence to an {{immunosuppressive}} regimen (NAH) is a {{major risk}} factor for poor outcome after renal transplantation (RTx), very {{few studies have examined}} non-adherence intervention in this context. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested the efficacy of an educational-behavioural intervention to increase adherence in non-adherent RTx patients. We also assessed how NAH evolves over time. METHODS: Eighteen RTx non-adherent patients (age: 45. 6 +/- 1. 2 yr; 78. 6 % male) were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (IG) (n = 6) or an enhanced usual care group (EUCG) (n = 12), the latter receiving the usual clinical care. The IG received one home visit and three telephone interviews. We assessed NAH through electronic monitoring (EM) of medication intake during a nine-month period (three months intervention, six months follow-up). RESULTS: Five of 18 patients withdrew. Inclusion in the study resulted in a remarkable decrease in NAH in both groups over the first three months (IG chi(2) = 3. 97, df = 1, p = 0. 04; EUCG chi(2) = 3. 40, df = 1, p = 0. 06). The IG showed the greatest decrease in NAH after three months, although this did not reach statistical significance (at 90 d, chi(2) = 1. 05, df = 1, p = 0. 31). Thereafter, NAH increased gradually in both groups, reaching comparable levels {{at the end of the}} six-month follow-up (i. e. at nine months). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an inclusion effect.

40|$|Status Quo: Automated {{systems will}} replace the human {{operator}} at different tasks in everyday life. From today’s perspective, these new technologies offer predicted but also unknown benefits. However, as every other new technology, also automated systems will have drawbacks for some stakeholders in our society. As long as new technologies are within readiness levels of research, their impact is mostly negligible. The technology readiness level of automated driving in road traffic is pushed forward strongly by many researchers and developers all over the world. Consequently, the demand for safety assurance gets urgent. From today’s perspective, a concept that evaluates the safety of automated driving in an affordable and meaningful way is missing. However, this concept is necessary to enable the introduction of automated driving to public road traffic. Objectives: The objective of this thesis {{is to improve the}} understanding of the challenge for safety assurance on automated vehicles. Therefore a concept is aimed for, that estimates the safety impact for the stakeholders of automated driving. Estimations are always based on assumptions and suffer from uncertainty. For that reason the concept needs to consider and express the underlying assumptions and uncertainties. Methodology: The methodology for reaching the objectives is formed around the core assumption of the concept: The safety of an Object under Test can be described by the parameter of a probability distribution. This parameter connects the number of events that result from driving a distance with the safety performance of the OuT. Based on this core assumption a model for safety evaluation is developed iteratively. First of all the relevant stakeholders that are influenced by the technology are identified and analyzed. The second step identifies measurable requirements for the safety of automated vehicles from the stakeholder’s perspectives. Based on this preliminary work on the one hand a usage strategy is defined that controls the introduction of automated vehicles. On the other hand an examination strategy is developed to evaluate whether this strategy enables the automation to meet the requirements. In step four the usage strategy is examined for the Autobahn automation being one representative use case. The results, meaning testing effort and introduction possibilities, are compared and discussed. A refinement of stakeholders as well as requirements is performed. Such a refinement is necessary as only a more precise and subtle analysis will lead to a share between efforts and benefits of the introduction of automated vehicles that forms a basis for the discussion on the safety assurance challenge. Results: The results of the thesis can be grouped into four mayor insights. Firstly, the number of rare events like accidents can be handled as being a product of a random experiment that depends on a safety performance of a traffic participant and the number of driven kilometers. From today’s perspective a falsification of this approach was not found and thus builds a simple first approach. Secondly, the statistical proof of safety based on real-world driving is not economically feasible before mass application of the automated vehicle. Thirdly, refinement of the requirements is necessary and justifiable to reduce the safety requirements. Splitting up the requirements of society and vehicle users leads to reduced testing efforts and an uncertainty-based usage strategy. This uncertainty most likely will reduce during usage, thus also enabling a <b>statistical</b> <b>statement</b> on safety at one point in future. Lastly, a method consisting of evaluation criteria as well as an introduction simulation is developed to examine proposed usage strategies. Thereby the possible safety impacts of the usage are studied. Conclusion: As the safety of automated driving cannot be proven statistically before introduction, the introduction needs to be performed despite and under consideration of an estimated uncertainty. This {{does not mean that the}} introduced vehicles are less safe compared to their benchmark; however during introduction it will be uncertain. As long as the uncertainty stays above a threshold a usage strategy that is included into the safety assurance concept is necessary. Such a usage strategy would be cautious and based on regular observation of the events encountered by introduced vehicles. Several challenges have been identified for the developed introduction concept of automated vehicles. Based on these challenges further work should mainly address two topics: 1. The identification and collection of data that is necessary for concept application. 2. The answer of an unavoidable question: How much harm, caused by a human built machine, is acceptable for the exposed humans...|$|E
