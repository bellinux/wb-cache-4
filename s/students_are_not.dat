5|$|Georgetown is {{the oldest}} Catholic and Jesuit-affiliated {{institution}} {{of higher education in}} the United States. The Jesuits have participated in the university's academic life, both as scholars and as administrators, since 1805; however, the university has always been governed independently of the church. At present, the majority of Georgetown <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> Catholic.|$|E

Anyone wishing to discuss a school issue can call schoolwide meetings.|$|E

30|$|The ZIP {{regression}} model {{indicates that the}} number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> receiving <b>is</b> 2.2 [1.3, 3.8] times greater for CoP instructors while controlling for other factors (p <. 01). In addition, CoP instructors were less likely to have no segments where <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> receiving—or, in other words, were less likely to have students receiving in every observed segment (p =. 04). The number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> receiving <b>is</b> 3.2 [1.3, 5.5] times lower for foundational courses (p <. 01). Instructor rank was related to the number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> receiving. As compared to non-tenure track faculty, the number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> receiving <b>was</b> 2.7 [1.5, 6.8] times lower for associate or full professors (p=. 03); however, there was no difference for assistant professors (p =. 51). In other words, the number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> receiving was higher for assistant professors as compared to non-tenure track faculty. Course size <b>was</b> <b>not</b> related to the number of segments when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> receiving (p=. 79).|$|R

5|$|Lafayette College {{encompasses}} a lively Greek community. Though <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> eligible to join these organizations until sophomore year, approximately 40.20% of eligible students join the school's fraternities and sororities. All {{but two of}} the Greek organizations at Lafayette are located on campus, making it a viable living option. Additionally, members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year as these groups work together with the college, local, and national affiliates to help achieve the goals and ideals their organizations were founded upon.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Northland {{requested}} {{inclusion in}} the Wisconsin Tuition Grant Program, so that undergraduate students from Wisconsin attending Northland could receive state financial assistance. In August 2009, the Wisconsin Higher Education Aids Board determined that Northland <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> eligible for state financial aid because the college's accreditation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> from a regional accreditation organization. Northland appealed the ruling to agency's board, citing TRACS' federal government recognition.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} who arrive at the student union per minute will likely not follow a Poisson distribution, because the rate is not constant (low rate during class time, high rate between class times) and the arrivals of individual <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> independent (students tend to come in groups).|$|E
