5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E

He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

25|$|A {{component}} of trade {{is the social}} premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where {{and how it is}} spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.|$|E
25|$|A new {{qualifying}} system {{consisting of}} three sessions of varying length was introduced. A 15-minute session was held first, {{in which the}} six slowest cars from that session were eliminated and thus set in grid positions 17–22. After a five-minute break, another 15-minute session was held with the remaining cars, and again the six slowest cars were eliminated and set in positions 11–16. These twelve eliminated drivers were placed in parc fermé, but allowed to modify fuel loads as they <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rabbis in the Talmud, {{and those}} in the Middle Ages, saw fit to spell out that, aside from in {{questions}} of marriage, a mamzer should be treated as an ordinary Jew. The Talmud insists that a mamzer should be considered as an ordinary relative for the purpose of inheritance, including levirate marriage. Maimonides and Joseph ben Ephraim Karo <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> to repeat this, and confirm that a mamzer can serve as a judge. Similarly a tosafa insists that it is permissible for a mamzer to become a king.|$|E

25|$|The {{laws are}} {{generally}} {{presented as a}} set of general principles and guidelines which each individual Bahá'í must apply to their own lives as they <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Bahá'í law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Bahá'í behaviour; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Bahá'í behaviour, such as how to dress, are a matter of individual choice and not Bahá'í law. This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|A magical {{record is}} a journal or other source of {{documentation}} containing magical events, experiences, ideas, {{and any other}} information that the magician may <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> to add. There can be many purposes for such a record, such as recording evidence to verify the effectiveness of specific procedures (per the scientific method that Aleister Crowley claimed should {{be applied to the}} practice of Magick) or to ensure that data may propagate beyond the lifetime of the magician. Benefits of this process vary, but usually include future analysis and further education by the individual and/or associates with whom the magician feels comfortable in revealing such intrinsically private information.|$|E

25|$|Police {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the legislative and executive {{branches of the}} various states through the enactment and enforcement of laws. States {{have the power to}} compel obedience to these laws through whatever measures they <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the United States Constitution or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include legal sanctions, physical means, and other forms of coercion and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Current {{campaign}} {{known as}} Project AWARE is working globally to advocate solutions for long-term protection for these animals. Created initially {{as an environmental}} initiative project, this campaign {{was developed by the}} Professional Associations of Diving Instructors (PADI) in 1989. Used to educate divers about environmental problems this program eventually grew to become a registered non-profit organization in the US in 1992 and eventually became recognized in the UK and Australia in 1999 and 2002 respectively. In spite of the arising issues with marine challenges, Project AWARE has continued to grow towards meeting the needs of the marine ecosystem as they <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Marine debris and shark and ray conservation activism are the two most prevalent issues that are being further worked toward improving since 2011.|$|E
25|$|Academic tenure's {{original}} {{purpose was to}} guarantee the right to academic freedom: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from prevailing opinion, openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics. Thus academic tenure {{is similar to the}} lifetime tenure that protects some judges from external pressure. Without job security, the scholarly community as a whole may experience pressure to favor noncontroversial lines of academic inquiry. The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions as they <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> and to report their honest conclusions. However, it has also become a type of job security for professors.|$|E
