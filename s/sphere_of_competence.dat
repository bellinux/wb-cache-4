Specific obstacles to the development of spatial information systems involve the use of computers, problems of confidentiality, and problems of data exchange.

40|$|The European Union has {{maintained}} that the obligations incumbent upon it {{in the area of}} human rights stem from its own internal legal order. Under this limited approach, the EU is merely under an obligation not to violate human rights when it acts (i. e. a negative obligation to respect human rights) and effectively only to respect those rights enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights. This article explores how the EU may be subject to more extensive human rights obligations, incumbent on it by virtue of international law. As an intergovernmental organization and subject to international law, the EU can be said to be bound by customary international law, treaties to which it is a party, and human rights treaties entered into individually by Member States through the principle of succession or substitution. This would extend the range of applicable rights far beyond those in the ECHR to other obligations in, for instance, UN human rights treaties. It also implies that the EU must not merely refrain from violating human rights, but also that, within its <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> it should take positive measures to protect and fulfill human rights...|$|R

First, I must frankly say that at this stage (before this Town Meeting in Darmstadt) our work is largely incomplete: for a number of reasons, the time actually at my disposal to organise the contributions was very short and this can explain many failures. In particular, the lack of time is the reason why a draft report has not been published in the web in advance, as happened for those of the other groups. I apologise for this and intend therefore to consider the Town Meeting as a starting point rather than the final one for the work of the group. Contributions, suggestions, criticisms are welcome and strongly encouraged to come from the meeting attendants in Darmstadt, and also from the wider community of nuclear physicists during the next few months. The second consideration is that the topics of applied nuclear physics are so many that-even with sufficient time at disposal- a comprehensive overview on all of them is a very hard task to anybody. The <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> involved by the applications of nuclear physics is dramatically varied since they include disciplines thousands of miles away from each other, not only as to their subjects but also in terms of the mental attitude to approach them.

The relevance of chosen research topic {{is due to the}} fact that successful reforming of government in Ukraine is impossible without learning the experience (both positive and negative) of national reforms in foreign countries. Special urgency has the research of territorial organization of power in Canada ? the country, the Ukrainian diaspora of which is the largest in the world and which, according to the level of socio-economic development and democracy of power institutions, is one of the world leaders. The article?s objective is deepening theoretical knowledge on territorial organization of power in Canada. It is noted that the Constitution of Canada of 1982 establishes two areas <b>of</b> competence: the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> exclusive <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> the federation covering the matters within the jurisdiction of only federal authorities and the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> exclusive <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> the objects of federation covering the matters related to the jurisdiction of only agencies of the objects of federation. The activities of the federal system of law enforcement agencies in Canada belong to the exclusive jurisdiction of federation. The administrative authorities of Canadian provinces are constructed on the same principle as the federal ones. Each has its own legislature; in some provinces ? it is unicameral legislative assembly, while others have ? bicameral parliament. For example, the parliament in Quebec consists of the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly. The author of the article has noted the specifics of Canada, in particular the fact that the subjects of federation are deprived of financial autonomy. Their own incomes are extremely limited; they can exist only through subsidies and grants that are obtained from the Federal Government. Financial dependence is a significant addition to that constitutional mechanism with the assistance of which the central government subordinates and controls the subjects of federation. As a result, it is stated that the territorial organization of power in Canada is largely dependent on the political and territorial system of the state, differentiation <b>of</b> the <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> federal and provincial levels. ??????????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????, ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ????????...|$|R
