2500|$|Rick Bentley of the Ventura County Star {{said that}} it was unusual for a cartoon creator to select a wallaby as a main character. Bentley also stated that the Rocko {{universe}} was influenced by [...] "everything from Looney Tunes to underground comics". The staff of the show were fans of outrageous comedy, both animated and not animated. Tom Kenny cited Looney Tunes and SCTV as influences for the show, and also stated [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> asked Joe Murray or Mr. Lawrence or any of those guys, especially in terms of animation, the weirdest cartoons would of course be our favorites—those weird '30s Fleischer brothers Betty Boop cartoons and stuff like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes {{the same thing}} over and over. Anyway, I'm not really a metal dude. None of us are. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, keep on trying. I feel <b>sure</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could only}} find {{something}} to do, it doesn't matter what, father would be quite different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{your father}} will never permit it, Miss Hawtrey. I am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will not go}} home with me he will himself come out to fetch you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come away, Massas, come away!" [...] he cried, {{his eyes}} {{starting}} from his head. [...] "The debbil get you <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stay up there." ...|$|E
60|$|Gom. No, {{you have}} taken some about me; I am <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are her brother, my sides can show the tokens of our alliance.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would have}} been <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't become so {{unexpectedly}} quiet after I left Marmion. You seemed to concur, {{to be willing to}} wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that, father," [...] exclaimed {{the youth}} earnestly, [...] "I am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> knew--stay; I'll send back the boat, with orders {{to return for}} me {{in an hour or}} so." ...|$|R
60|$|Why don't {{you take}} a little aspirin? I'm quite <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> set your mind to it you can persuade Arthur to give the job to Henry. And that would settle everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Beckendorff never takes {{anything}} {{after his}} noon meal, sir; but I am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> and your friend are hungry, sir, I hope {{there is never}} a want in this house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{one thing}} more," [...] she answered. [...] "Make <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, whether Mrs. Lecount, the housekeeper, remains or not in Mr. Noel Vanstone's service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is trusting {{him much}} too far. They are playing on your inexperience, I am <b>sure.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{were not a}} mere child, you would see what a {{shocking}} situation this is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{take the}} chair?" [...] I begged. [...] "Nothing could do me more good than that; and I feel <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at things----" [...] I {{was going to}} be very eloquent, but Eve {{interrupted}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not envy, <b>sure!</b> for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> gave me [...] Leave to take or {{to refuse}} [...] In earnest, {{do you think}} I'd choose [...] That sort of new love to enslave me?"--R. BROWNING.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{might become}} a lawyer and remain {{secretary}} of the company too," [...] was the answer. [...] "One thing is <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> and Dick are going to remain in that company you'll have to take me in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I {{will say}} no more,' he replied. 'Though, to be <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had consented to indue--A propos,' he broke off, 'and my trousers! They are {{lying in the}} snow--my {{favourite}} trousers!' And he dashed in quest of Jean-Marie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Abe Blower {{knew your}} Uncle Maurice well," [...] said Mrs. Morr, to her son. [...] "They were friends for years. I am <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can find Mr. Blower {{he will do}} all he can for you, and for me, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very <b>sure,</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> fail, it {{will not}} be for lack of courage, or of resolution. You and Henri, and M. de Lescure and our good friend Cathelineau, have taught us to expect victory as the sure result of your attempts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look then," [...] I said, [...] "and be <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{do not let}} us go, as yonder thing is, so shall all of you {{be before}} another moon has been born and died. Such is the life we shall give to evil men like you." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} one thing you can be {{perfectly}} <b>sure</b> of. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do wrong {{you are going to be}} punished for it sometime, somehow and somewhere. My punishment was delayed for two months, and then it descended on my head and I was crushed to the very dust.|$|R
6000|$|The {{currents}} {{that had}} been playing so warmly {{in and out of}} Verrian's heart turned suddenly cold. He said, with joyless mocking, [...] "You know, I'm used to keeping your secrets. I--shall feel honored, I'm <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> trust me with another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t {{know what}} {{we should have done}} without you," [...] {{continued}} Joan. [...] "There isn’t another man in the world would be so kind, I am <b>sure.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were only thirty or forty years younger I would marry you in reality." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{what does}} the Bible tell us? Very little indeed. And it tells us very little, because we were meant to know very little. Trust your Bibles always, my friends, and be <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were meant to know more, the Bible would tell you more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> behave well, and {{show me the}} way to the Hot Swamp, he will reward you {{in a way that will}} make your heart dance with joy. Come, guide me. We have a good deal of the day still before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "You hold only a third-share, anyway, and I'm not <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{split it}} up there would be enough for two. Still, I'll stay with you until this evening. You should have some notion how the thing will work out by then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite sure," [...] Cyril said firmly. [...] "In {{all cases}} in which I have found {{deficiencies}} I {{have gone through the}} books three times and compared the figures, and I am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> put the books into the hands of any city accountant, he will bear out my figures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see {{you don't}} {{approve of the}} thing," [...] Allan went on. [...] "Do you object to her being only a governess? You can't do that, I'm <b>sure.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were in my place, her being only a governess wouldn't {{stand in the way}} with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, I {{will say}} no more," [...] he replied.

6000|$|... "You want a keepsake, of course," [...] Philippa declared, {{looking around}} the room. [...] "You can have my photograph--the one over there. Helen will give you one of hers, too, I am <b>sure,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ask her. She is just as {{grateful}} to you about Richard as I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how do {{you know}} it is true?' added Fernando. 'I mean, what Lance has been telling me! What makes <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> of it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Doolan laughed, {{while the}} Doctor said, [...] "It {{is just the}} contrary, my dear; I am quite <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in Mrs. Cromarty's place, and had two tall, washed out looking daughters, you would not feel the {{slightest}} desire to place Miss Hannay in the same carriage with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May {{you never}} meet," [...] {{answered}} Galazi, [...] "for I am <b>sure</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> meet that sister of yours will bring death on {{many more than}} those who now lie low because of her loveliness.
