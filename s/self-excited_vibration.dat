[...] The unstable combustion results in variations of engine thrust, causing variations of acceleration on the vehicle's flexible structure, {{which in turn}} cause variations in propellant pressure and flow rate, closing the self-excitation cycle. The name is a metaphor comparing the longitudinal vibration to the bouncing of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation places stress on {{the frame of the}} vehicle, which in severe cases is dangerous.|$|E
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{specific to}} fluid-lubricated, hydrodynamic journal bearings in high-speed machinery is oil whirl—a <b>self-excited</b> <b>vibration</b> of the journal. Oil whirl {{occurs when the}} lubrication wedge becomes unstable: small disturbances of the journal result in reaction forces from the oil film, which cause further movement, causing both the oil film and the journal to [...] "whirl" [...] around the bearing shell. Typically the whirl frequency is around 42% of the journal turning speed. In extreme cases oil whirl leads to direct contact between the journal and the bearing, which quickly wears out the bearing. In some cases {{the frequency of the}} whirl coincides with and [...] "locks on to" [...] the critical speed of the machine shaft; this condition is known as [...] "oil whip". Oil whip can be very destructive.|$|E

Macroscale techniques like mill and lathe machining have been successful used to create features in the range of 25 µm. Meso Machine tools (mMTs), for example miniaturized milling machine, is a expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products. With the limitation of <b>self-excited</b> <b>vibration</b> of machine tools and fatigue, microassembly and micro- and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process, which improves the overall performance of manufacturing. The development of mMTs has revealed many challenges that are specific to machining at the small scales. These challenges stem from the large influence of grain size at small scales and the necessity of extremely small tolerances for both the machine tools and the measuring tools.|$|E

5000|$|Conductor gallop {{analysis}} overlaps several academic disciplines. Mechanical vibrations {{covers the}} laws of motion of the conductor and the long conductor acts as a mass suspended by an elastic spring obeying Hooke's law. Within the discipline of Mechanical vibration, conductor gallop is categorized as a <b>self-excited</b> <b>vibration</b> because the forces which generate conductor gallop are generated by the motion itself. One of the early leaders in modern mechanical vibrations, J. P. Den Hartog, described conductor gallop in a chapter on self-excited vibrations in his text book Mechanical Vibrations, copyrighted in 1956 and reprinted by Dover Publications, where he develops general stability criteria for conductor gallop but without a complete mathematical solution. However, conductor gallop analysis also relates to Civil engineering because the electric conductors are carried by towers {{and the study of}} wind influences on structures, including any kind of vibration, has been much studied, especially {{after the collapse of the}} Tacoma Narrows bridge due to Karman vortex shedding from the structural members. In fact, perfectly round electrical conductors experience vortex shedding in certain ranges of the Reynolds number. The underlying behavior in the conductor gallop phenomenon also applies to other civil engineering structural elements such as cables and stays on bridges. A more recent reference related to the analysis of conductor gallop is Flow-Induced Vibrations, An Engineering Guide, by Eduard Naudascher and Donald Rockwell copyrighted in 1994 and still published by Dover Publications in 2005, in which experimental data related to vortex shedding frequencies as well as the aerodynamic forces on various structure shapes including cylinder models for a conductor or cable. Another book titled Flow-Induced Vibration by Robert D. Blevins, 2nd Edition published by Van Nostrand-Reinhold in 1990, also treats conductor gallop while reporting experimental data related to vortex shedding and aerodynamic forces on various structural shapes. Both of the last-mentioned works include references to scientific and engineering journal articles, many of which directly relate to conductor gallop. In aeronautical engineering the term [...] "flutter" [...] is used to describe conductor gallop and analogous other phenomena involving aerodynamic forces interacting with elastic structures having inertial mass.|$|E

It is of practical importance to suppress the <b>self-excited</b> <b>vibration</b> of the wiper. To find out modal coupling in the vibration of the wiper, simplified wiper is constructed.
