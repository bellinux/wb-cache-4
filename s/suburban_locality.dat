40|$|Fine (PM 1) and coarse (PM 10 - 2. 5) {{aerosols}} differ {{not only}} in size {{but also in the}} chemical composition, health effects, type of sources, and others. A dividing line between fine and coarse aerosol is not clearly defined. These fractions overlap in the aerodynamic particle size range 1 - 2. 5 μm, also called the intermodal fraction. Sources of both coarse and fine aerosols contribute to the intermodal fraction to a different extent relating to different meteorological conditions and types of locations. According to several studies, the intermodal fraction highly correlated with coarse aerosol in dry areas during high wind speed episodes. In contrast, other studies have shown higher or comparable correlation with fine aerosol. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the intermodal fraction in urban and <b>suburban</b> <b>localities</b> and estimate to what extent fine/coarse aerosol sources contribute to this fraction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on the stigmatization of Australian public housing tenants and to the literature on Australian housing metaphors, explaining the usage of “the Bronx” as a means of stigmatizing country town and <b>suburban</b> <b>localities</b> dominated by public housing. It compares four Australian situations where the marginalization of the poor is expressed through the typification of the area in which they live as “the Bronx” by local usage, the media or both, comparing these with a fifth situation that matched the signal characteristics of this typification but escaped being so labeled. An examination of the Bronx’s (New York City) history shows the development of its reputation {{as a metaphor for the}} urban ghetto. The results of qualitative fieldwork undertaken in the Western Australian towns of Kalgoorlie, Carnarvon, and Broome are compared with media representations of analogous stigmatizations in New South Wales...|$|R

Some quarters are made up of several official recognised locations, {{not to be confused with}} by inhabitants so called neighbourhoods. In total Hamburg is subdivided into 181 localities (German: Ortsteile). St. Pauli quarter is much larger than the neighbourhood St. Pauli or Kiez which means the area around the Reeperbahn.|$|E

40|$|Donald Horne famously wrote, ‘Australia {{was born}} urban and quickly grew suburban’ (1964), an {{observation}} that carries a weight of assumptions about suburban living. Historically, the Australian suburbs have {{been regarded as}} places of retreat, family life and female activity, and subsequently {{as a place where}} not much of interest happens. By contrast, a city's central areas are seen as more dynamic spaces and, with recent creative city thinking and planning, as potential powerhouses of innovation and creativity. This article challenges assumptions about suburban living as passive places of retreat through an examination of women in the creative workforce who are living and working in the suburbs. It draws on historical accounts of creative suburban activity and a research project that mapped and investigated the experience of creative workers in the outer suburbs of Brisbane and Melbourne. The study finds that there is much creative work occurring in <b>suburban</b> <b>localities,</b> but this is not as unusual as might be expected...|$|R
40|$|Civic Engagement and the Governance of Irish Suburbs {{addresses}} the policy implications of suburban growth in Ireland. The significant {{development of new}} suburbs, experienced since the early 1990 s, is largely perceived as problematic, mainly because the social fabric in these places {{is considered to be}} weak and the 2 ̆ 7 sense of community 2 ̆ 7 difficult to sustain. This paper is informed by a sociological study of one such 2 ̆ 7 new suburb 2 ̆ 7, Ratoath Co Meath. The study explores the strength and texture of suburban civil society and examines the level of social capital in Ratoath through an exploration of local participation in social and public life. The authors discuss how a meaningful governance of the new <b>suburban</b> <b>localities</b> can be promoted and explore ways in which residents can participate in the decision-making processes affecting their local community. The policy options for the governance of these new suburbs are considered in this context, with a particular focus on ensuring that the participation processes for residents remain legitimate and inclusive...|$|R
40|$|The {{cultural}} and creative industries {{contribution to the}} economic and social sustainability of cities is a well acknowledged phenomenon which has accelerated in the era of urban renewal since the late twentieth century. The second-tier city of Brisbane, Australia was for many years considered a cultural backwater in the national context, yet its recent urban development within {{a short period of time}} has produced a city that now has all the hallmarks of a ‘creative city’. Brisbane’s transformation has been shaped by urban and cultural policies that are largely focussed around its inner-metropolitan localities, producing a growth in cultural infrastructure and the aestheticisation of inner-city precincts. However, like most Australian cities, the majority of Brisbane’s population live, and increasingly work in the suburbs. This article is based on a large research project that shows that creative industries workers are well represented across <b>suburban</b> <b>localities.</b> The article examines the policy and planning implications for creative industries located in Australian outer suburbs and the communities in which they are located...|$|R

40|$|Dealing as it {{does with}} only one {{suburban}} municipality, and with the first two enactments on municipal government and the period of {{less than a decade}} between them, this somewhat specialized study only scratches the surface of the work waiting to be done an municipal history in the middle 19 th century. Mr. Weston Bate, in his more detailed study of Brighton, has also stressed this need for balanced historical research on local history. The first section of the following thesis is, to sane extent, a companion piece to his history of another <b>suburban</b> <b>locality.</b> Similar studies remain to be tackled on the other 13 suburban municipalities incorporated before 1863, especially those where, unlike Brighton or Prahran, the Corporation of Melbourne was vitally interested. The Melbourne Corporation itself would provide material for a similar thesis. Only when such work has been done could a rounded interpretation of the metropolitan district be attempted. Similarly, the rural districts, whether gold-raining, squatting, agricultural or mixed areas, have much to yield the research worker.

The project uses administrative data, census data, and spatial analyses and map the rates and distribution of child abuse plus child neglect in three <b>suburban</b> <b>localities.</b> Particular {{attention is paid to}} how GIS technology can be used in conjunction with child maltreatment pattern analysis to explore relations between maltreatment as measured by mandatory notifications and the distribution of these unwanted phenomena over neighbourhoods. There has been some research on spatial crime analysis, educational planning, and other socio-economic application, and {{it is clear that the}} use of GIS for identifying and mapping of child maltreatment over neighbourhoods is a fertile area of research. The finding of this research will provide significant information for related authorities such as child protective services; community-based agencies in order to more effectively target preventative services that might minimize child maltreatment.
