He had to casually position his ship close enough to Philadelphia to allow his men to board while not creating any suspicion. When the two vessels were finally close enough, Catalano obtained permission for Decatur to tie Intrepid to the captured Philadelphia. Decatur surprised the few Tripolitans on board when he shouted the order [...] "board!", signaling to the hidden crew below to emerge and storm the captured ship. Without losing a single man, Decatur and 60 of his men, dressed as Maltese sailors or Arab seamen and armed with swords and boarding pikes, boarded and reclaimed Philadelphia in less than 10 minutes, killing at least 20 of the Tripolitan crew, capturing one wounded crewman, and forcing the rest to flee by jumping overboard. Only one of Decatur's men was slightly wounded by a <b>saber</b> <b>blade.</b> There was hope that the small boarding crew could launch the captured ship, but the vessel was in no condition to set sail for the open sea. Decatur soon realized that the small Intrepid could not tow the larger and heavier warship out of the harbor. Commodore Preble's order to Decatur was to destroy the ship where she berthed as a last resort, if Philadelphia was unseaworthy. With the ship secure, Decatur's crew began placing combustibles about Philadelphia with orders to set her ablaze. After making sure the fire was large enough to sustain itself, Decatur ordered his men to abandon the ship and was the last man to leave Philadelphia. [...] As the flames intensified, the guns aboard Philadelphia, all loaded and ready for battle, became heated and began discharging, some firing into the town and shore batteries, while the ropes securing the ship burned off, allowing the vessel to drift into the rocks at the western entrance of the harbor.|$|R

40|$|As {{the wind}} power {{industry}} has grown rapidly {{over the last}} decade, maintenance costs have become a significant concern. Due to the high repair costs for wind turbine blades, {{it is especially important}} to detect initial <b>blade</b> <b>defects</b> before they become structural failures which could lead to other more costly failures in the tower or nacelle. ^ This research presents a technique for identifying cracks in wind turbine blades undergoing operational load using the Vibo-Acoustic Modulation technique. The Vibro-Acoustic modulation technique utilizes a low frequency pumping excitation signal in conjunction with a high frequency excitation signal to create the modulation that is used to identify cracks. Wind turbines provide the ideal conditions in which to utilize Vibro-Acoustic Modulation because wind turbines experience large low frequency structural vibrations during operation which can serve as the low frequency pumping excitation signal and the other probing excitation signal can be generated using a PZT exciter/transducer. ^ The theory underlying the Vibro-Acoutstic technique is described in the document. The proposed crack detection technique was demonstrated with Vibro-Acoustic Modulation experiments performed on a small Whisper 100 wind turbine in operation and the results were compared with two other conventional Vibro-Acoustic Modulation tests. Spatio-temporal response analysis was also performed along with the Vibro-Acoustic Modulation tests using a 3 D laser vibrometer. ^ Finally, a finite element model of the cracked blade was developed for numerical simulation of Vibro-Acoustic Modulation tests which enables the design of Vibro-Acoustic Modulation tests to maximize the sensitivity of the technique for detecting cracks in these small-scale wind turbine blades. ...|$|R

Forged a gilded crown complemented by ornamented Hoop, pads, conical pommel, and ringed barmitsa Persian type. In Cherkessia similar hats were known as Tang (from the Arab. "the Taj", i. e. "crown").

Helmet No. 1 / 812 по the shape of a dome refers to the type of conal. Forged iron gilded crown complemented by ornamented Hoop, plates and funnel-shaped topping. Dome placed on the manufacture date of the helmet – " 1180 of the Hijra" (i. e., 1766 - 1767 in the Gregorian calendar), as well as the inscription: "Owner Sultan Ali", "Muhammad Giray", "Mansour". Helmet No. 1 / 811 по the shape of a dome refers to the type of cylindrical. Faceted iron supplemented gilt crown ornamented Hoop, conical pommel and Aventail Persian type. On the front of hats placed the inscription, "Sultan Mohammed Ibn AdilGiray". This suggests that the owner of the helmet could be the son of Nureddin (1718), serasker Budjaka and Editcol (1727 - 1728) Adil Ibn Selim I Giray or seraskier EditcolAdil Ibn Selim III Giray (1766 - 1767).

He cannot see exactly how she is attacking and their different physiques makes her impossible to copy. It is shown that he will eventually develop a style similar to Archer's due to their shared preference to dual wield swords.|$|R
40|$|Advanced surface {{engineering}} technologies {{have been successfully}} applied to high speed steel drills and carbide single-point cutting tools, but, as yet, limited benefits have been realized when applying the same technologies to multi-point cutting tools of commercial quality. This paper discusses the factors that have limited the benefits of advanced {{surface engineering}} treatments when applied to high speed steel circular saw <b>blades.</b> Common manufacturing <b>defects</b> have been identified on {{the teeth of the}} blades. Tests which evaluate the blade performance throughout its useful life and examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have shown that these defects adversely affect the performance and wear resistance of surface engineered blades. Further investigations suggest that significant improvements in coating integrity can be achieved through the careful preparation of the substrate surface and refinement of the cutting edge geometry prior to treatment. For this application, the need for refinement and enhancement of current manufacturing practices is demonstrated if the full benefits of advanced surface engineering are to be realized...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reach desired levels of {{efficiency}} and power output of jet engines, advanced gas turbine and compressor blades made from Ti- 6 AL- 4 V alloy operate at very high temperatures (up to 600 ° C) and speeds (up to 10000 rpm). Pressure of springing streams and inertial forces are main reasons of stress appearance in the blades. Besides that, blade usually could be out of action after one’s edges had become damaged under temperature or foreign object hit negative influence. High cycle fatigue (HCF) accounts for 56 % of major aircraft engine failures and ultimately limits the service life of most critical rotating components. Extensive inspection and maintenance programs {{have been developed to}} detect, re new and replace <b>defected</b> <b>blades,</b> to avoid catastrophic engine failure. Various modern technologies including laser cladding (filling layers of sprayed material) allow prolongation of blades’ life by damaged part’s renovation with alternate material. The general aim of the present work concludes of blades’ mechanical bahavour comparison before and after renewa...|$|R
