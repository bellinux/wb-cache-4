5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} that our new Enterprise <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> a plaque somewhere which commemorates the fact it was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is an intriguing idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave it to you {{where you want it}} on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to lobby for {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker {{on the site of the}} lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} Biblical {{inspiration}} can be corroborated {{by examining the}} weight of the Bible's moral teaching and its prophecies about the future and their fulfillment. Corroboration of this sort is a form of Christian apologetics.

In the actual {{collected}} canter, the horse <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> {{the majority of}} its weight on the hind end, rather than the front end. The hindquarters will sink lower toward the ground, and the forehand will appear higher and lighter. The horse should maintain tempo, rhythm, and impulsion.|$|E

25|$|A {{bridge was}} again {{proposed}} {{at the site}} in 1826, but the plan was defeated after supporters of Chain Bridge (then a toll bridge) opposed it. A bridge at the site was again proposed in 1828. This bridge would have carried a roadway on the upper level and an aqueduct capable of carrying barge traffic on the lower level. This time, however, Georgetown officials asked that the aqueduct be built further downstream. Disagreement over whether the aqueduct <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> a roadway was never resolved. The Aqueduct Bridge was completed in 1843.|$|E

In 2002 the UN Commission recommended that Russia <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> out additional research, which commenced in 2007.

25|$|Grampus {{needed a}} {{windlass}} {{in order to}} work her gear, and the Fish Commission opted for a steam windlass. United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Zera Luther Tanner, an influential inventor and oceanographer of the era, commanding officer of the Fish Commissions fisheries research ship USFC Albatross, and previously the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, received the task of determining what type of steam apparatus Grampus <b>should</b> <b>carry.</b> He chose a steam windlass with engines of 35-horsepower (26.1-kW). Operating the windlass required the installation of a boiler, steam pump, iron water tanks, and associated piping.|$|E
25|$|Why do we in this feast carry candles?

Because the holy fathers could not extirpate the custom, they ordained that Christians <b>should</b> <b>carry</b> about candles in honor of the Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in the honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.|$|E

The feasibility study (November 1989) showed {{that there was a}} significant demand for a 9–14 seat multi-role LTA in the country and estimated a market potential of about 250–350 aircraft in the next 10 years. NAL submitted the feasibility study report to the Research Council in November 1990 and started its search for an industrial partner.|$|E
