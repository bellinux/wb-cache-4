5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a <b>scrambled</b> <b>egg,</b> milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

60|$|Harris {{proposed}} {{that we should}} have <b>scrambled</b> <b>eggs</b> for breakfast. He said he would cook them. It seemed, from his account, that he was very good at doing <b>scrambled</b> <b>eggs.</b> He often did them at picnics and when out on yachts. He was quite famous for them. People who had once tasted his <b>scrambled</b> <b>eggs,</b> so we gathered from his conversation, never cared for any other food afterwards, but pined away and died when they could not get them.|$|R

60|$|Staring {{round with}} a vague half-smile at {{everybody}} within nodding distance, Her Serene Highness {{made one of}} her characteristic exits, which Lady Caroline declared always reminded her of a <b>scrambled</b> <b>egg</b> slipping {{off a piece of}} toast. At the entrance she stopped for a moment to exchange a word or two with a young man who had just arrived. From a corner where he was momentarily hemmed in by a group of tea-consuming dowagers, Comus recognised the newcomer as Courtenay Youghal, and began slowly to labour his way towards him. Youghal was not at the moment the person whose society he most craved for in the world, but there was at least the possibility that he might provide an opportunity for a game of bridge, which was the dominant desire of the moment. The young politician was already surrounded by a group of friends and acquaintances, and was evidently being made the recipient of a salvo of congratulation-- presumably on his recent performances in the Foreign Office debate, Comus concluded. But Youghal himself seemed to be announcing the event with which the congratulations were connected. Had some dramatic catastrophe overtaken the Government, Comus wondered. And then, as he pressed nearer, a chance word, the coupling of two names, told him the news.|$|E
