[...] If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning. [...] Another difference is in planning capacity. [...] Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be waiting in line. [...] Queuing theory has been devised to assist in design of service facilities waiting lines.

5000|$|A 1981 paper {{described}} possible ways {{of dealing}} with customer dissatisfaction. One such method was making a total adjustments for every case, even when customer complaints were unreasonable. The advantage of this method was described as a possible increase in confidence of the customer towards the firm, resulting in the customer making more purchases. This theory described similar effects with SRP. Before the term <b>Service</b> <b>Recovery</b> Paradox was first used, the concept was described by these quotes in the theoretical paper by Hart, Hessket and Sasser: [...] "A good recovery can turn angry, frustrated customers into loyal ones. It can, in fact, create more goodwill than if things had gone smoothly in the first place”. It was also theorized that this concept could be used strategically to increase customer retention.The term <b>Service</b> <b>Recovery</b> Paradox was coined in 1992 by Michael McCollough and Sundar Bharadwaj, who defined <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> as [...] "a situation in which a consumer has experienced a problem which has been satisfactory resolved, and where the consumer subsequently rates their satisfaction to be equal to or greater than that in which no problem had occurred". After its initial use, the concept has been a topic of research and the results on its existence have been inconclusive.|$|E
40|$|Given {{the extent}} of global {{ecosystem}} degradation resulting from environmental changes and human activity, restoration efforts have increasingly focused on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Grassland, the largest terrestrial ecosystem globally and in China, has high ecological and economic value. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impacts of grassland restoration on biodiversity and ecosystem services in China. The results showed that grassland restoration improved biodiversity by 32. 44 % and ecosystem services by 30. 43 %, although the restored grassland from degraded conditions failed to reach the level of non-degraded reference conditions for biodiversity and ecosystem services. The analysis of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the four ecological domains showed significant differences in restored grassland compared to the degraded and reference grassland. Restoration outcomes of biodiversity and ecosystem services were affected by different restoration approaches, but restoration age was not detected as significantly correlated with biodiversity and ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>recovery.</b> Biodiversity recovery, however, {{was positively correlated with}} ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>recovery</b> so far in our dataset. Despite this, these patterns require further elucidation and synthetic analyses must be conducted to assess and inform future restoration actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of service {{orientation}} on service innovation. The study have been conducted at public sector of Regional General Hospital (RSUD) of M. Yunus. Data is primary, there were 249 questionnaires which can be analyzed. This study used a multiple linear regression analysis with the SPSS 16 program. To measure service innovation, it is used five indicators. They are implementation, special program, new methods, modification, offering new service. Variables of strategic orientation are measured by 10 dimensions. They are service vision, servant leadership, customer treatment, employee empowerment, service failure prevention, <b>service</b> failure <b>recovery,</b> <b>service</b> technology, service standard communication, service reward, and service training. Based on the test results proving that the orientation dimensions have a significant influence for the service innovation, they are servant leadership, <b>service</b> failure <b>recovery,</b> <b>service</b> technology, and service training. While the other dimensions did not significantly effect service innovation, they are service vision,customer treatment, employee empowerment, service failure prevention, and service reward...|$|R

In high contact services {{there is no time}} to fix quality problems later; they must be handled by <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> as the service is delivered. For example, if soup is spilled on the customer in a restaurant, the waiter might apologize, offer to pay to have the suit cleaned and provide a free meal. If a hotel room is not ready when promised, the staff could apologize, offer to store the customer's luggage or provide an upgraded room. <b>Service</b> <b>recovery</b> is intended to fix the problem on the spot and go even further to offer the customer some form of consolation and compensation.
