5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Girls Aloud {{signed a}} new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, the group {{announced}} that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010; this did not happen, however. Two months later, the hiatus was briefly interrupted when they did two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. In April 2012, during an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio 1, Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In August 2012, Nicola Roberts was also featured on the same radio show, and said, [...] "It's our tenth birthday in November <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> definitely celebrating. I wanna tell you everything but I really can't!" ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Marvel {{released}} the first trailer for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "it looks like it'll {{live up to}} the 'political thriller' that's been promised for months now." [...] The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] trailer runs 2½ minutes and teases plenty of action, conspiracy and clever banter between Captain America and his S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues, with a smattering of the previously released Comic-Con International and D23 footage." [...] The Los Angeles Times also noted that the day before the release of the trailer, the studio released [...] "a teaser for a trailer." [...] The trailer received 23.5 million views in the 24 hours after its release. In November 2013, Jed Whedon, the co-creator of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., said that there are plans to reference events from the film into the show, stating, [...] "Nick Fury is in , and S.H.I.E.L.D. makes an appearance, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> definitely try to tee-up some stuff and probably play {{a little bit of the}} fallout from that film." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{began their}} defence {{of the league}} title against newly {{promoted}} team Nottingham Forest on 17 August 1998. A goal by Overmars, eleven minutes from the end gave Arsenal the win; Geoff Thomas equalised for Nottingham Forest after Petit headed in the opening goal. A goalless draw against Liverpool was followed by successive 0–0 draws, at home to Charlton Athletic and away to Chelsea. Stephen Hughes scored a last minute equaliser at Filbert Street on 12 September 1998 to deny Leicester City a win. After the match, Wenger admitted the club {{were looking for a}} new striker to replace Ian Wright, being impressed with Leicester City's goalscorer Emile Heskey: [...] "We will still be buying a striker but unfortunately Leicester do not want to sell Heskey <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have to go somewhere else … I'm impressed by Heskey. Today he did very well offensively and tried like crazy; too much for me." [...] In Arsenal's next match, at home to Manchester United, goals from Tony Adams, Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg helped the champions inflict a 3–0 defeat; the result was Wenger's third consecutive win over rival manager Alex Ferguson. However, in the following match, Arsenal lost {{for the first time in}} the season, against Sheffield Wednesday. Substitute Lee Briscoe scored in the 89th minute, lobbing the ball precisely over goalkeeper Alex Manninger after Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was sent off for pushing the referee.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1894 season, Parrott was {{converted}} to a second baseman, making way for Charlie Irwin at third base. Manager Cap Anson was criticized by The Sporting Life for continuing to play Parrott. The publication stated, [...] "It is true that [...] holds Parrot in high esteem and insists that 'Jiggs' is a great infielder, hence a suffering public may confidently expect to witness still further attempts of 'Jiggs' to hold down the second base bag." [...] On the season, Parrott batted [...]248 with 82 runs scored, 130 hits, 17 doubles, nine triples, three home runs, 65 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases in 126 games played. In 1895, Anson signed a new second baseman, Ace Stewart from Sioux City, Iowa, which demoted Parrott to the role of utility player. Anson responded to the criticism he had been taking for keeping Parrott by stating, [...] "I realize that 'Jiggs' is not popular with the Chicago crowds, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> play him in games abroad only." [...] However, The Sporting Life responded by saying, [...] "The local scribes and fans thought we had buried the lanky 'Jigglets,' so far as Chicago was concerned, but he bobs up serenely." [...] Parrott's final MLB game came on June 6, 1895. He played just three games with Chicago that season. In those games, he batted [...]250 with one hit in four at-bats. He was released early in the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E

2500|$|The title [...] "America's Player" [...] did {{lead to a}} bit of confusion, since Canadians {{were still}} allowed to vote online. Allison Grodner, the {{executive}} producer, chuckled while telling Global TV, [...] "We are certainly not trying to exclude any of our viewers <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> call this...the 'Canadian-American Player'." [...] or as Canadian fans might say, the [...] "Viewer's Player".|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} also denied release in the United Arab Emirates. Authorities {{said they had}} found [...] "many mistakes" [...] in the story. The {{director}} of Media Content Tracking at the National Media Council explained: [...] "This movie is under our review {{and we found that}} there are many mistakes not only about Islam but other religions too. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not release it in the UAE".|$|E

[...] Elliott did not turn professional, because she retired at age 15 when the minimum required age to turn pro was 16. She did express interest in the pro class: [...] "There {{needs to be a}} pro class for the girls <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have more interest in the sport." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdul Rahman's {{judicial}} proceedings, {{which began}} on March 16 and became widely {{known in the}} international press on March 19, were overseen by three judges in the public security tribunal of Kabul's primary court. Ansarullah Mawlawizadah, the chief judge in the case, said that Abdul Rahman {{would be asked to}} reconsider his conversion: [...] "We will invite him again because the religion of Islam is one of tolerance. We will ask him if he has changed his mind. If <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> forgive him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 21 August 2010, Eto'o scored {{twice as}} Inter beat Roma 3–1 {{to win the}} Italian SuperCup. His first hat trick for Inter {{occurred}} in the UEFA Champions League against Werder Bremen on 29 September 2010. Inter won the game 4–0, with Eto'o saying, [...] "We will remain humble {{because we know that}} there are sides out there that are better than us, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> just take it one match at a time and we will go as far as it takes us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Serbian {{authorities}} urged France {{to extradite}} Haradinaj urgently, citing that he [...] "personally {{took part in}} the torture, murder, and rape of civilians." [...] The director of the Serbian Office for Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Djuric, said that he was [...] "surprised that Serbia is criticized for something while a criminal like this is free." [...] He added that: [...] "Serbia is sending out a warning that it does not accept fake justice, according to which killings and crimes are allowed if they're in the interest of great powers. As France acts on Serbia's warrants, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> act on theirs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Sulaiman Al Fahim was swiftly {{relieved}} {{of his role}} as publicity figure after the takeover, one such example of his conduct being his discussion of a £134 million bid for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo: [...] "Ronaldo {{has said he wants}} to play for the biggest club in the world, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> see in January [...] if he is serious." [...] Despite making a series of other comments, this naïve statement was believed to have particularly irked Sheikh Mansour, who quickly appointed his trusted business friend Khaldoon Al Mubarak as chairman designate during the due diligence period, with Al Fahim {{relieved of}} his publicity duty.|$|E

The WA Property Council said [...] "Non essential power including decorative lighting in shopping centres will be switched off.

At the moment we are in winter mode and they are running to heat the buildings <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have to lower them, while main buildings will look at switching off non essential lifts". Perth's tallest building, Central Park, turned off its heating on 17 June, with General Manager Tim Ward saying, [...] "We're not expecting anyone {{to be anything but}} compliant".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1960s, Wilson began an {{obsession}} with fitness that led him to move the furniture out of his living room in order to make room for tumbling mats and exercise bars; later briefly serving as the co-owner of his own health food store. Wilson reported in 1967, [...] "I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> engage in a satirical approach."
