40|$|There has {{recently}} been a real demand to design and deploy mobile communication networks that consume significantly less energy compared to the existing s ystems. The main thrust of this research focuses on investigation of the impacts of radio resource allocation schemes in the current state-of-the-art Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems on energy efficiency (EE) o f modern Radio Access Networks (RANs), a s well a s design of effective solutions to reduce RAN energy consumption in such networks. Due to data traffic fluctuation of communication networks, there are often many unused radio resource blocks in OFDMA systems. Efficient allocation of these <b>surplus</b> <b>resource</b> blocks can lead to considerable energy savings. One of the key objectives of this thesis is to exploit this opportunity by designing practical and effective radio resource allocation techniques that exploit fundamental trade-off between energy consumption and bandwidth by reducing energy consumption of the RAN while providing the required quality of service (QoS) for the network users. The basic concept here is to exploit fluctuations of data traffic in the network. Specifically, a novel e nergy e fficient re source al location te chnique, fo r low lo ad tr affic conditions is proposed. This technique is then applied to three bespoke scheduling schemes, namely Round Robin (RR), Best Channel Quality Indicator (BCQI), and Proportional Fair (PF) for performance assessment. Comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheduling schemes demonstrates that adopting the proposed resource allocation technique significantly enhances the performance of RAN in terms of energy consumption {{in comparison with the}} conventional schemes such as the three aforementioned schedulers. Finding an optimal method for <b>surplus</b> <b>resource</b> allocation is firstly modelled as an optimisation problem which is subsequently solved using dynamic programming. In this context, a Knapsack Problem (KP) is adopted to find an optimal solution for a single-cell s cenario. The proposed heuristic method is simulated using Equal Power (EP) and Water Filling (WF) algorithms for <b>surplus</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. It is shown that the optimal solution is achieved using the WF algorithm leading to an EE saving of 60...|$|R

50|$|Each episode {{starts with}} an {{introduction}} of the Galta Gang, a successful troop of rhesus macaques {{that live in the}} Galta Temple within the city of Jaipur, northwestern India. Led by alpha male Tarak and his mate Rani, the troop prizes and defends their precious temple home. It is a privileged lifestyle, dining on food items handed over by worshipers visiting the temple as an offering of respect to Hanuman (the 'Monkey God' of India) and a continuous supply of water in pools fed by underground springs. It seems like paradise, but there is dissension in the ranks. Zamir, though the largest and most powerful male in the troop, is yet to be the leader and has ambitions of his own. He wants the crown for himself, and he is not afraid to use any means necessary to seize the top job. In order to gain the support he needs among lower-ranking members, the devious primate needs to show he can feed the family. But his raids on kitchens, cars and homes soon get him a reputation as the biggest monkey burglar in all of Jaipur. Zamir is eventually ousted from the troop, and spends months wandering the busy city streets on his own. Eventually he joins another troop, and in no time he's up to his old tricks. But before he can even put his plans in action, the alpha of his new gang is trapped by the city's monkey catcher along with many of his top lieutenants, and Zamir suddenly finds himself in charge. When the annual monsoon rains fail to appear as scheduled, a drought threatens the desert city's food supply and Jaipur's human population has no <b>surplus</b> <b>resources</b> to divert to the Galta Gang. Fewer people willing to hand out food to the macaques at the temple means empty bellies, forcing Tarak to leave their precious temple home unguarded as he leads his family into the city in search of feeding opportunities. Their ambitious neighbors the langur monkeys try to steal ownership of the ancient temple but the Galta Gang returns, launching into battle and forcing the langurs to flee. Life for the Galta Gang has many surprises. Zamir and his new troop launch a takeover bid for the temple but the Galta Gang holds them off as well. Zamir is eventually captured by the city's 'monkey catcher' and relocated 70 miles away. Tarak, the long-term alpha male of the Galta Gang, dies from wounds he sustained during the battle with Zamir's troop. Rani, the queen of the troop, also disappears, turning up days later with her newest baby at her breast. With their king gone and Zamir no longer a threat, Kamal, Tarak's second in command, takes over leadership of the Galta Gang.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{permanent}} income hypothesis {{implies that}} frictionless open economies with {{exhaustible natural resources}} should save abroad most of their resource windfalls and, therefore, feature current account <b>surpluses.</b> <b>Resource</b> rich developing countries (RRDCs), on the other hand, face substantial development needs and tight external borrowing constraints. By relaxing these constraints and providing a key financing source for public investment, resource windfalls might then be associated with current account deficits or at least low surpluses. In this paper, we develop a neoclassical model with private and public investment and several pervasive features in RRDCs, including absorptive capacity constraints, inefficiencies in investment, borrowing constraints, and capital scarcity. We use the model to study the role of investment and these frictions in shaping the current account dynamics under windfalls. Since consumption and investment decisions are optimal, the model also serves to analyze current account norms (benchmarks). We apply the model to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and discuss how our results {{can be used to}} inform external sustainability analyses in RRDCs...|$|R
30|$|While many {{scholars}} state that firms require <b>surplus</b> <b>resources</b> to grow, opponents counter that slack resources may encourage wasteful investment in innovation activities. The standpoint of such criticism arises from agency theory. The separation of {{ownership and management}} leads managers to discover themselves with discretionary control over the funds that shareholders invest. As a result, managers may engage in opportunistic behavior while principals do not have sufficient and quality information to monitor their performance (Jensen and Meckling 1976). Managers may squander the slack resources by expanding {{the size of the}} firm (empire building), even when the expansion is inefficient. A large shareholder can be an effective actor to control the agency problems.
