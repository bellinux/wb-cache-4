40|$|The Thiobacillis species {{involved}} in this investigation included Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus neapolitanus, and Thiobacillus thioparus, which are strict autotrophs, Thiobacillus intermedius, which utilizes an organic supplement in addition to thiosulfate, and Thiobacillus novellus which is capable of growth in nutrient broth. All of the Thiobacilli examined are capable of growth in an inorganic salts medium, using carbon dioxide and ammonia as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. Energy is obtained through the oxidation of thiosulfate, or in some cases, elemental sulfur, with the subsequent production of sulfuric acid in the medium. This investigation is concerned with properties of the phospholipids of these Thiobacillus species. Advisor:J. M. <b>Shivel...</b>|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} of lethal agents produced by several strains of Bacillus stearothermophilus originated with {{a survey by}} Thompson and Shively in 1963 (unpublished). All of the available thermophilic strains were examined for production of agents which demonstrated lethality toward {{other members of the}} same species. Many of the lethal agents proved to be bacteriophage, but in a few instances a non-sedimentable agent was found. One strain, NU- 2, produced an agent which was highly active against most of the other strains and was also non-sedimentable. With this discovery an active program was initiated to investigate the properties of the antibacterial agent produced by NU- 2. It was suspected that the agent was bacteriocin-like, for several similarities existed between bacteriocins and the agent from NU- 2. Bacteriocins are protein-like substances the biosynthesis of which is associated with a lethal consequence for the producing organisms (Jacob, et al., 1953). The action of a bacteriocin is restricted to {{only a limited number of}} related species and some act only on certain strains of the same species which produce them. The agent produced by NU- 2 appeared to also possess activity which was strain specific and was produced by a species of Bacillus, a genus which is known to produce bacteriocin. These similarities formed a basis for further study to isolate and characterize the agent from NU- 2. Advisors: Thomas L. Thompson and Jessup M. <b>Shivel...</b>|$|E
