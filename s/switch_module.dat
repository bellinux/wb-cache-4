5000|$|Translucent OXCs (optical and {{electronic}} switching) - As {{a compromise between}} opaque and transparent OXC's, there {{is a type of}} OXC called a translucent OXC. In such a switch architecture, there is a switch stage which consists of an optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> and an electronic <b>switch</b> <b>module.</b> Optical signals passing through the switch stage can be switched either by the optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> or the electronic <b>switch</b> <b>module.</b> In most cases, the optical <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> is preferred for the purpose of transparency. When the optical switch module's switching interfaces are all busy or an optical signal needs signal regeneration through an OEO conversion process, the electronic module is used. Translucent OXC nodes provide a compromise of full optical signal transparency and comprehensive optical signal monitoring. It also provides the possibility of signal regeneration at each node.|$|E

40|$|<b>Switch</b> <b>modules</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} component of the routing resources in FPGA's and FPIC's. The quality of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> greatly affects FPGA/FPIC routing solutions. The switch-module design problem was studied in [23]. In order to analyze the routability of designed <b>switch</b> <b>modules,</b> a heuristic algorithm based on network-flow techniques was proposed. In this paper, we mathematically show that the network-flow based algorithm has provably good performance with the bounds 5 and 5 / 4 away from the optima for two types of <b>switch</b> <b>modules,</b> respectively. Based on the analyses, we developed a new method for designing <b>switch</b> <b>modules.</b> Experimental results show that our designed <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> significantly improve routability, compared with those in [23]. Extensive experiments also show that the network-flow based algorithm is highly accurate and runs very efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Benes {{networks}} are constructed with simple <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> and have many advantages, including small latency and requiring only an almost linear number of <b>switch</b> <b>modules.</b> As circuit-switches, Benes {{networks are}} rearrangeably non-blocking, which implies {{that they are}} full-throughput as packet switches, with suitable routing. Routing in Benes networks {{can be done by}} time-sharing permutations. However, this approach requires centralized control of the <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> and statistical knowledge of the traffic arrivals. We propose a backpressure-based routing scheme for Benes networks, combined with end-to-end congestion control. This approach achieves the maximal utility of the network and requires only four queues per module, independently {{of the size of the}} network...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{novel and}} {{low-cost}} converter circuit for switched reluctance motors (SRMs) is developed.

The number of two-pack <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> used in the developed converter is only 50 % {{of the number of}} ones used in conventional asymmetrical bridge converter. Furthermore, the developed converter can fulfill the operation modes of charging, freewheeling, and discharging.

The theoretical analysis, the simulated results, and the experimental results demonstrate the proposed converter circuit.
