5|$|The {{assembly}} kit consisted of eight groups of components, plus a carry case. The build time was advertised as being around three hours, and required a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> {{and a pair}} of cutters. In January 1975, the kit was available for , half the price at the time of introduction a year earlier, and in December 1975 it was available for , {{less than a quarter of}} the introductory price.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron.</b> Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E
25|$|The Main Building was {{extensively}} damaged during renovations due to fire on May 15, 2001. A <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> {{being used}} on the copper cornice caused the fire that destroyed the roof, gutted the upper two floors, and left the lower floors flooded and damaged by water. On June 20, the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees approved a plan to restore and reconstruct the Administration Building and design work for the new facility began a few days afterward.|$|E

50|$|<b>Soldering</b> <b>irons</b> {{are most}} often used for installation, repairs, and limited {{production}} work in electronics assembly. High-volume production lines use other <b>soldering</b> methods. Large <b>irons</b> {{may be used for}} soldering joints in sheet metal objects. Less common uses include pyrography (burning designs into wood) and plastic welding.|$|R
25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio was}} built and {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The {{maker of the}} radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group of}} three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron.</b> In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E
2500|$|PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, {{the plastic}} welder, {{similar to a}} <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> in {{appearance}} and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, {{while at the same}} time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be [...] "mixed" [...] with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. [...] A speed tip [...] "gun" [...] is essentially a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{electrically}} heated <b>soldering</b> <b>irons</b> are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside {{the tip of}} the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. <b>Soldering</b> <b>irons</b> designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.Oleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability.|$|R

50|$|As {{computers}} {{became more}} accessible to the general public, the need developed for more frequent changes {{to be made by}} computer users unskilled with using <b>soldering</b> <b>irons.</b> Rather than cutting and soldering connections, configuration was accomplished by jumpers or DIP switches.|$|R
2500|$|Soft solder {{typically}} has {{a melting}} point range of , and {{is commonly used}} in electronics, plumbing, and sheet metal work. Manual soldering uses a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> or soldering gun. Alloys that melt between [...] are the most commonly used.

2500|$|In {{electrosurgical}} procedures, {{the tissue}} is heated by an electric current. [...] Although electrical devices {{that create a}} heated probe {{may be used for}} the cauterization of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery is usually used to refer to a quite different method than electrocautery. Electrocautery uses heat conduction from a probe heated to a glowing temperature by a direct current (much {{in the manner of a}} <b>soldering</b> <b>iron).</b> This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.|$|E
2500|$|Before recent {{requirements}} for lead-free products, electronic components on printed circuit (printed wiring) boards (PCBs) {{were connected to}} the etched-copper-foil circuit, and hence to other components, by soldered joints created either by hand with a <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> using flux-core eutectic or near-eutectic (60/40) wire solder, or by a wave soldering machine which applies a flux beforehand. [...] However, boards using the finest-pitch surface mount technology usually use solder paste applied to each location to be soldered before the component {{is placed on the}} board.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{soldering}} techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a [...] "Pick and place machine" [...] or SMT placement machine and bulk wave soldering or reflow ovens, but skilled technicians are able to solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.) by hand under a microscope, using tweezers and a fine tip <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> for small volume prototypes. Some parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as BGA packages.|$|E

In Winner Takes All the Doctor fails to open a lock with it and concludes that it [...] "hints at alien involvement". It is used to examine electronic standing stones in The Deviant Strain. In Only Human it is used to restrain someone by welding wires to a chair; in the same novel the Doctor informs Quelly that the device contains 29 computers.|$|E
2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – [...] "melted it down, got a hot <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> and shaped it like a finger" [...] – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings {{to make it easier}} to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles [...] "helped with his technique" [...] because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.|$|E

Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First {{he took out a}} <b>soldering</b> <b>iron</b> and some plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when lit {{in a corner of the}} tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame, then his operating knives, which he placed to hand, and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.|$|E
50|$|Some {{materials}} {{are easier to}} solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy to <b>solder.</b> <b>Iron</b> and Nickel {{are a little more}} difficult.
