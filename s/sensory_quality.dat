[...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings".

Pain is a distinct <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> equivalent to heat and cold, and its intensity can be roughly graded according to the force expended in stimulation. Discomfort, on the other hand, is that feeling-tone which is directly opposed to pleasure. It may accompany sensations not in themselves essentially painful; as for instance that produced by tickling the sole of the foot. The reaction produced by repeated pricking contains both these elements; for it evokes that <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> known as pain, accompanied by a disagreeable feeling-tone, which we have called discomfort. On the other hand, excessive pressure, except when applied directly over some nerve-trunk, tends to excite more discomfort than pain." ...|$|E

50|$|As to {{determining}} {{the key to}} the criteria for distinctions, some theorists emphasize the study of the after-image while others the memory image and still others the eidetic image. The eidetic image is favored as the key because it shares some attributes with the other two. To demonstrate this positioning of the EI sharing attributes, consider the following example. If one watches a color television picture and then turns the eye quickly away from the screen, a brief positive after-image (AI) of the original picture lingers. This AI travels with the eye and is not subject to voluntary control or recall. The eidetic (EI) of the original TV picture, once obtained, can be seen for a few minutes or even as long as several hours so it, too, has the lingering <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> of the positive after-image. While the memory image (MI) of the original TV picture being a conscious attempt of recall, it does not have the <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> of AI or EI. However, the MI can be seen {{for a long period of}} time like EI. Therefore, sharing qualities of the other two while also being independent of them, the EI is placed in intermediate position between AI and MI.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} promote millet cultivation, other {{potential}} uses have been considered recently. For example, starch derived from millets {{has been shown to}} be a good substrate for fermentation and malting with grains having similar starch contents as wheat grains. A recently published study suggested that starch derived from proso millet can be converted to ethanol with an only moderately lower efficiency than starch derived from corn. The development of varieties with highly fermentable characteristics could improve ethanol yield to that of highly fermentable corn. Since proso millet is compatible with low-input agriculture, cultivation on marginal soils for biofuel production could represent an important new market, such as for farmers in the High Plains of the US.The demand for more diverse and healthier cereal-based foods is increasing, particularly in affluent countries. This could create new markets for proso millet products in human nutrition. Protein content in proso millet grains is comparable with that of wheat, but the share of essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and methionine) is substantially higher in proso millet. In addition, health-promoting phenolic compounds contained in the grains are readily bioaccessible and their high calcium content favor bone strengthening and dental health. Among the most commonly consumed products are ready-to-eat breakfast cereals made purely from millet flour [...] as well as a variety of noodles and bakery products, which are, however, often produced from mixtures with wheat flour to improve their <b>sensory</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{a mental}} state is {{conscious}} – {{in the sense}} that there is something it is like for the subject to have it – it instantiates a certain property F in virtue of which it is a conscious state. It is customary to suppose that F is the property of having <b>sensory</b> <b>quality.</b> The paper argues that this supposition is false. The first part of the paper discusses reasons for thinking that unconscious mental states can have a <b>sensory</b> <b>quality,</b> for example in cases of absent-minded perception. If unconscious mental states can have a <b>sensory</b> <b>quality,</b> then <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> is an insufficient condition for consciousness. The second part of the paper argues that there are even better reasons to think that <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> is an unnecessary condition for consciousness. The idea is that mental states can be conscious even when they lack <b>sensory</b> <b>quality,</b> for example, in the case of certain conscious propositional attitudes. In the third part of the paper, an alternative to the rejected supposition, drawn from the phenomenological tra-dition, is offered: that consciousness is a matter of implicit self-awareness, rather than of <b>sensory</b> <b>quality.</b> According to this alternative, a mental state is conscious when, and only when, it involves implicit self-awareness...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the problem of}} how <b>sensory</b> <b>qualities</b> relate to neural states or processes. I shall try to present an account of why dualism appears to be an {{attractive}} and intuitive position, but also point out why dualistic intuitions may be misleading. A relatively common view in philosophy of mind is that accounts of how <b>sensory</b> <b>qualities</b> relate to neural states and processes involve an explanatory anomaly i. e. the so-called explanatory gap. The alleged gap makes it hard to comprehend how a system, which basically involves electro-chemical processes, can create feels of whatever kind. However, the felt profoundness of the problem may be an exaggeration. One of the major points in this essay is to show that we do not yet know whether it is a deep mysterious philosophical puzzle or if it is a technical engineering problem, i. e. how to bring about <b>sensory</b> <b>qualities</b> by means of an underlying neural mechanism. A theme throughout this essay is to demystify the nature of <b>sensory</b> <b>qualities</b> as natural items that only under certain descriptions appear as mysterious or miraculous. For all we know, phenomenal consciousness may be plain sentience – not some fancy or unfathomable kind of consciousness, although complicated to account for due to lack of empirical knowledge about how the brain works. The argument tries to establish that it is the wiring and function of sensory observational systems that make <b>sensory</b> <b>qualities</b> appear spectacular and immaterial. It is argued that the notion of there being an explanatory gap emerges out of a misunderstanding of how sensory observation is wired and how it works. Some basic facts about sensory observation explain why “experiential concepts” and “physical concepts” reflect two logically distinct conceptual vocabularies. Given a proper description of the observational process the gap does not manifest itself as a gap but as an illusion of there being a gap. In sum, the mind-body problem is man-made and is in a profound sense a cognitive artifact...|$|R

RESULTS : The <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> of frozen green peas, particularly texture properties, were well explained using physico-chemical methods of analysis notably alcohol insoluble solids, starch content, hardness and °Brix. Generally, retail class peas were of superior <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> to caterer’s class peas although one caterer’s brand was comparable to the retail brands. Retail class peas were sweeter, smaller, greener, more moist and more tender than the caterer’s peas. Retail class peas also had higher °Brix, a*, hue and chroma values; lower starch, alcohol insoluble solids, dry matter content and hardness measured. CONCLUSIONS : The <b>sensory</b> <b>quality</b> of frozen green peas can be partially predicted by measuring physico-chemical parameters particularly °Brix {{and to a lesser extent}} hardness by texture analyser, alcohol insoluble solids, dry matter and starch content.
