40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{development of}} advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), {{a new class}} of drugs, requires initial safety studies that deviate from standard non-clinical safety protocols. The study provides a strategy to address the safety aspects of biodistribution and tumorigenicity of ATMPs under good laboratory practice (GLP) conditions avoiding cell product manipulation. Moreover, the strategy was applied on a human ATMP for cartilage repair. Methods: The testing strategy addresses biodistribution and tumorigenicity using a multi-step analysis without any cell manipulation to exclude changes of test item characteristics. As a safeguard measurement for meeting regulatory expectations, the project design and goals were discussed continuously with the regulatory authority using a staggered scientific advice concept. Subsequently, the strategy was applied to co. don chondrosphere® (huChon spheroid), a tissue-engineered matrix-free ATMP of human normal chondrocytes. In both the biodistribution and tumorigenicity studies, huChon spheroids were implanted subcutaneously into 40 immunodeficient mice. Biodistribution was studied 1 month after implantation. A <b>skin</b> <b>disc</b> containing the huChon spheroid, two surrounding skin rings and selected organs were analyzed by validated, gender-specific, highly-sensitive triplex qPCR and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: No human DNA was detected in distant skin rings and analyzed organs. IHC revealed no direct or indirect indications of cell migration. Tumorigenicity was assessed 6 months after huChon spheroid implantation by palpation, macroscopic inspection, histology and IHC. No mice from the huChon spheroid group developed a tumor at the implantation site. In two mice, benign tumors were detected that were negative for HLA-ABC, suggesting that they were of spontaneous murine origin. Conclusions: In summary, the presented strategy using a multi-step analysis was confirmed to be suitable for safety studies of ATMPs...|$|E

40|$|Epidermal cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation were investigated in vitro after {{exposure to the}} anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Human skin organ cultures were exposed topically to various concentrations of SDS for 22 h, after which the irritant was removed. Cell proliferation was measured immunohistochemically by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA of cells during S-phase, while the expression of transglutaminase and involucrin were used as markers of differentiation. Cell proliferation was moderately increased at concentrations of SDS that {{did not affect the}} histomorphology (0. 1 % and 0. 2 % SDS). A marked increase of {{cell proliferation}} was observed 22 to 44 h after removal of SDS at a concentration (0. 4 %) that induced slight cellular damage. Exposure of human skin organ cultures to a toxic concentration of SDS (1. 0 %) led to decreased cell proliferation. Transglutaminase and involucrin were expressed in the more basal layers of the epidermis after exposure to 0. 4 % or 1. 0 % SDS. Moreover, intra-epidermal sweat gland duets were positive for transglutaminase at these irritant concentrations. These in vitro data demonstrate that SDS-induced alterations of epidermal cell kinetics, as described in vivo are at least partly due to local mechanisms and do not require the influx of infiltrate cells. However, we were unable to relate the altered cell kinetics to the release of interleukin- 1 α or interleukin- 6. Furthermore, supplementation of the culture medium with 12 -hydroxyeicosantetraenoic acid did not affect epidermal cell proliferation. Rabbit skin cultures appeared more sensitive to SDS than human skin.

5000|$|Like all Thyreophora, stegosaurians were {{protected}} by bony scutes {{that were not}} part of the skeleton proper but skin ossifications instead: the so-called osteoderms. Huayangosaurus had several types. On its neck, back, and tail were two rows of paired small vertical plates and spikes. On the rear of the tail, pairs of spikes were present forming the so-called [...] "thagomizer", a defensive weapon. The very tail end bore a small club. Each flank had a row of smaller osteoderms, culminating in a long shoulder spine in front, curving to the rear. Later forms show very variable configurations, combinating plates of various shape and size on the neck and front torso with spikes more {{to the rear of the}} animal. They seem to have lost the tail club and the flank rows are apparently absent also, with the exception of the shoulder spine, still shown by Kentrosaurus and extremely developed, as its name indicates, in Gigantspinosaurus. As far as is known, all forms possessed some sort of thagomizer, though these are rarely preserved articulated allowing to establish the exact arrangement. A fossil of Chungkingosaurus sp. has been reported with three pairs of spikes pointing outwards and a fourth pair pointing to the rear. The most derived species, like Stegosaurus, Hesperosaurus and Wuerhosaurus, have very large and flat back plates. To discern them from the smaller plates, which are intermediate to spines in having a thickened central section, these latter are sometimes called 'splates'. Stegosaurus plates are so large that it has been suggested that they were not arranged in paired but alternated rows or even formed a single overlapping midline row. With Stegosaurus fossils also ossicles have been found in the throat region, bony <b>skin</b> <b>discs</b> that protected the lower neck.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent data {{indicate}} that degeneration of intervertebral discs occurs naturally in sheep, with a higher prevalence {{at the level of}} the lumbo-sacral disc. The objective of this ex vivo study was to evaluate a computed tomography (CT) guided method of injection into the ovine lumbo-sacral disc. METHODS: Six euthanatized sheep were used for identification of the approach plane, the optimal direction of the needle and the mean distance from <b>skin</b> to <b>disc.</b> Dissection after injection of coloured ink was used to determine the anatomical structures that were penetrated. In seven other animals, all spines were assessed beforehand by CT and magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether disc pathology was present. The final position of the needle was assessed by CT to determine the accuracy of the technique. Contrast agent was injected to identify any problems associated with administration of liquid into the disc. RESULTS: The CT guided injection technique was easy to perform and enabled adequate positioning of the needle into all (n = 7) lumbo-sacral discs. Distance between the <b>skin</b> and the <b>disc</b> ranged between 12 and 17 cm. No organ, vascular or nervous structure was penetrated and the needle path remained intramuscular without penetration of the peritoneal cavity.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Pigmentation {{disorders}} {{occur in}} multiple conditions (Hakozaki et al., 2006 : 105). Although many modalities of treatments are available, none are completely satisfactory (Briganti et al., 2003 : 101). Two cytokines normally {{present in the}} skin, transforming growth factor–beta 1 (TGF– 81) and tumour necrosis factor–alpha (TNF– 9), {{have been shown to}} inhibit melanin synthesis (Martinez–Esparza, 2001 : 972). The stratum corneum has been commonly accepted as the main barrier to percutaneous absorption. Many techniques have been applied to overcome this barrier properties and to enhance penetration with varying success (Pellet et al., 1997 : 92). The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the topical delivery of the above mentioned peptide drugs with aid of the Pheroid drug delivery system. Pheroid technology is a delivery system that promotes the absorption and increases the efficacy of dermatological, biological and oral medicines in various pharmacological groups (Grobler et al., 2008 : 4). Pheroid entraps drugs with high efficiency and delivers them with remarkable speed to target sites (Grobler, 2004 : 4). In order to avoid degradation of these peptides, bestatin hydrochloride (an aminopeptidase inhibitor), was used (Lkhagvaa et al., 2008 : 386). Topical drug delivery was achieved by means of vertical Franz cell diffusion studies performed over a 6 and 12 h period. ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) detection was used to detect cytokine concentrations. Entrapped cytokine solutions were monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Upon removal of donor and receptor compartments, <b>skin</b> <b>discs</b> were subjected to tape stripping in order to establish the amount of active present within the stratum corneum and epidermis as well as the remaining dermis (Pellet et al., 1997 : 92). When comparing the two studies with each other, it is evident that the diffused concentration values obtained with PBS (phosphate buffer solution, pH 7. 4) was lower than that obtained with the Pheroid drug delivery system. Both cytokine concentrations were successfully delivered topically as a minimum of concentrations for both actives were detected. This positive result was confirmed as well by the amount of active detected in stratum corneum–epidermis and epidermis–dermis solutions. Master...|$|R

Methods. In this proof-of-concept study, eight patients were consecutively selected for clinical MR-HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids {{with the use of}} an additional DISC device to maintain a constant temperature (T ≈ 20 °C) at the interface between the HIFU table top and the skin. Technical feasibility was verified by successful completion of MR-HIFU ablation. Contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MRI was used to measure the treatment effect (nonperfused volume (NPV) ratio). Safety was evaluated by recording of adverse events (AEs) within 30 days' follow-up. Results. All MR-HIFU treatments were successfully completed in an outpatient setting. The median NPV ratio was 0. 56 (IQR [0. 27 - 0. 72]). Immediately after treatment, two patients experienced coldness related discomfort which resolved at the same day. No serious (device-related) AEs were reported. Specifically, no skin burns, cold injuries, or subcutaneous edema were observed. Conclusion.

40|$|The EPIC {{detectors}} on XMM-Newton {{provide the}} most sensitive broad band (∼ 0. 3 − 12 keV) X-ray spectra to date.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent results from X-ray {{observations}} of Active Galactic Nuclei involving the Fe K alpha line (reduction of line variability compared to the X-ray continuum variability, the X-ray ``Baldwin effect'') were attributed to a presence of a hot, ionized skin of an accretion disc, suppressing emission of the line. The ionized skin appears {{as a result of}} the thermal instability of X-ray irradiated plasma. We test this hypothesis by computing the Thomson thickness of the hot skin on top of the 'alpha P_tot' Shakura-Sunyaev disc, by simultaneously solving the vertical structure of both the hot <b>skin</b> and the <b>disc.</b> We then compute a number of relations between observable quantities, e. g. the hard X-ray flux, amplitude of the observed reprocessed component, relativistic smearing of the K alpha line, the r. m. s. variability of the hard X-rays.

We point out that this mechanism is unlikely to explain the behaviour of the X-ray source in MCG- 6 - 30 - 15, where there is a number of arguments against the existence of a thick hot skin, but it can work for some other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

50|$|Alpha {{collagen}} {{is designed}} {{to be used as a}} supplement for osteoarthritis, based on the theory of the different environments of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of joint cartilage comprises many classes of macromolecules; collagen (type I, II, VI, X collagen fibrils) and proteoglycans. The ratio and the proportion of collagen play an important role in the tensile and compressive strength, as well as the elasticity of the tissue. The content of collagen in cartilage is different between joints and soft tissue structures. For example, cartilage in the knee has a different structure to the ankle. Cartilage, <b>skin,</b> and spinal <b>discs</b> are subject to continuous regeneration during which anabolic and catabolic processes are in equilibrium. Any imbalance in this equilibrium between matrix degeneration and regeneration results in a decrease in the components of the ECM, and leads to loss of chondral damage. Therefore, it is important to tackle the degenerative process before the inflammatory metalloproteases set in by replenishing the collagen in the ECM. Collagen supplementation has been shown in research studies (in vitro and in vivo) to increase the thickness or volume of the cartilage tissue. Collagen can stimulate chondrocytes, which are responsible for the metabolic maintenance of the ECM.|$|R
40|$|Background: Collagen, a triple-helical, {{self-organizing}} protein, is {{the predominant}} structural protein in mammals. It {{is found in}} bone, ligament, tendon, cartilage, intervertebral <b>disc,</b> <b>skin,</b> blood vessel, and cornea. We have recently postulated that fibrillar collagens (and their complementary enzymes) comprise {{the basis of a}} smart structural system which appears to support the retention of molecules in fibrils which are under tensile mechanical strain. The theory suggests that the mechanisms which drive the preferential accumulation of collagen in loaded tissue operate at the molecular level and are not solely cell-driven. The concept reduces control of matrix morphology to an interaction between molecules and the most relevant, physical, and persistent signal: mechanical strain. Methodology/Principal Findings: The investigation was carried out in an environmentally-controlled microbioreactor in which reconstituted type I collagen micronetworks were gently strained between micropipettes. The strained micronetworks were exposed to active matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP- 8) and relative degradation rates for loaded and unloaded fibrils were tracked simultaneously using label-free differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging. It was found that applied tensile mechanical strain significantly increased degradation time of loaded fibrils compared to unloaded, paired controls. In many cases, strained fibrils were detectable long after unstrained fibrils were degraded.

All {{of them are}} associated with potential intraoperative complications and long-term hazards for the bladder, bowel and sexual function. Objectives: This study seeks to review systematically different types of surgical treatment of bowel endometriosis which include mucosal <b>skinning</b> (shaving), <b>disc</b> excision, and segmental resection. The review includes the number of participants, histology, symptomatology, preoperative assessment, types and access of surgery, complications, hospital stay, length and way of follow up, symptom improvement, recurrence, and effects on fertility. Study strategy: All published articles on surgical treatment of endometriosis (shaving, rectovaginal endometriosis, disc excision, and segmental resection), identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochran library during 1970 – 2011. Grey literatures were searched as well. Selection criteria: The terms ‘endometriosis’, ‘bowel’, surgical, and complications were used. Articles describing 50 patients or more who had bowel surgery for endometriosis were only included. Data collection and analysis: Data did not permit a meaningful meta-analysis. Main results: We analyzed 36 articles after thorough literature search. It described 2, 414 of mucosal skinning/rectovaginal endometriosis, 381 of disc excision, and 2, 728 of bowel resection for deep endometriosis {{involving the}} bowel. The indication for surgery was stated {{in most of the}} studies. Histology was confirmed in the majority; however, completeness of the excision was stated in few articles. There is significant improvement of symptoms with all types of surgery. Complications were higher in segmental resection than conservative surgery (shaving and disc excision) especially leakage and fistula formation. The duration of surgery and hospital stay was shorter in conservative surgery unless there were complications or if associated with other surgeries. Fertility outcome was favourable in all. The recurrence and reoperation rate was higher in one study only in the shaving group, but otherwise was comparable to the resection group. Conclusion: There was no difference in the outcome between different types of surgery which indicates that we should adopt the conservative surgery if possible. The heterogeneity of the studies makes it difficult to do any valuable statistical analysis. There should be standardization in clinical trials evaluating bowel surgery for endometriosis.|$|R

PU <b>discs</b> (5. 4 mm diameter, 300 µm thickness, and interconnected pore size of 150 µm) were produced with either a low (2. 5 mg/g) or high (6. 6 mg/g) heparin content (LC and HC respectively), and were implanted into the modified dorsal skin chamber (MDSC) of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with and without VEGF. Both low- and high-content discs with immobilized VEGF 165 (LCV and HCV, respectively) presented accelerated neovascularization and tissue repair in comparison to heparin discs alone. However, the highest angiogenetic peak was on day 7 with subsequent stabilization for HCV, whereas other groups displayed a delayed peak on day 14. We therefore attribute the superior performance of HCV due to its ability to hold more VEGF 165, based on its increased heparin surface coverage, as also demonstrated in VEGF elution dynamics. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|We build {{a simple}} {{model of the}} optical/UV {{emission}} from irradiation of the outer disc by the inner disc and coronal emission in black hole binaries. We apply this to the broadband Swift data from the outburst of the black hole binary XTE J 1817 [...] 330 to confirm previous results that the optical/UV emission in the soft state {{is consistent with a}} reprocessing a constant fraction of the bolometric X-ray luminosity. However, this is very surprising as the disc temperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which should produce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. The easiest way to match the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the <b>disc</b> <b>skin</b> to be highly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van Paradijs), so that the bulk of the disc flux is reflected and only the hardest X-rays heat the disc. The constant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc over a scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material (wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines. By contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor ~ 6) as the source enters the hard state. This dramatic change is not evident from X-ray/UV flux correlations as it is masked by bandpass effects. However, it does not necessarily signal a change in emission e. g. the emergence of the jet dominating the optical/UV flux as the reflection albedo must change with the dramatic change in spectral shape.

The study aimed at investigating the antimicrobial efficacies, phenolic content and cytotoxicity effects of eleven medicinal plant extracts commonly used for treating skin conditions and wound healing in traditional medicine within KwaZulu-Natal. Eleven plant species were separated into different plant parts (bulbs, roots, leaves) and extracted with different solvents. The extracts were assessed for antimicrobial activity against six Gram-positive and seven Gram-negative bacterial strains and four fungi commonly associated with <b>skin</b> conditions using <b>disc</b> diffusion and microdilution techniques. The aqueous methanolic extracts were screened for phenolic content while cytotoxicity tests were performed on all extracts using the brine shrimp lethality and tetrazolium–based colorimetric (MTT) assays. Extracts from Aloe ferox, A. arborescens and Hypericum aethiopicum were the most active against almost all of the tested bacterial and fungal strains. All plant species exhibited some degree of antimicrobial activity. Total phenolic levels, flavonoids and tannins were also higher for A. ferox, followed by A. arborescens and H. aethiopicum respectively. The cytotoxicity results of all plant extracts were in the range of 90 - 100 % survival after 24 h in the Brine shrimp assay. Extracts considered lethal would demonstrate > 50 % shrimp death. The MTT cytotoxicity test yielded LC 50 values of > 1 mg/mL on all extracts indicating that they are not cytotoxic. The observed antimicrobial efficacy demonstrated by some plant species and the general lack of cytotoxic effects on all the tested extracts presents some promising and beneficial aspects of these medicinal plant extracts in the treatment of skin diseases and wound healing. The two Aloe species and H. aethiopicum were among the best extracts that exhibited consistently good antimicrobial activity and warrants further investigations and possible isolation of bioactive principles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} {{mechanisms of}} action of ozone therapy are reviewed in this paper. The therapeutic efficacy of ozone therapy may be partly due the controlled and moderate oxidative stress {{produced by the}} reactions of ozone with several biological components. The line between effectiveness and toxicity of ozone may be dependent {{on the strength of}} the oxidative stress. As with exercise, {{it is well known that}} moderate exercise is good for health, whereas excessive exercise is not. Severe oxidative stress activates nuclear transcriptional factor kappa B (NFκB), resulting in an inflammatory response and tissue injury via the production of COX 2, PGE 2, and cytokines. However, moderate oxidative stress activates another nuclear transcriptional factor, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2). Nrf 2 then induces the transcription of antioxidant response elements (ARE). Transcription of ARE results in the production of numerous antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, GPx, glutathione-s-transferase(GSTr), catalase (CAT), heme-oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), NADPH-quinone-oxidoreductase (NQO- 1), phase II enzymes of drug metabolism and heat shock proteins (HSP). Both free antioxidants and anti-oxidative enzymes not only protect cells from oxidation and inflammation but they may be able to reverse the chronic oxidative stress. Based on these observations, ozone therapy may also activate Nrf 2 via moderate oxidative stress, and suppress NFκB and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, activation of Nrf 2 results in protection against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Mild immune responses are induced via other nuclear transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and activated protein- 1 (AP- 1). Additionally, the effectiveness of ozone therapy in vascular diseases may also be explained by the activation of another nuclear transcriptional factor, hypoxia inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 a), which is also induced via moderate oxidative stress. Recently these concepts have become widely accepted. The versatility of ozone in treating vascular and degenerative diseases as well as <b>skin</b> lesions, hernial <b>disc</b> and primary root carious lesions in children is emphasized. Further researches able to elucidate whether the mechanisms of action of ozone therapy involve nuclear transcription factors, such as Nrf 2, NFAT, AP- 1, and HIF- 1 α are warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel method for {{analysis}} of Ayurvedic pulse signals via a recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme called Consensus Locally Linear Embedding (C-LLE). Pulse Based Diagnosis (PBD) is a prominent method of disease detection in Ayurveda, the system of Indian traditional medicine. Ample anecdotal evidence suggests that for several conditions, PBD, based on sensing changes in the patient's pulse waveform, is superior to conventional allopathic diagnostic methods. PBD is an inexpensive, non-invasive, and painless method; however, a lack of quantification and standardization in Ayurveda, and a paucity of expert practitioners, has limited its widespread use. The goal of this work is to develop the first Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system able to distinguish between normal and diseased patients based on their PBD. Such a system would be inexpensive, reproducible, and facilitate the spread of Ayurvedic methods. Digitized Ayurvedic pulse signals are acquired from patients using a specialized pulse waveform recording device. In our experiments we considered a total of 50 patients. The 50 patients comprised of two cohorts obtained at different frequencies. The first cohort comprised 24 patients that were normal or diseased (slipped disc (backache), stomach ailments) while the second consists {{of a set of}} 26 patients who were normal or diseased (diabetic, with <b>skin</b> disorders, slipped <b>disc</b> (backache) and stress related headaches). In this study, we consider the C-LLE scheme which non-linearly projects the high-dimensional Ayurvedic pulse data into a lower dimensional space where a consensus clustering scheme is employed to distinguish normal and abnormal waveforms. C-LLE differs from other linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction schemes in that it respects the underlying nonlinear manifold structure on which the data lies and attempts to directly estimate the pairwise object adjacencies in the lower dimensional embedding space. A major contribution of this work is that it employs non-Euclidean similarity measures such as mutual information and relative entropy to estimate object similarity in the high-dimensional space which are more appropriate for measuring the similarity of the pulse signals. Our C-LLE based CAD scheme results in a classification accuracy of 80. 57 % using relative entropy as the signal distance measure in distinguishing between normal and diseased patients for the first cohort, based on their Ayurvedic pulse signal. For the 500 Hz data we got a maximum of 88. 34 % accuracy with C-LLE and relative entropy as a distance measure. Furthermore, C-LLE was found to outperfom LLE, Isomap, PCA across multiple distance measures for both cohorts...|$|R
