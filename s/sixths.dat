25|$|Two regular-tunings {{based on}} <b>sixths,</b> having {{intervals}} of minorsixths (eight semitones) and of majorsixths (nine semitones), have received scholarly discussion. The chord charts for minor-sixths tuning {{are useful for}} left-handed guitarists playing in major-thirds tuning; the chord charts for major-sixths tuning, for left-handed guitarists playing in minor-thirds tuning.|$|E
25|$|In many styles, such as soleá or siguiriya, {{the melody}} tends to proceed in {{contiguous}} degrees of the scale. Skips {{of a third}} or a fourth are rarer. However, in fandangos and fandango-derived styles, fourths and <b>sixths</b> can often be found, especially {{at the beginning of}} each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian jota.|$|E

2500|$|The major <b>sixth</b> chord (also called, <b>sixth</b> or added <b>sixth</b> {{with the}} chord {{notation}} 6, e.g., [...] "C6") {{is by far}} the most common type of <b>sixth</b> chord of the first group. It comprises a major triad with the added major <b>sixth</b> above the root, common in popular music. For example, the chord C6 contains the notes C-E-G-A. The minor <b>sixth</b> chord (min6 or m6, e.g., [...] "Cm6") is a minor triad with the same added note. For example, the chord Cm6 contains the notes C-E-G-A. In chord notation, the <b>sixth</b> of either chord is always assumed a major <b>sixth</b> rather than a minor <b>sixth,</b> however a minor <b>sixth</b> interval may be indicated in the notation as, for example, [...] "Cm(m6)", or Cmm6.|$|R

An additional vertical axes was drawn by Seurat, which neither corresponds to the location of the figures, nor to the architectural construction of the work; neither do these axes correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from Charles Henry.|$|E
25|$|Some guitarists {{have opted}} for open tunings which use more complex chords, which {{give them more}} {{available}} intervals on the open strings. C6, E6, E7, E6/9 and other such tunings are common among lap-steel players such as Hawaiian slack-key guitarists and country guitarists, and are also sometimes applied to the regular guitar by bottleneck players striving to emulate these styles. A common C6 tuning, for example, is C–E–G–A–C–E, which provides open major and minor thirds, open major and minor <b>sixths,</b> fifths, and octaves. By contrast, most open major or open minor tunings provide only octaves, fifths, and either a major third/sixth or a minor third/sixth—but not both. Don Helms of Hank Williams band favored C6 tuning; slack-key artist Henry Kaleialoha Allen uses a modified C6/7 (C6 tuning with a B on the bottom); Harmon Davis favored E7 tuning; David Gilmour has used an open G6 tuning.|$|E
25|$|Harvey's meals {{were served}} in sumptuous {{portions}} {{that provided a}} good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than <b>sixths,</b> which was the industry standard at the time. The Harvey Company and AT established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff {{to make the necessary}} preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as often as possible. It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear a coat and tie in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses served many a meal to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Vicentino's {{most famous}} {{invention}} was the archicembalo, a keyboard containing thirty-one {{keys to the}} octave. Using this keyboard, {{it was possible to}} play acoustically satisfactory intervals in any key, and therefore some of the recently composed music in a chromatic style, which was only in tune when sung, could be played on the keyboard. Later he applied the same keyboard layout to the arciorgano, a microtonal keyboard for the organ. While these keyboards did not achieve wide popularity, they did offer a way of playing music in meantone temperament in all keys. The standard way to modulate through all keys on a keyboard instrument later became to divide the octave into twelve equal parts, called 12-tone equal temperament, in which the major and minor thirds are not well tuned. Vicentino's solution in effect divides the octave into 31 equal parts, with good intonation for the thirds and <b>sixths</b> but somewhat beating narrow fifths.|$|E

50|$|In modern popular music, a <b>sixth</b> chord is any triad with {{an added}} <b>sixth</b> above the root as a chord factor. This was {{traditionally}} (and in classical music is still today) called an added <b>sixth</b> chord or triad with added <b>sixth</b> since Jean-Philippe Rameau (sixte ajoutée) in the 18th century. It is not common to designate chord inversions in popular music, {{so there is}} no need for a term designating the first inversion of a chord, and so the term <b>sixth</b> chord can be used in popular music as a short way of saying added <b>sixth</b> chord. When not otherwise specified, it usually means a major triad with an added major <b>sixth</b> interval (a major <b>sixth</b> chord). However, a minor triad is also used, together with the same interval, resulting in a minor <b>sixth</b> chord (also known as minor major <b>sixth).</b>|$|R
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] (Jesus, who out {{of great}} love), {{accompanied}} by the continuo, is dominated by an expressive motif with several upward leaps of <b>sixths,</b> which is introduced in the ritornello and {{picked up by the}} alto voice in four sections. Mincham notes that [...] "the mood is serious and reflective but also purposeful and quietly resolute".|$|E
500|$|The opening aria for alto, [...] "" [...] ("Come, o sweet hour of death" [...] or [...] "Come, thou sweet hour of parting") is {{accompanied}} by the recorders. They move in the ritornello in parallel thirds and <b>sixths.</b> The organ serves {{not only as a}} bass instrument but supplies the chorale melody. In Weimar, Bach seems to have expected the congregation to know the words of the first stanza of Knoll's hymn.|$|E
500|$|Chopin's {{harmonic}} innovations {{may have}} arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. Temperley {{says that in}} his works [...] "novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment", and cadences are delayed {{by the use of}} chords outside the home key (neapolitan <b>sixths</b> and diminished sevenths), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. Chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy, as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.|$|E

50|$|In music theory, an {{augmented}} <b>sixth</b> chord {{contains the}} interval of an augmented <b>sixth,</b> usually above its bass tone. This chord has {{its origins in}} the Renaissance, further developed in the Baroque, and became a distinctive part of the musical style of the Classical and Romantic periods. Conventionally used with a predominant function (resolving to the dominant), the three more common types of augmented <b>sixth</b> chords are usually called Italian <b>sixth,</b> French <b>sixth,</b> and German <b>sixth.</b>|$|R
500|$|The acclamation of Christ {{stresses}} {{the second person}} of the Trinity and is therefore rendered as a duet of the two sopranos. Their lines are often parallel, in an analogy to Christ and God proclaimed as [...] "two in one". Probably a parody of an earlier work, it is Bach's only extant duet for two sopranos, stressing that idea. Rathey {{points out that the}} duet is similar in many aspects to the love duets of Neapolitan opera. Typical features of these duets are consonant melodies, in parallel thirds and <b>sixths,</b> or imitating each other, with sigh motifs as on the word Christe. Rendering Christe eleison as a duet follows the Dresden Mass style.|$|E
500|$|... (He {{has filled}} the hungry with good things) is sung by the alto, {{accompanied}} by two recorders which may symbolise {{the need of}} the hungry. Bach used recorders also in his later cantata [...] They often play in parallels of <b>sixths</b> and thirds. The ritornello of eight measures introduces a motif moving up, on a continuo of steady quarter note, for four measures, later sung on , while downward lines and a continuo moving in eighth notes later go with [...] (and sent the rich away empty). In Latin, the last word is [...] (empty), which Bach sometimes separates by rests. The continuo is plucked in [...] "the emptiest sound", even on the last note, on which the recorders are silent.|$|E
500|$|... timentibus eum (His mercy is {{for those}} who fear Him from {{generation}} to generation) begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins.

The theme resembles the sarabande of Bach's first French Suite in D minor, BWV 812. Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, [...] "creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound". Jones remarks that [...] " [...] (who fear him) is [...] "full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass", while the [...] "divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello".|$|E
