5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E
25|$|The bandura {{underwent}} {{significant changes}} in the 20th century, in construction, technique and repertoire. Sanctions introduced by the Russian government in 1876 (Ems ukaz) that severely restricted the use of Ukrainian language and in point 4, also restricted the use of the bandura on the concert stage <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the repertoire was sung in Ukrainian.|$|E

25|$|Mordecai {{stressed}} that piety in any religious tradition {{was an important}} part of character development. Interestingly enough, the Mordecais also included the observance of Jewish holidays in the academy’s educational program. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Mordecai children, male and female, attended and/or worked in the school, as well as several cousins, there was a critical mass of Jewish students to observe holidays.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the deaths}} of the {{president}} and numerous officials, the crash was not expected to impair the functions of the Polish government, since no cabinet ministers were aboard the plane. The Polish Armed Forces were dealt a severe blow, however, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their senior commanding officers were killed; their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputy commanders, following standard contingency plans for such a situation.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign's summer 2007 {{financial}} woes, it used a list {{of donors}} as collateral {{in order to get}} approval on a bank loan. This raised {{the question of whether the}} campaign's privacy policy was violated by such a use. A McCain spokesperson said it did not, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the campaign's assets were pledged as collateral at the time, not just the donor list.|$|E

25|$|Captain Luis F. Emilio (1844–1918) – The {{son of a}} Spanish immigrant, Emilio {{was among}} the group of {{original}} officers of the 54th selected by Massachusetts War Governor John Albion Andrew. Captain Emilio emerged from the ferocious assault on Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863 as the regiment's acting commander, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the other ranking officers had been killed or wounded. He fought with the 54th for over three years of dangerous combat.|$|E
25|$|From 1866 to 1872, Starke was {{a member}} of the board of Mississippi levee commissioners; and was also {{appointed}} for one term as sheriff of Bolivar County. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the children of his first marriage had died after the war, he returned to Virginia in 1873 and settled in his native county near Lawrenceville. He died there on July 13, 1888, and is buried on what was formerly the farm of his second wife's family.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, June 23, 1929, Chief Flying Hawk {{made his}} last visit to The Wigwam. McCreight sent him clothes <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his {{belongings}} {{had been lost}} while performing in Harrisburg. Saturdays and Sundays were always reserved as a day off for the performers. The show was in Oil City, Pennsylvania, the following day. In accordance with established show procedures, a request was made by McCreight for a visit along with transportation arrangements. Chief Flying Hawk was accompanied by his friend and interpreter Chief Thunder Bull.|$|E

25|$|Beginning March 30, 2008, the Brown Line {{began running}} eight cars during rush hours, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the reopened or renovated {{stations}} have been rebuilt to accommodate eight cars. Prior to this, although ridership certainly warranted eight {{cars on the}} Brown Line during weekday rush hours, most stations on the line couldn't berth longer than six cars. Six cars are standard on the Brown Line during midday. Early morning, late evening, and weekend service is generally provided by four cars, although this may be extended to eight cars due to special events and holidays.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the {{electrons}} {{in the flow}} experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the critical value, {{it was no longer}} necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.|$|E
25|$|Also {{those who}} {{transmitted}} {{to us the}} reports about these copies of the Quran of the Companions have only narrated to us the various differences which occurred there according to reports that reached them (e.g. the hadith in Bukhari, VIII, No. 446 that Ubay at some early stage held this sentence {{to be part of}} the Quran). However the actual manuscripts of these copies of the Quran of the Companions have not come down to us, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them agreed on the correctness and validity of the copies which 'Uthman had arranged to be written and distributed for general use. Hence their own personal notebooks became obsolete and were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Also on Monday the Miskolc {{committee}} of opposition party Fidesz sent {{a press release}} to MTI (Hungarian News Agency) titled “One cannot build a city on lies” (a play on MSZP slogan We're building a brand new Miskolc which refers to the extensive downtown reconstruction program started by the party). In the press release, the committee declared that the seven members of parliament from MSZP's Miskolc committee, including Mayor Sándor Káli and deputy mayors Vilmos Fedor and Erika Szűcs must have known about Gyurcsány's lies, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them were present in Balatonőszöd and heard the Prime Minister's speech. Fidesz accused these members of parliament of becoming Gyurcsány's accomplices by keeping quiet.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of Venona decryption became {{known to the}} Soviets {{within a few years}} of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. <b>Since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} season the Dr. Weird {{openings}} were replaced with segments {{from the pilot}} episode of Spacecataz, an unaired spin-off created by Willis and Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim {{felt that there was}} little, if anything, that could be made into five more episodes, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the characters were destroyed {{at the end of the}} pilot, despite the parent series being predominantly non-canon. These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full Spacecataz pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box-set. The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians' ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.|$|E

25|$|The second {{aircraft}} entered {{service in}} November {{and the third}} in early 1947. FOF and DNL started an operations cooperation in early 1947, but this lasted for only a year, when FOF withdrew and DNL shifted to cooperate in the Scandinavian Airlines System. Since FOF focused exclusively on the passenger and freight charter market. In April and May 1952 the airline experienced two write-off incidents, causing a shortage of aircraft and crew, resulting in the purchase of another DC-3 and a Douglas DC-4. The latter only remained in use for two years. The airline also bought a helicopter, a Hiller 360, bought in 1954 which crashed on its inaugural flight. It was registered as LN-FOG, and <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the airline's registration codes started with FO.|$|E
25|$|Eleven bids were {{submitted}} in March 2009 covering thirteen nations, with two joint bids: Belgium-Netherlands and Portugal-Spain. Mexico also submitted a bid, but withdrew theirs on 28 September 2009, while Indonesia had their bid rejected {{for lack of}} government support on 19 March 2010. Five of the remaining nine bids, South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and United States were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others bid for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However, <b>since</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted {{either of the two}} preceding tournaments are not eligible to host, all of these bids were forced to be for 2018 only. Four bids came from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), four from Europe's UEFA, and one from CONCACAF. It had also been reported on the FIFA website that Egypt was entering a bid, but the president of the Egyptian Football Association denied that any more than an inquiry in principle had been made.|$|E
