40|$|In {{the field}} of food safety Regulation (EC) No 882 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> <b>performed</b> to ensure the {{verification}} of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules requires (Article 10, Control activities, methods and techniques) that <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> on feed and food include, inter alia, the following activities: (g) the reading of values recorded by means of measuring instruments in feed or food businesses; (h) controls, carried out {{by means of the}} competent authority’s own instruments, to verify measurements taken by operators from feed and food businesses. The ultimate goal of these activities is to evaluate the conformity of measurement results to specifications. The activities cited above imply that <b>staff</b> <b>performing</b> <b>official</b> controls: a) receive, for their area of competence, appropriate training enabling them to undertake their duties competently and to carry out <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> in a consistent manner; b) keep up to date in their area of competence and receive regular additional training as necessary. The Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS) and the Italian National Institute of Metrological Research (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, INRIM) have planned, in collaboration with Italian Competent Authorities, as the Veterinary Public Service – Florence Local Health Unit, and other interested parties, as the Veterinary Medical Research Institute for Piemonte, Liguria and the Valle D’Aosta, training courses for personnel involved in food and feed <b>official</b> <b>control</b> systems. In these courses lectures and training sessions on the following subjects are included: − general concepts on conformity assessment − general concepts related to metrology and metrological traceability − calibration and uncertainty of measurement − measurement management systems − requirements for measurement processes and measuring equipment...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{number of}} somatic cells {{and the number}} of {{microorganisms}} are the criteria for assessing whether raw milk is in accordance with the Regulation on specific requirements for safety and hygiene and manner for <b>performing</b> <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> on milk and dairy products - Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia 157 / 2007. Material and methods: In order to determine the NMO, 2065 samples were used, and for determining the NSC 1625 samples were taken from farms all over the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The samples were delivered in sterile plastic sealed cups with a capacity of 50 ml in which previously there was preservative added Azidiol (Sigma – Aldrich) in the dose of 0, 25 ml, and then they were transported at a temperature of + 4. 0 degrees Celsius. For counting {{of the total number of}} microorganisms Bactoscan 8000 was used. The procedure for counting the NSC was carried out in accordance with the accredited method ISO 17025 -FVM-SOP- 398 with references from ISO 13366 - 2 : 2006 /. Results: Only 704 samples, i. e. 42, 79...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{nitrofuran}} antimicrobials at {{food production}} animals was prohibited by Commission Regulation 2003 / 181 /EC {{because of their}} potential carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on humans. Main protein-bound metabolites of nitofurans are 3 -amino- 5 -morpholinomethyl- 2 -oxazolidone (AMOZ), 1 -aminohydantoin (AHD), semicarbazide (SEM) and 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AOZ). Since then numerous costly liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods {{have been developed for}} screening and confirmation of nitrofuran metabolites in line with the EU requirements for <b>performing</b> <b>official</b> <b>controls.</b> As an inexpensive and less time consuming alternative, enzyme-immunoassay methods were developed for screening of the respective compounds. In this study validation and evaluation of four commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been performed. According to the requirements of Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, different performance characteristics (specificity, detection capability, precision) for various matrices (liver, eggs, honey) have been determined for each kit. The validation study has confirmed that the methods studied possess suitable characteristics: detectionlimits between 0. 126 and 0. 240 μg/kg, detection capabilities ≤ 1. 0 μg/kg and the inter-day precision in the range from 16. 20 % to 22. 11 %. The validation study was finalized by participation in FAPAS Proficiency testing scheme in 2011, and the obtained results have confirmed the capability of applied methods for unambiguous discrimination between negative and positive sample...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether data from <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> can be used to examine to what extent the assessment of compliance is performed in a uniform way. Data from <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> carried out by a competent authority were examined for differences in the assessment of non-compliance amongst the control staff. The dissemination of non-compliance within a selection of regulatory requirements was also examined. The result shows that the proportion non-compliances increase when more than one inspector is present. Inspectors carrying out fewer controls show significant differences in their assessment of compliance with certain requirements. Under certain conditions dispersion measures based on the proportion of non-compliances can be used as indicators or comparative figures for consistency...|$|R
