5|$|Bart and Milhouse visit a joke shop. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so {{they can}} see the Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to a doctor instead, since he has superglued various novelty items to his face. <b>Since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E
5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, all Season One DVDs were encoded using NTSC. <b>Since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not {{compatible}} in {{most countries}} outside North America, Nickelodeon released separate DVDs in regions where the video would be encoded using PAL instead. These releases began on February 19, 2007; each DVD was released months after the original release. As with the original DVDs, each set contained five episodes on one disc, {{with the exception of}} The Complete Book One Collection Box Set, which contained all of the twenty episodes in the season on five discs. In the Netherlands, all episodes came out in a box.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> often the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth at dawn, and apparently arrived within sight of the barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman miles. (A contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible with all the other available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, <b>since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the last stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). <b>Since</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E
