40|$|Cemented {{backfill}} {{is one of}} geomaterials {{which is}} used at a high volume to serve a variety of geo-infrastructure systems (e. g., embankments, retaining walls and approach abutments) and involves the <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> or similar fine aggregate through {{the addition of a}} controlled amount of cementitious materials, such as Portland cement, fly ash or lime. A certain volume of expanded polystyrene (EPS) pre-puff bead can be incorporated into the backfill matrix to shape the backfill into a mixture, named EPS-backfill, which shows favorable properties a pure backfill rarely exhibits, e. g., reduced unit weight. The ductility of the backfill can also be improved by the inclusion of EPS bead and thus the amendment of material fabric structure. This study was carried out to model the mechanical response of EPS-backfill in terms of the cemented structure of the material. A model was established by treating the shear strength of the material as the combination of bond resistance and friction resistance, which were modeled against elasto-brittle and an elasto-plastic body, respectively. The load share ratio between the two bodies was determined in terms of material breakage undergone by the material. The model was verified against laboratory results of triaxial tests conducted on a series of EPS-backfill samples. An Deng and Jinrong Fen...|$|E

For the experiment, soil samples were prepared with the same amounts of benzene and stabilized using a mixture of CEMI 42. 5 R cement and fly ash from pit-coal combustion. <b>Solidification</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> contaminated with BTEX hydrocarbons using hydraulic binders involves a risk of releasing vapours of these compounds during homogenization of waste with stabilizing mixture introduced and its dilution with water. The primary purposes of the research were: analysis of benzene volume emitted from soil during stabilization/solidification process and characterization of factors that may negatively {{affect the quality of}} measurements/the course of stabilization process. Analysis of benzene emission intensity during the process was based on concentration (C 6 H 6) values, recorded with flame-ionization detector above the surface of reacting mixture. At the same time, gaseous contaminants emitted during waste stabilization were passed through pipes filled with activated carbon (SCK, Anasorb CSC). Benzene vapours adsorbed on activated carbon were subjected to analysis using gas chromatograph Varian 450 -GC. Evaporation characteristics of benzene during processing contaminated soils revealed the stages creating the highest danger to workers’ health, as well as a need for actions connected with modification of technological line...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{materials}} exhibiting phase transformations {{under the}} process of deformation have received increased attention in recent years. This reflects the tendency of modern mechanics to expand on {{the process of}} structures formation and changes. Stress-induced phase transformations lead to martensite transformations in alloys, localized orientation trans-formations in polymers, polymorphous transitions in minerals, rock melting or <b>solidification,</b> freezing <b>of</b> <b>soils.</b> On the whole, these studies are directed, on one hand, towards the further understanding of material structure formation on different length scales depending on the loading path, and, on the other hand, towards the development and practical use of new (smart) materials and elements of structures that predictably and nontrivially respond to external actions. Materials may contain inclusions that can endure phase transitions under the process of deformation. Favorably oriented anisotropic grains in polycrystalline material or material nonhomogeneities of various nature may be such inclusions. Phase transitions change elastic modulus of a material and produce self-strains of a transformation. As a result local stress-strain fields are changed. This in turn may initiate or block fracture processes. We study phase transitions in a cylindrical inclusion under a homogenous external stress field transmitted by a linear elastic matrix. Since a material of the inclusion allows phase transformations, its free energy density is to be noconvex and is modeled by piece-wise quadratic dependencies of a linear strain tensor. The transition from one stat...|$|R

It was raining when the construction train rolled noisily through a mountain gorge, {{and he stood}} {{at the door of the}} caboose, looking out. Three or four hundred feet below, a green river, streaked with muddy foam, brawled among the rocks, for the track had been dug out of a steep hillside. Festing knew this was difficult work; one could deal with rock, although it cost much to cut, but it was another matter to bed the rails in treacherous gravel, and the fan-shaped mounds <b>of</b> shale and <b>soil</b> that ran down to the water's edge showed how loose the ground was and the abruptness of the slope. Above, the silver mist drifted about the black firs that clung to the side of the mountain, and in the distance there was a gleam of snow. Some of the trees had fallen, and it was significant that, for the most part, they did not lie where they fell. They had slipped down hill, and the channels in the ground indicated that the shock had been enough to start a miniature avalanche which had carried them away. The pitch was near the slant engineers call the angle of rest, but Festing thought there was rock not far beneath, which prevented the <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> the superincumbent <b>soil.</b> It looked as if his contract would be difficult and he would earn his pay.|$|R

40|$|We give {{a general}} phenomenological {{description}} of the steady state 1 D front propagation problem in two cases: the <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> a pure material and the isothermal <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> two component dilute alloys. The <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> a pure material {{is controlled by the}} heat transport in the bulk and the interface kinetics. The isothermal <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> two component alloys is controlled by the diffusion in the bulk and the interface kinetics. We find that the condition of positive-definiteness of the symmetric Onsager matrix of interface kinetic coefficients still allows an arbitrary sign of the slope of the velocity-concentration line near the solidus in the alloy problem or of the velocity-temperature line in the case <b>of</b> <b>solidification</b> <b>of</b> a pure material. This result offers a very simple and elegant way to describe the interesting phenomenon of a possible non-single-value behavior of velocity versus concentration which has previously been discussed by different approaches.

In simulations with parameter values that approximate experiments, boundary-layer-mode convection produces corrugations in the mush-liquid interface. Some of these corrugations become chimneys that grow and interact within the mushy layer. We consider two porosity-permeability relations and examine their consequences for chimney spacing and mushy layer height.

The results of the calculating of the eutectic fraction of the alloys show that errors exist under assuming the partition coefficients of solutes as a constant due to the interaction between solutes in ternary alloys.
