5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Twinning is a {{phenomenon}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> crystallographic defect and a grain boundary. Like a grain boundary, a twin boundary has different crystal orientations on its two sides. But unlike a grain boundary, the orientations are not random, but related in a specific, mirror-image way.|$|E

Their colour is generally described as <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> pale cream to yellowish white. These have light brown and purplish markings or spots. There are normally 3 or 4 eggs produced in a nest.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen storage {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{by some to be}} optimal in a narrow range of energy storage time, probably <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> few days and a few weeks. This range is subject to further narrowing with any improvements in battery technology. It is always possible that some kind of breakthrough in hydrogen storage or generation could occur, but this is unlikely given that the physical and chemical limitations of the technical choices are fairly well understood.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on your political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the stacked design. It does this by reorienting the coils so that while electrically cancelling they are on opposite poles of a magnet. Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net effect is to add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding overwinding to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either. They are ideal candidates for overdriven sounds where loss of sparkle is less important than avoiding hum amplification. These type of pickups have the same appearance of P-90s.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} other {{variations}} of submanifolds used in the literature. A neat submanifold is a manifold whose boundary agrees with the boundary of the entire manifold. Sharpe (1997) defines a type of submanifold which lies <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> embedded submanifold and an immersed submanifold.|$|R

25|$|The show falls <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> cop {{show and}} a comedy show. Although superficially {{following}} the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American stereotypes, {{and the occasional}} fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show {{and much of the}} comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling the breath of a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{public order}} in the urban markets, the muhtasib would enforce fair {{commercial}} dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local price to rural people, honest weights and measures, but not quality of goods nor price per se), keep roadways open, regulate the safety of building construction, and monitor the metal value of existing coinage and the minting of new coin (gold dinars and silver dirhems were minted at Tunis). The authority of the muhtasib, with his group of assistants, was <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> qadi (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor (or trade commissioner) and the mayor (or a high city official). Often a leading judge or mufti held the position. The muhtasib did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could prescribe the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, or expel an offender from the city. However, the civic authority of the muhtasib did not extend into the countryside.|$|E

500|$|The Super Cub {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> scooter and a motorcycle, and sometimes it was called a moped, [...] "", or scooterette.|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, Sounders' coach Brian Schmetzer told Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times that Steve Zakuani {{had been}} {{training}} {{with the team}} for some time: [...] "He was asked whether Zakuani’s status fell <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> 'trial' with the Sounders and just pure training. 'I would say that’s fair,' he replied." [...] But just as the team was approaching its 2017 preseason, the 29-year-old forward fully {{realized that he was}} not going to be able to make it back to his former level of play: Zakuani officially announced his retirement one final time, with a lengthy and heart-felt Instagram post to his fans (included in full in the MLS post cited below).|$|E
500|$|The tengu in art {{appears in}} a variety of shapes. [...] It usually falls <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> large, monstrous bird and a wholly anthropomorphized being, often with a red face or an unusually large or long nose. Early depictions of tengu show them as kite-like beings who can take a human-like form, often {{retaining}} avian wings, head or beak. The tengu's long nose seems to have been conceived in the 14th century, likely as a humanization of the original bird's bill. This feature allies them with the Shinto deity Sarutahiko, who is described in the Japanese historical text the Nihon Shoki with a similar nose measuring seven hand-spans in length. [...] In village festivals the two figures are often portrayed with identical red, phallic-nosed mask designs.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the extent}} of the lands he ruled, a Taíno cacique was <b>a</b> minor prince, <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> Irish king and a clan leader in Scotland, in terms of his power.

5000|$|The game {{received}} reviews {{ranging from}} negative to positive. JustAdventure thought {{the game was}} a [...] "slight improvement" [...] over The Elk Moon Murders, while noting [...] "it is not entirely easy to classify - <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> interactive movie and an adventure game". In a 2001 retrospective, Programmer In Black wrote [...] "For an older game, the game play here holds up well."

5000|$|... "This {{is a fun}} book, a weighty book, and a {{political}} tour-de-force. But it isn't journalism. Instead it lies <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>an</b> historical novel such as Burr by Gore Vidal, and books such as Rise of the Vulcans by James Mann or Imperial Hubris by Michael Scheuer. State of Denial has had great influence among the chattering classes in Washington and I believe influenced the recent congressional elections {{and led to the}} downfall of Rumsfeld. This book is highly recommended." ...|$|R
500|$|IGN's Levi Buchanan {{described}} {{the game as}} <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> traditional tie-in game and a cash grab, and [...] "ambitious" [...] but limited by {{the confines of the}} mobile platform. He added the game appeared forced onto the platform despite its inability to support open world gameplay. Keith Andrew of Pocket Gamer felt similarly, and Rob Hearn of the same outlet also complained of how the large sprites restricted screen space and made driving slower. IGN's Buchanan felt that the screen was too small to fit so much action, especially due {{to the size of the}} minimap, and though the city [...] "looks alive", it became [...] "a painful obstacle course". He found driving difficult between its controls and his inability to plan for the offscreen unknown. Pocket Gamer Andrew also found both driving controls complicated and found himself accidentally killing pedestrians and thus getting into police chases. On the other hand, Andrew Podolsky of 1UP.com enjoyed driving through the destructible environments.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was <b>somewhere</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E
