40|$|Adventure {{tourism is}} a growing market sector {{worldwide}} including Australia. A range of research exists that examined participation in adventure tourism activities by consideration of various aspects such as socio-demographics, motivations, activity/setting preferences and involvement in the activity to understand the adventure tourist. While {{studies have been conducted}} that included several of these aspects, a holistic investigation of involvement, motivations and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences</b> together has not been conducted previously regarding adventure tourism in Australia in general and scuba diving in particular. Furthermore, in Australia, only limited information is available about those who participate in the adventure activity of scuba diving. The aim of this research is to investigate differences and similarities of involvement, motivations and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences</b> of scuba diving club members in Eastern Australia. In this study 294 scuba diving club members in New South Wales and Queensland were surveyed by utilisation of a web-based questionnaire in order to identify their involvement in scuba diving, socio-demographic characteristics, participation motives and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences.</b> Descriptive analysis was used to investigate the socio-demographic characteristics of divers, their motivations and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences.</b> Principal component analysis was applied on involvement variables as well as motivations to investigate the underlying constructs. Agglomerative and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to derive clusters of divers that differed in their involvement in scuba diving. Exact Pearson chi-square tests were conducted to test whether there were significant differences concerning sociodemographics between clusters. In addition, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to determine differences and similarities of motivational components and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences</b> between clusters. This study found that scuba diving club members are a heterogeneous group regarding their involvement in scuba diving. Five clusters of divers emerged that differed in their involvement in scuba diving. While differences in socio-demographics across the different involvement clusters were revealed, they proved to be less valuable for interpretation purposes. Regarding divers' <b>setting</b> <b>preferences,</b> similar structures were observed across all clusters regardless of differences in involvement. Motivations showed a complex structure across the clusters in regard to divers' involvement in scuba diving. Based on the studies findings, recommendations for future research were suggested. These emphasised the need for a holistic examination of motivations and <b>setting</b> <b>preferences</b> of adventure tourists based on the concept of involvement, which would be important for theory development and segmentation of tourists. The same holistic approach would also be valuable for examining other types of tourists such as events tourists and heritage tourists to better understand tourist behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Across {{a variety}} of {{decision}} domains, older adults desire fewer options than younger adults, but underlying mechanisms of these age differences remain unknown. Three studies (total N = 586) were conducted to investigate {{the extent to which}} age differences in choice <b>set</b> size <b>preferences</b> are driven by decision-making self-efficacy, maximizing, motivational priorities, and other theoretically implicated covariates. First, a large-scale survey (Study 1) examined the age trajectory of, and underlying influences on, choice <b>set</b> size <b>preferences</b> in a life-span sample. Subsequent laboratory-based experiments (Studies 2 a- 2 c) manipulated self-efficacy, maximizing, and motivational priorities, respectively, among younger adults and measured effects on choice <b>set</b> size <b>preferences</b> and information search. Finally, a laboratory-based quasi-experimental design (Study 3) assessed the effect of experimentally manipulated self-efficacy on older versus younger adults' decision making. Combined results suggest that age differences in choice <b>set</b> size <b>preferences</b> are linear, gradual, and relatively domain-general. They are not mediated by any of the variables tested, with the exception of vocabulary scores, which accounted for 1. 5 % of variance in choice <b>set</b> size <b>preferences</b> above and beyond age.

40|$|User {{preferences}} in databases are attracting increasing interests with the boom {{of information systems}} and the trend of personalization. In the literature, {{there are two different}} framework on this topic, namely quantitative approaches and qualitative approaches. The former assumes the availability of a scoring function, while the latter does not. Instead, in qualitative approaches, preferences are expressed using preference formulas. We investigate three advanced topics on preferences stemming from those frameworks. First, we study top-k queries over uncertain data in the quantitative framework. We formulate three intuitive semantic properties for top-k queries in probabilistic databases, and propose Global-Topk query semantics which satisfies them to a great degree. We also design efficient dynamic programming algorithms for query evaluation. Second, we observe that so far all work on top-k queries in probabilistic database focus on ordinal scores, while there are applications where cardinal scores are more appropriate. This motivates our work on preference strength, where we consider the magnitude of score in addition to the order they establish over tuples. Finally, as a counterpart to the top-k query in the quantitative framework, we explore the set preference problem in the qualitative framework. Observing the fact that preferences can also be collective in this case, our goal is to tackle this second-order problem with first-order tools. We propose a logical framework for <b>set</b> <b>preferences.</b> Candidate sets are represented using profiles consisting of scalar features. This reduces <b>set</b> <b>preferences</b> to tuple preferences over set profiles. We also propose algorithms to compute the “best ” sets...|$|E
