5|$|In 1327 Michael Shishman became {{involved}} in the renewed civil war in the Byzantine Empire, taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival Andronikos II obtained the support of the Serbian king. Andronikos III and Michael Shishman met at Chernomen (according to Nicephorus Gregoras at Dimotika) and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. The Byzantine emperor promised to Bulgaria territory with several towns and large amount of money if he would become a sole emperor. Based on that alliance, Andronikos III gained control of Macedonia but his success made Michael Shishman, who aimed at a prolonged conflict within the Byzantine Empire, enter into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and the cession of some border lands. The Bulgarian ruler sent a detachment of 3,000 cavalry, commanded by Ivan the Russian, from Yambol to guard the Imperial Palace in Constantinople and Andronikos II but his intentions were to capture the old emperor and the city. Forewarned by his grandson, Andronikos II prudently kept the Bulgarians away from the capital and his person. When Michael Shishman understood that his plans were revealed he sent Ivan a letter to retreat with a <b>singe</b> feather which meant that the orders had to be promptly executed.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the monkey}} and cat version appears in Simone Majoli's Latin work Dies caniculares (1588), {{where it is}} told of the antics of the pet monkey of Pope Julius II {{at the start of}} the century; a little later the story {{appeared}} as Un <b>Singe</b> et un Chat in Philippe Deprez's collection of a hundred verse fables, Le Théâtre des animaux (Paris, 1595). It is from one or other of these last two that La Fontaine is said to have adapted his story. Even before he popularised it, the earlier version had been used by two artists: the Roman painter Tommaso Salini and the Dutch animal painter Abraham Hondius. Both of these illustrate the detail that La Fontaine chose to modify, in which the monkey uses the cat's paw to poke out the chestnuts against its will. A third version of the story, yet again quoted as happening recently, was contained in Gemelli Careri's Voyage round the world (1695) and related by 'the admiral of the Portuguese fleet in India' as witnessed by him.|$|E

25|$|The No.18 Kentucky Wildcats {{baseball}} team came to Baum Stadium for a three game series, starting April 2. In game one, Braden Kapteyn of Kentucky hit a two-run {{home run in}} the first inning, and the Wildcats went on to win 12–8. Mike Bolsinger lasted only 2⅓ innings, and the Hogs' seven-game winning streak came to an end. Arkansas would collect seventeen hits in game two, with Drew Smyly pitching seven innings of one-run baseball, as the Razorbacks won 10–1. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Brett Eibner, Tim Carver and James McCann all had multiple hits in game two. Andy Wilkins would leave the game due to a hamstring injury. Game three, played on Easter Sunday, began with the Wildcats jumping out to five-run lead to start the game. In the bottom of the second, Razorbacks catcher James McCann powered a three-run homer over the fence, and coupled with some Kentucky miscues, the Razorbacks took an 8–5 lead. The UK offense would strike again for seven runs in the seventh off of Razorback reliever DJ Baxendale to make it 16–13 Wildcat lead. In the ninth, Jarrod McKinney drew a walk, followed by a McCann <b>singe</b> and Andy Wilkins pinch-hit walk. Collin Kuhn was due up, and with two outs and two strikes, Kuhn took the pitch from Matt Little over the left field fence for a walk-off grand slam. The 17–16 final capped a very offensive weekend for the Hogs, including 35 runs and 48 hits.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila <b>singed</b> mutants {{were named}} for their gnarled bristle {{phenotype}} but severe alleles are also female sterile. Recently, <b>singed</b> protein {{was shown to}} have 35 % peptide identity with echinoderm fascin. Fascin is found in actin filament bundles in microvilli of sea urchin eggs and in filopodial extensions in coelomocytes. We show that Drosophila <b>singed</b> is required for actin filament bundle formation in the cytoplasm of nurse cells during oogenesis; in severe mutants, the absence of cytoplasmic actin filament bundles allows nurse cell nuclei to lodge in ring canals and block nurse cell cytoplasm transport. <b>Singed</b> is also required for organized actin filament bundle formation in the cellular extension that forms a bristle; in severe mutants, the small disorganized actin filament bundles lack structural integrity and allow bristles to bend and branch during extension. <b>Singed</b> protein is also expressed in migratory cells of the developing egg chamber and in the socket cell of the developing bristle, but no defect is observed in these cells in <b>singed</b> mutants. Purified, bacterially expressed <b>singed</b> protein bundles actin filaments in vitro with the same stoichiometry reported for purified sea urchin fascin. Singed-saturated actin bundles have a molar ratio of singed/actin of approximately 1 : 4. 3 and a transverse cross-banding pattern of 12 nm seen using electron microscopy. Our results suggest that <b>singed</b> protein is required for actin filament bundle formation and is a Drosophila homolog of echinoderm fascin...|$|R

500|$|Several of {{the poems}} of Silesius have been used or adapted as hymns used in Protestant and Catholic services. [...] In many early Lutheran and Protestant hymnals, these lyrics were {{attributed}} to [...] "anonymous", rather than admit they were penned by the Catholic Silesius, known for his criticism and advocacy against Protestantism. In many instances, the verse of Silesius is attributed in print to [...] "anonymous" [...] or to [...] "I.A." [...] While I.A. were the Latin initials for Iohannis Angelus they were often misinterpreted as Incerti auctoris, meaning [...] "unknown author". [...] Likewise, several truly anonymous works were later misattributed to Silesius, thanks to the same ambiguous initials. Verses by Silesius appear in the lyrics of hymns published in Nürnberg Gesang-Buch (1676), Freylinghausen's Gesang-Buch (1704), Porst's Gesang-Buch (1713); and Burg's Gesang-Buch (1746). [...] Seventy-nine hymns using his verses were included in Nicolaus Zinzendorf's Christ-Catholisches <b>Singe</b> und Bet-Büchlein (1727).

40|$|In this study, combed {{ring spun}} and compact spun cotton yarns with {{different}} counts {{were selected from}} different textile mills to conduct <b>singeing</b> treatment.

Compact ring spun cotton yarns showed higher tex values and lower weight loss than combed ring spun cotton yarns under the same counts. Coefficient of variation of yarns increased slightly after <b>singeing</b> treatment. The unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts: basic unevenness of yarn body and hairiness unevenness, to explain the worse yarn evenness after <b>singeing</b> treatment. In this way, the effect of <b>singeing</b> on yarn properties was investigated thoroughly so as to improve yarn quality with less hairiness and good evenness. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of an unstable allele of the singed-bristle locus on the X chromosome was studied {{in connection with}} the occurrence of lethal mutations on that same chromosome. The unstable allele, weak <b>singed</b> (snw), is {{under the control of the}} P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis and, in the M cytotype, mutates secondarily to extreme <b>singed</b> (sne) and to wild type (sn+) at high rates. Chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated in this fashion sustained lethal mutations at a rate of 3 %; whereas, those whose snw allele had apparently remained unchanged, acquired lethals at a lower rate, 1. 3 %. The significant difference between these values indicates a statistical coincidence between the phenomena of snw instability and X-linked lethal mutation induction. This coincidence can be explained by postulating that mutations at the <b>singed</b> locus sometimes release a genetic element capable of reinserting elsewhere in the chromosome. Alternately, snw instability and lethal induction might be associated because they are the effects of a common cause, perhaps some mutation-inducing substance present in various amounts in the germ cells of dysgenic flies. —The lethals that occurred on chromosomes whose snw allele had mutated to sne mapped preferentially close to <b>singed.</b> The lethals on the snw and sn+ chromosomes did not show this concentration on the map. Cytological analysis of samples of all three types of lethal chromosomes indicated that, with one exception, there was no detectable breakage at the <b>singed</b> locus itself. The single instance of breakage at <b>singed</b> was not associated with any change in the <b>singed</b> phenotype. Thus, the instability of snw apparently does not involve detectable breakage of the <b>singed</b> locus, or if it does, this breakage is not a common event...|$|R
