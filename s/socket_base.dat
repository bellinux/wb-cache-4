40|$|Abstract This work {{studies the}} column-base {{connection}} by external socket in precast structures. A parametric {{study of the}} geometric characteristics of the external <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> with smooth interface is presented. In this parametric study, the consumption of concrete and steel are analyzed. The column cross section, the embedded length of the column in the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> and {{the thickness of the}} wall of the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> were the variables considered in this study. It was observed that with the increase of the embedded length, the minimum cross section of the main horizontal reinforcement reduces. With this modification, the walls of the <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> that are perpendicular to the direction of the applied loads presented a reduction of their stiffness. Besides the parametric study, this paper presents a verification model.

40|$|The {{curing process}} of {{prosthetic}} <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> materials requires attention owing {{to a series}} of associated problems that are yet to be addressed and solved. However, to date, few relevant studies have been reported. In this paper, nanodiamonds modified with a silane coupling agent were dispersed into a prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> material, and the performance of the modified base materials was investigated. Adding a predetermined amount of nanodiamonds to the prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> material increased the glass transition temperature, improved the mechanical properties of the cured base material, and reduced the influence of the volatile gas formed during the curing process on the environment. With increasing nanodiamond contents, the glass transition temperature increased and the mechanical properties improved slightly. Owing to the high thermal conductivity of the nanodiamonds, the localized heat, {{as a result of the}} curing process, could be dissipated and released. Thus, adding nanodiamonds led to a more uniform temperature field forming in the curing system. This improved the curing process and reduced the formation of volatile monomers, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of the generated volatile gases on the environment. All of these provide a potential strategy for modifying prosthetic <b>socket</b> <b>base</b> materials...|$|E

The specimens consisted of pedestal walls and were submitted to loads with large eccentricities. Based on the experimental results, two rational design models are proposed for this connection. One of these models accounts for the friction and is applied to socket bases with smooth interfaces. The main behavior model was verified for sockets {{with this type of}} interface and the design of the longitudinal walls as corbels is also suggested in this case. Because the behavior of the rough interface specimens was very close to a monolithic connection, the other proposed model is an adaptation of the bending theory to calculate the vertical reinforcement of socket bases with rough interfaces...|$|E

The experimental program included seven specimens, for which the type of interface in contact with cast-in-place concrete, the load eccentricities and the embedded lengths were all varied, A design model was proposed to calculate the reinforcements of the transverse walls. Based on the obtained results, some conclusions can be drawn: (a) The top of the transverse wall on the compression side of the smooth connections and the top of the two transverse walls of the rough connections are submitted to a bending-tension and this tension prevails on the bending; (b) The design model proposed for the calculation of the reinforcement of the transverse wall on the compression side provides the best prediction of the experimental results for all specimens when compared to the current design models; (c) For rough interfaces, the top of the transverse wall on the tension side is more requested than the top of transverse wall on the compression side; (d) The results of the proposed design model for the reinforcement of the transverse wall on the tension side of rough connections were in close agreement with the experimental results.

No programa {{experimental}} foram ensaiados dois protótipos submetidos à flexão com grande excentricidade: um com interface pilar-colarinho lisa e o outro com interface rugosa por meio de chaves de cisalhamento. Foi adotado um detalhamento diferenciado para as armaduras verticais principais concentrando as mesmas próximas aos cantos, bem como foi adotada, para o colarinho, uma espessura inferior à recomendada pela literatura técnica. Com os resultados experimentais foi possível analisar a resistência dos protótipos, as deformações das armaduras e os deslocamentos das paredes. Foi realizada uma análise dos resultados experimentais com um modelo de cálculo da literatura técnica, no que diz respeito às forças resultantes nas armaduras verticais principais e nas armaduras horizontais principais situadas nas paredes transversais do colarinho, considerando duas situações distintas de comportamento para as paredes transversais: flexo-tração e tração. Em função dos resultados foi verificado que as armaduras verticais situadas próximo aos cantos contribuíram efetivamente para a resistência do protótipo com interface lisa. Comprovou-se que as paredes transversais foram submetidas a uma flexo-tração e que o modelo teórico aplicado considerando 15 % de flexão e 85 % de tração apresenta os melhores resultados, se comparados com os valores obtidos experimentalmente.
