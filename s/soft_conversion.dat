25|$|Standards {{pertaining}} to transport infrastructure were metricated using <b>soft</b> <b>conversions,</b> {{as part of}} the general metrication of the engineering industry – the standard railway track gauges fixed at 4ft 8½in in 1845 was redefined as 1.435m – a decrease of 0.1mm but well within the engineering tolerances. Motorway marker posts used by road maintenance teams and emergency services demarcate locations in multiples of 100m. Standards relating to the design and building of new road and rail vehicles have been metric since the engineering changeover in the 1970s. Imperial units have been retained for both road and railway signage except on new railways such as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, and the Tyne and Wear Metro and London Tramlink which along with all other modern British tram systems also operate in metric. The Cambrian Line has also changed to metric units with the change to ERMTS signalling. London Underground has converted to using metric units for distances but not for speeds.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{possible}} acceptance of metric conversion for clothing sizes and sizing standardization by a selected sample of female ready-to-wear clothing consumers. A questionnaire was designed to elicit consumer's positive or negative attitudes toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and sizing standardization. The 54 -item questionnaire also incorporated measures of selected items of consumer background information including: attitude toward metric conversion in the U. S. A., attitude toward change, level of metric knowledge, perceived fashion innovativeness, educational level, and age group. The questionnaire was mailed to 500 women residing in Thurston County, Washington. Respondents were systematically selected by computer from 32 randomly selected polling precincts out of 128 total precincts. The initial mailing and the three-week follow-up of non-respondents included a hand-signed cover-letter, the questionnaire booklet, and a first-class return envelope. A total of 288 usable replies (57. 60) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were employed in the analysis of individual questions and each composite measure. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the chi-square test of independence were used to analyze relationships between variables. The significance level was set at. 05. Consumers expressed a positive attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes, sizing standardization, metric conversion in the U. S. A., and change. Most of the 288 women possessed "some" to "a great deal of" metric knowledge, were educated beyond high school, were between 18 and 41 years of age, and perceived themselves as adopting new styles about the same time as most other people. The consumers desired a period of dual labeling for apparel, preferably permanently, and acknowledged that metric size designations on dual labels probably would be ignored. The women agreed that size markings should be actual body measurements, yet most were reluctant to abandon nominal codes. Aesthetically appealing, simple, size designations were supported. Rationalized metric sizes were ultimately preferred over <b>soft</b> <b>conversion</b> methods. The present system of sizing by style and age group was satisfactory to more than half of the respondents, although some voiced discontent with their inability to purchase fashionable styles in all size ranges. The women agreed that current sizes are not uniform, supported elimination of vanity sizing and the reduction of overlapping sizes between groups, and wished to rectify sizing discrepancies between brand and price levels through use of the metric system. Simultaneous sizing standardization and metric clothing size conversion was viewed as possibly too confusing by a slight majority; in order to avoid confusion, most respondents felt mandatory conversion by the industry was necessary. Consumers concurred that shopping for metric clothing sizes would not really be any more difficult, and that increased uniformity in apparel sizes would result in less need to try on garments and increased confidence when shopping for gifts and through catalogues. Significant relationships were found to exist between consumers' attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and the following variables: attitude toward sizing standardization, level of metric knowledge, attitude toward metric conversion in the U. S. A., attitude toward change, and educational level. Significant relationships could not be established between consumers' attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and perceived fashion innovativeness or age group...|$|E

The American standards explicitly state that the slump cone should have a height of 12-in (300 mm), a bottom diameter of 8-in (200 mm) and an upper diameter of 4-in (100 mm). The <b>soft</b> SI <b>conversions</b> provided in the standard allow using the same dimension slump cones as those described in other standards. The ASTM standards also regulate the rigidity of the cone. It states in the procedure that when the cone is removed, it should be lifted up vertically, without any rotational movement at all.

30|$|Based on the {{protection}} level, audio authentication {{can be classified}} into hard and soft authentication [1]. Hard authentication rejects any modifications except lossless compression or format <b>conversion.</b> <b>Soft</b> authentication passes certain incidental or admissible manipulations and rejects all the rest called malicious manipulations. Soft authentication can be further divided into quality-based authentication which rejects any manipulations that lower the perceptual quality below an acceptable level and content-based authentication which rejects any manipulations that change the semantic meaning of the content. Apparently, hard authentication has the minimum distortion endurance, while content-based soft authentication has the maximum capability.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel three-phase utility frequency to high frequency <b>soft</b> switching power <b>conversion</b> circuit with dual mode {{pulse width modulation}} and pulse density modulation for high power induction heating applications as melting of steel and non ferrous metals, annealing of metals, surface hardening of steel and cast iron work pieces and hot water producers, steamers and super heated steamers. This high frequency power conversion circuit can operate from three-phase systems to produce high current for high power induction heating applications under the principles of ZVS and it can regulate its ac output power from the rated value to a low power level. A dual mode modulation control scheme based on high frequency PWM in synchronization with the utility frequency positive and negative half cycles for the proposed high frequency conversion circuit and utility frequency pulse density modulation is produced to extend its soft switching operating range for wide ac output power regulation. A dual packs heat exchanger assembly {{is designed to be}} used in consumer and industrial fluid pipeline systems and it is proved to be suitable for the hot water, steam and super heated steam producers. Experiment and simulation results are given in this paper to verify the operation principles of the proposed ac conversion circuit and to evaluate its power regulation and conversion efficiency. Also, the paper {{presents a}} mutual coupling model of the induction heating load instead of equivalent transformer circuit model.
