Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. In the fourth edition of her memoirs, written in 1941, Lúcia said that {{on the occasion of}} their third visit to the Cova da Iria, on 13 July 1917, she asked the Lady to tell them who she was, and to perform a miracle so that everyone would believe. The Lady told her that they should continue to come to the Cova each month until October, when the requested miracle would occur.|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} {{began its}} work on 7 June 1676. At the hearings, strong criticism surfaced and was directed against individual officers {{as well as}} Swedish conduct in general. Anders Homman, {{one of the officers}} on Svärdet, was among those who chastised his colleagues the hardest. In his testimony he said that Admiral Uggla had exclaimed [...] "look how those dog cunts run" [...] when he was surrounded, fighting the allied flagships. Homman himself described the actions of his colleagues as those of [...] "chickens running about the yard, each in his own direction", and added that he [...] "had been in seven battles, but had never <b>seen</b> <b>our</b> people fight so poorly".|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever <b>seen.</b> <b>Our</b> clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E

The lowest level was a drop table which was raised for use in the sacrament. The pulpits to the east, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood. Written in gilded letters along the arch of the ceiling, above the eastern pulpits, were the words [...] "The Lord Has <b>Seen</b> <b>Our</b> Sacrifice – Come After Us."

2500|$|In a Bangladeshi {{assessment}} of the war, a top Awami League leader, MR Chowdhury, lambasted {{the performance of the}} Indian army. Chowdhury argued that “Never was such a heroic force neglected so much as the Mukti Fouz. The rebels got only ten rounds of ammunition a day, and this was far from adequate. Officers waited for days to get ammunition for a raid. Senior officers lacked weapons, and most of the rebels were short on rations, uniforms, Pakistani cash (necessary for missions inside East Pakistan), tents, soaps, and shoes." [...] Mr Chowdhury further said: “I have <b>seen</b> <b>our</b> (Mukti Bahini) sector commanders have to roam like beggars to procure medicine from various sources for their ailing men. We were assured that the ‘Friends’ (the Indian army) promised to look after the basic necessities of our (Bengali) men, but the bare truth is that our men never get what they require.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{their early}} years, Depeche Mode were {{considered}} teen idols, and regularly featured on front covers of magazines such as Smash Hits. Following {{the departure of}} Vince Clarke, their music began {{to take on a}} darker tone akin to that found in gothic rock, as Martin Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore's lyrical artistry has been recognised as encapsulating themes such as sex, religion, and politics, so much so that many labelled the band's lyrical and musical themes as dark and bleak. In response, Gore has stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness present more of a realistic character and are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds [...] "happy songs" [...] fake and unrealistic: [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>our</b> music as being over-dark. I think that there is always an element of hope in our music." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} recurring characters was Sardo (Richard Dumont), owner of [...] "Sardo's Magic Mansion" [...] (a magic shop). He would often attempt to sell a character a [...] "prized" [...] item, succeeding almost every single time. He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic, yet did not know until it was revealed in the story. One {{of the most memorable}} recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as [...] "Mr. Sardo." [...] He would then get irritated and exclaim: [...] "That's SarDO! No mister; accent on the doh!" [...] Another recurring line was: [...] "Have you <b>seen</b> <b>our</b> vomit?" [...] Additionally, when selling someone an item, he would often ask a rather high price. The main character would mention how much money they had, and Sardo would grab the money saying, [...] "But I'm losing on the deal." [...] Although he rarely got what he wanted, he would often end up helping the characters, often unintentionally. He appeared in Gary's stories, although in the later seasons, he appeared in two of Tucker's and one of David's in the episode [...] "The Tale Of The Dark Dragon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Various {{claims have}} been made as to what {{actually}} happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have <b>seen</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God. According to accounts, {{after a period of}} rain, the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The sun was then reported to have careened towards the earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became [...] "suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling".|$|E
2500|$|On 7 May 1099 the crusaders reached Jerusalem, {{which had}} been recaptured from the Seljuks by the Fatimids of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the crusaders were able to end the siege by {{breaking}} down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over {{the course of that}} afternoon, evening and next morning, the crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem. Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the Temple Mount inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous Gesta Francorum, in what some believe {{to be one of the}} most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, [...] "...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...." [...] Tancred claimed the Temple quarter for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow crusaders. According to Fulcher of Chartres: [...] "Indeed, if you had been there you would have <b>seen</b> <b>our</b> feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared." ...|$|E
