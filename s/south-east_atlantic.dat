Location Middle to Late Miocene in the <b>south-east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) off {{the west coast}} of South Africa. Methods We studied the palynology of the thoroughly dated Middle to Late Miocene sediments of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1085 retrieved from the Atlantic off the mouth of the Orange River. Both marine upwelling and terrestrial input are recorded at this site, which allows a direct correlation between changes in the terrestrial flora and the marine BUS in the <b>south-east</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Results Pollen types from plants of tropical affinity disappeared, and those from the Cape flora gradually increased, between 10 and 6 Ma. Our data corroborate the inferred dating of the diversification in Aizoaceae c. 8 Ma. Main conclusions Inferred vegetation changes for the Late Miocene south-western African coast are the disappearance of Podocarpus-dominated Afromontane forests, and a change in the vegetation of the coastal plain from tropical grassland and thicket to semi-arid succulent vegetation. These changes are indicative of an increased summer drought, and are in step with the development of the southern BUS. They pre-date the Pliocene uplift of the East African escarpment, suggesting that this did not play a role in stimulating vegetation change. Some Fynbos elements were present throughout the recorded period (from 11 Ma), suggesting that at least some elements of this vegetation were already in place during the onset of the BUS. This is consistent with a marine-driven climate change in south-western Africa triggering substantial radiation in the terrestrial flora, especially in the Aizoaceae...|$|E

40|$|The {{net effect}} of aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing (DRF) is the balance between the {{scattering}} effect that reflects solar radiation back to space (cooling), and the absorption that decreases the reflected sunlight (warming). The amplitude of these two effects and their balance depends on the aerosol load, its absorptivity, the cloud fraction and the respective position of aerosol and cloud layers. In this study, we use the information provided by CALIOP (CALIPSO satellite) and MODIS (AQUA satellite) instruments as input data to a Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) and quantify the shortwave (SW) aerosol direct atmospheric forcing, over the <b>South-East</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The combination of the passive and active measurements allows estimates of the horizontal and vertical distributions of the aerosol and cloud parameters. We use a parametrization of the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) based on the satellite-derived Angstrom coefficient. The South East Atlantic is a particular region, where bright stratocumulus clouds are often topped by absorbing smoke particles. Results from radiative transfer simulations confirm the similar amplitude of the cooling effect, due to light scattering by the aerosols, and the warming effect, due to the absorption by the same particles. Over six years of satellite retrievals, from 2005 to 2010, the <b>South-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> all-sky SW DRF is − 0. 03 W m − 2, with a spatial standard deviation of 8. 03 W m − 2. In good agreement with previous estimates, statistics show that a cloud fraction larger than 0. 5 is generally associated with positive all-sky DRF. In case of cloudy-sky and aerosol located only above the cloud top, a SSA larger than 0. 91 and cloud optical thickness larger than 4 {{can be considered as}} threshold values, beyond which the resulting radiative forcing becomes positive...|$|E

Particles lofted into the mid-troposphere are transported westward over the <b>South-East</b> (SE) <b>Atlantic,</b> home to one of the three permanent subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The SE Atlantic stratocumulus deck interacts with the dense layers of BB aerosols that initially overlay the cloud deck, but later subside and often mix into the clouds. These interactions include adjustments to aerosol-induced solar heating and microphysical effects, and their global representation in climate models remains one of the largest uncertainties in estimates of future climate. Hence, new observations over the SE Atlantic have significant implications for regional and global climate change predictions. The low-level clouds in the SE Atlantic have limited vertical extent and therefore present favorable conditions for their exploration with remote sensing. On the other hand, the normal coexistence of BB aerosols and Sc clouds in the same scene also presents significant challenges to conventional remote sensing techniques.

An understanding of future environmental conditions can assist marine resource users plan their activities, minimise risks due to adverse conditions, and maximise opportunities. Short-term farm management is assisted by weather forecasts, but longer term planning may be hampered by an absence of useful climate information at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we use dynamical seasonal forecasts to predict water temperatures for <b>south-east</b> Tasmanian <b>Atlantic</b> salmon farm sites several months into the future. High summer temperatures pose a significant risk to production systems of these farms. Based on twenty years of historical validation, the model shows useful skill (i. e., predictive ability) for all months of the year at lead-times of 0 – 1  months. Model skill is highest when forecasting for winter months, and lowest for December and January predictions. The poorer performance in summer may be due to increased variability due to the convergence of several ocean currents offshore from the salmon farming region. Accuracy of probabilistic forecasts exceeds 80 % for all months at lead-time 0  months for the upper tercile (warmest 33 % of values) and exceeds 50 % at a lead-time of 3  months. This analysis shows that useful information on future ocean conditions up to several months into the future can be provided for the salmon aquaculture industry in this region. Similar forecasting techniques can be applied to other marine industries such as wild fisheries and pond aquaculture in other regions. This future knowledge will enhance environment-related decision making of marine managers and increase industry resilience to climate variability...|$|R

40|$|Calanus finmarchicus {{sensu lato}} {{belongs in the}} order Copepoda of the class Crustacea. It is {{probably}} the most widespread marine copepod, being found throughout the world in all but the tropical seas. Over much of its distribution it is the dominant member of the zooplankton and {{is an essential part of}} the food web on which many economically important fish depend. An understanding of its ecology will play a fundamental part in the scientific management of fisheries. The aim of the thesis is to attempt an understanding of certain aspects of this vast subject. The scope of the thesis has been broadened, paradoxically perhaps, by previous work which has produced various opinions on the systematic status of populations in different water masses. It has been necessary, therefore, to define the main populations in systematic terms and then to use these definitions in a number of ecological studies. The scientific history of Galanus finmarchicus s. l, began two hundred years ago with its discovery and description, as Monoculus finmarchicus, by Gunnerus. Today it has been suggested that it should be regarded as a complex of seven species, each characteristic of different water masses. Three of these, C, finmarchicus, sensu stricto, C. glacialis and G. helgolandicus are known from the North Atlantic and they form the subject of the present investigations. Morphological separation of these species is based mainly on the structure of the fifth (last) pair of limbs; in adult females and stage V copepodids the shape of the inner border of the coxopodite and the size of the teeth on this border are the main characters. In C. finmarchicus the teeth are small and the border approximately straight; C. glacialis, which is larger than the other two, also has small teeth on a concave border; and C. helgolandicus has larger teeth on a strongly concave border. Adult males are distinguished mainly by different proportional lengths of the rami of this pair of limbs. The material for the investigations has come for the most part from samples obtained by the Continuous Plankton Recorder in the course of the Survey of the North Atlantic and North Sea conducted from the Oceanographic Laboratory, Edinburgh; these samples have all been taken at a depth of 10 m. Some experimental work was carried out at the Marine Station, Millport, in the Firth of Clyde, and net samples obtained during the International NORWESTLANT Surveys of 1963 have formed the basis for two ecological studies. Mixed samples formed the basis for the comparisons of G. finmarchicus with C. glacialis and C. helgolandicus. The routine analysis conducted by the staff of the Oceanographic Laboratory provided the information on occurrence necessary for the selection of samples. Measurements were taken of metasome length and of all features of the fifth limbs mentioned in previous descriptions; the most important of these was the curvature of the toothed border, but the number and size of teeth and the presence or absence of an extra seta on the endopodite were included as well. These characters were all considered in relation to metasome length and, in the case of curvature of the toothed border, an angular measure was devised which also took account of size. The results showed that there was little difference in length between G. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus, the mean for the latter being slightly greater; values for tooth size also overlapped but there was complete separation between the two on the basis of curvature. This separation held good when measurements were made of over a thousand specimens from a wide range of different positions in the North Atlantic and North Sea. The mixed sample of C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis showed a bimodal length frequency but continuity of all morphological characters, including curvature, in relation to length. The experimental investigations demonstrated inverse relationships between length and temperature and between concavity and temperature. The individuals in the experiment thus tended at low temperatures towards features characteristic of C. glacialis. These results are considered, on the one hand, to support the specific separation of C. finmarchicus from C. helgolandicus, as is now widely accepted, but, on the other, to indicate that the apparent differences between G. finmarchicus and G. glacialis are the result of scarcity of specimens of intermediate size and that the characters are affected by temperature. The scarcity of individuals of intermediate size is considered to be explicable in terms of the comparatively small quantities of stable sub-Arctic water compared with the North Atlantic and the Arctic. Since recent authors have shown G. glacialis to be zoogeographically distinct from C. finmarchi cus, it is proposed to retain the former as a subspecies of G. finmarchicus. In introducing the ecological studies, results are presented which were obtained from a series of plankton samples taken during the NORWESTLANT Surveys. These demonstrate above all the dominance of GaJLanus fÂ« finmarchicus among the herbivorous copepods in the region south-west of Greenland. In addition to C. f. finmarchicus and G. f. glacialis, ten species of larger copepods (greater than 3 mm in body length) were obtained and the distribution and abundance of each is recorded. The occurrence of each species is analysed further in relation to sea temperature and depth in a way which enabled them to be classified as warm, intermediate or cold water and as slope, intermediate or oceanic species. It is suggested that the temperature characteristics of C. f. finmarchicus indicate that the sampled population is relatively stenothermic. The primary aim of the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey is zoogeographical and the abundance of Galanus finmarchicus s. l. makes it an ideal subject for distributional studies even in the areas to have come most recently within the Survey. Charts of distribution show that C. f. glacialis occurs only in those areas influenced by an outflow from the Arctic,i. e. the Labrador and Greenland coastal currents; that G. f. finmarchicus is found throughout the Survey area except for the extreme south-east and is most abundant in the colder oceanic regions of the North Atlantic; and that C. helgolandicus is a more southerly form which is most common in the south-east of the Survey area and in the waters of the Gulf Stream System. Low numbers of each form are generally found during the winter months. In spring, C. f, glacialis is the first to increase in numbers near the surface, starting in the regions most strongly affected by the Labrador Current and later in the more mixed waters south of the Newfoundland Grand Banks, G, f. finmarchicus is next to increase, first in the southern coastal areas and later further north and out into the open ocean, G, helgolandicus is last to increase in numbers, starting in the south and becoming progressively later towards the north. Where they overlap, C. f, finmarchicus is the spring-summer form, G. helgolandicus the summer-autumn one. Annual fluctuations in numbers are, with a few exceptions, closely similar throughout the Survey area. The most notable exception concerns C. f. finmarchicus on the Grand Banks where the cycle is a complete inversion of the typical pattern. The Continuous Plankton Recorder provides samples which can also be used in a detailed investigation of the ecology of abundant epiplanktonic species in a part of the Survey area. In the present study the annual cycle of C. f. finmarchicus on the continental shelf between Newfoundland and the Gulf of Maine has been investigated, as well as some aspects of the relationships with temperature and phytoplankton. There are two main generations in the year, in spring and summer, and a suggestion of a third one in the autumn. Timing was a little earlier in the vicinity of the Gulf of Maine than further to the north-east. Copepodids showed clearer relationships with environmental conditions than did adults, presumably because they had had less time to encounter and be affected by different conditions. An inverse relationship was apparent between metasome length of stage V and sea surface temperature two months previously. Fluctuations in the estimated biomass of younger copepodids (stages I - IV) closely followed those of estimates of the total phytoplankton at all times of year except the spring; in the four months from March to June the increase in phytoplankton was at first greatly in excess of that of young Calanus, to be followed two months later by signs of overgrazing before the balance was achieved again in July. It is suggested that the total biomass of Galanus did not fluctuate greatly through the year; stocks increased steadily during spring and summer and became depleted just as steadily during late autumn and winter. Hensen net samples taken in April, June and July, 1963 Â» during the NORWESTLAMT Surveys, formed the basis for an investigation of the speed and geographical pattern of development of C. f> finmarchicus in the waters around Greenland. The spring generation, the only important one in the year, began almost simultaneously throughout the area. It is suggested that light, rather than temperature, was associated with maturation of the population. Thereafter the speed of development varied from region to region, so that in July the generation was most advanced in the open Atlantic and southern Labrador Sea, less advanced further north and in shallower water. A temperature effect was apparent in this pattern. It was possible to define three regions within the Survey area, namely the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay, the Irminger Sea south to the Reykjanes Ridge, and the open <b>Atlantic</b> <b>south-east</b> of the Ridge, The relationships between sea temperature and the speed of development of Galanus in each region differed in such a way that, for a given temperature, development was fastest in the Labrador Sea and slowest in the open Atlantic, This is taken to indicate acclimatisation of the populations in each of the three regions. It is suggested that in this way populations of Galanus f. finmarchicus can complete a generation during the summer months, both in the cold water of the Labrador Sea and in water, some 8 - 11 C warmer, in the open Atlantic. In conclusion, the importance of the population as the basic unit in ecological investigations is emphasised. A high degree of ecotypic adaptation of populations is suggested as the means whereby Calanus finmarchicus s. l. has become widely distributed and reached high levels of abundance. Prominence must be given, therefore, to the identification of such populations in future studies. The vitality and adaptability of this copepod remain to be explained in terms of a wide range of biological disciplines. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{last one}} million years are {{important}} in terms of climate development during the so-called Mid-Pleistocene Transition when amplification of the glacial-interglacial cycles occurred. This study describes abundance changes in fossil planktonic foraminifera in sediments from Core T 89 - 40, retrieved from the Walvis Ridge in the <b>south-east</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> across this time period. Cycles between upwelling and subtropical planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are shown to mirror changes between glacial and interglacial periods, respectively. During interglacial marine isotopic stages (MIS) 9, 11 and 31, however, anomalously high abundances of the polar left-coiled Neogloboquadrina pachyderma occur, presumably linked to unusual seasonal upwelling waters. The planktonic foraminiferal abundance record shows 41 -ky cyclic variations in the regional oceanography linked to cycles in insolation influenced by changes in the Earth's axial tilt (obliquity). These orbitally induced oscillations in oceanographic change occurred throughout the entire record. The most conspicuous feature of the planktonic foraminiferal record is the near absence of left-coiled Globorotalia truncatulinoides between 960 and 610 ka (MIS 26 - 15). The abrupt disappearance of this species is synchronous with the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition in MIS 26. © The Palaeontological Association...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on larval {{distribution}} data from five lanternfish species outside the spawning grounds of the adult populations. Using hydrographic information collected with the larvae, the effect of surface currents on the observed patterns of distribution is discussed. In the <b>South-East</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> adjacent to the Benguela upwelling system, larvae of the pseudoceanic Lampanyctodes hectoris were found farther offshore (250 – 450 km) than usual. The general flow of the current {{is parallel to the}} coast, but upwelling filaments extend offshore. The size distributions of the L. hectoris larvae found, together with the rather low temperature at two of the oceanic stations sampled, indicate that they had been displaced by a filament. In the South-West Indian Ocean, the distribution of larvae of highly oceanic species of lanternfish over the shelf is related to onshore intrusions of the Agulhas Current. The size distributions of Hygophum hygomii and Scopelopsis multipunctatus indicate southward transport of larvae. The presence of larvae of Myctophum selenops and Benthosema pterotum, which have not been documented as adults in the region, indicates not only transport to the area, but also that spawning could be taking place closer to the area than previously reported...|$|E
