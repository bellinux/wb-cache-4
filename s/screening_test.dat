5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable <b>screening</b> <b>test.</b> If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical <b>screening</b> <b>test,</b> such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E

40|$|The MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd.), {{a commercially}} available, rapid (20 -min) slide latex {{agglutination}} test for the determination of methicillin resistance by detection of PBP 2 a in Staphylococcus aureus, was compared with the oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> and PCR detection of the mecA gene. A total of 563 S. aureus isolates were tested. Two hundred ninety-six of the isolates were methicillin-susceptible isolates from cultures of blood from consecutive patients. Also, 267 methicillin-resistant isolates that comprised 248 different phage types were tested. Methicillin resistance {{was defined as the}} presence of the mecA gene. Of the 267 mecA gene-positive isolates, 263 were positive by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (sensitivity, 98. 5 %), and all the mecA-gene negative strains were negative by the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (specificity, 100 %). The oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> detected methicillin resistance in 250 of the mecA gene-positive isolates (sensitivity, 93. 6 %). The sensitivity of the MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> was statistically significantly higher than the sensitivity of the oxacillin agar <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> (P < 0. 05). The MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>test</b> is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of methicillin resistance. Also, it offers results within half an hour and is easy to perform, which makes this test a valuable tool in the ongoing battle against methicillin-resistant S. aureus...|$|R
5|$|The first <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> {{in someone}} {{suspected}} of having HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial <b>screening</b> <b>test</b> is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol <b>Screening</b> <b>Test</b> (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
