5|$|Nursing lasts <b>six</b> <b>to</b> {{eight months}} in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, {{with the mother}} {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at <b>six</b> <b>to</b> eight months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
