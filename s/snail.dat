5|$|A <b>snail</b> {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a <b>snail</b> has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A <b>snail</b> often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden <b>snail</b> Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. The <b>snail</b> serves as first {{intermediate}} host to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} this small <b>snail,</b> as is Notocotylus zduni. This small <b>snail</b> is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this <b>snail</b> are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E
5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber <b>snail,</b> {{scientific}} name Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, is {{a species of}} small air-breathing land <b>snail</b> in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. This species was discovered in 1905, and was reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval ambersnail, Succinea ovalis. Several taxonomic reviews {{took place in the}} subsequent decades {{until the end of the}} 1980s, when the Chittenango ovate amber <b>snail</b> was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, based on chemical and morphological data.|$|E

50|$|The Calyptraeidae, the slipper <b>snails</b> or slipper limpets, cup-and-saucer <b>snails,</b> and Chinese hat <b>snails,</b> are {{a family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} marine prosobranch gastropods.

50|$|Crepidula, {{common name}} the slipper <b>snails,</b> slipper limpets or slipper shells, is a genus of sea <b>snails,</b> marine {{gastropod}} mollusks {{in the family}} Calyptraeidae.

5|$|The <b>snail</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} at Chittenango Falls in August 1905 by a field party from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1908, Henry Augustus Pilsbry reported the discovery, describing the <b>snail</b> as a subspecies of the widely distributed Succinea ovalis. Because of this, the Chittenango ovate amber <b>snail</b> {{is referred to}} in many publications as Succinea ovalis chittenangoensis.|$|E

5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or <b>snail</b> fever) is transmitted to humans via water <b>snail</b> hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some <b>snail</b> species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} molluscs, {{particularly}} certain snails and slugs, can be serious crop pests, and when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African <b>snail</b> Achatina fulica, {{has been introduced}} to many parts of Asia, {{as well as to}} many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. Attempts to control it by introducing the predatory <b>snail</b> Euglandina rosea proved disastrous, as the predator ignored Achatina fulica and went on to extirpate several native <b>snail</b> species, instead.|$|E

25|$|Predation by the {{non-native}} rosy glandina <b>snail</b> Euglandina rosea {{remains a}} serious threat to the survival of Newcomb's <b>snail.</b> This predatory <b>snail,</b> introduced into Hawai`i in 1955, has established populations throughout the main islands. The rosy glandina feeds on snails and slugs, and field studies document that it readily feeds on native snails found in Hawai`i. Furthermore, the rosy glandina <b>snail</b> exhibits remarkable hunting behaviors leading to capture and predation of submerged prey. Although terrestrial, the rosy glandina will fully immerse itself in water to locate and feed on aquatic molluscs such as Newcomb's <b>snail.</b> The rosy glandina has been observed on the wet, algae-covered rocks of the Makaleha Stream in close proximity to individual Newcomb's snails, and is believed to prey on them. The rosy glandina <b>snail</b> is responsible for the extirpation of many populations and even the extinction of numerous species of native snails throughout the Pacific Islands, and represents a significant threat to the survival of Newcomb's <b>snail.</b>|$|E
