25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead).

If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E
