40|$|Abstract. A good {{performance}} of traditional genetic algorithm {{is determined by}} its ability to identify building blocks and grow them to larger ones. To attain this objective a properly arranged chromosome is needed to ensure that building blocks will survive the application of recombination operators. The proposed algorithm periodically rearranges the order of genes in the chromosome while the actual information about the inter-gene dependencies is calculated on-line through the run. Standard 2 -point crossover, operating on the adapted chromosomal structure, is used to generate new solutions. Experimental results show that this algorithm is able to solve separable problems with <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> building block dependencies among genes {{as well as the}} hierarchical problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Categorization is the {{development}} in which objects are recognized, differentiated and understood. Categorization implies that objects are grouped as categories, usually for some precise purpose. There are many categorization theories and techniques such as conventional categorization, conceptual clustering, and Prototype theory. Conceptual Clustering is a data mining (machine learning) technique used to situate data elements into related groups without advance acquaintance of the group definitions. This correspondence describes extensions to the K-modes algorithm for clustering categorical data. The simple identical dissimilarity measure for categorical objects, allows the use of K-modes paradigm to attain a cluster with <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> similarity and competently cluster large categorical data sets. By exploiting the semantic formation of the sentences in documents, a better text clustering result is achieved...|$|E

Because of the advantages of chitosan, it has received much attention for many diverse applications in biomedicine, pharmaceutics, cosmetic, biomaterial, agriculture, food processing, and waste water treatment. Chitosan has high molecular weight and also <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Ozonation becomes alternatives to degrade chitosan into chitosan oligomers and glucosamine. In this study, chitosan was treated by ozonation process with various composition and temperature process. After ozonation, chitosan was characterized by viscosimetry and HPLC to determine molecular wight and also the dissolved product.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study that helps {{understand}} the mechanisms of adsorption of polyelectrolytes on particles, using numerical simulation methods, specifically the one known as dissipative particle dynamics are reported here. The adsorption of cationic polyelectrolytes of two different polymerization degrees interacting with two types of surfaces, one made of gold and the other of silica is predicted and compared. We find that a more negatively charged wall does not necessarily adsorb more cationic polyelectrolytes because the electrostatic repulsion between {{the wall and the}} polyelectrolytes is <b>stronger.</b> Additionally, <b>intra</b> chain repulsion plays an important role, because the largest polyelectrolyte chains have larger excluded volume than the shorter ones. In regard to the adsorption dependence on the polyelectrolyte polymerization degree we find that the excluded volume drives the adsorption throughout the intrachain electrostatic repulsion, because the SiO 2 surface is strongly negative. These results are expected to be useful for several nanotechnological applications of current interest, such as in gene therapy and in the improvement of drug delivering mechanisms.

40|$|Amiloidosis is the misfolding of soluble {{proteins}} {{followed by}} their self-assembling, resulting in aggregation into insoluble fibrils which replace the functional cells or block the connectivity between the cells. The mechanism of amyloid formation is still unclear. The amyloid beta protein 1 - 42 {{is responsible for}} formation of human amyloidosis leading to Alzheimer disease. In the present work we studied the formation of amyloid β-structure of the amyloid beta protein fragment 25 - 35 (Abeta 25 - 35), GSNKGAIIGLM. A flat, parallel single six stranded beta-sheet (6 Abeta 25 - 35) and ten stranded beta-sheet (10 Abeta 25 - 35), {{as well as a}} stack built from six stranded beta-sheet (6 x 6 Abeta 25 - 35) were simulated by molecular dynamics (MD) for 210 ns, 310 ns and 76 ns, respectively, using Amber 9. 0 program package, f 99 force field. Temperature was increased stepwise from 10 K with the constant temperature platos at 200 K and at 309 K. 6 Abeta 25 - 35 and 10 Abeta 25 - 35 single beta sheet systems show the stable ß-structure at 200 K temperature, but collapse loosing ß-structure at 309 K temperature, indicating that supplementary ß-sheets are required for ß-structure stabilization. The additional four strands in 10 Abeta 25 - 35 comparing to 6 Abeta 25 - 35 do not stabilize the β-sheet. In the 6 x 6 Abeta 25 - 35 beta-sheet stack the <b>strongest</b> <b>intra</b> β-sheet interactions, which keeps the stack together, is comprised by Ile 31 and Ile 32 forming {{the main part of the}} hydrophobic core. Apart from that, in the β-sheet stack the β-sheets are kept together by Leu 34 and Met 35 hydrophobic interactions and Ser 26 and Asn 27 electrostatic interactions. In several cases the sidechain of Lys 28 makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Gly 29 in the nearby β-sheet. The C-terminal part of the β-sheet stack is more prone to keep the β-sheet structure while the N-terminal part of the β-sheet stack is more flexible which is in accord with the experimental data [39]. A single strand of the Abeta 25 - 35 stack tends to jump away from the stack and turns from ß-structure to coil conformation with the further perspective to turn to α-helix. This is in accordance with literature data suggesting that the Abeta 25 - 35 peptide could form both β-structure and α-helical structure in water and membrane environment depending on conditions [38]...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{a model of}} an adaptive networked dynamical system, where the coupling strengths among phase oscillators coevolve with the phase states. It is shown that in this model the oscillators can spontaneously differentiate into two dynamical groups after a long time evolution. Within each group, the oscillators have similar phases, while oscillators in different groups have approximately opposite phases. The network gradually converts from the initial random structure with a uniform distribution of connection strengths into a modular structure which is characterized by <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> connections and weak inter connections. Furthermore, the connection strengths follow a power law distribution, which is a natural consequence of the coevolution of the network and the dynamics. Interestingly, {{it is found that}} if the inter connections are weaker than a certain threshold, the two dynamical groups will almost decouple and evolve independently. These results are helpful in further understanding the empirical observations in many social and biological networks. Comment: 14 page, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} time on the flow rate when the {{bounding}} surface is subjected to sinusoidal disturbances has been studied. The fluid under the consideration is of second order. When the angle of inclination of the fluid bed is increased, the flow rate is found to be periodic in its nature over a period of time. Further, it is noticed that, for constant angle of inclination, as the visco elasticity of the fluid is increased, still the periodic nature of flow rate is preserved. An interesting phenomenon that can be attributed for the above is due to the <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> molecular forces in the fluid medium. Further, when the time parameter is constant and as the porosity of the fluid bed is increased, for a constant time, a decreasing trend in the flow rate is noticed. However, the graphical and analytical results illustrate an interesting phenomenon. Also, for a constant visco elasticity of the fluid and for a fixed angle of inclination an...|$|E

Tuning the x ray {{energy to the}} electric dipole E 1, 2 p amp; 8594; 5 d or quadrupole E 2, 2 p amp; 8594; 4 f transition allows us to selectively and independently study the spin dynamics of the itinerant 5 d and localized 4 f electronic subsystems via {{the suppression of the}} magnetic 2 1 3 amp; 8722; amp; 964; satellite peak.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to face dog’s {{behavioural}} problems according with the cognitive relational method, working on both cognitive skills and relational system. 122 dogs with behavioural problems attributed to early adoption, <b>strong</b> limitations in <b>intra</b> and interspecific relationships, lack of experience and traumas, mistaken interspecific relationship, incorrect role of the dog in the family group participated to the study. A therapy based on knowledge modification and correction of relationship’s structure was implemented in all the subjects. The 122 dogs were divided in 2 groups: the first group constituted by 72 dogs with problems related to lack of experience, followed an educational training, the second group constituted by 50 dogs with problems related to traumas, followed a re-educative training. The interventions lasted from 4 to 12 months with 3 sessions per week. In 64 dogs from the first group behavioural problems were completely solved, 7 showed remarkable improvements and are continuing the therapy, 1 still shows the starting problem. In 42 dogs from the second group behavioural problems were solved, 5 showed improvements and are continuing the therapy, 3 still show the starting problem. The results evidence that dog’s behaviour is strictly related with epigenetic factors as variety and quality of environmental stimulations. A good knowledge of behavioural characteristics of an individual prevents behavioural problems and is necessary to solve them...|$|R

Strains carry a region bordered by two Ter sites that block both replication forks (for example between TerE and TerD in Figure S 1). We selected TerE as a predicted very <b>strong</b> site (strains <b>Intra</b> R 1 and Intra R 2 in Table 1), the couple TerH and TerI (TerHI, strains Intra R-NSright 1 to 4 in Table 1) as a predicted moderately strong site, and TerI (strain Intra R-NSright 3 ΔTerH in Table 1) or TerJ (strain L-NSleft 1 in Table 1) as a predicted weak site. As observed before with strong ectopic TerA site [1 - 3], the inversion {{of the strong}} TerE site severely affected colony formation (Figure 2 B). The size of colonies containing inverted TerHI sites was significantly reduced whereas the inversion of only a weak site, TerI or TerJ, had little effect. The detrimental effect produced by the inversions of TerE or TerHI can be suppressed either by a deletion of the tus gene or by the precise deletion of the Ter sites present in the inverted fragment (Figure S 1 B) ...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a chronic}} systemic disease that causes joint damage. A {{variety of methods}} {{have been used to}} evaluate the general health status of these patients but few have specifically evaluated the hands. The objective {{of this study was to}} translate, perform cultural adaptation and assess the validity of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire for Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Validation study conducted at a university hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. METHODS: Firstly, the questionnaire was translated into Brazilian Portuguese and back-translated into English. The Portuguese version was tested on 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and proved to be understandable and culturally adapted. After that, 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were evaluated three times. On the first occasion, two evaluators applied the questionnaire to check inter-rater reproducibility. After 15 days, one of the evaluators reassessed the patients to verify intra rater reproducibility. To check the construct validity at the first assessment, one of the evaluators also applied other similar instruments. RESULTS: There were <b>strong</b> inter and <b>intra</b> rater correlations in all the domains of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha was higher than 0. 90 for all the domains of the questionnaire, thus indicating excellent internal validity. Almost all domains of the questionnaire presented moderate or strong correlation with other instruments, thereby showing good construct validity. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire was translated and culturally adapted successfully, and it showed excellent internal consistency, reproducibility and construct validity...|$|R
40|$|This paper conducts {{an event}} study {{analysis}} of the market value impact of operational loss events on non-announcing firms in the U. S. banking and insurance industries. The two principal hypotheses investigated in the study are the contagion hypothesis, i. e., that operational risk events {{have a negative effect}} on stock prices of non-announcing firms, and the competition hypothesis, i. e., that operational risk events lead to wealth transfers from announcing to non-announcing firms. The rationale for anticipating a spillover effect from announcing to non-announcing firms is the convergence that has taken place over the past two decades in the previously fragmented markets for financial services – banks have entered the insurance market and insurers offer both wholesale and retail financial products in competition with banks. Three main sectors of the financial services industry are analyzed – commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance – and both intra and inter-sector analyses are conducted. The results indicate that operational risk events cause <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> and inter-sector contagion, i. e., the stock prices of non-announcing firms respond negatively to operational loss announcements. Regression analysis reveals that the negative effect represents information-based rather than pure contagion. 1 1...|$|E
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorders are {{associated}} with atypical movements, of which stereotypical motor movements (SMMs) interfere with learning and social interaction. The automatic SMM detection using inertial measurement units (IMU) remains complex due to the <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> and inter-subject variability, especially when handcrafted features are extracted from the signal. We propose a new application of the deep learning to facilitate automatic SMM detection using multi-axis IMUs. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a discriminative feature space from raw data. We show how the CNN {{can be used for}} parameter transfer learning to enhance the detection rate on longitudinal data. We also combine the long short-term memory (LSTM) with CNN to model the temporal patterns in a sequence of multi-axis signals. Further, we employ ensemble learning to combine multiple LSTM learners into a more robust SMM detector. Our results show that: 1) feature learning outperforms handcrafted features; 2) parameter transfer learning is beneficial in longitudinal settings; 3) using LSTM to learn the temporal dynamic of signals enhances the detection rate especially for skewed training data; 4) an ensemble of LSTMs provides more accurate and stable detectors. These findings provide a significant step toward accurate SMM detection in real-time scenarios...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the market value}} impact of operational risk events on both announcing and non-announcing firms in the U. S. Financial sectors and provides models to quantify operational risk. ^ I begin by conducting an event study analysis {{of the impact of}} operational loss events on the market values of banks and insurance companies, using the OpVar database. I focus on financial institutions because of the increased market and regulatory scrutiny of operational losses in these industries. The results reveal a strong, statistically significant negative stock price reaction to announcements of operational loss events. Moreover, the market value loss significantly exceeds the amount of the operational loss reported, implying that such losses convey adverse implications about future cash flows. ^ Next, I conduct an event study analysis of the market value impact of operational loss events on non-announcing firms in the U. S. banking and insurance industries. The two principal hypotheses investigated in the study are the contagion hypothesis, i. e., that operational risk events {{have a negative effect on}} stock prices of non-announcing firms, and the competition hypothesis, i. e., that operational risk events lead to wealth transfers from announcing to non-announcing firms. The results indicate that operational risk events cause <b>strong</b> <b>intra</b> and inter-sector contagion, i. e., the stock prices of non-announcing firms respond negatively to operational loss announcements. Regression analysis reveals that the negative effect represents information-based rather than pure contagion. ^ Finally, I provide a framework that allows the use of both external data and firm specific information to quantify operational risk so that firm specific capital calculation can be made. I utilize a model from Bayesian credibility theory to estimate the frequency distribution and introduce covariates in the estimation of severity distribution. A simulation procedure is presented to construct the entire aggregate distribution of operational risk exposure. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} silicon {{biogeochemical}} cycle {{and its associated}} parameters in 24 and 18 Indian estuaries during dry and wet periods respectively. We focus more specifically on dissolved Si (DSi), amorphous Si (ASi,) lithogenic Si (LSi), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), Total Suspended Material (TSM), Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN), salinity and fucoxanthin, a marker pigment for diatoms. Overall, we show that the estuaries have <b>strong</b> inter and <b>intra</b> variability of their biogeochemical parameters both seasonally and along salinity gradients. Based on Principal Component Analysis and clustering of categorised (upper and lower) estuaries, we discuss the four major processes controlling the Si variability of Indian estuaries: 1) lithogenic supply, 2) diatom uptake, 3) mixing of sea water and, 4) land use. The influence of lithogenic control is significantly higher during the wet period than during the dry period, due to a higher particle supply through monsoonal discharge. A significant diatom uptake is only identified in the estuaries during dry period. By {{taking into account the}} non-conservative nature of Si and by extrapolating our results, we estimate the fluxes from the Indian subcontinent of DSi, ASi, LSi to the Bay of Bengal (211 ± 32, 10 ± 4. 7, 2028 ± 317 Gmol) and Arabian Sea (80 ± 15, 7 ± 1. 1, 1717 ± 932 Gmol). We show the impact of land use in watersheds with higher levels of agricultural activity amplifies the supply of Si to the coastal Bay of Bengal during the wet season. In contrast, forest cover and steep slopes cause less Si supply to the Arabian Sea by restricting erosion when entering the estuary. Finally, Si:N ratios show that nitrogen is always in deficit relative to silicon for diatom growth, these high Si:N ratios likely contribute to the prevention of eutrophication in the Indian estuaries and coastal sea...|$|R
40|$|The NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 {{proteins}} {{of influenza}} viruses together {{are responsible for}} the transcription and replication of viral RNA, and the latter three proteins comprise the viral polymerase. Two recent reports indicated that the mutation at site 627 of PB 2 {{plays a key role in}} host range and increased virulence of influenza viruses, and could be compensated by multiple mutations at other sites of PB 2, suggesting the association of this mutation with those at other sites. The objective of this study was to analyze the co-mutated sites within and between these important proteins of influenza. With mutual information, a set of statistically significant co- mutated position pairs (P value = 0) in NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 of avian, human, pandemic 2009 H 1 N 1, and swine influenza were identified, based on which several highly connected networks of correlated sites in NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 were discovered. These correlation networks further illustrated the inner functional dependence of the four proteins that are critical for host adaptation and pathogenicity. Mutual information was also applied to quantify the correlation of sites within each individual protein and between proteins. In general, the inter protein correlation of the four proteins was <b>stronger</b> than the <b>intra</b> protein correlation. Finally, the correlation patterns of the four proteins of pandemic 2009 H 1 N 1 were found to be closer to those of avian and human than to swine influenza, thus rendering a novel insight into the interaction of the four proteins of the pandemic 2009 H 1 N 1 virus when compared to avian, human, and swine influenza and how the origin of these four proteins might affect the correlation patterns uncovered in this analysis...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) is {{a disease}} caused by Mycobacterium bovis, {{a member of the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which are bacteria that infect both domestic and wildlife host species. The zoonotic nature of the disease is of great concern globally. Over 50 million animals are infected all over the world, resulting in economic losses of approximately three billion United States dollars per year. Molecular typing techniques have greatly improved knowledge regarding the sources and modes of BTB transmission in many countries including South Africa. The current study was aimed at filling the knowledge gap regarding the epidemiology of the disease in livestock and wildlife species in the country for the purpose of effective control and management (in wildlife) as well as ultimate eradication (in livestock). Identification of a suitable typing technique for potential application in South Africa was the core purpose of the study. In an attempt to determine the manner of transmission within and between animal populations and map the geographical spread of this zoonotic disease, samples were collected from a variety of animal species throughout the country. In Chapter 2, molecular techniques (i. e. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, spoligotyping and variable number tandem repeat) were used to identify and characterize Mycobacterium bovis infecting buffaloes in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP) and three epidemiologically related game reserves over a 15 -year time frame. The findings demonstrated {{that the majority of the}} M. bovis infections in buffaloes were as a result of a single strain which has persisted throughout the years with spill-over to other wildlife species. Evidence of further M. bovis infections due to strains previously undetected in the park was also shown. With a view to providing a simple and reliable method suitable for studying the epidemiology of BTB in the country, we describe, in Chapter 3, how we evaluated the utility of known VNTR sequences as epidemiological markers to describe the molecular epidemiology of BTB in South Africa, with special emphasis on the Kruger National Park (KNP) where there is evidence of clonal expansion of the C 8 parental cattle strain. A set of VNTR loci that provided sufficient discriminatory power for application in epidemiological studies was identified. Potential use of VNTR typing in exploring evolutionary changes was also highlighted. To further establish the genetic diversity of the isolates and study the population structure of M. bovis, the loci were used to study a larger panel of M. bovis isolates from different regions (Chapter 4). The findings showed that besides cattle, at least 16 animal species contracted the infection, and highlighted a <b>strong</b> evidence of <b>intra</b> and inter-species transmission of M. bovis. Furthermore, the study also showed that despite the fact that a national control programme for BTB is applied in commercial cattle, there is a high diversity of M. bovis persisting in the country, highlighting the importance and need for intensified diagnostic testing and consideration of alternative control measures such as vaccination. Together with results obtained in Chapter 5, the study further indicated the presence of M. bovis infection in previously uninfected (or unknown status) game parks or reserves. Overall, three novel M. bovis strains (i. e. SB 1474, SB 2199 and SB 2200) were identified and their patterns are now available in the international M. bovis database. We also describe for the first time in South Africa, M. bovis infection in a blue wildebeest (Comochaetes taurinus), nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) and giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis); and a rare case of M. bovis infection causing pulmonary tuberculosis in a horse (Equus ferus caballus) is described in Chapter 6. To improve VNTR typing method for clonally linked isolates from the KNP, we sequenced whole genomes of local M. bovis isolates in Chapter 7. The tandem repeat loci identified were exploited for polymorphisms in M. tuberculosis complex isolates including M. bovis, with two of the five polymorphic loci identified showing potential discriminatory capabilities for clonally linked isolates. The epidemiological information gained in this investigation is particularly important in the context of the establishment of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTFP) where the potential spread of BTB from Kruger National Park to Limpopo National Park (Mozambique) and Gonarezhou National Park (Zimbabwe) (or vice versa) is of great concern. The availability of the local M. bovis genomes provides an opportunity for future comprehensive sequence comparisons which may assist in further deducing the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships of M. bovis isolates and efforts towards vaccine developments.
