The basic method of the research is decrypting method and implementation by case study method. This research is done in PT Air Mancur. This location research is selected on purpose because PT Air Mancur is a factory that processing plant medicine becomes an herb product more than 40 years, this company doesn’t pay attention for feasibility analysis if economic age of machines finished, and data that needed for this research is available. Based on infestations criteria Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are know that all of investation alternatives and feasible to do. But then, the infestation alternative for buy for new Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey <b>Stick</b> <b>Machine,</b> Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine is the best alternative. This decision is taken based on value of infestation criteria NPV and PI for buying new machine alternative is more than value infestation criteria NPV and PI for repairing machine alternative. In expectation, this alternative give more benefit than repairing the old machine. The result of this research show that the reasonable alternative is buy for new machine of Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey <b>Stick</b> <b>Machine,</b> Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine. From the research result suggested that PT Air Mancur should choose buying infestation alternative for new machine prioritized for Filling and Packaging Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, and Auto strip Packaging Machine because these machines are the oldest (17 years old). PT Air Mancur should give attention for the economic age of machines. All this time this company operated machines although the economic age of machine is finished. This research showed that repairing old machine as an effort for elongate machine’s economic age is an unprofitable alternative than buy new machine...|$|E

50|$|The basic {{ingredients}} are the bamboo stick, the paste (generally made of charcoal dust and joss/jiggit/gum/tabu powder - an adhesive {{made from the}} bark of litsea glutinosa and other trees), and the perfume ingredients - {{which would be a}} masala (spice mix) powder of ground ingredients into which the stick would be rolled, or a perfume liquid sometimes consisting of synthetic ingredients into which the stick would be dipped. Perfume is sometimes sprayed on the coated <b>sticks.</b> <b>Stick</b> <b>machines</b> are sometimes used, which coat the stick with paste and perfume, though the bulk of production is done by hand rolling at home. There are about 5,000 incense companies in India which take raw unperfumed sticks hand-rolled by approx 200,000 women working part-time at home, and then apply their own brand of perfume, and package the sticks for sale. An experienced home-worker can produce 4,000 raw sticks a day. There are about 50 main companies who together account for up to 30% of the market, and around 500 of the companies, including a significant number of the main ones, including Moksh Agarbatti and Cycle Pure, are based in Bangalore.|$|R

50|$|First, candy sticks cut to {{the desired}} length enter the <b>machine.</b> Each <b>stick</b> is bent individually, but the machine has a system of {{multiple}} grippers and rollers to continually bend the sticks, one after the other. As each <b>stick</b> enters the <b>machine,</b> it is positioned in a gripper which holds the straight portion of the cane with the part to be bent protruding out. Each gripper has on one side a curved die which the protruding end will be bent over. The candy stick is first bent to a right angle as it is moved past and put into contact with an inclined face. The patent application describes two potential versions of the mechanism which complete the bending process.|$|R
40|$|As {{the modern}} trend is {{approaching}} more towards handcrafted art and natural artifacts, {{the demand for}} such hand-crafted arts has increased tremendously. To meet this increasing market demand {{there is always a}} need for advancement in the conventional production techniques so as to counterbalance the ever-increasing market demand for such handcrafted arts. India is known for many cottage industries and handicrafts designs but still, continuous efforts are required to design and produce unique handicrafts to satisfy the customer demands. In most of the large-scale industries, production is achieved with the help of machines but whereas in small-scale production, the man force is a must to carry out the entire production manually which results in the increased workload on workers which ultimately affect production rate as well as quality. To overcome this and to minimize the stress on the worker, an attempt has been made to design a bamboo <b>stick</b> making <b>machine,</b> which is simple in design and even can be handled by unskilled labor. The designed Bamboo cutting machine is mainly used to cut the bamboo into required shapes which are used in small-scale industries to prepare ice cream sticks or incense sticks. Our main concern is to avoid the manual operation of cutting bamboo which is time-consuming. The cutting operation is achieved by using a pair of spur gears and rollers...|$|R

40|$|How to get {{traffic on}} credit ne {{of the biggest}} {{obstacles}} you will have once your offer is ready to get a ton of traffic is cash flow for ramping up the traffic. The problem will NOT be supply of traffic, there is a ton of traffic out there (you won’t {{be able to get}} your hands on all the traffic that will convert for your offer) the problem will be allocating that traffic you know converts and getting {{as much of it as}} possible to drive it to your website. Let me give you an example: With the diet patch campaign one of the very profitable traffic sources I found is running banners with Yahoo targeting women. I did a test and the traffic converted like crazy. Now what you want to do once you find a traffic pool that works is get as much of that traffic as you can get your hands on because you know that you can take as much of that traffic as you can get and turn it into cash. It’s like if you have built a “machine ” where every time you put in “one ” dollar it spits back out “five. ” How many one dollar bills would you want to <b>stick</b> into this <b>machine</b> if every time you put in one dollar it gave you back five? As many as you possibly could right? Well once you find a big traffic source that converts like Yahoo, this is the same exact scenario. The problem is that publishers will only grant you so much traffic on credit, usu-ally if it’s the first time you are doing busi-ness with them as long as you follow the formula I outline below, you can get them to grant you a $ 5, 000. 00 to $ 25, 000. 00 credit line with them. So that’s exactly what happened… Yahoo gave me a $ 25, 000. 00 credit line to start. I tested the traffic and was able to get it to convert like crazy. So now I want to get as much traffic as possible from Yahoo. I call my sales rep and ask him to send me a spread sheet with how much of this traffic is available on a monthly basis...|$|R
