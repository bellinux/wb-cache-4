5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's <b>start</b> <b>date</b> by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was August 1996, but principal photography did {{not begin}} until September 12, 1996. Batman & Robin finished filming in late January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule. The film was mostly shot at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E
30|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> for subsidised {{employment}} {{are available}} from the PES (since they refer to the <b>starting</b> <b>date</b> of a program administrated by the PES), but not the <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> for non-subsidized employment. Hence, we relied on our measures in the month of November, which we also used as outcomes.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was July 10, 2000, but filming {{was delayed}} until August. Aside {{from a couple}} of weeks shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon, A.I. was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach, California.|$|E
5|$|Although {{construction}} was planned {{to begin in}} 2005, the delays in approval of funding pushed back the <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> To facilitate Silver Line construction, responsibility for the project was transferred on November 1, 2008, from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to the MWAA. Utility relocation work began in 2008, and construction began on March 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to the Soviet forces, the German 6th Army, {{under the}} newly {{appointed}} General Paulus, was issued orders for Operation Fredericus on 30 April 1942. This operation was {{to crush the}} Soviet armies within the Izium salient south of Kharkov, created during the Soviet spring offensives in March and April. The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 18 May.|$|E
40|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer {{rainy season}} during {{historical}} times (1736 - 1911) in Fuzhou and Guangzhou of South China, were determined and reconstructed {{on the basis}} of historical documents in the Yu-Xue-Fen-Cun archive, together with observed features of precipitation during the pre-summer rainy season. In addition; <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer rainy season from 1953 in Fuzhou and from 1952 in Guangzhou were reconstructed for the instrumental period. These data allowed for analyses of inter-annual and inter-decadal changes in the <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of the pre-summer rainy season in South China over the past 300 years. Results show that the mean <b>starting</b> <b>date</b> of the pre-summer rainy season in South China was the first pentad of May; in addition, periodicities in the <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> of 2 - 3 years, 10 years, and 40 years were detected during the period 1736 - 1911, and of 2 - 3 years, 10 years, and 22 years during the instrumental period. From 1736 to 1911, the earliest <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> at Fuzhou and Guangzhou both occurred at the fourth pentad of April, while the latest <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> were at the sixth pentad of May in Fuzhou and the first pentad of June in Guangzhou. During the instrumental period, the earliest and latest <b>starting</b> <b>dates</b> were at the fourth pentad of April and the first pentad of June, respectively, in both Fuzhou during 1953 - 2010 and Guangzhou during 1952 - 2010. The maximum difference between neighboring decades during 1736 - 1911 was 2. 2 and 1. 6 pentads in Fuzhou and Guangzhou, respectively, and during the instrumental period it was 2. 5 and 2. 4 pentads in Fuzhou and Guangzhou, respectively...|$|R

5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|E
5|$|The film {{suffered}} setbacks {{in development}} in December 2002. Rudin left Unfortunate Events over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount's $100million budget. The studio decided that changing the shoot from Hollywood to Wilmington, North Carolina {{would be less}} expensive. The April 2003 <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled the situation in January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director's position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was mid-1999, {{with the}} release date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X-Men to June. Steven Spielberg {{had been scheduled to}} film Minority Report for release in June 2000, but he had chosen to film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Fox needed a film to fill the void. This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had been pushed back. The release date was then moved to July 14.|$|E

5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was mid-August 1995, but filming {{was delayed}} until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, {{because he was}} a fan of his work in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X) intended to have the war room pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate the look of the 1960s trading cards.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E
5|$|With a {{production}} budget of $200 million, Green Lantern was initially {{scheduled to begin}} filming in November 2009 at Fox Studios Australia. The <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was pushed back to January 2010, but the production moved to Louisiana, where, on March 3, 2010, test footage was filmed in Madisonville involving stunt cars. Principal photography began on March 15, 2010 in New Orleans. Nine days after filming began, Angela Bassett joined the cast as Dr. Amanda Waller, a government agent who is {{a staple of the}} DC Comics universe.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent {{on the availability of}} air and helicopter support, and the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted.|$|E
5|$|In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were {{planning}} to start production on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro {{with the potential to}} direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated {{that the rest of the}} major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 <b>start</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was pushed back twice.|$|E

5|$|On January 4, 2017, {{the office}} of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo {{announced}} a plan to renovate the entire airport {{at a cost of}} $7–10 billion. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system. There would also be a rebuilding the Jamaica station so that there is a direct connection to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Subway. There is no proposed <b>start</b> <b>date</b> for the overhaul. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published a study in which it studied a possible direct rail link from Manhattan. In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting proposals for master plans to renovate the airport.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Guandique. He was {{returned}} to {{the custody of the}} District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Panzer Army's {{offensive}} forced Stavka {{to recalculate}} its intentions for Operation Saturn, and on 13 December Stalin and Stavka authorized the redeployment of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front, {{where it would}} be ready to be used against German forces on 15 December. This army had a strength of roughly 90,000 soldiers, organized into three guards rifle corps (the 1st, 13th and 2nd). Operation Saturn was redesigned into Operation Little Saturn, which limited the scope of the attack to breaking through the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear. The offensive was also changed from a southward push to a drive in a southeastern direction, and the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was pushed back to 16 December. In the meantime, the 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces {{in the vicinity of the}} Alksay River, trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army.|$|E
