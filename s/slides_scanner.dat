40|$|Background: Validation {{of digital}} whole slide images {{is crucial to}} ensure that {{diagnostic}} performance is at least equivalent to that of glass slides and light microscopy. The College of American Pathologists Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center recently developed recommendations for internal digital pathology system validation. Following these guidelines we sought to validate {{the performance of a}} digital approach for routine diagnosis by using an iPad and digital control widescreen-assisted workstation through a pilot study. Methods: From January 2014, 61 histopathological slides were scanned by ScanScope Digital <b>Slides</b> <b>Scanner</b> (Aperio, Vista, CA). Two independent pathologists performed diagnosis on virtual slides in front of a widescreen by using two computer devices (ImageScope viewing software) located to different Health Institutions (AOUI Verona) connected by local network and a remote image server using an iPad tablet (Aperio, Vista, CA), after uploading the Citrix receiver for iPad. Quality indicators related to image characters and work-flow of the e-health cockpit enterprise system were scored based on subjective (high vs poor) perception. The images were re-evaluated two weeks apart...|$|E

40|$|Background: Currently {{available}} microscope <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> produce whole <b>slide</b> images {{at various}} resolutions from histological sections. Nevertheless, acquisition area and so visualization of large tissue samples {{are limited by}} the standardized size of glass slides, used daily in pathology departments. The proposed solution has been developed to build composite virtual slides from images of large tumor fragments. Materials and methods: Images of HES or immunostained histological sections of carefully labeled fragments from a representative slice of breast carcinoma were acquired with a digital <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> at a magnification of 20 ×. The tiling program involves three steps: the straightening of tissue fragment images using polynomial interpolation method, and the building and assembling of strips of contiguous tissue sample whole slide images in × and y directions. The final image is saved in a pyramidal BigTiff file format. The program has been tested on several tumor slices. A correlation quality control {{has been done on}} five images artificially cut. Results: Sixty tumor slices from twenty surgical specimens, cut into two to twenty six pieces, were reconstructed. A median of 98. 71 % is obtained by computing the correlation coefficients between native and reconstructed images for quality control. Conclusions: The proposed method is efficient and able to adapt itself to daily work conditions of classica...|$|R
40|$|Relative {{abundance}} of tumour angiogenesis {{has been shown}} to be of clinical relevance in cancers of various locations such as the ovary. Nevertheless, several problems are encountered when quantifying tumour microvessels: (i) as many other tumour markers, vascularity pattern is often heterogeneous within the tumour mass and even within the same histological section. As a consequence, an adequate acquisition method must be developed for accurate field sampling. (ii) Manual microvessel counting is long, tedious and subject to poor reproducibility. Introduction in routine practice requires a fast, reproducible and reliable automatic image processing. In this study we present an original procedure combining a <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> image acquisition and a fully automatic image analysis sequence. The <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> offers the advantage of recording an image of the whole histological section for subsequent automatic blood vessel detection and hot spot area location. Microvessel density and surface fraction were measured for the whole section as well as within hot spots. Different immunostaining methods were tested in order to optimise the procedure. Moreover, the method proposed was submitted to a quality control procedure, with reference to interactive identification of microvessels at scanner level. This experiment showed that 93 to 97 % of blood vessels were detected, according to the staining protocol used. Colour figures can be viewed on [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The active {{search for}} markers of {{prognostic}} impact and therapeutic response is of crucial importance in oncology. The amount of stroma {{is a potential}} indicator with {{a significant impact on}} tumor growth. To solve the problems linked to tumor heterogeneity and, hence, of quantization at the microscopic level, we developed an image-analysis strategy dedicated to estimating the proportion of tumor connective tissue in whole histological sections at low resolution. 2, 700 -dot-per-inch numerical images were acquired with a calibrated <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> and automatically analyzed. We performed a quality control in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method of analysis at the selected resolution. The point-counting method and the interactive drawing of stroma limits on equivalent mosaic microscopic images were "the gold standards. " The proportions of stroma estimated on microscopic images (magnification with a 4 × objective corresponding to 16, 200 dots per inch) and on <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> images (2, 700 dots per inch) through point counting stereology or manual delineation were equivalent (p < 0. 0001). The results obtained through automatic image processing of scanner images were also close to the gold standard (95 % correlation, p < 0. 0001). The proposed method makes it possible to estimate the stroma amount of ovarian carcinomas in whole histological sections with a simple, fast, and low-cost acquisition device...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{opportunity}} {{offered by}} whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> of automated histological analysis implies an ever increasing importance of digital pathology. To {{go beyond the}} importance of conventional pathology, however, digital pathology may need a basic histological starting point {{similar to that of}} hematoxylin and eosin staining in conventional pathology. This study presents an automated fluorescence-based microscopy approach providing highly detailed morphological data from unstained microsections. This data may provide a basic histological starting point from which further digital analysis including staining may benefit. Methods: This study explores the inherent tissue fluorescence, also known as autofluorescence, as a mean to quantitate cardiac tissue components in histological microsections. Data acquisition using a commercially available whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> and an image-based quantitation algorithm are presented. Results: It is shown that the autofluorescence intensity of unstained microsections at two different wavelengths is a suitable starting point for automated digital analysis of myocytes, fibrous tissue, lipofuscin, and the extracellular compartment. The output of the method is absolute quantitation along with accurate outlines of above-mentioned components. The digital quantitations are verified by comparison to point grid quantitations performed on the microsections after Van Gieson staining. Conclusion: The presented method is amply described as a prestain multicomponent quantitation and outlining tool for histological sections of cardiac tissue. The main perspective is the opportunity for combination with digital analysis of stained microsections, for which the method may provide an accurate digital framework...|$|R
30|$|After {{removal of}} the matrix, the slides were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Cover slipped H and E-stained slides were loaded into the <b>slide</b> <b>scanner</b> (Mirax Midi <b>Slide</b> <b>Scanner,</b> Zeiss, Germany) to take {{detailed}} images for selection of regions of interest at high resolution [26]. The raw image files were opened in Aperio ImageScope Viewer v 12.1 (Leica Biosystems Imaging Inc., Vista, CA), where {{a photo of the}} detailed HE scan could be taken and saved as a .tiff image file. The same HE images were annotated by a pathologist highlighting tumor cell dense regions using the Path XL web-based software tool. These annotations were transferred and overlaid on to extracted ion maps of tamoxifen for comparison of tumor areas with stroma within each section using the open source image processing software Fiji (ImageJ v 2.0. 0; [URL] Outlines of the areas representing the malignant tissue were directly derived from the highlights made by the pathologist. Outlines of the areas representing unaffected stroma were obtained from the images of HE stained tissue, in which the ROIs representing the tumor areas were filled with background color. The images were then converted to binary representation, and “Create Selection” function was applied to outline the tissue sections and create regions of interest which excluded tumor areas and spaces not occupied by cells. The mean intensity values were determined and used for statistical evaluation calculating the p value in two-tailed paired t test.|$|R

Cell-based analysis was performed with automated cell segmentation based on colour: haematoxylin in the blue and DAB in the red channel. To avoid artefacts, a threshold for minimum cell area and variance of haematoxylin staining was set. Positive cells were selected based on mean and maximum intensity of DAB. Data were generated by calculating {{the percentage of the}} DAB-reactive cells in relation to the total number of cells in the regions of interest.|$|R

40|$|Whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> are novel {{devices that}} enable {{high-resolution}} imaging {{of an entire}} histological slide. Furthermore, the imaging is achieved {{in only a few}} minutes, which enables image rendering of large-scale studies involving multiple immunohistochemistry biomarkers. Although whole slide imaging has improved considerably, locally poor focusing causes blurred regions of the image. These artifacts may strongly affect the quality of subsequent analyses, making a slide review process mandatory. This tedious and time-consuming task requires the scanner operator to carefully assess the virtual slide and to manually select new focus points. We propose a statistical learning method that provides early image quality feedback and automatically identifies regions of the image that require additional focus points.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{microscopic}} imaging {{systems such}} as whole <b>slide</b> <b>scanners</b> provide very large (up to 18 GB) high resolution images. Such amounts of memory raise major issues that prevent usual image representation models from being used. Moreover, using such high resolution images, global image features, such as tissues, do not clearly appear at full resolution. Such images contain thus different hierarchical information at different resolutions. This paper presents the model of tiled top-down pyramids which provides a framework to handle such images. This model encodes a hierarchy of partitions of large images defined at different resolutions. We also propose a generic construction scheme of such pyramids whose validity is evaluated on an histological image application...|$|R
