5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk,</b> in {{the same}} genus and thought to be similar in {{appearance}} ...|$|E
50|$|Storrs L. Olson {{studied the}} bird in 2007 {{and placed it}} in the genus Buteogallus owing to its {{similarity}} to the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk</b> (Buteogallus meridionalis) {{is a large}} raptor {{found in}} open savanna and swamp edges. It was {{formerly}} placed in the genus Heterospizias. It breeds from Panama and Trinidad south to Bolivia, Uruguay and central Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Though {{generally}} {{found in}} lowland rainforest or gallery forest in lowland <b>savanna,</b> the Papuan <b>hawk</b> owl is occasionally found at elevations up to 1500 m above sea level. It {{is probably a}} resident species in its restricted range, New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk</b> {{feeds on}} small mammals, lizards, snakes, crabs and large insects. It usually sits {{on an open}} high perch from which it swoops on its prey, but will also hunt on foot, and several birds may gather at grass fires.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, Hildegarde Howard {{assigned}} a coracoid and (tentatively) some phalanges to Wetmoregyps from specimens at the tar pits. She noted these fossils {{were difficult to}} distinguish from those of Woodward's eagle (Buteogallus woodwardi), a huge bird of prey in the same genus as the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Harpyhaliaetus is {{a former}} genus of eagles. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the solitary eagle is closely related to the black-hawks, in {{particular}} the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk</b> (Buteogallus meridionalis) which is smaller and browner but otherwise very similar to Harpyhaliaetus. Therefore, this genus is now merged into that of the black-hawks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk</b> is 46-61 cm {{in length}} and weighs 845 g. The adult has a rufous body with grey {{mottling}} above and fine black barring below. The flight feathers of the long broad wings are black, and the tail is banded black and white. The legs are yellow. The call is a loud scream keeeeru.|$|E
5000|$|However, it is some 40 percent {{larger than}} the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk.</b> This gives it a total length of 64-90 cm, {{including}} 26-32.2 cm of tail; its wingspan would have been 169-196 cm. Body weight is estimated at 3 kg. This makes it quite a heavy raptor, slightly greater than the present-day secretarybird of Africa. This African raptor shares the long legs of Daggett's eagle and their lifestyles may have been similar (see [...] "Ecology" [...] below).|$|E
5000|$|Daggett's eagle (Buteogallus daggetti), {{also known}} as the walking eagle, is an extinct species of long-legged hawk which lived in {{southwest}} North America during the Pleistocene. Initially believed {{to be some sort of}} carrion-eating eagle, it was for some time placed in the distinct genus Wetmoregyps (meaning [...] "Alexander Wetmore's vulture"). It probably resembled a larger version of the modern-day <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk,</b> with its long legs possibly used like the secretarybird of Africa to hunt for small reptiles from a safe distance. It died out about 13,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its large}} size and long legs, Daggett's eagle is theorized {{to have lived}} rather like the modern-day secretarybird. Its diet would have been {{composed}} mostly of snakes and other small reptiles, which it would have kicked to death with its long legs. Not just good weapons, these legs would have kept the bird {{at a safe distance}} from its struggling prey. Olson's paper guessed that Daggett's eagle may have been attracted to grass fires as the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk</b> is today. These fires chase out small animals, which then make easy prey for the raptors.|$|E
5000|$|In life, Daggett's eagle {{is thought}} to have resembled the related <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk,</b> also of the genus Buteogallus: B. daggetti had long legs which earned it the {{nickname}} [...] "walking eagle". Miller (1915) concluded that these legs had little lifting power and weakly grasping claws compared to eagles that hunt on the wing. Conversely, the points of strong muscle attachment on the shaft of the tarsus suggest walking proficiency. He likened this [...] "degeneracy" [...] to the relationship of the roadrunner to tree-dwelling cuckoos. As with many birds, its females were larger than the males, an example of sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5000|$|The solitary eagles (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) are a more inland {{relative}} of the [...] "black" [...] group of Buteogallus - in phenotype they are essentially hefty common black-hawks with lighter body plumage and in one species a small crest. Insofar as {{there are differences in}} anatomy, these seem {{to be related to the}} different prey they hunt (namely reptiles). Together with the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk,</b> they seem to be close to some species that were uncomfortably placed in Leucopternis. As that genus was apparently polyphyletic, the present article follows a proposal to unite the solitary eagles as well as the slate-coloured hawk ("Leucopternis" [...] schistaceus) with Buteogallus, to agree with the morphological and mtDNA sequence data., with the addition of the white-necked hawk, [...] "Leucopternis" [...] lacernulatus.|$|E
50|$|For a {{long time}} various systematists have {{proposed}} moving the slate-coloured hawk to Buteogallus. Together with the crab hawks and solitary eagles form a sequence of plumage patterns that nicely agrees with the DNA-based phylogeny: the slate-coloured hawk {{looks very much like}} a smaller, shorter-legged and lighter common black hawk. The case of the white-necked hawk is more puzzling. It is visually and ecologically almost identical to the sympatric mantled hawk (Leucopternis polionotus) and some allopatric white hawks (L. albicollis) but differs in tail color. According to the mtDNA data, it is very closely related to the <b>savanna</b> <b>hawk,</b> which is visually dissimilar, appearing like a very light Buteogallus which has an ochre-grey coloration due to abundant pheomelanins. Either there has been strong convergent evolution in plumage and ecology - perhaps a case of mimicry - between the white-necked and the mantled hawks, or the mtDNA data is misleading due to ancient hybrid introgression. In the respect, {{it is interesting to note}} that the white-necked hawk specimen sampled showed indications of heteroplasmy.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of roadside point transects for estimating abundance could {{be related to}} better stationary scanning of the sample area for raptors rather than observers constantly moving along the route. The time spent scanning each unit of area (e.g., a hectare) in roadside strip transects tends to be shorter than when conducting roadside point transects, reducing the probability of detecting inconspicuous raptors. However, roadside point transects tend to increase the probability of individual detection, particularly of raptors perched in less exposed sites (e.g., in a tree with dense foliage, on a fence, or on the ground), where the sighting of raptors might be more difficult (Diesel 1984). Increasing the duration of the survey may compensate for differences in the probability of detection among species with different foraging behaviors. Most species, both those that usually soar and have active flight-foraging behaviors (e.g., vultures and the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle) and those that forage on the ground or from a perch (e.g., <b>Savanna</b> <b>Hawk</b> and Southern Caracara), were more abundant in the roadside point transects than strip transects, suggesting that the former is less sensitive to species behavior.|$|E
30|$|The {{assemblage}} on {{the coastal}} plain was characterized by species associated with wet habitats and that are also tolerant of human disturbance. The most abundant species, the Black Vulture and Southern Caracara, are both regularly found in urban and agricultural areas (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Alencar-Carvalho and Marini 2007), although the latter {{is also found in}} natural grasslands (Filloy and Bellocq 2007; Pedrana et al. 2008). The American Kestrel and Roadside Hawk are abundant in Rio Grande do Sul (Belton 1984). They are food and habitat generalists (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), show a high tolerance to human disturbance, and are even found inside big cities (Belton 1984; Scherer et al. 2005). The Snail Kite and <b>Savanna</b> <b>Hawk</b> are common in coastal areas of southern Brazil and Uruguay (Belton 1984; Albuquerque et al. 1986; Arballo and Cravino 1999; Zilio et al. 2012). These species were abundant on {{the coastal plain}}, surely favored due to the availability of marshes and rice fields in the region. The Long-winged Harrier had a similar pattern of distribution, being more abundant on the coastal plain than on altitudinal grasslands, agreeing with Albuquerque et al. (1986) who found high abundances further to the south. The occurrence of Long-winged Harriers was positively associated with marshes (Pedrana et al. 2008), a common habitat type on the coastal plain, but a habitat type less frequently encountered in altitudinal grasslands (F Zilio personal observation).|$|E
