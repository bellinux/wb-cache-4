5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. <b>So,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no confirmed observations of comets {{that are likely to}} have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E
5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
