5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli.

25|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{is carried}} out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs a DNA sequence called a Pribnow box {{as well as a}} <b>sigma</b> <b>factor</b> (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the promoter and a set of DNA-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, snoRNAs or long non-coding RNAs). Pol II includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is rich in serine residues. When these residues are phosphorylated, the CTD binds to various protein factors that promote transcript maturation and modification. RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (e.g., 7SK). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sigma</b> <b>factors</b> are an {{essential}} part of bacterial gene regulation and have been extensively studied as far as their molecular mechanisms and protein structure are concerned. However, their molecular evolution, especially for the alternative <b>sigma</b> <b>factors,</b> is poorly understood. Here, we analyze the evolutionary forces that have shaped the rpoH <b>sigma</b> <b>factors</b> within the alphaproteobacteria. We found that an ancient duplication gave rise to two major groups of rpoH <b>sigma</b> <b>factors</b> and that after this event horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurred in rpoH 1 group. We also noted that purifying selection has differentially affected distinct parts of the gene; singularly, the gene segment that encodes the region 4. 2, which interacts with the - 35 motif of the RpoH-dependent genes, has been under relaxed purifying selection. Furthermore, these two major groups are clearly differentiated from one another regarding their promoter selectivity, as rpoH 1 is under the transcriptional control of σ 70 and σ 32, whereas rpoH 2 is under the transcriptional control of σ 24. Our results suggest a scenario in which HGT, gene loss, variable purifying selection and clear promoter specialization occurred after the ancestral duplication event.
