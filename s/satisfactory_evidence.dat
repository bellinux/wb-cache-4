She also joined the growing consensus that Triceratops should be classified among the long-frilled ceratopsids. Forster performed a cladistic analysis of the ceratopsids. She argued against the idea that ceratopsid frills served as attachment sites for large jaw muscles. She observed that the opening in the skull above the animal's temple seems to show the physical location extent of the jaw muscle attachment point. She supported the hypothesis that ceratopsids used their horns and frills in competition over mates.|$|E

Kulashekara alwar mentions this temple as Tillai Chitrakutam and equates Chitrakuta of Ramayana fame with this shrine. King Kulothunga Chola II is believed to have uprooted the presiding Govindraja image from the shrine. [...] The shrine has close connections with the Govindaraja temple in Tirupati dating back to saint Ramanuja of the 11-12th century. Ramanujar fled to Tirupati with the utsava (festival image) of the temple to escape punishment. [...] Down the centuries, king Krishnappa Nayak (1564-1572 A.D.) was instrumental in installing the image of Govindaraja back in the temple. There was lot of resistance from the shaivites (those worshipping Shiva) against placing the Vishnu image in a revered Shiva temple, but the king was unmoved and the image was installed in the present form. There is no <b>satisfactory</b> <b>evidence</b> of co-existence of the Shiva and Vishnu shrines within the same temple built during the same time - there was a dispute even in last century during 1849 A.D. regarding the rights on the Govindaraja idol and Alwar Sannidhi(sanctum of azhwars) between Vaishnavas and Dikshitars and the position of Vaishnavas was upheld by the district court.|$|E

With a careful scan of the published work at corporate level productivity, we shows that, researchers have developed 3 different approaches in assessing the correlation between IT implementation and productivity measures. Broadly speaking, the first two approaches focus on the effects of IT investment on direct and intermediary, financial and non-financial, measures of productivity. None of these two approaches could positively prove either a direct correlation or lack of such a relation. The third approach, `complementary` approach, considers the IT implementation but emphasizes the role of complementary investments that enhance and complement the IT implementation. In this article, an effort has been made to provide <b>satisfactory</b> <b>evidences</b> to show that IT implementation, when rationally backed up by suitable complementary investment, will lead to a considerable increase in productivity at corporate level...|$|R

The present study assessed whether equivalent scaling properties could be found in a comprehensive assessment of satisfaction with care (CASC) administered in cancer patients from French, Polish and Swedish oncology settings, in comparison to the scaling properties previously evidenced in the CASC with an Italian sample. A total of 140, 186 and 133 oncology patients were approached in France, Poland and Sweden, respectively. Specific items in the CASC were identified as consistently omitted across country samples. Multitrait scaling analysis on an item-grouping adapted for the French, Polish, Swedish and Italian samples provided excellent internal consistencies and convergent validity estimates. Discriminant validity proved less <b>satisfactory,</b> <b>evidencing</b> overlap between hypothesised care dimensions across country samples. The identification of omitted or overlapping items will lead to the design of a revised CASC version to further test in larger cross-cultural sample...|$|R

[...] Once a contract of that kind is established, equity will impose on the surviving testator a constructive trust not to dispose of the property in any other way. [...] There {{did not have to be}} more detailed terms of the contract because the remedy was not founded on specific performance of contractual obligations but upon implementation of the trust, and the intentions of the parties had only to be expressed sufficiently to lay the foundations for that equitable obligation. [...] The case also held that, where established, the equitable obligation under the trust became immediately binding upon the surviving testator upon the death of the first and was not postponed to take effect only after the death of the second or last testator when the property, or what was left of it, came into the hands of his personal representatives.|$|E

[...] "The making the machinery, and what was published before, hit so well together, is," [...] he told Spencer, [...] "I think, one of the greatest proofs of judgment of anything I ever did." [...] And he might well be proud. Macaulay, in a well-known passage, has pointed out how seldom in the history of literature such a recasting of a poem has been successfully accomplished. But Pope's revision of 'The Rape of the Lock' was so successful that the original form was practically done away with. No one reads it now but professed students of the literature of Queen Anne's time. And so artfully has the new matter been woven into the old that if the recasting of 'The Rape of the Lock' were not a commonplace even in school histories of English literature, not one reader in a hundred would suspect that the original sketch had been revised and enlarged to more than twice its length. It would be an interesting task for the student to compare the two forms printed in this edition, to note exactly what has been added, and the reasons for its addition, and to mark how Pope has smoothed the junctures and blended the old and the new. Nothing that he could do would admit him more intimately to the secrets of Pope's mastery of his art.|$|R
40|$|Accurate distant {{metastasis}} (DM) {{prediction is}} critical for risk stratification and effective treatment decisions in breast cancer (BC). Many prognostic markers/models based on tissue marker studies are continually emerging using conventional statistical approaches analysing complex/dimensional data association with DM/poor prognosis. However, few of them have fulfilled <b>satisfactory</b> <b>evidences</b> for clinical application. This study aimed at building DM risk assessment algorithm for BC patients. A well-characterised series of early invasive primary operable BC (n = 1902), with immunohistochemical expression of a panel of biomarkers (n = 31) formed the material of this study. Decision tree algorithm was computed using WEKA software, utilising quantitative biomarkers’ expression and the absence/presence of distant metastases. Fifteen biomarkers {{were significantly associated with}} DM, with six temporal subgroups characterised based on time to development of DM ranging from 15 years of follow-up. Of these 15 biomarkers, 10 had a significant expression pattern where Ki 67 LI, HER 2, p 53, N-cadherin, P-cadherin, PIK 3 CA and TOMM 34 showed significantly higher expressions with earlier development of DM. In contrast, higher expressions of ER, PR and BCL 2 were associated with delayed occurrence of DM. DM prediction algorithm was built utilising cases informative for the 15 significant markers. Four risk groups of patients were characterised. Three markers p 53, HER 2 and BCL 2 predicted the probability of DM, based on software-generated cut-offs, with a precision rate of 81. 1 % for positive predictive value and 77. 3 %, for the negative predictive value. This algorithm reiterates the reported prognostic values of these three markers and underscores their central biological role in BC progression. Further independent validation of this pruned panel of biomarkers is therefore warranted...|$|R
