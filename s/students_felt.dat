5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises {{spurred on by}} civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was a proponent of military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> was forced by the chancellor.|$|E

25|$|However, VSU {{was seen}} as a welcome relief to many groups of {{students}} within Universities, especially those who felt that the Student Unions offered them very little benefit. For example, many younger <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> it unfair for them to pay between $200–$300 to subsidise things like childcare which primarily benefited mature age students.|$|E

30|$|The outcome {{variables}} {{used in the}} analyses serve {{as a proxy for}} student and instructor perception of OTLs. The outcome in the student analysis was whether each student responded affirmatively or negatively to the statement, “My Calculus instructor allowed time for me to understand difficult ideas.” As described in the measuring perceptions of OTL section above, original student responses to this statement on the survey were dichotomized, such that a “ 1 ” indicates a <b>student</b> <b>felt</b> there was adequate time and a “ 0 ” denotes the student did not feel there was enough time. Since this outcome is binary, we used a logistic regression model to quantify the effect of each of the variables in the second column of Table  1 on the probability that a <b>student</b> <b>felt</b> there was enough time.|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that Facebook causes {{negative}} effects on self-esteem by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving {{to be the largest}} resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by Utah Valley University found that college <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> worse about their own lives following an increase in {{the amount of time spent}} on Facebook.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that if the sexual {{harassment}} was done by a male, {{both male and female}} victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not want to return to school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of students reported having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males. Other effects include getting into trouble at school, changing the route in which one gets to and from school, and stopping doing activities and sports.|$|E

25|$|Causes for {{the high}} female {{dismissal}} rate were studied at Jimma University. Students re-admitted in 2007-08 and staff completed questionnaires and took part in focus groups. Only 37% of female students had been taught by female teachers. The advantages of having female teachers were that female teachers were better than male teachers at understanding their problems, they could share their experiences of the challenges they had to overcome, they could discuss their problems freely and find solutions. In class, female <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> free to ask and answer questions and female teachers showed them {{that it was possible}} for them to attain higher levels if they worked hard like men. Only 27% of female students had received assertiveness training. However, female students had received informal orientation advice from senior female students in their first year. Lack of assertiveness training encourages female students to feel inferior about their abilities and to lack confidence in speaking up when conflict arises. This contributes to low achievement, dismissal and dropping out. Feelings of powerlessness make them dependent on others such as male students. Some students (46%) had not chosen their university and 74.1% had not chosen their department. The former increased homesickness when they were too far away to visit their parents, and the latter reduced interest in the university and in attending lessons. There was a guidance and counseling service but only 22% of students were aware of its existence and none had attended. Poor time management could be another reason for dropping out. When female students first arrived, their time was wasted by male students repeatedly trying to start love affairs. If a love affair did start, it was the man who decided when they would meet so interrupting the woman's studies. The women agreed with the man's decisions to maintain the relationship and avoid losing the academic benefits the relationship provided. Many students were from poor families and could not afford necessities for education and university life. They might try to resolve their economic difficulties through high risk sexual activity. There was widespread sexual harassment and discrimination from male students and, sometimes, male teachers. Both consensual and non-consensual sex could result in HIV, pregnancy and drop out.|$|E

2500|$|As of 1975 about 33% of Lamar's {{students}} were black.

Curtis wrote that black {{students who did not}} wish to associate with whites often do not participate in the social environment while whites who did not wish to associate with blacks were still able to participate in that environment. Some black students emphasized with friends attending other schools who criticized them for going to Lamar that they only attended the school.

30|$|On the contrary, {{another student}} {{recognized}} the actual background (highlighted in black in Figure  4) {{as part of}} the cell. This student (2 P 31) suggested that the black background (Figure  4) represented an “empty space in the cell”. This misconception may have arisen because the <b>student</b> <b>felt</b> a “need” to explain her thinking “scientifically” using relevant conceptual knowledge of the cell structure. By implication therefore, IVM is linked to the availability of conceptual knowledge from long term memory. Furthermore, Mnguni’s example demonstrates that IVM can be inter-linked with CVM as it requires prior conceptual knowledge.|$|R

2500|$|The Festa das Latas {{goes back}} to the 19th century when the Coimbra <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> the need to express their joy at {{finishing}} the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely tin cans. The highlight of this festival, which now takes place {{at the beginning of the}} academic year (November) is the special parade known as the Latada. After marching through the streets of the city the new students are [...] "baptized" [...] in the Mondego River thus entering into the Coimbra academic fraternity. The students from the penultimate year, normally the 3rd year's students, are awarded their Grelos (a small ribbon). The Grelo is a small, woollen ribbon with the color(s) of the student's faculty that is attached to a student's briefcase. Previous to this, at the morning the students must have visited the Dom Pedro V market where they must get a turnip to sustain the Caloiros during the day's festivities. Besides the tin cans they have tied to their legs, the new students wear all kinds of costumes made up according to the creativity and imagination of their godmothers or godfathers who are older students. They also carry placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2017, the SOAS Students Union courted {{controversy}} {{in the news media}} when they released a report titled 'Degrees of Racism: Attainment Gap Report'. ITV news published a story titled [...] "Black and ethnic minority students unhappy about 'too white' university staff." [...] The ITV News article reported that “Some black and ethnic minority students at a leading university have said they are unhappy about being taught by old white professors” The report itself investigated the reasons why a greater proportion of white students at SOAS attain a 2:1 or first class degree, compared to BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) students. Some participants within the report stated that there is an “over representation of white people among staff and students on some courses.” Furthermore, the BME participants highlighted the impact of the “whiteness of the curriculum than that of any other aspect of learning and teaching.” The report also stated that, “discussions dominated by ‘white male students’, made minority female students feel uncomfortable, intimidated or threatened” and that “Having white students voice dominate was especially frustrating when the discussion was about political or theoretical interventions of people of color, or about racist violence.” One BME student also had issues with “white teachers teaching white students about black/brown people.” Some BME <b>students</b> <b>felt</b> silenced also “by the pressure to communicate using academic language that – for reasons of structural racism – was closer to the everyday speech of middle-class, white students than their own.” The report recommended that “All academics must be prepared to acknowledge that, no matter their research specialism, they are capable of racism, and should be prepared to discuss how.” Other recommendations included “Introduce mandatory unconscious bias workshops for all assessors and staff on recruitment or promotion panels.” ...|$|E
