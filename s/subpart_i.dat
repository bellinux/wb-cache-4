40|$|Aspectual classes (e. g. accomplishments, achievements, activities) {{are often}} modeled via event decompositions (Dowty 1979) or {{featural}} breakdowns (Olsen 1994). However, decompositions {{often do not}} correspond to appropriate aspectual properties (Rappaport Hovav 2005), while binary features typically produce more or fewer classes than actually attested, and often are not precisely defined enough to predict significant interactions. Likewise, predicate classes such as semelfactives (Rothstein 2004) and degree achievements (Hay et al. 1999) tend to defy standard classification schemes. I offer a new view on (non-stative) aspectual classes building on scalar models of change-of-state as a transition a theme x for predicate P makes along a property scale sP (Krifka 1998, Hay et al. 1999, Beavers 2008), where a homomorphism θ between sP and e preserves the mereological properties of adjacency and number of <b>subparts.</b> <b>I</b> show that a constrained set of aspectual classes emerges from cross-classifying predicates by two previously, independently motivated factors: how specific P is about the endpoints of sP (relevant for objecthood; Beavers 2006) and the mereological complexity of sP (relevant for resultatives; Wechsler 2005). This in turn predicts significant interactions between aspectual classes and other motivating phenomena, especially argument realization.

40|$|Power systems {{over the}} recent past few years, has {{undergone}} dramatic revolution in terms of government and private investment in various areas such as renewable generation, incorporation of smart grid to better control and operate the power grid, large scale energy storage, and fast responding reactive power sources. The ongoing growth of the electric power industry is {{mainly because of the}} deregulation of the industry and regulatory compliance which each participant of the electric power system has to comply with during planning and operational phase. Post worldwide blackouts, especially the year 2003 blackout in north-east USA, which impacted roughly 50 million people, more attention has been given to reactive power planning. At present, there is steady load growth but not enough transmission capacity to carry power to load centers. There is less transmission expansion due to high investment cost, difficulty in getting environmental clearance, and less lucrative cost recovery structure. Moreover, conventional generators close to load centers are aging or closing operation as they cannot comply with the new environmental protection agency (EPA) policies such as Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and MACT. The conventional generators are getting replaced with far away renewable sources of energy. Thus, the traditional source of dynamic reactive power support close to load centers is getting retired. This has resulted in more frequently overloading of transmission network than before. These issues lead to poor power quality and power system instability. The problem gets even worse during contingencies and especially at high load levels. There is a clear need of power system static and dynamic monitoring. This can help planners and operators to clearly identify severe contingencies causing voltage acceptability problem and system instability. Also, it becomes imperative to find which buses and how much are they impacted by a severe contingency. Thus, sufficient static and dynamic reactive power resource is needed to ensure reliable operation of power system, during stressed conditions and contingencies. In this dissertation, a generic framework has been developed for filtering and ranking of severe contingency. Additionally, vulnerable buses are identified and ranked. The next task after filtering out severe contingencies is to ensure static and dynamic security of the system against them. To ensure system robustness against severe contingencies optimal location and amount of VAR support required needs to be found. Thus, optimal VAR allocation needs to be found which can ensure acceptable voltage performance against all severe contingency. The consideration of contingency in the optimization process leads to security constrained VAR allocation problem. The problem of static VAR allocation requirement is formulated as minlp. To determine optimal dynamic VAR installation requirement the problem is solved in dynamic framework and is formulated as a Mixed Integer Dynamic Optimization (MIDO). Solving the VAR allocation problem for a set of severe contingencies is a very complex problem. Thus an approach is developed in this work which reduces the overall complexity of the problem while ensuring an acceptable optimal solution. The VAR allocation optimization problem has two <b>subparts</b> <b>i.</b> e. interger part and nonlinear part. The integer {{part of the problem is}} solved by branch and bound (B 2 ̆ 6 B) method. To enhance the efficiency of B 2 ̆ 6 B, system based knowledge is used to customize the B 2 ̆ 6 B search process. Further to reduce the complexity of B 2 ̆ 6 B method, only selected candidate locations are used instead of all plausible locations in the network. The candidate locations are selected based upon the effectiveness of the location in improving the system voltage. The selected candidate locations are used during the optimization process. The optimization process is divided into two parts: static optimization and dynamic optimization. Separating the overall optimization process into two sub-parts is much more realistic and corresponds to industry practice. Immediately after the occurrence of the contingency, the system goes into transient (or dynamic) phase, which can extend from few milliseconds to a minute. During the transient phase fast acting controllers are used to restore the system. Once the transients die out, the system attains steady state which can extend for hours with the help of slow static controllers. Static optimization is used to ensure acceptable system voltage and system security during steady state. The optimal reactive power allocation as determined via static optimization is a valuable information. It 2 ̆ 7 s valuable as during the steady state phase of the system which is a much longer phase (extending in hours), the amount of constant reactive power support needed to maintain steady system voltage is determined. The optimal locations determined during the static optimization are given preference in the dynamic optimization phase. In dynamic optimization optimal location and amount of dynamic reactive power support is determined which can ensure acceptable transient performance and security of the system. To capture the true dynamic behavior of the system, dynamic model of system components such as generator, exciter, load and reactive power source is used. The approach developed in this work can optimally allocate dynamic VAR sources. The results of this work show the effectiveness of the developed reactive power planning tool. The proposed methodology optimally allocates static and dynamic VAR sources that ensure post-contingency acceptable power quality and security of the system. The problem becomes manageable as the developed approach reduces the overall complexity of the optimization problem. We envision that the developed method will provide system planners a useful tool for optimal planning of static and dynamic reactive power support that can ensure system acceptable voltage performance and security...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableThe Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) in Columbia, Missouri is {{interested}} in the amount of the Argon- 41 being produced and released to the environment. The objective of this work is to know what operations within the facility are contributing to this production and the quantities released. I'll be working in collaboration with Jeancarlo Torres (Computational Assessment) and Erick Scheerer (Experimental Assessment) in determining these parameters. The calculational work analyzes the distribution of releases from the stack at the MURR. The dose is then predicted with the Comply program. EPA's Comply model was developed based on the procedures in the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Commentary No. 3 (NCRP 89). The Comply computer software may be used to demonstrate compliance with the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) in 40 CFR 61 <b>Subpart</b> <b>I</b> and H. Comply calculates the effective dose equivalent (EDE) from radionuclide released from stacks and vents. The Nuclear Activation Analysis (NAA) is used in the experimental assessment of Argon- 41 production. Neutron Activation Analysis is a nuclear process used for determining concentrations of elements in a vast amount of materials. NAA allows discrete sampling of elements as it disregards chemical form of a sample and focuses solely on its nucleus. NAA is a sensitive analytical technique useful for performing both qualitative and quantitative multi-element analysis for mayor, minor and trace elements in samples from almost every conceivable field of scientific or technical interest. Using NAA we will irradiate air samples from around the facility to determine the concentration of natural Ar- 40 to produce Ar- 41 for measurement. The relationship between these two different projects is that the results of the experimental technique will indicate if excess argon is present in the facility and the computational technique will calculate the dose the activation of Ar- 40 to Ar- 41 may have on the environment...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to map the {{possibilities}} of a social worker´s participation in multidisciplinary zootherapeutics. I was interested in whether the social workers are able to define the multidisciplinary team itself and whether {{they are able to}} choose which coworkers in their facilities are placed in such teams. Multidisciplinary team is hugely discussed topic in all fields beginning with health services. The thesis is divided into two parts into the theoretical part and the part dealing with the research. Theoretical part is then divided into next three subparts. In the first one I escribed basic definitions of social work, role and content of social worker´s work according to law n. 108 / 2006 about social work and specifics of social work with seniors. I devoted the second subpart to the definition and different kinds of zoothereapeutics, to focus groups and to its benefits. In the last <b>subpart</b> <b>I</b> did a summary about all workers who belong into the multidisciplinary team and their activities according to chosen laws. In the research part I tried to map the social worker´s involvement in providing zootherapeutics. I stated two main research questions. In the thesis I used approach based on quality, the method of asking questions and the technique of half structuralized interview. The interview contained 25 opened questions which were supplied by subquestions. The research showed that in the chosen facilities the social worker figures rather as a coordinator of zootherapeutics, communicates with zootherapist, organizes terms and chooses subjects that are suitable for the zootherapeutics. I also found out that the most often used type of zootherapeutics is a group form of dog therapy. The social worker participates during the therapy only minimally because it is mostly organized by the therapist himself / herself. The thesis may be used as a feedback for social facilities using zootherapeutics and also as a source for lectures at the university...|$|E
40|$|While for {{the largest}} part of its history, and also {{to a large extent}} to day, {{in most parts of the}} world {{humankind}} has experienced its daily life in religious terms, as being connected to some transcendent realm. In c ontrast, a significant group of Westerners live their lives without any reference to such a transcendent realm. From a Christian perspective, th is situation is complicated by the fact that this loss of transcendence has occurred in the Christian West, and by the fact that it was precisel y in the Christian West that the possibility of a secular, completely im manent and a-religious explanation of the world emerged for the first ti me. This raises the question of the relation between Christianity and se cularization (interpreted in the sense of desacralization). In order to meet the challenge posed to Christianity by this loss of transcendence, two problems have to be addressed. (1) First, the question must be raise d inquiring into how the loss of transcendence in the West happened and what role Christianity played in that process. (2) Second, the question of how Christianity should react to the contemporary loss of transcenden ce has to be addressed. Do Christians have to accept the loss of transce ndence (perhaps as the final realization of the essence of Christianity, even if that means that there is no future for Christianity as a religi on), or should they attempt to rectify it? This dissertation aims at providing answers to both of these questions. There fore, it consists of two parts. The first part, entitled God is Dead!: An Investigation into the History of the Western Concept of God, offers a historical-systematic survey. In it, I search for the orig ins of the contemporary loss of transcendence in the West. To this end, I embark on an investigation into the history of the Western concept of God, taking the interpretation of Nietzsches proclamation of the death of God by the French philosopher Alain Badiou as my starting point. The second part, entitled The Question of Christology after the Deat h of God: An Investigation into the Christology of Gianni Vattimo, René Girard, and Slavoj iek, addresses the question of how Christianity should react to the contemporary loss of transcendence. It focuses on th e question of Christology and investigates the answers of the three afor ementioned contemporary thinkers to the problem of the relation between Christianity and secularization. The f irst chapter, entitled Nietzsches Proclamation of the Death of God Revisited, questions the opinion that Nietzsche only proclaimed t he death of the metaphysical God, as well as the opinion that this deat h enables a return to the God of Christianity. It is concluded that the re is no clear-cut distinction between the God of the philosophers and t he God of faith but that both Western philosophy and Christianity deal w ith the same God, the God of Western theism. This chapter also offers an investigation into the role played by the God of Western theism and an outline of the consequences of the passing away of this God. The s econd chapter, entitled The Prehistory of the Death of God, p resents a history of the Western concept of God from its Greeks origins until the fourteenth century. This inquiry demonstrates three things: (1) that the God of Western theism can be traced back to the search of the first Greek philosophers for the ultimate ground of all that is, (2) th at despite the  at least at first sight  irreconcilable opposition bet ween Greek philosophy and Biblical faith, a synthesis between both was n evertheless achieved, especially in the work of Augustine, and (3) that this synthesis began to break down from midway in the thirteenth century onwards as the result of a growing separation between the realms of the natural and the supernatural. The t hird chapter, entitled Descartes, Divine Omnipotence, and the Th eological Origins of Modernity, elaborates further on this separation between the realms of the natural and the supernatural. In particular, it investigates the role played by the doctrine of divine omnipotence in the emergence of this separation and focuses on the relation between th at doctrine and the origins of the modern subject in Cartesian philosoph y. Starting from Michael Gillespies claim that Descartes invented the cogito in order to solve a theological problem, namely the p roblem of the uncertainty of all knowledge in the face of an omnipotent God (the problem of the possibility of a deceiving God, a problem caused by the theology of Ockham), what is investigated is the development of the doctrine of Gods omnipotence in the Bible, the Church Fathers and t he Christian philosophy of the Middle Ages. This study results in a reje ction of Gillespies thesis. This is followed by an alternative explanat ion of Descartess deceiving God, namely that Descartes adopted this ide a from a number of scholastic authors who had used it before him and tha t he engaged this idea in a formally constructed series of meditations w hich attempted to overcome the sceptical consequences of his own epistem ology. This chapter concludes with a study of Descartess doctrine of th e creation of the eternal truths, which is used by him to effect a separ ation between philosophy/natural science, on the one hand, and theology on the other. Thus, in order to make his new mechanistic philosophy of n ature possible, Descartes effectively banished God from nature. The f ourth chapter, entitled Modern Science and the Disappearance of Transcendence from Western Culture, elaborates on the relation betwee n modern science and the death of God. In this regard, the question of p riority is raised: was it modern science who killed God or, conversely, could modern science only emerge because God had already passed away? In order to answer this question, Amos Funkensteins solution of the pro blem of why the so-called Scientific Revolution only took place as rec ently as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is investigated. Afterw ards, the roles that Duns Scotuss doctrine of univocity and the scholas tic concept of natura pura played in the disappearance of tra nscendence in the West are evaluated. This chapter also deals with the t heological origins of modern atheism. The f ifth chapter, entitled Luther, Hegel, and the Death of God, i nvestigates the origins of the phrase God is dead! in Lutheran theolog y and the way Hegel adapted it. In this way, it becomes clear that there runs a thread from Luther to Nietzsche, which passes via Hegel. This ch apter concludes with a note on the role Protestantism played in the rise of modern atheism and on the enduring relevance of the theme of the dea th of God. In th e conclusion to the first part of my dissertation, the death of God, the disappearance of transcendence from Western culture is linked to the em ergence of a new epistemological ideal with the first Greek philosophers of nature. The f irst chapter of the second half of this dissertation, chapter 6, which i s entitled Christology after the Death of God: The Case of Giann i Vattimo, investigates Vattimos proposal for a post-modern Christia nity. This enables me to sketch the problem of the relation between secu larization and Christianity in more precise terms and to formulate the s trategy to deal with this problem. The fact that Vattimo, in his attempt to evaluate secularization positively from a Christian perspective, end s up with what seems to amount to simply a Christian legitimization of t he abandonment of Christianity, raises the question of whether such a po sitive evaluation of secularization is possible at all. The second part of my study attempts to answer this question. In order to do so, two que stions are dealt with. First, it is asked what the naturally sacred is and where it comes from. In this respect, the hypothesis is put forw ard that the sacred is that which transforms the human animal into a tru e human being. Second, the question is raised of how Christianity, and i n particular the event of the Incarnation, relates to this natural sacre d. In order to answer these two questions, I have entered into dialogue with Girard and iek, two authors who defend the specificity of Christi anity. Initi ally, I intended to develop a genealogy of the sacred, an account of t he origins of the sacred, with the help of Girard (in a first subpart) a nd a phenomenology of the sacred, a description of the way the sacred appears in contemporary experience, on the basis of the work of i ek (in a second subpart), before turning to an outline of the uniqueness of Christianity with the help of the Christological reflections of both thinkers (in a third subpart). In that first <b>subpart,</b> <b>I</b> planned to move from the current state of evolutionary theory via Girards view on the origins of human culture to the uniqueness of Christianity. In the second <b>subpart,</b> <b>I</b> planned to demonstrate the uniqueness of Christianity, with the help of iek, starting from Freuds drive theory. During my s tudy of iek, however, a number of difficulties arose, difficulties whi ch made it rather unlikely that iek is a good source to develop this i ntended phenomenology of the sacred. As a result, I was only able to com plete the first line of research which I have indicated just above. Ther efore, I have decided to reduce the number of subparts to two. In th e first subpart, which is entitled René Girard on the Uniqueness of Christianity and which contains the actual argument of the second part of my study, I develop the aforementioned genealogy of the sacred. In this <b>subpart,</b> <b>I</b> also integrate Girards Christology, which I origina lly planned for discussion in the third subpart. Since Girard develops h is ideas in opposition to, among others, Freuds views, chapter 7, entit led Sigmund Freud on the Origins of Culture: Totem and Taboo, offers a discussion of Freuds reconstruction of the origins of cultu re. In order to begin my speculations on the emergence of human culture with humankind as a part of nature, a detour via evolutionary theory is necessary. I begin by offering a concise overview of the current state o f the science of human origins and evolution (in chapter 8, entitled A Basic Outline of Human Origins and Evolution) and continue by examining whether it is possible to account for Girards starting point, namely the imitative character of human desire, within the frame of cur rent evolutionary theory (as addressed in chapter 9, entitled Th e Part Played by Imitation in the Transition from Ape to Human). Cons equently, I finally turn to Girards work (in chapter 10, entitled René Girard on the Origins of Culture). The result of these invest igations is a genealogy of the sacred and an account of the human l eap into civilization. Though these retain a certain speculative charact er, I have not offered unfounded speculation. By making use of imaginat ion in the company of reason (Kant), I hope to shed some light on what may not be immediately accessible for reason, but what reason neverthele ss wants to gain access to, namely the very origins of humankind, of its leap into civilization, and its break with nature. In this way, I shall be able to formulate an answer to the question of the uniqueness of Chr istianity in chapter 11, entitled The Christology of René G irard, In which I first present Girards account of the Christ event, before confronting him with Nietzsche on the topic of the specificity o f Christianity, and with Vattimo on the question of transcendence. In th e second subpart of part II, which is entitled An Exercise in Re sisting Slavoj ieks Lacanian Sophistry and which has the character of a large appendix, I reflect on my study of Freuds drive theory and also demonstrate that, even if one does not accept my rejection of iek s drive theory, his Christology remains highly problematical. This is d one in three steps. In chapter 12, entitled The Appearance of the Drive, I present Freuds drive theory, which is evaluated in chapter 13, which is entitled Freuds Drive Theory Evaluated. iek s Christology is discussed in chapter 14 (entitled The Christolo gy of Slavoj iek).
