40|$|Pavement {{surface as}} part of road is due to provide as safe, {{comfortable}} and economical drive to its user, as possible. Beside aforementioned, the quality level of pavement structure must be high enough to provide an adequate pavement life time. In order to ensure this demands, I prepared the Schedule of providing quality to pavement structures, which is the basic topic of this assignment. The Schedule refers to asphalt mixtures that are installed in asphalt surfacing and asphalt base course of pavement structure. The content of the Schedule is dealing with a field of directing and organizing supervision, providing quality to installed materials and inspecting the pavement structure during the warranty period. My purpose was to describe all contents, which are due {{to be included in}} the contract between contractor and investor. These demands refer to a production control, which is contractors’ responsibility and to a third party control, which is investors’ responsibility. Another field, which has an influence on pavement structures’ quality, is based on manufacturing of asphalt mixture. In the Schedule, this segment is described as providing the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> which is the manufacturers’ responsibility. The Schedules’ content is used in a real case, where I was participating in the production control. This supervision took place on the construction site at the Razdrto – Vipava road section...|$|E

50|$|Keenan joined Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> in 1989. Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> {{released}} {{their third}} album called Blind with Keenan on rhythm guitar. After Karl Agell and Phil Swisher left the band (Swisher {{being replaced by}} original bassist Mike Dean), Keenan took over on vocals and guitar. Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> have since released the albums Deliverance, Wiseblood, America's Volume Dealer, and In the Arms of God, {{as well as the}} live release, Live Volume. From 2006 to 2010, Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> had been on hiatus. The band has since reunited and recorded an album without Keenan. However, a possibility of Keenan re-joining C.O.C. remains, according to a message dated May 15, 2010, on the official C.O.C. website. According to drummer Reed Mullin, Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> plans to reunite with Keenan in 2015 for a new album and tour. Corrosion <b>of</b> <b>Conformity</b> performed their first show with the re-united Deliverance era line-up of Pepper Keenan, Woody Weatherman, Mike Dean, and Reed Mullin on March 7, 2015 in Manchester, England. Their first U.S. tour with the re-united line-up, supporting Clutch, was announced on July 28, 2015.|$|R

For this purpose conformal contact analyses are carried out by means of Finite Element (FE) models, and also with the exact rolling contact theory approach developed by Kalker, which has been appropriately adapted by the authors {{in order to take}} into account some of the effects <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> On the other hand, equivalent cases are analysed without taking into account the effects <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> In this way, the validity of the hypothesis of non-conformity is evaluated in different cases with varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>conformity...</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of {{perceived}} {{authority on the}} clinical behaviour and decisionmaking of midwives has received little research attention, {{largely due to the}} unavailability of a midwifery-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> The current study investigated the factor structure of the social influence scale for midwifery (SISM), a recently developed measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> designed specifically for use within midwifery practice. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a four-factor model <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> comprising distinct dimensions <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> client control, personal control and non-conformity offered an excellent fit to the data. It is concluded that, though the SIS-M was developed as a unitary measure <b>of</b> <b>conformity,</b> there is also compelling evidence that the SIS-M could be developed as a multi-dimensional measure of distinct, but related, conformity dimensions. The SIS-M therefore offers considerable potential as a research tool to gain novel insights into the <b>conformity</b> behaviour <b>of</b> midwives in the practice environment and the relationship of such behaviour to maternal and neonatal outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Seller {{is liable}} for the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> {{delivered}} goods. However, there are cases where the seller's liability is excluded despite the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods. First, pursuant to Art. 478 (3) of Serbian Law on Obligations an insignificant material defect of the goods {{should not be taken}} into account. In other words, minor difference in quantity or quality will not be taken into consideration where it is not material. In international trade, in principle, the seller is liable for minor defects of the goods. However, in practice seller's liability for immaterial lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> will be excluded on the basis of relevant trade usages and previous bussines dealings of the parties. Second, it is commonly accepted in international and domestic trade, as concretization of the principle of good faith, that the seller is not liable for any lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> goods if at the time of conclusion of a contract the buyer knew or could not have been unaware of such lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> Seller's liability for the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> the goods is excluded when the following requirements are fulfilled. The first requirement is that the buyer had positive knowledge of the defects or that he could not have been unaware of their existence. It is considered that the buyer could not have been unaware of the non-conformity if he acted with gross negligence. Furthermore, buyer's knowledge of the lack <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> should exist at the time of conclusion of the contract. Finally, the exclusion of seller's liability is not possible when he acts in bad faith...|$|R
