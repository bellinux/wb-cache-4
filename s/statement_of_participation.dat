Our experience was that assessment used within open courses, such as massive open online courses, is primarily determined by the requirements of quality assurance processes to award a digital badge or <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> {{as well as what}} is technologically possible. However, this disregards much recent work in universities that use assessment in support of learning. We suggest that designers of online open courses should pay greater attention to the relationship of assessment and learning to improve participant course completion...|$|E

40|$|Feminist {{attempts}} to empower women {{within their own}} cultural traditions have employed two broad strategies: authentic choice and participation. This paper argues that the methodological problems that beset the authentic choice strategy tell in favour <b>of</b> the <b>participation</b> approach. However, proponents <b>of</b> the <b>participation</b> strategy have failed to pay sufficient attention to the background conditions {{that need to be}} met if women are to make effective use of the institutional mechanisms their models advocate. If women are to be effective political agents {{at least some of the}} most serious structural inequalities that women face must be addressed. A nuanced <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participation</b> strategy must therefore take account of long-standing feminist concerns regarding economic equality and access to resources. While this approach falls short of the demanding conditions for democratic citizenship implicit in the authentic choice strategy, it none the less places significant limits on the scope of participatory strategies and links the goal of empowering women within their own cultural traditions to wider feminist struggles to secure greater economic equality for women in general...|$|R

5000|$|While Vissi's {{popularity}} and commercial appeal {{had already begun}} declining by the early 2000s, as seen by the sales of albums such as Nylon [...] - which although successful had relatively low sales compared to her other albums [...] - [...] Eurovision was considered {{to have had a}} detrimental affect to her career. The Greeks viewed her sudden departure and abstaining completely from the media as Vissi being ashamed about her result in the contest, furthered by Vissi's own <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participation</b> being a mistake. Although this was partially due to hardships faced by the Greek music industry including piracy, the financial crisis, and changing musical tastes, leading to a general decline of the laïko-pop scene and image-based singers, her career choices, such as the pursuit of an international career at a relatively advanced age, leading to several long absences from Greece and attempting to use Eurovision as a gateway, were thought to be major components. In an article about the [...] "golden trio of Greek pop" [...] consisting of Vissi, Despina Vandi, and Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vlavianou of To Vima considered Vissi to have [...] "the most vociferous" [...] decline of the group. Vlavianou interpreted her tears on the night:"When America looked too big to be won, Anna Vissi turned towards Europe. She took part in Eurovision to conquer the summit of the Alps and lost Mount Olympus too. Her tears on the evening of the contest in 2006, following her failure, showed that she was fully aware of her situation: not only had she not conquered the European audience, but she had lost the Greek one too." ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{available}} opinions regarding participation do {{not appear}} to be applicableto adults with visual and severe or profound intellectual disabilities (VSPID). Because a cleardefinition and operationalization are lacking, it is difficult for support professionals to givemeaning to participation for adults with VSPID. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to develop a definition and operationalizationof the concept <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> adults with VSPID. Methods: Parents or family members, professionals, and experts participated in an onlineconcept mapping procedure. This procedure includes generating statements, clusteringthem, and rating their importance. The data were analyzed quantitatively using multidi-mensional scaling and qualitatively with triangulation. Results: A total of 53 participants generated 319 <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> which 125 were clusteredand rated. The final cluster map <b>of</b> the <b>statements</b> contained seven clusters: (1) Experienceand discover; (2) Inclusion; (3) Involvement; (4) Leisure and recreation; (5) Communica-tion and being understood; (6) Social relations; and (7) Self-management and autonomy. The average importance rating <b>of</b> the <b>statements</b> varied from 6. 49 to 8. 95. A definition ofparticipation of this population was developed which included these seven clusters. Conclusions: The combination of the developed definition, the clusters, and the statementsin these clusters, derived from the perceptions of parents or family members, professionals,and experts, can be employed to operationalize the construct <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> adults withVSPID. This operationalization supports professionals in their ability to give meaning toparticipation in these adults.
