40|$|AbstractLack of {{a strong}} and stable restorer-of-fertility (Rf) allele in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum L.) has been a hurdle in {{commercial}} exploitation of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system for cost-effective production of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> hybrid seeds. A known sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (CRF-S 870) associated with a fertility restoration phenotype (Rf locus) in hot pepper was validated in a strong restorer hot pepper inbred line (AVPP 9905). The CRF-S 870 marker was successfully used in marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB) to transfer Rf allele from hot pepper line AVPP 9905 to several <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> genotypes. The fertility restoration ability of 21 BC 4 F 2 <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> plants obtained through marker-assisted backcrossing {{was found to be}} normal, as CMS based plants derived from the backcrossed male plants upon selfing produced a normal amount of fruit with sufficient selfed seeds. The development of restorer lines in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> is expected to open commercial exploitation of CMS hybrid technology in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|R

Results showed that despite <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> flowers are considered autogamous, this crop benefits from pollination by M. subnitida, producing fruits significantly heavier and wider, containing a greater number of seeds and of better quality (lower percentage of malformed fruits) than self-pollinated <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> Thus, M. subnitida can be considered an efficient pollinator of greenhouse <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{automation}} {{in agricultural}} field has attracted more attention of researchers and greenhouse producers. The main reasons are {{to reduce the}} cost including labor cost and to reduce the hard working conditions in greenhouse. In present research, a vision system of harvesting robot was developed for recognition of green <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> on plant under natural light. The major challenge of this study was noticeable color similarity between <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> and plant leaves. To overcome this challenge, a new texture index based on edge density approximation (EDA) has been defined and utilized in combination with color indices such as Hue, Saturation and excessive green index (EGI). Fifty images were captured from fifty <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> plants to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm could recognize 92 out of 107 (i. e., the detection accuracy of 86 %) <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers</b> located within the workspace of robot. The error of system in recognition of background, mostly leaves, as a green <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> decreased 92. 98 % by using the new defined texture index in comparison with color analysis. This showed the importance of integration of texture with color features when used for recognizing <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers.</b> The main reasons of errors, besides color similarity, were waxy and rough surface of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> that cause higher reflectance and non-uniform lighting on surface, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Lygus rugulipennis Poppius and Liocoris tripustulatus Fabricius (Heteroptera: Miridae) are pests of {{glasshouse}} cucumber and <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> crops respectively. L. rugulipennis has a {{wide range}} of foodplants, but L. tripustulatus is specialised with very few food plants. We report behavioural assessments to investigate whether either species exhibits a preference for salad over wild hosts, and whether the role of olfaction and vision in response to cues from host plants can be distinguished. Olfactory responses to leaves were tested in choice chambers. L. rugulipennis was presented nettle (wild host) and a salad leaf of cucumber or <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> where the salad leaves had higher nitrogen content. L. tripustulatus was tested with nettle and <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> of two different nitrogen contents. Female L. rugulipennis spent more time on the cucumber salad host, and chose it first most often, but males showed no preference. Neither sex discriminated between <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> or nettle leaves, but males made more first contacts with <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> Neither sex of L. tripustulatus discriminated between <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> and nettle leaves when the <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> had higher nitrogen. When the plant species contained equivalent nitrogen both sexes spent more time on nettle. There was no difference in first choice made by either sex. When visual stimuli were available, and leaves had equivalent nitrogen, L. rugulipennis showed no preference and L. tripustulatus preferred nettle leaves. We conclude that the generalist L. rugulipennis has the ability to use remote olfactory cues for hos...|$|R

GWorkS is a discrete event model that approaches reality as a discrete stochastic dynamic system. GWorkS was developed and validated using cut-rose as a case crop for which two cultivation systems exist, the path-based system and the mobile cultivation system. The focus of this paper is horizontal extension of GWorkS to <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> which is characterised by high crop-related labour effort and costs. For <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> international research aiming at automation of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> harvest is ongoing. Dynamic process simulation and analysis may contribute strongly to economic and technical constraints for the design of new work methods. The most important crop operation in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> cultivation, harvesting, was pre-modelled in IDEF 3 process analysis. The mathematical structure of the GWorkS model is described, as well as specific model adaptations for <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> and inputs determined from labour registration data and video recordings at a <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> grower.

Doctor’s dissertation ISSN 1401 - 6249, ISBN 91 - 576 - 6441 - 2 This thesis examines effects of plant fertilisation regime on herbivore and parasitoid performance for two aphids, Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Myzus persicae, and one parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Herbivore performance was measured as adult fresh weight and intrinsic rate of increase. Parasitoid performance was measured as length of hind tibia, sex ratio, {{and in a}} series of choice experiments also parasitoid development time and parasitization rate was measured. Comparisons were made between the performance of M. euphorbiae on two different plant species, petunia and <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> between the performance of the aphids M. euphorbiae and M. persicae on <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> and between the performance of A. ervi in M. euphorbiae and in M. persicae on <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> The performance of M. euphorbiae was better on petunia than on <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> On petunia a positive effect of plant content of potassium and indications of a positive effect of nitrogen fertilisation were found while on <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> both nitrogen and of potassium ha...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the lessons learnt during the {{development}} of a new robotic harvester (Harvey) that can autonomously harvest <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> (capsicum) in protected cropping environments. Robotic harvesting offers an attractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more regular and selective harvesting, optimising crop quality, scheduling and therefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers.</b> We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a grasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To reduce complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on picking <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers</b> in a protected cropping environment where plants are grown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in protected cropping environments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and detach crop from the plant within a real protected cropping system. The novel contributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging improvements in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> picking success rates compared with the state-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> peduncles and improving the total harvesting cycle time for each <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> The methods presented in this paper provide steps towards the goal of fully autonomous and reliable crop picking systems that will revolutionise the horticulture industry by reducing labour costs, maximising the quality of produce, and ultimately improving the sustainability of farming enterprises...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{body of literature}} analyzing how smallholder farmers in developing countries can benefit from modern supply chains. However, most of the available studies concentrate on export markets and fail to capture spillover effects that modern supply chains may have on local markets. Here, we analyze the case of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> in Thailand, which was initially introduced as a product innovation in modern supply chains, but which is now widely traded also in more traditional markets. Using survey data from smallholder farmers and econometric techniques, we show that <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> cultivation contributes significantly to higher household incomes. Strikingly, at this stage, participation in modern supply chains {{does not lead to}} higher incomes than supplying <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> to traditional markets.
