500|$|Francis Mackey, an {{experienced}} harbour pilot, had boarded Mont-Blanc {{on the evening}} of 5 December 1917; he had asked about [...] "special protections" [...] such as a guard ship, given the Mont-Blanc's cargo, but no protections were put in place. Mont-Blanc started moving at 7:30am on 6 December, heading towards Bedford Basin. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted Imo when she was about [...] away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if to cut him off his own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's <b>signal</b> <b>whistle</b> to indicate that he had the right of way, but was met with two short blasts from Imo, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered Mont-Blanc to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard, but was again met with a double-blast in negation.|$|E

[...] Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word [...] As far as Coilantogle ford: [...] Nor would I call a clansman's brand [...] For aid against one valiant hand, [...] Though on our strife lay every vale [...] Rent by the Saxon from the Gael. [...] So move we on;--I only meant [...] To show the reed {{on which you}} leant, [...] Deeming this path you might pursue [...] Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.' [...] They moved;--I said Fitz-James was brave [...] As ever knight that belted glaive, [...] Yet dare not say that now his blood [...] Kept on its wont and tempered flood, [...] As, following Roderick's stride, he drew [...] That seeming lonesome pathway through, [...] Which yet by fearful proof was rife [...] With lances, that, to take his life, [...] Waited but signal from a guide, [...] So late dishonored and defied. [...] Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round [...] The vanished guardians of the ground, [...] And stir'd from copse and heather deep [...] Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep, [...] And in the plover's shrilly strain [...] The <b>signal</b> <b>whistle</b> heard again. [...] Nor breathed he free till far behind [...] The pass was left; for then they wind [...] Along a wide and level green, [...] Where neither tree nor tuft was seen, [...] Nor rush nor bush of broom was near, [...] To hide a bonnet or a spear.|$|E

50|$|On lines {{currently}} {{operated by}} the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE), signalling was not installed until World War II. There were few trains running and all traffic control was performed by the station masters (Σταθμάρχης).

Station managers were coordinated by morse-code landline telegraph and, later, by telephone.|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of the project The Final Neolithic in the Lower Traisen Valley, 13 reproductions of Final Neolithic {{artefacts}} were produced by Wolfgang Lobisser and his team, in order to gain insights into Final Neolithic manufacturing techniques and the usage of the objects. For this, both authors macroscopically examined artefacts made of bone, antler, animal teeth and shell from 37 graves of the Corded Ware Culture and three Bell Beaker graves from the Traisen Valley in regard to manufacturing specifications and traces of usage. Tools, parts of clothes as well as two objects that are interpreted as a doll and a <b>signaling</b> <b>whistle</b> were reproduced. In the Late Neolithic crushing, splitting, grating, scraping, and grinding were the basic techniques for the processing of bone, antler, teeth, and shell material. The manufacturing of the reproductions shows that compared to flint drills, copper awls provide much better results for fine drillings in hard materials such as bone or antler. Some bone artefacts are characterised by notable glossy areas, indicating an intense usage. In some graves of men, bone artifacts such as chisels and pegs are associated with stone axes, fire stone tools, or copper blades. The combination of the equipment suggests that those buried in the graves had been skilled and experienced tradesmen...|$|R
50|$|Not all railroads use {{exactly the}} same <b>whistle</b> <b>signals</b> or assign the same meanings. Some railroads will use their own {{variations}} of the above.

5000|$|The Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, Admiral John B. Hayes, {{approved}} {{the report of}} the marine board of investigation on the collision between Blackthorn and Capricorn. The board determined that the cause of the collision was the failure of both vessels to keep well {{to the side of the}} channel which lay on each ship's starboard (right) sides. Concurring with the marine board's determination of the cause, the Commandant emphasized in his [...] "Action" [...] that the failure of the persons in charge of both vessels to ascertain the intentions of the other through the exchange of appropriate <b>whistle</b> <b>signals</b> was the primary contributing cause. Additionally, Admiral Hayes pointed out that attempts to establish a passing agreement by using only radiotelephone communications failed to be an adequate substitute for exchanging proper <b>whistle</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{a subset}} of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which {{originally}} included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound <b>signals</b> by <b>whistle,</b> siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases. The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...). In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages.|$|R

[...] Captain Nelson asserted that the vessels exchanged two blast signals for a starboard-to-starboard passing. [...] At the time impact, the Superior City was swinging across the King’s bow while Captain Nelson swung his bow hard aport and rang the telegraph to stop and then full astern.
