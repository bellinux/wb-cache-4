5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand <b>sound</b> <b>frequency.</b> By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz <b>sound</b> <b>frequency).</b> Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz <b>sound</b> <b>frequency).</b> The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear. The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply.|$|E
25|$|In a {{dispersive}} medium, {{the speed}} of sound is a function of <b>sound</b> <b>frequency,</b> through the dispersion relation. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the phase velocity, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the group velocity. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see optical dispersion for a description.|$|E

25|$|Fetuses between 32 and 39 weeks {{gestation}} {{were presented}} a pure tone (CS), which was {{paired with a}} vibroacoustic stimulus (US). A vibroacoustic stimulus is a low bass <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> that is felt by the fetus as a mechanical vibration. After 10-20 pairings, approximately 50% of the fetuses showed successful conditioning, unrelated to age or sex of the fetus. It is suggested that poorly prepared experimental set up, inaccurate or inappropriate response measures and unsuitable stimuli could all contribute to failed conditioning, as opposed to lack of fetal memory. Reasons for some fetuses demonstrating conditioning, while others do not, remains undetermined.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and <b>sound)</b> <b>frequency,</b> based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E
500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} {{at any time of}} day and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E

500|$|The {{stage was}} as huge as {{a tennis court}} and was made movable. Above the stage was a vast {{electrical}} grid, composed of truss sections, chain motors, electrical cables and the control devices that linked electronically or mechanically with the performances happening below. Four gigantic video monitors formed {{the backdrop of the}} stage. Other equipment included a mechanical bull and equipment for aerial movements. The sets were built in sections by three companies. A permanent crew of around hundred was hired. Monitor mixing was handled by four monitor engineers, with two of them for Madonna's monitors. Blake Suib, one of the engineers, commented that Madonna was a perfectionist and she knew when a sound, coming from the speakers, sounded bad or good during rehearsals. By the suggestion of music director Pat Leonard, they tried out using 14kHz of <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> in their live speakers, which was unusual to use at that point of time. Also they {{came up with the idea}} of using isolated amplifiers to pick up the sound of the instruments individually. Suib commented that [...] "the creative process of coming up with new ideas, implementing them, and then soberly evaluating their results was time-consuming but worth it." [...] The poster and the logo for the tour was developed by Chase Design Group. They wanted to make the logo as much aesthetic as possible. They developed a custom icon and logo type to convey the unique and ethereal qualities of Madonna's show, which was described by the group's founder Margo Chase as [...] "a multilayered musical and spiritual journey through diverse worlds." [...] Chase commented that since [...] "Madonna is a student of Kabbalah, she requested that we include references to that body of knowledge." [...] The resulting logo and poster included both Arabic and Hebrew references. A number of designs were prepared by Chase and the one ultimately chosen by Madonna made it to the main poster of the show, which featured Madonna's face-shot from the [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] video shots.|$|E

2500|$|Used in multi-driver speaker systems, the {{crossover}} is {{an assembly}} of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. [...] "bands"), {{according to the}} requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation ("ripple") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.|$|E

[...] The actual threat depends on a variety of factors beyond noise levels: [...] <b>sound</b> <b>frequency,</b> frequency and duration of transmissions, the nature of the acoustic signal (e.g., a sudden pulse, or coded sequence), depth of the sound source, directionality of the sound source, water depth and local topography, reverberation, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Chakraverti {{claimed to}} have cracked the mystic code that shrouds the Konark Sun Temple in Orissa, and its {{curative}} power. After years of research, she made this revelation in a documentary titled The Konark Code, which was premiered at the Nehru Centre in London in February 2008. Her theory was that the temple at Konark was a healing spot, a cure centre for various diseases. King Narasimha Deva started making the temple in 1253 AD and it took him 12 years to complete it. [...] "Myth says that Samba, the son of Krishna, went to the spot to get himself cured of leprosy. Till date, hundreds of leprosy patients flock to the temple to cure themselves. There are other factors that add to the temple's existence as a healing centre." [...] According to Chakraverti, solar rays and <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> also played {{an important part in}} healing. The dance that was part of worship was for a purpose. The vibration of the steps of the dancers energized the temple stones. The sun's rays, because of the particular corner in which the temple was constructed, also played an important part. In August, Chakraverti worked on a tele serial for ETV Bangla called Parapaar. The show was based on Chakraverti's life-journey and her encounters with the paranormal. A dramatized story, where actress Chandrayee Ghosh played the part, was aired from Monday to Friday, and on Saturday, Chakraverti herself interacted with audiences through phone-ins related to the story. She commented, [...] "I had reservations when I was approached for Parapaar because it’s important to convey the philosophy and atmosphere in Wicca in the right way. But I feel it’s time to reach Wicca to the masses, and since Bengal is the place where the Mother Goddess Durga is worshipped, it’s important that misconceptions about Dakinividya are shattered. People should know who a daini is and what she does." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{responses}} to pure tone stimuli of individual auditory receptors in the locust Valanga irregularis were quantified {{and the location}} of receptors within the auditory organ identified through the intracellular injection of Lucifer Yellow.

The receptor cell bodies belonging to these groups were separated into three distinct regions of the auditory organ (Fig. 5). There was no evidence of any tonotopic organisation within the three groups (Fig. 6). These data therefore support the conclusion that the receptors within the auditory organ of the locust are organized into specific physiological groups (Michelsen 1971 a) and thus suggest that the mechanics of the auditory apparatus may indeed play a role in defining the tuning of the receptors...|$|R
