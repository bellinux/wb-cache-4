50|$|The static {{center of}} gravity margin (c.g. margin) or <b>static</b> <b>margin</b> is the {{distance}} between the {{center of gravity}} (or mass) and the neutral point. It is usually quoted {{as a percentage of the}} Mean Aerodynamic Chord. The center of gravity must lie ahead of the neutral point for positive stability (positive <b>static</b> <b>margin).</b> If the center of gravity is behind the neutral point, the aircraft is longitudinally unstable (the <b>static</b> <b>margin</b> is negative), and active inputs to the control surfaces are required to maintain stable flight. Some combat aircraft that are controlled by fly-by-wire systems are designed to be longitudinally unstable so they will be highly maneuverable.

40|$|Summary. [...] This report {{develops}} {{an approximate}} theory of longitudinal response which {{applies to the}} slow mode of motion after a disturbance. This theory is complementary to that for the quick-period motion given by Gates and Lyon 5 (1944). It predicts the slow motions which occur after the quick-period motions ha-~e died out. The approximate equations given are of second order only and can therefore be solved algebraically. This has been done and the general solutions are given in Tables 1 and 2. Some numerical examples have been computed to indicate the accuracy which can be expected. The agreement with the first approximation is quite good and in some components it can be improved {{by the use of}} a further correction term., 1. Introductio~.
