25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E

So it's a nice contrast with the house." [...] For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, [...] "This is an underground world; this is a ministry, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the real ministries, the Muggle ministries – Whitehall, in London – and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries." ...|$|E
500|$|Creation of a 3D effect {{required}} the design team {{to use an}} assortment of low-poly meshes, or 3D geometric models. Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques, these images were later superimposed [...] "with painstaking care" [...] to avoid a sterile, digitized look. Clair said, [...] "The most crucial thing to me was that this didn't feel digital, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible." [...] For some stills, the design team created digital doubles to develop more texture. The sequence's final cut was polished using optical glitching and motion distortion techniques. The Sydney Morning Herald included the opening sequence in a list of ten of the best title sequences on television.|$|E

5000|$|The spirit {{with which}} these home missionaries went forth was ably {{expressed}} {{by one of}} the Iowa Band when he said: [...] "The understanding is among us all, that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> west not for a temporary purpose, unless the great Head of the Church shall make it <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> remain permanently -- to live and die there -- and God grant us grace to carry out this purpose." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Miracle Man" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The X-Files written by Howard Gordon {{without the aid of}} his {{long-term}} collaborator Alex Gansa. The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard came to my house, and said, 'Help me out,' <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> my living room and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} we came up with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E
500|$|Since the flood, Grand Forks' {{recovery}} {{has been}} used as a model by other communities which have suffered from natural disasters. After Hurricane Katrina hit several U.S. states in 2005, Grand Forks adopted the city of Biloxi, Mississippi. Current Grand Forks mayor Michael Brown stated that it was important [...] "to utilize the experience from those people who went through those disasters, like our fire chief, police chief and public works directors. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'" [...] Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA. One Biloxi city official stated that Grand Forks had [...] "just helped us to understand what we were looking at, and gave us some direction to go in, which was really needed, with the rebuilding and the recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought {{out the best in}} Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No. I wouldn't {{after the}} way he pitched into me. I didn't know if he would give it. And he wouldn't hear a word, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> up <b>to</b> Rockstone to the house.' ...|$|R
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
2500|$|Smart Bomb Interactive {{stated that}} the {{inspiration}} for Flying Ace came from their well received 2006 title, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. [...] "We were {{very proud of that}} game and it was a critical success, but the budget and time constraints that came from the publisher [...] left us feeling that we could have done a lot more. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> United Media and representatives of the Schulz family, and we licensed the property ourselves" [...] stated Clark Stacey, Vice President for Smart Bomb Interactive. [...] "But of course, it was Charles M. Schulz’s original strips of Snoopy as the World Famous WWI Flying Ace that are the ultimate inspiration" [...] added Stacey. [...] The game was developed using Bombshell, Smart Bomb Interactive's game engine and toolset.|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{continued}} {{to pay the}} annual tribute to Virginia's governor. This consists of game, usually a deer, and pottery or a [...] "peace pipe". The Pamunkey have been paying such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we knew we had to have something to present to the governor; <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E
50|$|The process {{also works}} for types of things. Take “bridges” as a concept. It doesn’t have spatiotemporal extent, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the next {{question}} “does it have members ?”. It does - the members are all the bridges in the world. We then identify some exemplar members - e.g. Waterloo Bridge. At this stage, it is advisable to identify exemplars that are “on the edge” of the set - e.g. things {{that may or may}} not be bridges - e.g. pontoons, bridging vehicles, etc. so as to accurately identify the extent of the type.|$|R

6000|$|But Fulk's answer, was--"Better <b>so!</b> If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{a strange}} place, {{and tried to}} conceal it, it would always be oozing out, and be {{supposed}} disgraceful. If my sisters can bear it, I had rather confront it straightforwardly--" ...|$|R
60|$|At length, by merest accident, {{we found}} {{ourselves}} {{in the vicinity of}} old John's little house. I knew he had a good well, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in <b>to</b> get a drink, for our ham and biscuits had made us very thirsty.|$|R

6000|$|It was 10 o'clock A.M. {{when we got}} in Chicago, {{too late}} for the steamer; <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> an {{excellent}} public house, the [...] "American Temperance," [...] and I spent the time that day and till next morning, looking around Chicago.|$|E
60|$|As I emptied my cup Lord Ragnall, who {{had left}} the room, {{returned}} and asked us {{to come and see}} the game. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went,</b> <b>to</b> find it laid out in endless lines upon the snow-powdered grass in the quadrangle of the castle, arranged in one main and two separate lots.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> off <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the brow}} {{of the hill}} on which the Temple stood, whence old Marnham {{pointed out to me}} a beacon, which I could not see in the dim, silvery bush-veld below, and how the line ran from it to another beacon somewhere else.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, {{it was the}} Captain who awakened me, not I the Captain, {{saying that}} {{daylight}} was on the break and we had better be stirring. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> the Store, where I was thankful to find that everything had been tidied up in accordance with my directions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but we will," [...] she answered. [...] "You {{have your}} wine to drink, and then there's the tea; and then we'll have a song two. I'll spin it out; see if I don't."

60|$|We {{proposed}} {{a great many}} things, but nothing could offer where {{there was nothing to}} begin with. He begged me at last to talk no more of it, for, he said, I would break his heart; so we talked of other things a little, till at last he took a husband's leave of me, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Zululand {{because after}} talking it over we {{all came to}} the {{conclusion}} that this was the best thing to do, especially as there we seemed to be sure of a welcome.

60|$|Then {{came the}} question, {{which of the}} two next doors?

60|$|Still I {{observed}} {{that for all}} his confidence, Hans himself {{was the first to}} depart and with considerable speed. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> our camp without more conversation, since the Zulus were scared and I confess that myself I could not understand the matter, though no doubt it admitted of some quite simple explanation.|$|R
