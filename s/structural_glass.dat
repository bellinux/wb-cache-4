500|$|A 10-month, US$19 million {{renovation}} of the wing concluded in July 2011 to refurbish the Open Sea exhibit, as the [...] tunas were dismantling <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> tiles with their turbulent swimming patterns.

500|$|The {{glass was}} {{custom-made}} at {{a factory in}} Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and shipped to the <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> panel manufacturer in Melbourne, Florida. [...] The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is white glass, rather than the usual green glass that results from iron impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is [...] with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, {{one of the six}} faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured.|$|E
40|$|The p-spin spin-glass {{model has}} been studied {{extensively}} at mean-field level because of the insights which it provides into the mode-coupling approach to <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> {{and the nature of}} the glass transition. We demonstrate explicitly that the finite dimensional version of the p-spin model is in the same universality class as an Ising spin glass in a magnetic field. Assuming that the droplet picture of Ising spin glasses is valid we discuss how this universality may provide insights into why <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> are either "fragile" or "strong".

40|$|We {{consider}} two mean-field {{models of}} <b>structural</b> <b>glasses,</b> the random energy model (REM) and the $p$-spin model (PSM), and {{we show that}} the finite-size fluctuations of the freezing temperature are described by extreme-value statistics (EVS) distributions, establishing an unprecedented connection between EVS and the freezing transition of <b>structural</b> <b>glasses.</b> For the REM, the freezing-temperature fluctuations are described by the Gumbel EVS distribution, while for the PSM the freezing temperature fluctuates according to the Tracy-Widom (TW) EVS distribution, which has been recently discovered within the theory of random matrices. For the PSM, we provide an analytical argument showing that {{the emergence of the}} TW distribution can be understood in terms of the statistics of glassy metastable states...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the interrelation between spin <b>glasses</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>glasses.</b> Spin glasses in this case are p-spin interaction spin glasses (at p > 2) or Potts glasses which contain quenched disorder, whereas the <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> are here exemplified by the homopolymeric globule, which {{can be viewed as}} a liquid of connected units on nanoscales. It is argued that the homopolymeric globule problem can be mapped onto a disorder field theoretical model whose effective Hamiltonian resembles the corresponding one for the spin glass model. In this sense the disorder in the globule is self- generated (in contrast to spin glasses) and can be related with competing interactions (virial coefficients of different signs) and the chain connectivity. The work is aimed at giving a quantitative description of this analogy. We {{have investigated}} in the mean-field (MF) approximation the phase diagram of the homopolymeric globule where the transition line from the liquid to glassy globule is treated in terms of the replica symmetry breaking paradigm. The configurational entropy temperature dependence is also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
500|$|The {{structure}} for the blocks was a challenge. [...] At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in Melbourne, Florida which specializes in <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> panel systems. [...] Circle Redmont {{came up with the}} plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements. The individual grids are [...] tall and either [...] or [...] wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks. [...] Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded. [...] The combination of the refraction of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible.|$|E

50|$|Pigmented <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> {{could be}} {{manufactured}} in flat panels or curves, {{and in a}} wide range of sizes and thicknesses. Small mosaic tiles, affixed to flexible fabric, were another option for fitting the product to curved surfaces.

50|$|The Great Depression {{significantly}} reduced {{the demand for}} pigmented <b>structural</b> <b>glass.</b> American production reached only 1000000 sq ft in 1933. By the 1950s, changing architectural tastes had vastly reduced the demand for the product. The last two American manufacturers ceased production about 1960: Libbey-Owens-Ford shut down its pigmented <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> plant in 1958, followed by Pittsburgh Plate Glass in the early 1960s.

The Art Deco and Steamline Moderne architectural movements vastly increased the market for pigmented <b>structural</b> <b>glass.</b> Its first important architectural use came in 1912, when it was used for bathroom stall partitions and dados in the Woolworth Building in New York City. By 1929, 5000000 sq ft of pigmented <b>structural</b> <b>glass</b> was being manufactured in the United States.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the glass transition, the kinetics of a spin model with frustration but no quenched randomness has been analyzed. The phenomenology of the spin model is remarkably {{similar to that of}} <b>structural</b> <b>glasses.</b> Analysis of the model suggests that defects {{play a major role in}} dictating the the dynamics as the glass transition is approached. 1 Introduction In recent years, there has been considerable interest in spin models without quenched-in disorder which exhibit glassy dynamics[1]. The model discussed in this paper belongs to this category. Frustration is a key concept in theories of <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> such as the curved-space pictures of metallic glass[2]. The two concepts taken together, glassy dynamics in non-random spin systems and frustration as a key to glassy behavior, suggest that frustrated spin systems could play a role in understanding the nature of structural glasses[3].

40|$|In {{this note}} we apply some {{theoretical}} predictions {{that arise in}} the mean field framework for a large class of infinite range models to <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> and we present a first comparison of these predictions with numerical results. 1 Introduction In recent years some theoretical progresses {{in our understanding of}} glasses [1] have been achieved by comparing the results obtained for soluble models of generalized spin glasses [2, 3] with <b>structural</b> <b>glasses</b> properties, under the assumption that the phase space of the two systems is similar. These progresses are also due {{to the use of the}} replica method and of related concepts as replica symmetry breaking, coupled replicas, dynamic transitions: : : In the nutshell many of the ideas of this replica approach are already present in the original papers of Gibbs and Di Marzio [4]. However, the use of the whole panoply of tools developed in the study of spin glass models allow us to put these ideas in a much sharper form and to test them in [...] ...|$|R
