The switches was insulated by solid multi-layer transparent dielectrics.

Its change of amplitude was less than 1. 2 %, the triggered jitter-time was less than 10 ps, and pulse width was up to sub - nanosecond.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a novel single-switch access {{technology}} {{based on}} infrared thermography was proposed. The technology exploits the temperature {{differences between the}} inside and surrounding areas of the mouth as a <b>switch</b> <b>trigger,</b> thereby allowing voluntary switch activation upon mouth opening. However, for this technology to be clinically viable, it must be validated against a gold standard switch, such as a chin switch, that taps into the same voluntary motion. Methods In this study, we report an experiment designed to gauge the concurrent validity of the infrared thermal switch. Ten able-bodied adults participated {{in a series of}} 3 test sessions where they simultaneously used both an infrared thermal and conventional chin switch to perform multiple trials of a number identification task with visual, auditory and audiovisual stimuli. Participants also provided qualitative feedback about switch use. User performance with the two switches was quantified using an efficiency measure based on mutual information. Results User performance (p = 0. 16) and response time (p = 0. 25) with the infrared thermal switch were comparable to those of the gold standard. Users reported preference for the infrared thermal switch given its non-contact nature and robustness to changes in user posture. Conclusions Thermal infrared access technology appears to be a valid single switch alternative for individuals with disabilities who retain voluntary mouth opening and closing. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFunctional Electrical Stimulation (FES) {{facilitates}} walking after paralysis by activating {{the muscles}} of the lower extremities. The FES-assisted stepping triggered either by a manual switch (switch-trigger), or by an electromyogram-based gait event detector (EMG-trigger) were presented in random order to two subjects with incomplete spinal cord injuries (iSCI) during ten trials over two alternate days. Subject iSCI- 1 (C 6 ASIA C) was non-ambulatory without the assistance of FES and could stand but not initiate a step volitionally. Subject iSCI- 2 (T 1 ASIA D) could walk only short distances with great difficulty without FES. Gait kinematics and kinetics were captured during FES-assisted over-ground walking with a rolling walker under laboratory conditions. Gait parameters including speed, left and right step length, left and right double support duration, left and right swing phase durations were extracted from the kinematic data. Mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and 95 % confidence interval were computed for each gait parameter under each triggering condition. The ground reaction forces were recorded for both the subjects while upper body support provided by the instrumented walker was recorded for iSCI- 2. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether significant differences existed in gait parameters between command sources. The left and right double support duration were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) during EMG-triggered gait than switch-triggered for iSCI- 1. The average normal ground reaction force was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher during EMG-triggered gait than switch-triggered for iSCI- 1 and iSCI- 2. The average body weight support on the walker was significantly lower for EMG-triggered gait than switch-triggered one for iSCI- 2. The results suggest that less user effort was needed when walking with EMG-triggered stepping than with manual <b>switch</b> <b>trigger...</b>|$|E

We show that 2 μm BayK or 0. 5 μm FPL accelerates the rate of catecholamine secretion to a similar extent in the presence either of the permeable Ca 2 + and Ba 2 + or the impermeable charge carrier La 3 +. These results suggest that structural rearrangements generated through the binding of BayK or FPL, by altering the channel activity, could affect depolarization-evoked secretion prior to cation transport. FPL also accelerated the rate of secretion mediated by a Ca 2 +-impermeable channel made by replacing the wild type α 11. 2 subunit was replaced with the mutant α 11. 2 /L 775 P.
