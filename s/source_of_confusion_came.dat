Another possible <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>comes</b> from the existence of Morissette's 2008 track [...] "It's a Bitch (To Grow Up)", which is unrelated to Brooks's song but has a similar title and some similar lyrical themes. Brooks has stated that the popular misconception used to bother her but seems to have become just humorous.|$|R
40|$|A clear {{terminology}} {{is essential}} in every research discipline. In the context of ESOA, a lot <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> exists {{about the meaning of}} the terms emergence and self-organisation. One <b>of</b> the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the <b>confusion</b> <b>comes</b> from the fact that a combination of both phenomena often occurs in dynamical systems. In this paper a historic overview of the use of each concept as well as a working definition, that is compatible with the historic and current meaning of the concepts, is given. Each definition is explained by supporting it with important characteristics found in the literature. We show that emergence and self-organisation each emphasise different properties of a system. Both phenomena can exist in isolation. The paper also outlines some examples of such systems and considers the combination of emergence and self-organisation as a promising approach in complex multi-agent systems. status: publishe...|$|R

One important <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> {{is that the}} term cardinality in a relationship has several interpretations, two of them being very popular. But none of the two approaches, nor the two together, allow us to express all the possible cardinality patterns. The transformations from all the possible relationships to database schemas have never been described by the existing literature. Using the 14 ternary patterns as example, we discuss these transformations particularly the transformations from the patterns ignored in the literature. Postprint (published version...|$|R
