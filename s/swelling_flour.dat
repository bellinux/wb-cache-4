40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Until recently, the viscoamylograph {{had been}} the primary method for {{measuring}} starch {{as it relates to}} noodle quality in wheat. This method requires a large sample of flour and is time consuming. With the introduction of the rapid visco-analyser (RVA) in 1986 and the more recent <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume procedure, both the time to determine starch quality and the sample size required have been reduced Parents, reciprocal F₂, and backcross generations from a cross involving two white wheat lines were space-planted to study the association among the three procedures for measuring noodle starch quality. Grain protein and hardness and plant height also were measured. Differences among the generations were observed for the viscoamylograph, <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume, and plant height. Coefficients of variation were low for both <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume and plant height. A significant positive association was found between the viscoamylograph and the RVA (r= 0. 61). This indicates that for the populations evaluated in this study the RVA can be used in place of the viscoamylograph to measure starch quality. The RVA values, however, varied greatly between years suggesting a large environmental influence. There was also evidence for a genotype by environment interaction. No maternal effects were noted between reciprocal crosses. Conflicting results were found for the association between the <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume procedure and the RVA and viscoamylograph. Further experiments are required to clarify the possible association between <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume and other starch quality tests. Such experiments may have to be delayed until the F₄ or F₅ generations when adequate amounts of flour can be obtained from more genetically uniform lines...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} seventy wheat {{varieties}} developed in India {{during the past}} 100 years were assessed for allelic diversity of waxy genes and two hundred varieties for starch pasting properties. Large variation was exhibited in starch pasting properties such as peak viscosity (159. 3 to 303. 2 RVU), RVA breakdown (28. 5 RVU to 111. 4 RVU), setback (73. 2 to 116. 3) and final viscosity (109. 2 to 309. 1 RVU) measured by Rapid Visco-Analyzer. <b>Flour</b> <b>swelling</b> power varied from 10. 25 to 16. 19 with the average value of 13. 24. Final viscosity showed strong positive correlation with peak viscosity (R 2 = 0. 55). Significant positive correlation was observed between peak viscosity and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> power (R 2 = 0. 37). Because <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> can be measured using 40 mg of the flour, it has utility in breeding programme to identify desirable recombinants in early segregating generations. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of Wx-B 1 locus showed the presence of Wx-B 1 null in 60 % of the varieties and exhibited significant positive correlation with peak viscosity (P < 0. 01), <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> power (P < 0. 001) and RVA breakdown (P < 0. 001). Therefore, the combination of both the PCR for Wx-B 1 null and microlevel test for starch properties such as FSP {{can be used for}} the improvement of flour properties suitable for various end-use products of wheat...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the genetic basis of gelatinization temperature (GT), gel textural traits and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume, quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for these traits using a doubled haploid (DH) population {{derived from a}} cross between indica variety Zai-Ye-Qing 8 (ZYQ 8) and japonica variety Jing-Xi 17 (JX 17). The {{results indicated that the}} starch property parameters were continuously distributed among the DH lines, and some DH lines showed transgressive segregation for all the parameters. A total of 16 QTLs were identified for seven traits. A major QTL, the alk gene on chromosome 6 was significant for the three GT traits, onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), and completion temperature (Tc). This locus could explain 49. 4, 38. 9, and 28. 3 % of the total variance, respectively, indicating that GT parameters were substantially controlled by the alk gene which has previously been identified for alkali spreading value (ASV). The additive effects of alk on To,Tp and Tc were from ZYQ 8. Another two QTLs on chromosomes 1 and 7 were also identified for the three GT parameters, whose positive effects were contributed from JX 17. Another QTL on chromosome 10 with the positive effects coming from ZYQ 8 was significant only for Tc. However, the enthalpy (ΔH) of gelatinization was controlled by two minor QTLs on chromosomes 1 and 7. A major QTL, the Wx gene on chromosome 6 was identified for gel hardness and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume which explained 58. 8 and 36. 6 % of the total variances, respectively. Another two QTLs were also detected for <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume, one of which (qSV- 7) could explain 21. 4 % of the total variance. However, gel cohesiveness was controlled by a major QTL located between alk and Wx on chromosome 6. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Seed storage protein and amylose content of grains were evaluated. Biochemical makers, including granule bound starch synthase (GBSS), high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and friabilin were also evaluated by using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a single kernel.

40|$|Eleven rice genotypes {{with diverse}} Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) pasting {{characteristics}} were evaluated for their physicochemical and gel textural characteristics {{relative to their}} suitability for making rice noodles. Apparent amylose content (AC) was highly correlated with swelling power (r = - 0. 65, P < 0. 05), <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume (FSV) (r = - 0. 67, P < 0. 05), noodle hardness (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 01), gumminess (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 01), chewiness (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 01), and tensile strength (r = 0. 72, P < 0. 05). Solubility showed an inverse relationship with the pasting parameters and noodle rehydration, and a positive relationship with cooking loss, noodle hardness, and gumminess. FSV {{and most of the}} pasting parameters were negatively correlated with noodle hardness. RVA parameters and textural parameters of gels formed in the RVA canister were well correlated with actual noodle texture and may, therefore, be used for predicting rice noodle quality during early screening of genotypes in breeding programs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{properties}} {{were measured}} on the doubled haploid progeny of 2 crosses, one between Cranbrook and Halberd {{and the other}} between CD 87 and Katepwa. Properties studied included starch peak and final viscosity measured by Rapid Visco Analyser, starch granule size distribution measured by laser light scattering, starch gelatinisation temperature by differential scanning calorimetry, and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume. In the Cranbrook Halberd cross (samples from 2 environments), a highly significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) was located on chromosome 4 A for both starch peak viscosity and starch/flour swelling volume, centred around the Wx-B 1 locus. In previous studies, this locus {{has been found to}} be linked to Japanese noodle quality. The increases in starch peak viscosity and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume are derived from the Halberd parent, consistent with the fact that Halberd is null for the Wx-B 1 locus on chromosome 4 A and is missing the respective granule-bound starch synthase protein, whereas Cranbrook is a wheat line carrying the normal 3 Wx loci. The final starch viscosity also showed an association with the Wx-B 1 locus. In the CD 87 Katepwa cross, the progeny showed an association between peak viscosity and a marker on chromosome 7 A. This appeared to be near the Wx-A 1 locus. In some experiments, flour viscosity showed a highly significant QTL on chromosome 7 B, apparently at the same locus as the late maturity - amylase derived from the Cranbrook parent. Starch gelatinisation onset temperature indicated a significant QTL on chromosomes 2 B and 7 A (LOD = 2. 58 and 3. 66, respectively, in interval analyses). Starch gelatinisation peak temperatures indicated a QTL on chromosome 7 A, which, although not in the significant (P = 0. 05) class based on regression analyses, indicated a LOD score of 3. 06 in interval analyses. Heat of gelatinisation (H) indicated a suggestive QTL (LRS = 14. 5 with a threshold of 14. 7 for P < 0. 05, LOD = 2. 65 for interval analysis), on chromosome 4 A, at the Wx-B 1 locus with an increased effect coming from the Halberd parent. The A:B granule ratio analysis indicated a significant QTL on chromosome 4 B, but this was not observed in all environments and may be due to the fact that the QTL corresponded to the position of a major QTL controlling plant growth...|$|R

These changes are likely to affect the nutritional content, anti-nutritional and functional properties of sprout flour produced. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect the length of germination on the functional properties of the antitrypsin activity of pigeon pea sprout flour. After being soaked at 50 °C during the first 6 hours, then at room temperature in the next 30 hours, pigeon pea seeds were germinated at room temperature with germination time of 24; 36, 48; 60 and 72 hours respectively. The resulting sprouts were dried at 50 °C, then powdered. The results showed that the germination process increased water absorption capacity and the oil absorption 15. 73 % and 14. 80 % respectively. The longer the time of germination, the higher the water absorption capacity and the oil absorption were. The process of germination decreased pigeon pea <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume from 5. 3 % to 4. 2 % in pigeon pea sprouts flour, but increased the solubility of 13. 3 % (pigeon pea flour) to 19. 0 % (pigeon pea sprouts flour) an...|$|R

These markets require suitable quality grain for use in wheat-based products, so the understanding of wheat end products from an Asian consumer {{point of view is}} important. The major wheat quality requirements for char siew bao, a Chinese Guandong-style steamed bun were determined. The research 1) developed laboratory methods for the production and assessment of char siew bao using a scoring system 2) optimized the new methods and compared the new methods with a traditional method and 3) used the new validated methods in an investigation of the role of soft wheat quality on char siew bao. A sponge and dough method with one hour fermentation time was developed to establish a simplified laboratory method for char siew bao production. The screening experiments and response surface methodology experiments showed that water addition, sugar, and sponge mixing time were responsible for sixty-nine percent of the variation in total score.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} in the physicochemical properties of starches from 56 waxy rice (Oryza sativa L) genotypes (34 of indica and 22 of japonica) was studied. The parameters included thermal and retrogradation properties tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), pasting viscosity tested by rapid viscoanalyser (RVA), and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume (FSV). Wide diversity was found in all the parameters. According to their gelatinisation temperature (GT), the waxy rice genotypes could {{be divided into two}} groups, a high-GT group and a low-GT group. A total of 15 genotypes were identified as high-GT, all belonging to the indica subspecies. There was about a 5 °C difference within each group and a 10 °C difference between groups. Many parameters were correlated with each other in all 56 waxy rices, but some correlations were also consistent and significant when comparing the high-GT group and the low-GT group separately. For example, hot paste viscosity (HPV) was positively correlated with onset temperature (To) and enthalpy of gelatinisation (ΔH g). The results suggested that initial screening in waxy rice breeding programmes for varieties with desirable starch properties for specific food uses could be efficiently accomplished using pasting profiles from the RVA. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Rice flours with {{different}} particle sizes and degrees of damaged starch granules were produced by hammer milling and cryogenic milling of rice grains, where degradation of starch molecules {{was evident in}} the hammer-milled flours, but not in the cryogenically milled flours. The solubility and swelling properties of the resulting rice flours were determined in cold (30 °C) and hot water (90 °C). The cold- and hot-water starch solubility was strongly correlated with the degree of damaged starch granules, and weakly with the particle size of rice flour. No evident correlations were observed between starch solubility and the molecular structures, indicating that molecular degradation by milling process was not the only precondition of increased starch solubility. Possible mechanism for the observed correlations is that increasing surface area and/or exposure of loosely packed inner part of starch granules with increasing degree of damaged starch granules allowed more starch molecules to leach out in cold and hot water. Furthermore, the cold-water <b>swelling</b> of rice <b>flour</b> was strongly correlated with the degree of damaged starch granules, possibly due to the rapid hydration of damaged starch granules, whereas the hot-water swelling did not show any correlations with flour particle size and granular and molecular starch structures. The results have provided better insights in the relationship between starch structures and solubility and swelling properties of rice flour, which can be used to improve the manufacture and selection criteria of rice flour for better products...|$|R

The pasting properties (using a Rapid Visco-Analyser [RVA]) and <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume (FSV, using silver nitrate to inactivate α-amylase activity) of wholemeal, were measured for 242 hexaploid accessions of Iranian landrace wheat. FSV values and the peak viscosities were positively correlated (r = 0. 73 ***). FSV values in the landraces ranged from 8. 3 to 15. 9 mL/g and peak viscosities ranged from 139 to 305 RVA units (RVU). In comparison, FSV of cvs. Eradu and Klasic were 18. 6 and 15. 0 mL/g, and peak viscosities were 355 and 303 RVU, respectively. Of the landraces, Iranian Wheat Accession (IWA) 8602488 had the highest peak viscosity (305 RVU) and exceptionally high hot- and cool-paste viscosities. Two accessions, IWA 8602430 and 8600544, displayed pasting characteristics considered desirable for high-quality Japanese white-salted noodles. Four landraces were identified that had starch with unusually high resistance to shear-thinning. Texture profile analysis was done on the wholemeal gels formed in the RVA canister. The variation in parameters such as hardness, chewiness, and adhesiveness in the landraces greatly exceeded that in the cultivars. The hot-paste viscosity, breakdown, setback, and final viscosity values, but not the peak viscosity or FSV, were highly significantly correlated with the hardness, chewiness, and adhesiveness of the gel.

This test is applicable to the direct analysis of starch, flour, or crushed grain and requires less than 1 grain to perform. Several hundred samples may be routinely analysed in one day. The assay was validated using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of a doubled haploid mapping population of the cross Cranbrook (Wx-B 1 a) /Halberd (Wx-B 1 b). This demonstrated that the assay unambiguously identified 153 of 161 lines analysed, with a highly significant QTL (LRS value 270) accounting for 83 % of ELISA variation, at the Wx-B 1 locus on chromosome 4 AL. In addition, measurement of total GBSSI variation using a non-isoform-specific GBSSI detection monoclonal antibody also gave a significant QTL (LRS of 84, accounting for 42 % of ELISA variation) at the Wx-B 1 locus. Application of the assay to crude flour extracts of 8 grains for each of 1093 progeny from 4 crosses segregating at the Wx-B 1 locus permitted the unambiguous scoring of lines as pure Wx-B 1 a or pure Wx-B 1 b. The scoring by ELISA was strongly related to the <b>flour</b> <b>swelling</b> volume of the lines, thus demonstrating the utility of this high-throughput screening method for the faster, more efficient development of Australian noodle wheats.

The yams were processed by peeling, cubing, and blanching at 100 ºC for 5 or 10 min, drying at 50 ºC and subsequently milled to flours and fractionated to 40, 60, or 80 mesh sizes. Another batch of the tubers were processed similarly, {{but they were not}} subjected to a blanching treatment. Swelling capacity, water absorption capacities, bulk density, solubility and pasting characteristics were evaluated. The result showed that the lesser known yam Ighu exhibited significantly higher (p< 0. 05) hot and cold paste viscosities, solubility, water absorption and swelling capacities than the common yam varieties. Hot and Cold paste viscosities, solubility, water absorption and <b>swelling</b> capacities of <b>flour</b> generally increased as particle size decreased in all the test samples. While the bulk density was not affected by the blanching treatment, it decreased with decrease in particle size. The yam starches generally showed weak stability,but starch of the lesser known variety Ona suffered the least share thinning. Rate of retrogradation was found to be high in all the yam varieties but more pronounced in the lesser known yams Ighu and Ona.

40|$|Wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal in the production of a very wide range of products such as bread, cookies, cakes and breakfast cereals. Such different end-products can be obtained by varying the ingredient bill and/or processing conditions (Shewry, 2009). However, not every wheat flour type is equally suited for each application. Therefore, flour quality determination is of great (economical) importance. Adequate flour quality determination is, however, difficult because of the complexity of the system. Indeed, wheat flour contains different constituents that contribute to its properties and the levels and/or functionality of these flour constituents vary between different flour types. The general objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate methods for assessing the quality of European wheat flour. An important focus point was the investigation of the relative value of solvent retention capacity (SRC) test methodologies when compared to more general flour and dough characterization methods for differentiating European flour samples of different bread, cookie and cake making quality. SRC tests are based on quantifying the <b>swelling</b> behavior of <b>flour</b> polymer networks and, hence, their ability to retain a given medium. By doing so, the method relates flour functionality to specific flour constituents. A SRC profile of flour consists of its water retention capacity (WRC), sodium carbonate SRC (SCSRC), sucrose SRC (SuSRC) and lactic acid SRC (LASRC) values. Evidently, the bread, cookie and cake making qualities of a set of European wheat flours were also investigated. In a first experimental part, the SRC readings of a set of 19 European wheat flour samples, used commercially for different end-products, were determined and compared with those from some typical North American wheat flour samples. WRC, SCSRC and LASRC readings were mostly higher than those of some typical North American soft wheat flour samples, but in the range of those of some typical North American hard wheat flour samples. For the SuSRC readings, no distinction could be made between our European flour samples and those of typical North American hard or soft wheat flour samples. In general, based on data in literature of chemical compositions, dough properties and SRC profiles, the 19 European wheat flours appeared better suited for bread making than for cookie or cake making. This was investigated in the second part of the experimental work. Furthermore, it was verified whether the knowledge base relating to SRC tests could be extended to typical European wheat flour. Strong linear relations were observed between flour damaged starch contents and both the WRC and SCSRC readings. Modifying specific flour constituent properties and contents illustrated that proteins, damaged starch and solvent-accessible arabinoxylan contributed to all SRC readings, but each of these flour polymers contributed more to one specific SRC test. Flour proteins, especially the glutenins, contributed mostly to LASRC test results and likely restricted the swelling of damaged starch in the SCSRC test. Damaged starch largely determined the SCSRC reading of flour, but also affected the other three SRC readings. Water-extractable arabinoxylan only contributed to the SuSRC reading, whereas the water-unextractable, but still solvent-accessible arabinoxylan contributed to all SRC readings in general and to the SuSRC reading in particular. In general, the knowledge base relating to SRC tests could be extended to European wheat flour. In a second experimental part, the quality of the European flour samples for the production of three common wheat-based food products in the Western world, namely straight-dough bread, sugar-snap cookies and pound cakes, was assessed. Thereafter, the relative suitability of the SRC tests and more general flour and dough characterization methods to differentiate flour samples of different bread, cookie or cake making quality were evaluated. For bread making, variables related to flour protein content and/or quality were positively related to bread volume. The SRC variables did not show the best correlation with the bread making quality of European wheat flour. However, the LASRC was the test of choice for assessing the bread making quality of flour, especially when the obtained LASRC value was corrected for the contribution of non-glutenin polymers (e. g. damaged starch and arabinoxylan) by dividing the LASRC value by the sum of the SCSRC and SuSRC values. For cookie making, all variables indicative for flour water holding capacity were suitable for assessing cookie making quality of flour. For the current flour sample set, the WRC even correlated better with the cookie diameter than commonly applied methods that measure the amount of water necessary to develop visco-elastic dough. Furthermore, the SuSRC value was negatively related to the dough spread rate during baking. Next to flour water holding capacity, flour protein quality also appeared an important flour quality specification for sugar-snap cookie making. The higher the level of gluten in flour that are unextractable in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing buffer (large gluten proteins), the earlier the cookie dough stopped spreading during baking. For cake making, flour protein content, flour water holding capacity and minimum batter viscosity during baking were positively related to the cake volume which itself is the net result of the oven spring and the collapse that takes place during cake making. The flour proteins had a positive influence on batter viscosity during baking and the quality of the proteins determined the resistance of the crumb structure to collapse. The damaged starch contents were positively related to the oven spring values. The minimum batter viscosity during baking is a useful variable because high viscosities during baking allow the batter to retain expanding gas cells and thereby improve cake volume. For the current flour sample set, especially flour water-extractable arabinoxylan content, but also flour protein and damaged starch contents, contributed to the minimum batter viscosity during baking. All in all, SRC variables were less suitable for assessing the cake making quality of flour. Nevertheless, the SuSRC values were positively related to the minimal batter viscosity during baking. WRC, SCSRC and SuSRC values, which are positively related to flour damaged starch content, were also indicative for the batter expansion during baking. Furthermore, the desired flour characteristics for pound cake making corresponded more to the characteristics desired for straight-dough bread making than those desired for sugar-snap cookie making. Taken together, within the boundaries of our study, we logically assume that the SRC tests are good alternative tests to differentiate European flour samples of different cookie making quality. To a lesser extent, they are useful to differentiate European flour samples of different bread or cake making quality. status: publishe...|$|R
