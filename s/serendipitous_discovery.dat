25|$|Drug {{discovery}} {{is the process}} by which potential drugs are discovered or designed. In the past most drugs have been discovered either by isolating the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discovery.</b> Modern biotechnology often focuses on understanding the metabolic pathways related to a disease state or pathogen, and manipulating these pathways using molecular biology or biochemistry. A great deal of early-stage drug discovery has traditionally been carried out by universities and research institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} study of mosasaurs {{began in the late}} 18th century with the <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discovery</b> of a large fossilized skeleton in a limestone mine near Maastricht in the Netherlands. The fossils were studied by local scholar Adriaan Gilles Camper, who noted a resemblance to modern monitor lizards in correspondence with renowned French anatomist Georges Cuvier. Nevertheless, the animal was not scientifically described until the English Reverend William Daniel Conybeare named it Mosasaurus, after the river Meuse located near the site of its discovery.|$|E
25|$|A <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discovery</b> {{was made}} in China in the early 1980s while searching for novel {{anthelmintics}} for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with schistosomiasis.|$|E

40|$|Serendipity, {{a trigger}} of {{exciting}} yet unexpected discoveries, {{is an important}} but comparatively neglected factor in information seeking, research, and ideation. We suggest that serendipity can be facilitated through visualization. To explore this, we introduce the Bohemian Bookshelf, which aims to support <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discoveries</b> {{in the context of}} digital book collections. The Bohemian Bookshelf consists of five interlinked visualizations each offering a unique overview of the collection. It aims at encouraging serendipity by (1) offering multiple visual access points to the collection, (2) highlighting adjacencies between books, (3) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection, (4) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books, and (5) enabling a playful approach to information exploration. A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discoveries.</b> This encourages future explorations into promoting serendipity through information visualization.

[...] Soil and water {{samples were collected}} {{from all over the}} world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products.

40|$|Searching for unknown urban {{events in}} the hope of making <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discoveries</b> {{has been the focus of}} {{multiple}} mobile tourist guide and recommender systems. This study investigates how transitory search can be used as an interaction mechanism for making such discoveries on a mobile phone. Our prototype, onMelbourne, returns a changing collection of urban events within physical and temporal proximity based on the setting and adjustment of search sliders by the user. Laboratory tests with 5 participants show that users understand transitory search for urban events and do make <b>serendipitous</b> <b>discoveries.</b> In addition we found that users fear missing out on events not shown by the system, and that the choice of labels on sliders impacts their understanding of a slider set halfway. The contribution of the paper is a better understanding of how transitory search can facilitate explorative behaviour when browsing for urban events on mobiles...|$|R
