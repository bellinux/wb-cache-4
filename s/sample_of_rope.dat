40|$|A unique {{machine for}} {{inducing}} bending fatigue in wire ropes was {{built at the}} U. S. Bureau of Mimes' Pittsburgh Research Center. This machine can produce nine levels of degradation through repetitive cycling <b>of</b> long <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> the types used in the mining industry. This report provides {{an analysis of the}} results of the first wire rope to be fatigued on this machine. These results have indicated that as a wire rope accumulates bending cycles, its strength first decreases because of wear and then in- creases due to cold working of the wires. As the amount of cold working increases, more and more of the embrittled wires break and the strength <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> decreases rapidly. In this test, application of several of the regulatory retirement criteria to various sections <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> suggests that there may be some inconsistency among them...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{established}} a wire rope research laboratory {{to examine the}} factors that affect the safety and the useful life <b>of</b> wire <b>rope.</b> In the most recent work, two 32 -mm 6 x 27 H flattened strand ropes were degraded on a bending fatigue machine. The two tests were run at constant loads of 285 and 347 kN or safety factors of 2. 5 and 2. Nondestructive and tensile strength tests were performed on <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ropes</b> to determine the relationship between rope deterioration and rope breaking strength. Neither the area loss nor the number of broken wires measured from nondestructive tests {{could be used as}} clear indicators of the loss of strength. However, it was found from the tensile tests for both rope specimens that the strength loss was associated with the reduction of breaking strain. This suggests that measuring the strain of many short sections <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> in the elastic region may locate the high stress sections and thus delermine the condition <b>of</b> the <b>rope...</b>|$|R
40|$|Safe {{participation}} in the sport of rock climbing is dependent on using a range of equipment and using appropriate techniques. However, the level of safety achieved {{will depend on the}} specific equipment used, in terms of design, type, adequate load rating and condition, and also upon the climbing technique as this can significantly help to minimise any impact loads in the advent of a fall. In addressing these issues, this paper describes some mechanical tests which have been carried using a specially designed drop load rig in which falling weights have been applied to <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> climbing <b>rope</b> to establish impact loads. The load-time histories have been recorded and peak loads have been compared with those determined theoretically. In addition, some new and also used anchor nuts have been test loaded to failure and the different failure modes which resulted are described. Finally, the general design of climbing equipment is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In three-layered {{flattened}} wire ropes, which {{are common in}} mine haulage systems in coal mines, {{only part of the}} wires can be inspected by the visual method, so magnetic induction testing is employed as well. The project aimed at reducing inspection requirements without impairing the safety standard. Random <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> {{flattened wire}} <b>ropes</b> have shown that this is possible, provided that fatigue and corrosion curves of the cable can be made comparable with the diagrams of magnetic induction tests. Monitoring of the strength reduction <b>of</b> these <b>ropes</b> must be possible throughout the whole rope life. The project focused on the following tasks: Assessment and description of the haulage systems and operating conditions (haulage equipment, mine climate, number of hoists per day, etc.); Inspection of the geometries of new and worn-out <b>ropes</b> and calculation <b>of</b> rupture forces and residual rupture forces; Modification of existing measuring and storage instruments, if possible in explosion-proof construction; Development of software for assessing the residual fracture force <b>of</b> haulage <b>ropes.</b> Available from TIB Hannover: RR 1344 (142) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEMinisterium fuer Wirtschaft und Mittelstand, Technologie und Verkehr des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Duesseldorf (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design.

In this critical review of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes, we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a unified way to smooth certain {{multiple}} structures called ropes on smooth varieties. We prove that most <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary multiplicity, supported on smooth curves can be smoothed. By a rope being smoothable we mean that the rope is the flat limit {{of a family of}} smooth, irreducible curves. To construct a smoothing, we connect, on the one hand, deformations of a finite morphism to projective space and, on the other hand, morphisms from a rope to projective space. We also prove a general result of independent interest, namely, finite covers onto smooth irreducible curves embedded in projective space can be deformed to a family of 1 : 1 maps. We apply our general theory to prove the smoothing <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> 3 on P^ 1.
