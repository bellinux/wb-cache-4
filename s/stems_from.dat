Some of these differences <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> variations in the perceived acceptability of an activity in different cultures. Others <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> different approaches to the common problem of identifying and regulating hazardous activity.

5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the underlying grotesque scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow hominids, the mentioning of artifacts which {{have not yet been}} invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.|$|E
5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the use of {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range}} of languages.

5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus gracilis, {{the older}} species, {{is found in}} the Löwenstein Formation (Lower Norian). P.engelhardti <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the upper Löwenstein Formation (Upper Norian), the Trossingen Formation (Upper Norian), and {{equivalently}} aged rock units. Plateosaurus thus lived probably from approximately 214 to 204 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|Defined as {{dreams that}} contain impossible, incongruent, or bizarre content as {{the types of}} dreams {{hypothesized}} to <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> memory circuits accumulating efficacy errors. In theory, old memories having undergone synaptic efficacy refreshment multiple times throughout one's lifetime result in accumulating errors that manifest as illusory dreams when stimulated. Qualities of illusory dreaming {{have been linked to}} delusions observed in mental disorders. Illusory dreams are believed to most likely <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> older memories that experience this accumulation of errors in contrast to authentic dreams that <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> more recent experiences.|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov {{cyclization}} as a tool in organic synthesis <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis. The reaction {{has been used in}} several total syntheses and several reviews have been published.|$|E

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
