5000|$|Air is channeled {{within the}} air shower using a {{closed-loop}} system, {{where it is}} continuously re-circulated. Air is forced through a motorized filter/blower module into a large plenum, then into the shower through jet nozzles. Particle-laden, contaminated air is routed out of the <b>shower</b> <b>compartment</b> through floor vents {{and returned to the}} filtration unit. This process ensures that only decontaminated air is used to remove particulates from personnel and other equipment, such as supply carts.|$|E
50|$|Dahlia {{agrees to}} {{move closer to}} Kyle so shared custody will be easier. As she packs, {{a girl in a}} hooded {{bathrobe}} who resembles Cecilia asks her to read to her. When Dahlia hears Cecilia playing in the bathtub, she realizes that the girl is Natasha. Natasha begs Dahlia not to leave but Dahlia rushes into the bathroom to save Cecilia. Natasha locks Cecilia in the <b>shower</b> <b>compartment</b> and holds her underwater. Dahlia pleads with Natasha to let her daughter go, promising to be her mother forever. Floods overwhelm the apartment, and Natasha and the ghost of Dahlia walk the hall as mother and daughter.|$|E
50|$|Alexandras {{body was}} lifted in 1919, and the frame {{was cut in}} half and a 5 ft section was spliced into the frame. The end {{diaphragms}} were removed and replaced with 2 ft platforms, and the interior was rebuilt. The modified car was renamed Melville, and had two 14 ft couches with a table and one 6 ft couch in the formerly ladies-end saloon, which was extended from 12 ft to 20 ft. The ladies lavatory was abolished, and the compartments were reorganised to a small attendants storage closet (2 ft), then a conductors compartment (9 ft). The former mens lavatory was made unisex, but split into the lavatory section and a shower section; the latter only accessible from the former-mens-end saloon. That end saloon was fitted with a single bed-chair, and two couches of 10 ft and 12 ft; the latter had to be shifted to access the <b>shower</b> <b>compartment.</b> The four external body doors either side were all sealed but their window spacing was retained, {{and access to the}} car was exclusively via the end platforms. In the new form, the car was named Melville.|$|E

The new CFR sleepers are some of the most modern in Europe, having air-conditioning, LCD screens and modern <b>showers</b> in each <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Edward was {{modified}} in 1919, {{with the ladies}} end compartment abolished and replaced with three <b>showers,</b> the attendants <b>compartment</b> seat modified allowing conversion to a sleeping berth, and the car was renamed Carey. A new underframe was placed under the vehicle, based on the Tait motor carriage outside-channel construction, but the car length was retained. The car was damaged at Seymour and taken off register in June 1955, and scrapped at Newport Workshops on 28 June 1961. The name Carey was recycled on a guards van that became the new shower car.|$|R
