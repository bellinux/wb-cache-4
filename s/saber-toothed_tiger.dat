5|$|Smilodon is an extinct genus of machairodont felid. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous prehistoric mammals, and the best known saber-toothed cat. Although {{commonly}} known as the <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tiger,</b> it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on fossils from Brazil. Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The largest collection of Smilodon fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} Ice Age, between 8000–7000 BCE Kentucky's climate stabilized, leading to a rise in {{population}} and technology advances, resulting in more sedentary lifestyle. This warming trend killed the Pleistocene big game megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon, giant beavers, tapirs, short faced bear, giant ground sloths, <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tiger,</b> horse, bison, musk ox, stag-moose, and peccary, all of which were native to Kentucky during the Ice Age, became extinct or moved north as the glacial ice retreated.|$|E

One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tiger</b> reaching with its tremendous hooks.

50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Provence during the paleolithic age lived in caves or in huts made of branches or covered with animal skins. Evidence {{found at the}} Grotte du Vallonnet shows they were more scavengers than hunters, using their tools to scrape meat from carcasses of bison, deer, rhinoceros, horses and other game killed by <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> tigers, panthers and other predators. They endured the arrival and departure of two ice ages, which caused dramatic changes to the climate, vegetation and even the sea level.|$|R
50|$|Around this period, North America {{was still}} recuperating from its last glacial {{period and the}} climate was much {{different}} than now. The climate more closely resembled a tundra, with lower temperatures, conifer trees and large mammals such as mammoths and <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers.</b> Eventually, the climate began to warm up again, the large mammals started to disappear, and the vegetation seen more often today began to flourish. These climatic changes made life more sustainable for the Native Americans. They continued to invent new weapons and made advancements in agriculture until the Europeans arrived in North America.|$|R

50|$|The {{remnants}} of ferns, semi-tropical and temperate deciduous forests, shellfish, <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> extinct horse and camel species, and giant sloth, among other extinct species {{found in the}} John Day Fossil Beds, are {{a reminder that the}} flora and fauna of the region has changed significantly over the millennia. While deer, elk, pronghorn, cougar, bear and upland game bird populations thrive today, some of these animals were remarkably scarce 200 years ago. Explorers and trappers traveling through the region in the early 19th century remarked on the scarcity of game animals and their ability (or inability, as the case were) to find food.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} human fossils found {{outside of}} Africa are skulls and mandibles of the Asian Homo erectus from Dmanisi (modern Republic of Georgia) in Caucasus, {{which is a}} land corridor that led to North Asia from Africa and Near East or Middle East. They are approximately 1.8 Ma (Megaannum, or million years) old. Archaeologists have named these fossils Homo erectus georgicus. There were also some remains that looked similar to the Homo ergaster, which may mean that there were several species living about that time in Caucasus. Bones of animals found near the human remains included short-necked giraffes, ostriches, ancient rhinoceroses from Africa and <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers</b> and wolves from Eurasia. Tools found with the human fossils include simple stone tools like those used in Africa: a cutting flake, core and a chopper.|$|R
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|R

40|$|N evada and Gold {{are words}} that go {{together}} like “peach-es ” and “cream. ” Official estimates indicate that total world gold production {{since the beginning}} of civil-ization has been 4. 97 billion troy ounces and total Nevada production is 3 % of that, which ranks young Nevada as one of the earth’s primary gold-producing regions. Nevada, like every piece of land, has a story to tell—the geological story of becoming a mountain or desert, a plain or a canyon. Also to be told is the story of its people, people that loved and hated, searched for gold and silver, waged wars, and finally settled and founded ranches and cities. A million years ago, the land that we call Nevada stretched for hundred of miles before it gently touched the majestic snow-capped mountains. Rivers and lakes left behind by the huge glacial melt provided for Pleistocene megafauna. Giant sloths, camels, elephants and woolly mammoths competed for resour-ces in an area also haunted by <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> giant lions, big hyenas and dire-wolves. Ten to fifteen thousand years ago, the first party of men penetrated the area. The brave hunters and gatherers left their marks, and their tools and weapons, which were dropped on the shores of many lakes, now riddle the landscape. There are flints, obsidian knifes, darts and atlatls, a fearsome device that uses leverage to attain great velocity in throwing spears and was capable of bringing down a large mammoth. A few thousand years later, more modern humans settled down and started agricultural enterprises; they also mined tur-quoise and salt. Their dwellings evolved into what the world would later acknowledge as the enigmatic Anasazi ruins. Nevada’s Lost City experienced glorious days prior to being mysteriously abandoned. The subsequent inhabitants of the area—Paiute and other Indian tribes—were encountered by the first white explorers to set foot in Nevada: the Spanish priest Francisco Garces i...|$|R
50|$|This {{chapter is}} called vision; {{it is the}} 10th brain rule. In this chapter John Medina {{discusses}} human vision and how it outplays all the other senses. Vision is the most dominant of all the senses, yet it is not 100 percent accurate. Our {{view of the world}} is not what the brain tells us, rather it is an estimate. Using previous knowledge and the surrounding view, our brain fills in the gaps in our vision. These gaps or black holes are caused by “a region in the eye where retina neurons, carrying visual information, gather to begin their journey into deep brain tissue” (228). This place is called the optic disc and in this region there are no cells that can recognize sight, thus it is blind here. The brain is so powerful that it can fill in these gaps instantly. The brain has to work very hard {{in order for us to}} see, this causes it to use up a lot of its thinking resources. Vision is the most important tool for learning. Visual input of pictures is more likely to be remembered and recalled than visual input of texts; this notion is called the pictorial superiority effect, or PSE. Our early surroundings were of trees and <b>saber-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> the threat of danger and the survival of our lives. We had to identify food, shelter, and our predators. This is why our vision is the most important of our senses. It is more work for our brains to remember texts because the brain sees words as many tiny pictures. Texts are a lot like pictures and it takes our brains longer to make sense of them. Even when we read something, we try to visualize what we are reading. The visual and smell senses are battling it out to see which one will dominate, and so far the visual sense is winning. Many of our other senses have been harmed by our vision because what we see alters what is real.|$|R
