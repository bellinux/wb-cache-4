40|$|Four 10 MW, highly-stabilized {{power supply}} modules have been {{installed}} at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL, to energize water-cooled, resistive, high-field research magnets. The power supply modules achieve a long term current stability if 10 ppM over a 12 h period with a short term ripple and noise variation of < 10 ppM over a time period of one cycle. The power supply modules can operate independently, feeding four separate magnets, or two, three or four modules can operate in parallel. Each power <b>supply</b> <b>module</b> consists of a 12. 5 kV vacuum circuit breaker, two three-winding, step-down transformers, a 24 -pulse rectifier with interphase reactors, and a passive and an active filter. Two different transformer tap settings allow rated dc supply output voltages of 400 and 500 V. The rated current of a <b>supply</b> <b>module</b> is 17 kA and each <b>supply</b> <b>module</b> has a one-hour overload capability of 20 kA. The isolated output terminals of each power <b>supply</b> <b>module</b> are connected to a reversing switch. An extensive high-current bus system allows the modules {{to be connected to}} 16 magnet cells. This paper presents the detailed design of the power supply components. Various test results taken during the commissioning phase with a 10 MW resistive load and results taken with the research magnets are shown. The effects of the modules on the electrical supply system and the operational behavior of the power factor correction/harmonic filters are described.

40|$|Abstract – Identifying {{worst-case}} {{voltage drop}} conditions in every <b>module</b> <b>supplied</b> {{by the power}} grid is a crucial problem in modern IC design. In this paper we develop a novel methodology for power grid verification {{which is based on}} accurately constructing the space of current variations of the <b>supplied</b> <b>modules</b> and locating its precise points that yield the worst-case voltage drop conditions. The construction of the current space is performed via plain simulation and statistical extrapolation using results from extreme value theory. The method overcomes limitations of past methods which either relied on loosely bounding the worst-case voltage drop, or abstracted the current space in a vague and incomplete set of bound-type constraints. Experimental results verify the potential of the proposed method to identify worst-case conditions and demonstrate the pessimism inherent in previous bound-type approaches. I...|$|R
