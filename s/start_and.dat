5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most two <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E

25|$|Each stage {{begins and}} ends in a city. Most stages have {{different}} <b>start</b> cities <b>and</b> end cities, while some stages have the same <b>starting</b> <b>and</b> ending location. Milan has hosted the most stage <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> finishes with 137 since the race traditionally finishes in Milan. In addition to that, the race used to begin in Milan during the race's early existence. Milan has hosted the most <b>starts</b> <b>and</b> finishes for Giro d'Italia stages, with Rome being a close second and many towns having hosted over 25 stages.|$|R
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end graphics to mark the <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end clocks for each hour, marking the <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E

5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to <b>start</b> <b>and</b> stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E
5|$|Adams again {{became a}} free agent before the 2010 season, but he {{resigned}} with the Roughriders. He continued to regularly <b>start</b> <b>and</b> be featured in the rotation at the defensive lineman position. Adams missed Week 13 due to an injury. He finished the season with 27 tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery across 16 regular season games. The Roughriders again {{made it to the}} Grey Cup, but they lost to the Alouettes 21–18.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack sabotages the operation by cutting Ben's kidney sack, and demands that Tom (M.C. Gainey) let him speak with Kate. Before Pickett can shoot Sawyer, Tom calls over the walkie-talkie. As Pickett gives the walkie to Kate, Jack tells her she has an hour's head <b>start,</b> <b>and</b> directs her to call him on the radio when she is safe.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps <b>start</b> <b>and</b> maintain a stable arc.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} <b>start</b> <b>and</b> destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
