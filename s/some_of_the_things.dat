They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Nigella found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to lose weight for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. Nigella has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.|$|E

Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> on his list.

[...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E
