40|$|AbstractThis paper presents, after a {{comparative}} {{review of the}} most often used algorithms, a control methodology that clarifies the control problems and shows how to design a robust control to {{track the maximum power}} point in VSAS. This approach clarifies the rationale behind MPP dynamic tracking problem and shows how to be optimal. This technique called VSAS (Variable Structure Automated Systems) is compared with some techniques existing in literature like PO, HC, InCond and SMC approach. The maximum power is computed online using a Modified Enhanced Perturb and Observe (MEPO) algorithm and a Robust Unified Control Algorithm (RUCA). The proposed MPPT has several advantages: simplicity, high convergence speed, robustness and is independent on PV array characteristics. The algorithm is tested under various operating conditions. The results show that the MPPT is tracked even under <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> irradiation <b>level...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a new {{maximum power point}} {{tracking}} algorithm for photovoltaic arrays is proposed. The algorithm detects the maximum power point of the PV. The computed maximum power is used as a reference value (set point) of the control system. ON/OFF power controller with hysteresis band is used to control the operation of a Buck chopper such that the PV module always operates at its maximum power computed from the MPPT algorithm. The major difference between the proposed algorithm and other techniques is that the proposed algorithm is used to control directly the power drawn from the PV. The proposed MPPT has several advantages: simplicity, high convergence speed, and independent on PV array characteristics. The algorithm is tested under various operating conditions. The obtained results have proven that the MPP is tracked even under <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> irradiation <b>level.</b> Keywords—Photovoltaic, {{maximum power point tracking}}, MPPT.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the line posed no great engineering challenges due to its course following {{the valley of the}} River Taff. The line was [...] miles in length. At Quaker's Yard there was a <b>sudden</b> steep <b>change</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>level,</b> and Brunel used 50 hp stationary winding engines; the inclined section was half a mile in length with gradients of 1 in 19 and 1 in 22. Locomotives did not ascend the incline. There was a 1 in 13 gradient on the Pwllyrhebog branch, near Tonypandy; it too was rope worked with special locomotives. Inevitably there were some stiff gradients elsewhere. There were two stone viaducts on the route: the first, at Pontypridd, crosses the River Rhondda, and the second bridges the Taff valley between Goetre Coed and Quaker's Yard.|$|R
40|$|During early {{development}} of the nervous system, gene expression patterns are known to vary widely depending on the specific developmental trajectories of different structures. Observable changes in gene expression profiles throughout development are determined by an underlying network of precise regulatory interactions between individual genes. Elucidating the organizing principles that shape this gene regulatory network {{is one of the}} central goals of developmental biology. Whether the developmental programme {{is the result of a}} dynamic driven by a fixed architecture of regulatory interactions, or alternatively, the result of waves of regulatory reorganization is not known. Here we contrast these two alternative models by examining existing expression data derived from the developing human brain in prenatal and postnatal stages. We reveal a sharp change in gene expression profiles at birth across brain areas. This sharp division between foetal and postnatal profiles is not the result <b>of</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>changes</b> in <b>level</b> <b>of</b> expression of existing gene networks. Instead we demonstrate that the perinatal transition is marked by the widespread regulatory rearrangement within and across existing gene clusters, leading to the emergence of new functional groups. This rearrangement is itself organized into discrete blocks of genes, each associated with a particular set of biological functions. Our results provide evidence of an acute modular reorganization of the regulatory architecture of the brain transcriptome occurring at birth, reflecting the reassembly of new functional associations required for the normal transition from prenatal to postnatal brain development...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} an exploratory {{study of the}} detection <b>of</b> a <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the field time series based on the numerical solution of the Lorenz system. First, {{the time when the}} Lorenz path jumped between the regions on the left and right of the equilibrium point of the Lorenz system was quantitatively marked and the <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> time <b>of</b> the Lorenz system was obtained. Second, the numerical solution of the Lorenz system was regarded as a vector; thus, this solution could be considered as a vector time series. We transformed the vector time series into a time series using the vector inner product, considering the geometric and topological features of the Lorenz system path. Third, the <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the resulting time series was detected using the sliding t-test method. Comparing the test results with the quantitatively marked time indicated that the method could detect every <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the Lorenz path, thus the method is effective. Finally, we used the method to detect the <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the pressure field time series and temperature field time series, and obtained good results for both series, which indicates that the method can apply to high-dimension vector time series. Mathematically, there is no essential difference between the field time series and vector time series; thus, we provide a new method for the detection <b>of</b> the <b>sudden</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the field time series...|$|R
