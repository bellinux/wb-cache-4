40|$|ABSTRACT: The lifting {{scheme is}} an {{efficient}} tool to construct second-generation wavelets. It {{has been used}} to realize Daubechies wavelet transform in image compression standard JPEG- 2000. Daubechies wavelets can provide better image coding performance than discrete cosine transform (DCT) which is used in JPEG because the wavelets can present signal more efficiently than DCT. However, for high compression rate, the details of the decompressed images in JPEG- 2000 are degraded. The reason is that Daubechies filters are maximally flat while their frequency selectivity is very poor. In this paper, we present an efficient method for the optimal design <b>of</b> <b>filter</b> banks and wavelets based on the lifting structure. The design problem is expressed as an optimization problem where the frequency <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>filters</b> is optimized for a given regularity order.

40|$|Ionic <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> the acetylcholine-activated ionic {{channel of}} frog {{endplate}} membranes to various organic cations has been studied. The ratio of test cation permeability (PX) to sodium permeability (PNa) was estimated by two methods, {{one based on}} the measurements in test cation solutions of the amplitude of transient depolarization induced by iontophoretic application of acetylcholine, {{and the other on}} the measurements of the reversal potential for the membrane current induced by iontophoretic application of acetylcholine under voltage-clamp conditions. The endplate channel is relatively nonselective to various test cations. The permeabilities relative to Na are ammonium (1. 71), formamidine (1. 49), methylamine (1. 39), hydrazine (1. 35), and Li (0. 76), as measured from the reversal potential for acetylcholine currents, and guanidine (0. 74), aminoguanidine (0. 20), methylguanidine (0), and choline (0) as measured from the amplitude of acetylcholine potential. Methylguanidine and aminoguanidine block the endplate channel with the apparent dissociation constants of 0. 5 and 15 mM, respectively.

40|$|The <b>selectivity</b> <b>filter</b> <b>of</b> {{potassium}} channels is {{the structural}} element {{directly responsible for}} the selective and rapid conduction of K+, whereas {{other parts of the}} protein are thought to function as a molecular gate that either permits or blocks the passage of ions.

Using free energy molecular dynamics simulations, it is shown that the reorientation of two peptide linkages in the <b>selectivity</b> <b>filter</b> <b>of</b> the KcsA K+ channel can lead to a stable nonconducting conformational state. Two microscopic factors influence the transition toward such a conformational state: the occupancy of one specific cation binding site in the selectivity filter (S 2), and the strength of intersubunit interactions involving the GYG signature sequence.

30|$|Photonic {{crystals}} (PHCs) with periodic dielectric {{materials have}} provided {{new ways of}} controlling light by means of photonic band gap (PBG). The PBG is a frequency gap in which the propagation of incident light with special frequencies as well as special polarization will be possible. This feature, in turn, has been utilized for realization of new optical functionalities and many novel devices. During the last decade, photonic crystals {{have been the most}} important part in the different areas of engineering consisting of coherent electron-photon interactions, ultra small add/drop filters (ADFs), low threshold lasers, photonic chips, nonlinear optics, and quantum information processing[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. PHCs with photonic band gap guidance mechanism can provide highly confined guided mode which is suitable for controlling the propagation of light[8]. Nowadays, all-optical ADFs are the basis of wavelength division multiplexer telecommunication systems. On the other hand, compactness is an important issue for future all-optical integrated circuits. Hence, {{one of the most important}} candidates for constructing ultra small ADFs without significant losses are photonic crystal ring-resonators (PCRRs), where the guided mode is coupled between two W 1 waveguides. Two specific properties of such devices are high quality factor (Q-factor) and small modal volume (V). Having a high Q-factor gives rise to the <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>filters,</b> and small V provides single-mode operation.
