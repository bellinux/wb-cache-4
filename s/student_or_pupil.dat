The social, economic and professional differences of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in no way hinder the young <b>student</b> <b>or</b> <b>pupil</b> from developing, {{if he or she is}} motivated to do so, its unchanged fundamentals by way of intelligent thought and practice". [...] "With its mid-nineteenth century background of poverty, neglect, ignorance and prejudice the book was a challenge to contemporary views of nursing, of nurses and of the patient". [...] "The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons. The book has, inevitably, its place in the history of nursing, for it was written by the founder of modern nursing".|$|E

The distance learning model where study packages are sent out, does fit this assumption, as the only human interaction is the marking of work by a teacher, and even that much may not be part of the service. But in a live, interactive, online school (synchronous learning) lessons are socially constructed. <b>Students</b> <b>or</b> <b>pupils</b> are in contact with each other and with teachers through software provided by the online school, and by email, both in lessons and outside them.

The authors find significant changes in how ethnicity and citizenship affect workers’ mobility. According to the authors’ results, {{in the first two}} years after 2004, 11 to 13 percent of migrants from Lithuania and Estonia and 15 percent of their Latvian counterparts were unemployed in the home country in the previous year, while around 7 percent were either <b>students</b> <b>or</b> <b>pupils.</b> These proportions exceed those observed among stayers by a factor of three to four, indicating that work abroad has represented an important coping strategy for the Baltic unemployed or potentially unemployed. Furthermore, Hazans and Kaia Philips (2010) point out that the two-thirds to three-quarters of all migrants had secondary education and that enlargement changed the skill composition of migrants. In the years prior to 2004, Lithuanian migrants had the same skill distribution as stayers, while Latvian and Estonian migrants were on average more educated than stayers. Post-accession migrants from all three countries were significantly less educated than stayers, with this gap tending to increase over time.|$|R

As a result, university lecturers often find that students lack the spatial and constructive thinking skills needed to successfully participate in graphics and design related courses. To try to improve the situation in early 2013, Riga Technical University lecturer Ieva Jurāne (Mg. sc. ing.), in collaboration with University of Liepaja Natural and Engineering Faculty, decided to develop a website "Technical Drawing" ([URL] //rasesana. it- studenti. liepu. edu. lv), in which every interested person, irrespective of {{whether it is a}} <b>student</b> <b>or</b> a <b>pupil,</b> could independently solve a variety of technical drawing course related tasks, thus developing their spatial and constructive thinking skills, which later makes it easier to learn complex Engineering Graphics programs such as AutoCAD or SolidWorks.

Our sample comprised 22 schools: 20 primary schools and 2 secondary schools.

The use of social (and digital) media becomes the ‘alternative’ collaborative tool that allows participants to engage in innovative learning environments, existing both inside and outside of the classroom. In using the platform of social media as a social innovation tool the project provided educators with the relevant knowledge, skills, values and capabilities required in facilitating a meaningful curriculum for the development of citizenship (in this case European) and sustainability in terms of a knowledge sharing community. The basis of this paper surrounds the intentions, implementations and outcomes of the EU-funded Comenius project ‘Learn to Teach by Social Web’ (L 2 T – www. learn 2. teach. eu) which set out to exploit the educational potential that social media offers teachers in engaging their learners in the contextual development of skills and knowledge through an ‘alternative’ or unfamiliar learning paradigm.
