500|$|Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, {{soon after}} the manager's retirement, [...] "He was never {{necessarily}} the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that {{had a chance to}} win, he'd win." [...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E

500|$|To-date, Deja remains {{best known}} for animating several of Disney's most famous villains, admitting to preferring animating villains over heroes. However, after The Lion King, Deja finally {{decided to take a}} break from animating villains in order to avoid repeating himself, {{subsequently}} refusing to animate villain Judge Claude Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) in favor of working on Hercules from Hercules (1997), along with Mickey Mouse in the animated short Runaway Brain (1995). Comparing Scar to other villains that he has played, Irons said that he [...] "measures very highly," [...] having [...] "charm," [...] "Machiavellian qualities" [...] and being [...] "iconic in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> says." ...|$|E

60|$|She was, however, {{forced to}} admit that her weariness and the dreary {{surroundings}} did not quite explain everything. Even her lover's first embrace had brought her no thrill, and now the close pressure of his arm left her quite unmoved. This was almost disconcertingly curious; but while she would admit no definite reason for it, there was creeping upon her a vague consciousness {{that the man was}} not the one she had so often thought of in England. He seemed different--almost, in fact, a stranger--though she could not exactly tell where the change in him began. His laughter jarred upon her. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> said appeared almost inane, and others were tinged with a self-confidence that did not become him. It almost seemed to her that he was shallow, lacking in comprehension, and once she found herself comparing him with another man. She, however, broke off that train of thought abruptly, and once more endeavoured to find the explanation in herself. Weariness had induced this captious, hypercritical fit, and by and bye she would become used to him, she said.|$|E

"They're still {{proud of}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> {{did at the}} Foreign Office--the famous 'exchange' with Spain, in the Mediterranean, which took Europe so by {{surprise}} and by which she felt injured, especially when it became apparent how much we had {{the best of the}} bargain. Then the sudden, unexpected show of force by which he imposed on the United States our interpretation of that tiresome treaty--I could never make out what it was about. These were both matters that no one really cared a straw about, but he made every one feel as if they cared; the nation rose to the way he played his trumps--it was uncommon. He {{was one of the few}} men we've had, in our period, who took Europe, or took America, by surprise, made them jump a bit; and the country liked his doing it--it was a pleasant change. The rest of the world considered that they knew in any case exactly what we would do, which was usually nothing at all. Say what you like, he's still a high name; partly also, no doubt, on account of other things his early success and early death, his political 'cheek' and wit; his very appearance--he certainly was handsome--and the possibilities (of future personal supremacy) which it was the fashion at the time, which it's the fashion still, to say had passed away with him. He had been twice at the Foreign Office; that alone was remarkable for a man dying at forty-four. What therefore will the country think when it learns he was venal?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{obstacles}} I {{refer to}} are the disadvantages I have in learning French, there being so many persons around me speaking English, and that, {{as you may}} say, in the very bosom of a French family. It seems as if you heard English everywhere; but I certainly didn't expect to find it {{in a place like}} this. I am not discouraged, however, and I talk French all I can, even with the other English boarders. Then I have a lesson every day from Miss Maisonrouge (the elder daughter of the lady of the house), and French conversation every evening in the salon, from eight to eleven, with Madame herself, and some friends of hers that often come in. Her cousin, Mr. Verdier, a young French gentleman, is fortunately staying with her, and I make a point of talking with him as much as possible. I have extra private lessons from him, and I often go out to walk with him. Some night, soon, he is to accompany me to the opera. We have also a most interesting plan of visiting all the galleries in Paris together. Like most of the French, he converses with great fluency, and I feel as if I should really gain from him. He is remarkably handsome, and extremely polite--paying a great many compliments, which, I am afraid, are not always sincere. When I return to Bangor I will tell you <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> has said to me. I think you will consider them extremely curious, and very beautiful in their way.|$|E
