5|$|In 1135, Stratford Langthorne Abbey was founded. The Abbey {{continued}} {{the process of}} draining Stratford marsh begun in the Middle Ages and creating artificial channels to drive water and tide mills. A small river port developed at Stratford, mentioned in the 15th century, to {{serve the needs of}} Stratford Abbey and the mills at Stratford, and there is similar evidence in later centuries. The Abbey took on responsibility to maintain the marsh walls around Bow Creek, to keep the tidal waters out. The river was being used for the transport of goods and passengers by 1571, when an Act of Parliament empowered the Lord Mayor of London to make improvements to the river to ensure that supplies of grain continued to reach the capital. These works included a new cut near the Thames, probably the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> between Bow Tidal Gates and Old Ford, on which no tolls were to be charged, and a pound lock was constructed at Waltham Abbey, only the second to be built in England.|$|E

25|$|The stretch above Jesus Lock is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} middle river (with the section above the Mill Pond being {{referred to as the}} upper river). Between Jesus Lock and the Mill Pond, it passes through the Backs below the walls of many of the colleges. This is the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> most popular with tourists, with its picture-postcard views of elegant bridges, green lawns and graceful willows. This stretch also has the unusual feature of the remains of a submerged towpath: the riverside colleges did not permit barge horses on the Backs, so the beasts waded up the Cam to the mill pulling their loads behind them.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of river-going traffic next to Shad Thames. It is part of the {{particularly}} deep <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> called the Pool of London, which even ships can navigate. So from time to time even full-size cruise ships or naval vessels will stop next to Shad Thames, usually for a day or so, often then proceeding through Tower Bridge (though they can go no further than the next crossing, London Bridge). Police boats and speedboats pass by frequently, as do passenger boats (such as the Damien Hirst-decorated 'Tate to Tate' boat), and yachts from St Katharine Docks {{on the north side of}} the river opposite Shad Thames.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sites of}} Dreaming {{significance}} are located along the River Murray. Near {{the confluence of}} the Murray River with Lake Alexandrina is Murungun (Mason's Hill), home to a bunyip called Muldjewangk. An ancestral hero named Ngurunderi chased an enormous Murray cod named Ponde from a river in central New South Wales, creating the River Murray from its attempts to escape Kauwira (Mannum) is where Ngurunderi forced Ponde to turn sharply south. The straight <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> to Peindjalong (near Tailem Bend) resulted from Ponde fleeing in fear after being speared in the tail. The twin peaks, large permanent sandhills of Mount Misery on the eastern shore of Lake Alexandrina are known as Lalangenggul or Lalanganggel (Two watercraft) and represent where Ngurunderi brought his rafts ashore to make camp. Ngurunderi cut up Ponde, throwing the pieces into the water, where each piece became a species of fish.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons the Mormons were able to colonize Arizona was the {{existence}} of Jacob Hamblin's ferry across the Colorado at Lee's Ferry (then known as Pahreah Crossing), which began running in March 1864. This location was the only <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> for hundreds of miles in both directions where the canyon walls dropped away, allowing {{for the development of a}} transport route. John Doyle Lee established a more permanent ferry system at the site in 1870. One reason Lee chose to run the ferry was to flee from Mormon leaders who held him responsible for the Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by a local militia disguised as Native Americans. Even though it was located along a major travel route, Lee's Ferry was very isolated, and there Lee and his family established the aptly named Lonely Dell Ranch. In 1928, the ferry sank, resulting in the deaths of three men. Later that year, the Navajo Bridge was completed at a point [...] downstream, rendering the ferry obsolete.|$|E

On April 9, 2014, MLB announced that a new annual award for relief pitchers, the Reliever of the Year Award, would replace the existing Delivery Man of the Year Award, and that the AL honor would be named after Rivera. The following month, a <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>River</b> Avenue bordering Yankee Stadium at 161st Street was renamed [...] "Rivera Avenue" [...] in the pitcher's honor. This coincided with the release of his autobiography, The Closer: My Story, co-authored with Wayne Coffey. New York University bestowed an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon Rivera during its commencement ceremony at Yankee Stadium on May 21, 2014. During the 2015 Little League World Series, he was inducted into the Little League Hall of Excellence. The Yankees dedicated a plaque to Rivera in Yankee Stadium's Monument Park on August 14, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|The first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>River</b> Road to be paved {{was from}} the District of Columbia {{boundary}} west to Wilson Lane at the hamlet of Cohasset. Montgomery County applied for state aid for the road by 1910; it was built as a [...] macadam road by 1915. A second section of macadam road was built from Bradley Lane to a point just west of Potomac by 1923. The western section was extended as a concrete road from Potomac to near Piney Meetinghouse Road in 1925 and 1926. A third segment of MD 190 was built as a concrete road from Cabin John Creek to Booze Creek in 1928. The original extent of the state highway was finished when the gaps in the highway between Bradley Lane and Wilson Lane were filled with macadam roadway by 1930. MD 190 was extended west from Piney Meetinghouse Road to Travilah Road, which was then MD 421, in 1950. River Road from MD 421 to MD 112 was completely reconstructed as a federal aid project for Montgomery County between 1954 and 1956. This improved road was brought into the state system as the westernmost portion of MD 190 in 1974. MD 190 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from {{just west of the}} I-495 interchange east to the Georgetown Branch railroad crossing in 1963, the same year the highway's interchange with I-495 opened. The Capital Crescent Trail's bridge across MD 190 was completed in 1996.|$|E
