5|$|The Union Bank of Switzerland {{emerged in}} 1912 when the Bank in Winterthur fused with the Toggenburger Bank. The Bank in Winterthur, founded in 1862 {{with an initial}} <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of CHF 5million, focused on {{providing}} financing for industry and other companies, and had profited considerably from its close railroad connections and large warehousing facilities during the American Civil War when cotton prices rose dramatically. The Toggenburger Bank was founded in 1863 with an initial <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of CHF 1.5million, and specialized as a savings and mortgage bank for individual customers, maintaining a branch office network in eastern Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary <b>share</b> <b>capital.</b> The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Sanpaolo IMI {{acquired}} the bank minority rights {{to serve as}} a strategic partner. Banca CR Firenze also acquired a minority interests on the bank.

50|$|The {{preferred}} and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of {{the split}} corporation are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, {{each pair of}} preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued preferred <b>shares</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> (e.g., one preferred share for every two <b>capital</b> <b>shares)</b> would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the preferred shares {{at the cost of}} making the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|R

The Royal Bank of Scotland Group is now the ultimate holding company of both banks. At that time the entire issued <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of Lombard North Central Plc was transferred by the bank to the holding company. Ownership of National Westminster Home Loans Limited was passed to the holding company in December 2005; the mortgage portfolio and related funding were transferred back to NatWest in October 2012. In December 2000 the bank transferred National Westminster Life Assurance Limited to RBS Life Investments Limited, effectively establishing the business as {{a joint venture between}} the Group and Norwich Union.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{empirical}} studies on economics {{rely on the}} assumption of constant <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> of income both at the aggregate level and at the sector level. However, there is no empirical evidence supporting the constancy of <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> at the sector level. In this paper, using Colombian data, we measure <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> for 48 sectors during the period 1990 - 2005. We also explore the relation between <b>capital's</b> <b>share</b> and factor prices and the behavior of <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> during the business cycle. The main results are the following: (i) <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> is not constant but, rather, has an increasing trend; (ii) <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> growth rates positively correlate with sector value-added growth; (iii) the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> behave pro-cyclically; and (iv) {{there is a positive}} correlation between <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> and real wages and a negative correlation between <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> and interest rates. These results suggest that the usual assumption of constant factor shares is not accurate...|$|R

5|$|Public {{debate about}} {{constructing}} a railway from Lillesand {{up the valley}} following the river Tovdalselva started in the mid-1880s. At the time, lumber was being floated down the river, but low levels of water was causing irregular operations and the piling of lumber in Flaksvand. In 1889, the government for received an application for a concession. Costs were estimated at NOK462,000 and the line {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway on 22 June 1891. At the same time, the line received a state funding of NOK200,000. Half of this was <b>share</b> <b>capital,</b> the other half was a subsidy. Aust-Agder County Municipality also gave a grant of NOK20,000, and bought shares for the same amount. Of the <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of NOK417,350, NOK850 was from private investors and the rest from municipalities. The largest owner was Lillesand Municipality, who bought shares for NOK181,000.

50|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are borrowing money from the holders of the preferred shares at the dividend rate of the preferred shares, and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of <b>shares.</b> <b>Capital</b> gains (or losses) are amplified in the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> because the value of the preferred shares is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> Holders of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the holders of the preferred shares in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} in economics use multi-sector {{versions of the}} growth model. In this paper, we measure the income <b>shares</b> of <b>capital</b> and labor at the sectoral level for the U. S. economy. We also decompose the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> into the income shares of land, structures, and equipment. We find that the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> differ across sectors. For example, the <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> of agriculture is more than two times that of construction and more than 50 % larger {{than that of the}} aggregate economy. Moreover, agriculture has by far the largest land share, which mostly explains why it has the largest <b>capital</b> <b>share.</b> Our numbers can directly be used to calibrate standard multi-sector models. Alternatively, if one wants to abstract from differences in sector <b>capital</b> <b>shares,</b> our numbers can be used to establish that this is not crucial for the results.
