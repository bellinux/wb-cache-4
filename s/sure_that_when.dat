25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E

I gotta say that First Ladies right now don't , even though that's a tough job!" [...] In August 2014, Bush and Obama appeared together at the Kennedy Center. Shortly afterward, Bush told The Washington Post that she believed Obama was ready to leave the White House.|$|E
500|$|Eric Crookshank, {{who had his}} jersey retired {{while playing}} for Halifax, said that the {{prospect}} of having the organization fold was [...] "sad." [...] He also said, [...] "If what these players are saying is true it’s very hurtful to me. It sickening to my stomach that the players say they didn't get paid or they got kicked out of their living arrangements." [...] Joey Haywood criticized the league for not having a players' union or commissioner, with [...] "owners acting like commissioners." [...] He also condemned Levingston for not standing up for his players. On May 7, Clarós issued an open letter to the City of Halifax and the fans of the Rainmen. In a paragraph about the forfeit, he wrote, [...] "At this time, we don't know what the future holds. But there is one thing we know for <b>sure.</b> <b>That</b> <b>when</b> a group of good people unite to take a stand in the name of safety, good values, people’s rights and strong principles, that this will rise above any rules or even winning." ...|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene. As the {{popularity}} of 80's pop gave way to alternative rock, Yankovic {{decided it was time}} to record a parody of the Seattle-based band's huge hit single [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic later said, [...] "I wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I came back after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn't until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender." [...] To secure permission for the parody, Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain. After learning that Nirvana was to perform on Saturday Night Live, Yankovic called up his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, who was, at the time, a regular cast member on the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was [...] "going to be a song about food". [...] Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how [...] "no one can understand [...] lyrics" [...] to the original, which Cobain thought was funny. After receiving permission, Yankovic wrote and recorded [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] on January 27, 1992.|$|E

2500|$|Like all {{his other}} films, Bhansali {{preferred}} shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, [...] "I like to construct sets and then light it up. It {{is a part}} of my story telling. My story needs a setting and I like to create that ambiance." [...] Hence he chose Filmcity, Mumbai to shoot the movie. Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to [...] ".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things. So if I have benefited from this experience so much, I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> people see the film and understand the character, they will get a lot to learn".|$|E

60|$|In {{this way}} there rose some bad feeling. Lord Castlewell did {{think that there}} was {{something}} wanting {{in the manner in which}} he was treated by his bride. He was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he loved her, but he was <b>sure</b> also <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a lord marries a singing girl he ought to expect some special observance. And the fact that the singing girl's father was a Member of Parliament was much less to him than to her. He, indeed, would have been glad to have the father abolished altogether. But she had become very proud of her father since he had become a Member of Parliament. Her ideas of the British constitution were rather vague; but she thought that a Member of Parliament was at least as good as a lord who was not a peer. He had his wealth; but she was <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he was too proud to think of that.|$|R
