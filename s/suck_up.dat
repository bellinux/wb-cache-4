5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, when Homer {{collects}} {{supplies to}} protect his family and home from the marauding zombies, he decides to pursue a black sports car—which is a probe for the aliens' ship—to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. There, he finds Professor Frink, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: nuclear waste. He {{plans to use the}} alien ship's tractor beam to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> cars that are loaded with barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three more, into the aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of Foolish Earthlings.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{of female}} vampire-like beings who can detach {{parts of their}} upper body occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan manananggal ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that {{takes the form of}} an {{attractive}} girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. The tongue is used to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> blood from a sleeping victim.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> plant juices.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E

5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E
5|$|Vampires have {{appeared}} in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampire-like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo ("blood-sucker") and the Visayan Manananggal ("self-segmenter").

25|$|The {{heads of}} jewel bugs are {{triangular}} and the antennae have {{three to five}} segments. Like all heteropterans, jewel bugs are characterized by a segmented beak-like mouthpart (known as the rostrum). During feeding, jewel bugs inject proteolytic enzymes in their saliva into plants, digesting plant matter into a liquid form which they then <b>suck</b> <b>up.</b> The tarsus has three segments (tarsomeres).|$|E
25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, {{so they have a}} mouth part shaped like a short {{drinking}} straw that they use to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> the liquefied insides of their prey. However, they are able to eat their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the dewdrop spiders (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|E
50|$|Most {{heat pipes}} use a wick {{to return the}} liquid from the {{condenser}} to the evaporator, allowing the heat pipe to operate in any orientation. The liquid is <b>sucked</b> <b>up</b> back to the evaporator by capillary action, {{similar to the way}} that a sponge <b>sucks</b> <b>up</b> water when an edge is placed in contact with a pool of water. However the maximum adverse elevation (evaporator over condenser) is relatively small, on the order of 25 cm long for a typical water heat pipe.|$|R

25|$|Once the {{butterfly}} {{has emerged from}} the shell of its pupa, it hangs with its wings downward. The wings inflate, unfurl and dry into shape. Adult Boisduval's tree nymphs usually keep to semi-shaded areas provided by trees. They often sit head downwards on the stems or larger branches of trees, usually with the wings held closed. The adults feed on fermented fruit and on tree sap, and the males are known to land on damp patches of ground to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> moisture.|$|E
25|$|Chiggers {{attach to}} the host, pierce the skin, inject enzymes into the bite wound that digest {{cellular}} contents, and then <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> the digested tissue through a tube formed by hardened skin cells called a stylostome. They do not burrow into the skin or suck blood, as is commonly assumed. Itching from a chigger bite may not develop until 24–48 hours after the bite, so the victim may not associate the specific exposure with the bite itself. The red welt/bump on the skin is not where a chigger laid eggs, as is sometimes believed. The larva remains attached to a suitable host for {{three to five days}} before dropping off to begin its nymphal stage. They tend to attach where clothing have restrictions, such as belt lines, or behind the knees when wearing jeans.|$|E

25|$|Mouthparts {{can have}} {{multiple}} functions. Some insects combine piercing parts along with sponging ones {{which are then}} used to pierce through tissues of plants and animals. Female mosquitoes feed on blood (hemophagous) making them disease vectors. The mosquito mouthparts consist of the proboscis, paired mandibles and maxillae. The maxillae form needle-like structures, called stylets, which are enclosed by the labium. When mosquito bites, maxillae penetrate the skin and anchor the mouthparts, thus allowing other parts to be inserted. The sheath-like labium slides back, and the remaining mouthparts pass through its tip and into the tissue. Then, through the hypopharynx, the mosquito injects saliva, which contains anticoagulants to stop the blood from clotting. And finally, the labrum (upper lip) is used to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> the blood. Species of the genus Anopheles are characterized by their long palpi (two parts with widening end), almost reaching the end of labrum.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum cleaner}} uses a partial vacuum to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|E
25|$|Foraging on {{the seabed}} {{typically}} {{takes place at}} depths between 20 and 40 m, although they can dive to depths of 700 m in search of food. Their flexible necks provide {{a wide range of}} movement while they are searching for food on the ocean floor. Some animals have been observed to <b>suck</b> <b>up</b> water and then forcefully expel it to uncover their prey hidden in the silt on the seabed. As their teeth are neither large nor sharp, belugas must use suction to bring their prey into their mouths; it also means their prey has to be consumed whole, which in turn means it cannot be too large or the belugas run the risk of it getting stuck in their throats. They also join together into coordinated groups of five or more to feed on shoals of fish by steering the fish into shallow water, where the belugas then attack them. For example, in the estuary of the Amur River, where they mainly feed on salmon, groups of six or eight individuals join together to surround a shoal of fish and prevent their escape. Individuals then take turns feeding on the fish.|$|E
