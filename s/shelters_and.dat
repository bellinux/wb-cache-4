Authorities in Martinique canceled {{a memorial to}} the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters. In Dominica, tourists were evacuated to concrete <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> the vast majority of foreign medical students from the Ross University School of Medicine evacuated the island. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. Martinique's main airport and both of St. Lucia's commercial airports closed when the last airplanes landed on the night of August 16 and the storm's outer rainbands began to sweep over the island.|$|E

Roughly 50,000 people {{evacuated}} to storm <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> thousands of others sought refuge in public buildings, such as schools and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guamúchil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents.|$|E

25|$|Many coastal juveniles use seaweed for the <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> {{the food}} that is {{available}} from invertebrates and other fish associated with it. Drifting seaweed, particularly the pelagic Sargassum, provide a niche habitat with its own <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> food, and even supports its own unique fauna, such as the sargassum fish. One study, off Florida, found 54 species from 23 families living in flotsam from Sargassum mats. Jellyfish are also used by juvenile fish for <b>shelter</b> <b>and</b> food, even though jellyfish may prey on small fish.|$|R
5|$|Over 50 {{temporary}} shelters {{were made}} available in flood-prone areas across various municipalities in Veracruz. Authorities in Tamaulipas prepared five <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> mobilized of 10emergency teams to evacuate up to 20,000 people {{in anticipation of}} adverse weather conditions. In Hidalgo, 250shelters were opened and emergency workers were dispatched as a safety measure. At the risk of flash flooding, public storm shelters were made available in parts of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as <b>shelters,</b> <b>and</b> were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E

5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent them from being used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus <b>shelters,</b> <b>and</b> 5 public information boards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail <b>shelters,</b> <b>and</b> foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E

5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof <b>shelters,</b> <b>and</b> base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
5|$|Authorities in El Salvador {{declared}} a national state of alert {{in response to}} the potential threat from the hurricane. Residents in flood-prone areas were warned of potential flash flooding. As the hurricane turned sharply to the northwest, there are no reports of damage or deaths from Pauline in the country. Officials in Puerto Madero closed port facilities to all ships, excluding ships in open seas seeking shelter. The government ultimately closed six major ports between Acapulco and Puerto Madero. State authorities in Oaxaca opened 75emergency <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> prepared 50schools to house 10,000people.|$|E
5|$|Florida Governor Jeb Bush {{issued a}} state of {{emergency}} two days before the storm's final landfall. Recovery teams were also deployed for the area.

Walton County officials issued a voluntary evacuation for low line areas and mobile homes. Walton County also opened a shelter in Freeport, and four <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> one special needs shelter were opened in Escambia County.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, the Red Cross and World Food Council (UNDRO) set up <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> began {{assisting}} {{residents in}} need of food and shelter. Several thousand residents were provided food, clothing and shelter {{across the country in}} mass-feeding shelters. The UNDRO also contributed $461,000 in funds to the Philippines. Another $46,000 was provided by the Government of Norway and the Catholic Relief Services donated $50,000. The Government of Japan provided $300,000 and the Government of the United States donated $25,000 in response to the overall effects of Elsie and the three preceding storms. Two other non-governmental organizations, the Lutheran World Federation and World Council of Churches allocated $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center began {{issuing a}} Hurricane Watch for the Big Island of Hawaii on August 31 at 0000 UTC; the {{following}} day the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) issued a tropical storm warning at 0300 UTC and a flash flood watch. The watches and warnings prompted residents to board up windows and stock up on emergency supplies. The storm's approach also closed down beaches and prompted officials to cancel outdoor activates as a precaution and the American Red Cross opened <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> provided emergency services. The preparations for Hurricane Jimena cost the American Red Cross $5,000 (2003 USD).|$|E
5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their <b>shelters</b> <b>and</b> explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
