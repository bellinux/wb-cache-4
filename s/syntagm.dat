40|$|The present work {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with the syntactic structures of the predicative-based <b>syntagms</b> in I 4 amali Arabic. The constituents within these <b>syntagms</b> are further analysed until the relations between pleremes (i. E. the minimal syntactic entities) are arrived at. It also offers description of similar structures in English, and brief comparisons between the structures of the two languages in question. Linguistic description {{has been defined as}} "the application of a particular linguistic theory to a selected field of linguistic phenomena". (Mulder 1975). The theory applied in this work, to both English and Kamali Arabic, is Mulders axiomatic functionalist approach to syntax. This thesis falls into four parts. The first part is divided into two chapters the first of which offers a brief introduction to the basic principles of axiomatic functionalism, and to the relations between linguistic theory, linguistic descriptions and the speech phenomena; and the second provides explanations to the essential notions in syntax. The second part, dealing with syntactic relations in Kamali Arabic, comprises three chapters. Chapter I is {{concerned with the}} verbal, and non-verbal, predicative-based <b>syntagms,</b> chapter II with the functional <b>syntagms,</b> and chapter III with the nominal <b>syntagms.</b> The third part, dealing with syntactic relations in English, comprises four chapters. Chapter I deals with the verbal predicative-based <b>syntagms,</b> chapter II With the copulative predicative, III with functionals, and IV with nominals.

50|$|The semiological {{theory of}} <b>syntagm</b> and {{paradigm}} (originally formulated by Ferdinand de Saussure and later worked on by Roland Barthes) helps {{to define the}} relationship between the database-narrative opposition. In this theory the <b>syntagm</b> is a linear stringing together of elements while at the paradigmatic each new element is chosen from a set of other related elements. In this case, the elements in <b>syntagm</b> dimensions are related in praesentia: it is the flow of words we hear, or the shots we see. On a paradigmatic dimension the elements are related in absentia: they exist in our minds or stuffed away in a database. To quote Manovich: “the database of choices from which narrative is constructed (the paradigm) is implicit; while the actual narrative (the <b>syntagm)</b> is explicit”.In New Media projects, this is reversed according to Manovich. The paradigmatic database is tangible, while the syntacmatic narrative is virtual.|$|E

5000|$|While some Soviet {{linguists}} {{continued to}} deny {{the existence of a}} distinct Moldovan language, a new generation of Soviet linguists revived the debate in the 1970s. For example, one linguist, Iliasenco, compared the Romanian and Moldovan translations of a Leonid Brezhnev speech from Russian and used them as a proof for the existence of two different languages. Mikhail Bruchis analysed this claim, and noticed that all the words of both translations are found in both dictionaries. Also, Iliasenco implied that [...] "Moldovan" [...] preferred synthetic <b>syntagms,</b> while [...] "Romanian" [...] preferred analytic ones. However, this claim was also proven wrong, as a book of Nicolae Ceauşescu (the political leader of Romania at the time) uses mostly [...] "Moldovan" [...] synthetic <b>syntagms,</b> while a book by Ivan Bodiul (the secretary of the Moldavian SSR) uses mostly [...] "Romanian" [...] analytic <b>syntagms.</b> Bruchis' conclusion was that both translations were within the limits of the Romanian language.|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between syntagmatic compounds {{of the type}} N Prep N, such as Fr. jouet d?enfant, and nominal <b>syntagms</b> of the type N Prep N, such as the partially equivalent Fr. jouet pour enfants, remains unclear and vague. This is mainly because the lexical and syntactic status of syntagmatic compounds still is controversial. In some cases, as in jouet d?enfant and jouet pour enfants, partial equivalent syntagmatic compounds and nominal <b>syntagms</b> may coexist and underlie a specific variation and alternation. In other cases, such as Pt. bracelete de aço and bracelete em aço, two variants of a syntagmatic compound may alternate and coexist. The {{first part of this}} paper provides an overview of the current discussion on these two types of constructions. The second part addresses the alternation and variation of syntagmatic compounds and nominal <b>syntagms</b> by means of analysis of large-scale corpus data, the French, Spanish and Portuguese corpus of the TenTen family. Here, the focus lies on the variation of the prepositional internal element of these constructions as well as on a comparison of different word formation patterns...|$|R
50|$|This {{understanding}} {{leads to}} the opportunity to consider the linguistics of texts and language in a wider variety ways.

From this understanding {{it is possible to}} consider the structure of texts, film and television being an ideal example.|$|E
50|$|In semiotics, {{the sign}} is the {{fundamental}} building block out of which all meaning is constructed and transmitted. Meaning is encoded by the sender of the message and decoded by the receiver recalling past experience and placing the message in its appropriate cultural context. Individual signs can be collected together to form more complex signs, i.e. building up from linguistics, groups of sounds (and the letters to represent them) form words, groups of words form sentences, sentences form narratives, etc. The constructed signs are called syntagms (see syntagmatic structure) and each collection may be a paradigm. Thus, in the English language, the alphabet is the paradigm from which the syntagms of English words are formed. The set of English words collected together in a lexicon become the paradigm from which sentences are formed, etc. Hence, paradigmatic analysis is a method for exploring a <b>syntagm</b> by identifying its constituent paradigm, studying the individual paradigmatic elements, and then reconstructing {{the process by which}} the <b>syntagm</b> takes on meaning.|$|E

50|$|Semiotics {{in popular}} music, or mesomusica, is {{different}} from semiotics in other musical forms, because pop music denotes a cultural object. (Matusitz, 2004). Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the “logical expression” of feelings, a “symbolic form”. Music videos are an example of <b>syntagm,</b> which interacting signifiers form a meaningful whole. Music videos are also considered multimodal genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning. The process of music correlated with visuals {{can be described in}} terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal synchronicity and cross-modal homology. Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified <b>syntagm.</b> Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the semantic content of the lyrics. Semiotics in music videos {{is different from}} a pragmatic analysis because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in.|$|E

50|$|The {{division}} of the stream of speech into meaningful morphemes plus their further subdivision into meaningless elements {{is known as the}} double articulation. This duality of patterning of language {{is one of the few}} facts of language which most schools of linguistics can agree on. Occasionally, two morphemes can combine in an arbitrary way into a new morpheme, as in double names such as Mary-Alice, John-Paul, and Sarah-Jean, creating a kind of triple articulation. English speakers recognize Mary and Alice as parts of the name Mary-Alice, yet they understand that a woman of that name is in no way a combination of two other women. But neither are double given names typical of English, nor are surnames meaningless, since surnames usually identify a family relationship. As far as the combination of meaningful elements is concerned, there is much less agreement on what constitutes a <b>syntagm</b> (e.g. foot-ball, I-am) and whether any such syntax is universal.|$|E

This integrative scale allows hypothesizing that indexing à propos de X against the remaining proposition gives this <b>syntagm</b> a textual function as it provides an interpretative background for the proposition. Within the sentence, analysis suggests it is difficult to index à propos de X. However, analysis also shows that indexing à propos de X is possible when providing sentences, where à propos de X is integrated, with a context and when indexing this <b>syntagm.</b> A textual perspective modifies the grammatical judgments made in the sentence, makes the examples sufficient and also underlines that the maker of thematization à propos de X is potentially integrative and oppositive. The detachment of à propos de X does not mean however that the <b>syntagm</b> is systematically a thematic introducer.

40|$|Basing {{her study}} on Bernardo Albanese’s {{interpretation}} of the <b>syntagm</b> ‘proletario iam civi’ – which is uphold as the original content of XII Tab. 1. 4 – the author intends to take to heart the results gained by the Scholar from Palermo, who acknowledged an early link between proletarius and prolis, and a primary meaning of prolis {{closely related to the}} idea of belonging to civitas. Hence, the author proposes to resurvey the literary and legal tradition that coupled proletarius and prolis, by considering the {{interpretation of the}} Festus’s lemma proletarium. Such interpretation is the effective evidence of a long-lasting tradition that, undeniably stemming from the decemviral precept that embodied the <b>syntagm</b> proletarius iam civis, joined proletarii with prolis and progenies as suitable terms for showing the legal condition which is also represented through other terms such as suboles, liberi and filii familias. Therefore, the relation between the terms proletarius and prolis would have been built because of their mutual suitability for expressing the idea of ‘belonging to a community’. In conclusion, the author proposes that Cic., leg. 3. 7, where the <b>syntagm</b> ‘problem discribunto’ is comprised, should be attributed to such a tradition as well...|$|E
