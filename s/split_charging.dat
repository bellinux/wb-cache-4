However, {{there is no consensus}} on a generic set of optimal parameters, even when one only considers parameters calibrated against atomic charges in organic molecules. In this work, the origin of the disagreement in the parameters is investigated by comparing and analyzing six sets of parameters based on two sets of molecules and three calibration procedures. The resulting statistical analysis clearly indicates that the conventional least-squares cost function based solely on atomic charges is in general ill-conditioned and not capable of fixing all parameters in a charge-equilibration model. Methodological guidelines are formulated to improve the stability of the parameters. Although in this case a simple interpretation of individual parameters is not possible, charge equilibration models remain of great practical use for the computation of atomic charges...|$|R

40|$|Calculating the Coulomb {{forces in}} Molecular Dynamics (MD), the {{effective}} atomic charge on each atom must be known accurately. While {{there are several}} approaches (QE, AACT) for this task, they each have shortcomings. <b>Split</b> <b>Charge</b> Equilibration (SQE) is a method combining the beneficial aspects of both QE and AACT, while avoiding their deficiencies, such as predicting a wrong charge distribution among dissociation of dimers. To date, partial atomic charges are either assumed constant or assigned according to minimization principles that are smooth and unique functions of the instantaneous atomic coordinates. Thus, charge-transfer history effects cannot be accounted for. Such occur for instance during contact-induced charge transfer between two solid bodies. In particular, redox reactions involve a quasi-discontinuous change of the electronic state, without significant atomic rearrangement. RedoxSQE, an extension to SQE, assigns discrete oxidation states to each atom. This enables us to model redox reactions. This talk will show proof-of-concept applications, including a complete atomistic nano battery, which self-consistently shows many generic properties of macroscopic batteries. Among other applications, redoxSQE can help {{to better understand the}} processes happening at the electrode-electrolyte interface of a real battery...|$|R
40|$|Force fields uniquely assign {{interatomic}} {{forces for}} a given set of atomic coordinates. The underlying assumption is that electrons are in their quantum-mechanical ground state or in thermal equilibrium. However, there is an abundance of cases where this is unjustified because the system is only locally in equilibrium. In particular, the fractional charges of atoms, clusters, or solids tend to not only depend on atomic positions but also on how the system reached its state. For example, the charge of an isolated solid [...] and thus the forces between atoms in that solid [...] usually depends on the counterbody with which it has last formed contact. Similarly, the charge of an atom, resulting from the dissociation of a molecule, can differ for different solvents in which the dissociation took place. In this paper we demonstrate that such charge-transfer history effects can {{be accounted for by}} assigning discrete oxidation states to atoms. With our method, an atom can donate an integer charge to another, nearby atom to change its oxidation state as in a redox reaction. In addition to integer charges, atoms can exchange "partial charges" which are determined with the <b>split</b> <b>charge</b> equilibration method. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} the spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction on the directed flow of charged pions. For intermediate centrality Au+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 7. 7 GeV, we demonstrate that the electromagnetic interaction between spectator charges and final state pions results in <b>charge</b> <b>splitting</b> of positive and negative pion directed flow. Such a <b>charge</b> <b>splitting</b> is visible in the experimental data reported by the STAR Collaboration. The magnitude of this <b>charge</b> <b>splitting</b> appears to strongly depend on the actual distance between the pion emission site (pion at freeze-out) and the spectator system. As such, the above electromagnetic effect brings new, independent information on the space-time evolution of pion production in heavy ion collisions. From the comparison of our present analysis to our earlier studies made for pions produced at higher rapidity, we formulate conclusions on the rapidity dependence of the distance between the pion emission site and the spectator system. This distance appears to decrease with increasing pion rapidity, reflecting the longitudinal expansion of the strongly-interacting system responsible for pion emission. Thus for the first time, information on the space-time characteristics of the system is being provided by means of the spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction. The above electromagnetic effect being in fact a straight-forward consequence of the presence of spectator charges in the collision, we consider that it should be considered as a baseline for studies of other phenomena, like those related to the electric conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma.
