German engineer Philip Deidesheimer created a timbering system for mining tunnels called square sets, which enabled the retrieval of huge amounts of silver ore in a safe manner.

5000|$|A tie pin (or tiepin, {{also known}} as a stick pin/stickpin) is a neckwear-controlling device, {{originally}} worn by wealthy English gentlemen to secure the folds of their cravats. They were first popularized {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. Cravats were made of silk, satin, lace and lightly starched cambric, lawn and muslin, and stickpins were necessary accoutrements to keep these expensive fabrics in place and safe. Stickpins commonly used pearls and other precious gemstones set in gold or other precious metals and were designed specifically for their owners. By the 1860s, wearing cravats had been embraced by the English upper middle classes with a consequently lower quality of materials and designs used in both the neckwear and in the stickpins used to keep it in place. By the 1870s Americans had embraced stickpins and designs were mass-produced and included animal heads, horse shoes, knife and fork motifs, crossed pipes, wishbones, bugs, flowers, shields and a host of other figural motifs. By the 1890s stickpins had crossed gender lines as women began wearing them with sporting outfits worn for bicycling, boating, riding, tennis and golf. The Ascot, Four in Hand, Sailor scarf, cravat bow tie and wrapped scarf all became popular for both men and women, and all could be set off with an [...] stickpin. Between 1894 and 1930 many patents were issued covering such issues as prong setting, ornament attachment, stickpin blanks, <b>safety</b> <b>clutches,</b> guards and decorations. One patent was for a brooch which could convert the center medallion to a stickpin. Another concealed a small lead pencil point attached to the shaft of the pin. Still another included a small water reservoir behind the ornamental head of the stick pin in which a flower blossom could be placed. Patent 1,301,568 dated April 22, 1919 was for a luminous stickpin with a star motif disk-like head which held a small drop of radioactive material.|$|R

40|$|In this Master degree {{work there}} is a {{description}} of a <b>safety</b> <b>clutch</b> of a perforator with SDS + chuck. Perforrator‘s main purpose is to drill holes in concrete, metal and wood. <b>Safety</b> <b>clutch</b> purpose is to ensure safety of electrical engine from overworking, which occurs in drilling with drill bit or crown. <b>Safety</b> <b>clutch</b> starts working when electrical engines spins pinion which is placed on cylinder. Pinion is being presseed by the spring to the cylinder‘s knuckles. Drill bit is being placed in the cylinder and when drill bit stucks or if there‘s too high resistance, knuckle goes up and overcomes spings tensile strength – pinion‘s and cylinders knuckles excel. When <b>safety</b> <b>clutch</b> starts working, pinions slide at each other and as friction exists safety clutch‘s pinions worn out. Changing worned out pinions is not complicated, but price of repair takes up to 50 % of a new perforator price.

5000|$|Mechanical punch presses {{fall into}} two {{distinct}} types, {{depending on the type}} of clutch or braking system with which they are equipped. Generally older presses are [...] "full revolution" [...] presses that require a full revolution of the crankshaft for them to come to a stop. Full revolution clutch presses are known to be dangerous and outlawed in many countries unless the pinch point is fully guarded. This is because the braking mechanism depends on a set of raised keys or [...] "dogs" [...] to fall into matching slots to stop the ram. A full revolution clutch can only bring the ram to a stop at the same location- top dead center. Newer presses are often [...] "part revolution" [...] presses equipped with braking systems identical to the brakes on commercial trucks. When air is applied, a band-type brake expands and allows the crankshaft to revolve. When the stopping mechanism is applied the air is bled, causing the clutch to open and the braking system to close, stopping the ram in any part of its rotation. Modern part revolution clutch & brake units are normally combined units that operate in a fail safe mode, a dual air <b>safety</b> valve engages <b>clutch</b> and starts slide motion and brake is applied by springs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a safety-clutch by using magnetorheological fluids (MRF) to switch the transmission torque between a motor and a generator in a bus-like vehicle. The clutch is based on a new design combining an axial MRF-actuator and a ball coupling mechanism. This so called "MRF-ball-clutch" avoids the disadvantages of traditional bell- or disc-MRF-clutch designs where the torque is transmitted by the MRF which leads to a self-heating due to the shearing forces in the fluid and a more or less significant drag torque caused by limitations of the relation between minimal and maximal transmittable torque. The <b>safety</b> <b>clutch</b> based on the new MRF-clutch design requires a minimum of power consumption and allows switching high torsional moments in a very compact, lightweight and robust design. The work was done within the Fraunhofer System Research for Electromobility FSEM, founded by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper presented here {{is to determine the}} relationships for describing the bending and torsional vibrations of long cardan drivelines and to compare the calculated results to the experimental results. The problem of the resonance of cardan shaft drivelines means a considerable difficulty in the field of designing. Dynamic modelling could solve the problem by determining the natural frequency of the system. The load is dependent on the ratio of the natural frequency to the excitation frequency. Furthermore, the dynamic model is suitable for tuning/detuning the natural frequency. The parameters of the driveline (moment of inertia, bearing stiffness, shaft length, etc.) are the input data of the simulation model developed and the effects of changes can be determined. The driveline can be designed according to the results of the simulation of a flywheel location, bearing stiffness and cardan shaft length. Location of the <b>safety</b> <b>clutch,</b> location and number of cardan shaft bearings and the stiffness of bearings can be found out by the simulation model, as well. The results of the measurements performed with a test stand proved that resonance phenomenon did not occur with the Wühlmaus 2733 potato harvester during operating conditions. Therefore, the possible breakdown of some parts of the machine was caused probably by overloading and not by resonance...|$|E
