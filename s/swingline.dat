5000|$|<b>Swingline</b> {{was founded}} in 1925 in New York City by Jack Linsky. At that time, it {{was known as the}} Parrot Speed Fastener Company and opened its first {{manufacturing}} facility in Long Island City in 1931. Eight years later the company changed its name to Speed Products and created the first top-opening stapler, allowing easy refilling of a full strip of staples. This design eventually became the industry standard. In 1956 the company was renamed <b>Swingline,</b> and in 1968 introduced the <b>Swingline</b> 747, their most popular model yet. It was then sold to American Brands in 1970, becoming a division of ACCO, under Fortune Brands, in 1987.|$|E

50|$|A {{revolving}} loan is {{a particularly}} flexible financing tool {{as it may be}} drawn by a borrower by way of straightforward loans, but it is also possible to incorporate different types of financial accommodation within it - for example, it is possible to incorporate a letter of credit, <b>swingline</b> or overdraft within the terms of a revolving credit loan.

50|$|High-rise {{housing is}} being built on a former Pepsi-Cola site on the East River. From June 2002 to September 2004, the former <b>Swingline</b> Staplers plant was the {{temporary}} headquarters of the Museum of Modern Art.

Long Island City's turn-of-the-century district of residential towers, called Queens West, is located along the East River, {{just north of the}} LIRR's Long Island City Station. Redevelopment in Queens West reflects the intent to have the area as a major residential area in New York City, with its high-rise residences very close to public transportation, making it convenient for commuters to travel to Manhattan by ferry or subway. The first tower, the 42-floor Citylights, opened in 1998 with an elementary school at the base. Others have been completed since then and more are being planned or under construction.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, the Japanese {{architect}} Yoshio Taniguchi {{beat out}} ten other international architects {{to win the}} competition to execute the redesign of the museum. MoMA's midtown location underwent extensive renovations in the early 2000s, closing on May 21, 2002, and reopening {{to the public in}} a building redesigned by Taniguchi along with Kohn Pedersen Fox, on November 20, 2004. Severud Associates was the structural engineering firm chosen for this project. From June 29, 2002, until September 27, 2004, a portion of its collection was on display in what was dubbed MoMA QNS, a former <b>Swingline</b> staple factory in Long Island City, Queens. The expansion, including an increase in MoMA’s endowment to cover operating expenses, cost $858 million in total. The project nearly doubled the space for MoMA's exhibitions and programs and features 630000 sq ft of new and redesigned space. The Peggy and David Rockefeller Building on the western portion of the site houses the main exhibition galleries, and The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building, after Lewis B. Cullman and Dorothy Cullman, on the eastern portion provides over five times more space for classrooms, auditoriums, teacher training workshops, and the museum's expanded Library and Archives. These two buildings frame the enlarged Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.|$|E
