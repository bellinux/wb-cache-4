5|$|Dhumavati's outer inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> outer illusory form from the inner reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee {{to go beyond the}} outer deceptive appearances and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
5|$|Since Norfolk {{serves as}} the {{commercial}} and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), {{it can be difficult}} to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The early chansonniers did not <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> {{works of}} the male troubadours {{from those of the}} trobairitz. It was only in later Italian and Catalan chansonniers that the {{works of the}} trobairitz were found in {{different}} sections than those of their male counterparts.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Lipadas River <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} Tagabawa and Clata territories, {{while the}} Talomo River (Ikawayanlinan) was <b>the</b> boundary <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> Tagabawas, Clatas, and Obos. <b>The</b> Davao River <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> traditional Bagobo and Clata territories.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLong and Selman (1986) proved that, {{for most}} {{familiar}} pairs of complexity classes, <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> classes with a tally oracle is no easier than truly <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> classes. Refuting a claim in the literature, we prove {{for the first}} time that for many familiar pairs of complexity classes, <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> classes with a tally oracle is easier than truly <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> classes...|$|R
50|$|The closest races were in {{the fourth}} {{district}} (where only 27 votes <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> candidates), the fifth district (23 votes <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> leading candidates, and 87 votes went to independent candidates) and the ninth where a mere 9 votes <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> candidates (46 votes having gone to the independent candidate) and a recount was conducted.|$|R
5|$|This period {{coincided with}} further {{confiscations}} {{of private property}} belonging to Armenians. Special commissions were created to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> evictions of non-Muslims from others. The investigators of this commission usually expedited the evacuation and eventual confiscation of the non-Muslim property in question.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
50|$|On {{the lateral}} {{surface of the}} human brain, <b>the</b> central sulcus <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. <b>The</b> lateral sulcus <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> frontal lobe from the {{temporal}} lobe.|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>the</b> {{vertical}} septa <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> individual muscles, transverse septa {{are given}} off {{both on the}} volar and dorsal surfaces of <b>the</b> forearm, <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> deep from the superficial layers of muscles.|$|R
30|$|The EX 1 – 4 {{simulations}} <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} individual N inputs; EX 5 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> effect of direct N input to croplands; and EX 6 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> human impacts on land systems. EX 3 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> effect of N inputs from atmospheric deposition and indirectly included anthropogenic inputs. EX 6 removed direct impacts of local human manipulations {{and showed the}} effects caused by elevated CO 2 concentration and climate change. EX 7 was conducted to quantify the impact of ignoring manure inputs, which have been inconsistently considered in terrestrial N model studies (discussed later).|$|R
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of}} the cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5000|$|In both {{left and}} right {{ventricle}} there are specific structures <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> inflow and outflow of blood. In the right ventricle, the inflow and outflow is <b>separated</b> by <b>the</b> supraventricular crest. In the left ventricle, the anterior cusp of the mitral valve is responsible for <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> flow of blood.|$|R
50|$|The Chongar Strait (Чонгарский пролив; Чонгарська протока) is a short, shallow, narrow strait <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern and}} western {{portions}} of the Syvash, the shallow lagoon system <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> Crimea from the mainland east of the Isthmus of Perekop.|$|R
50|$|The right lobe is {{functionally}} <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> left lobe by {{the middle}} hepatic vein. A common misconception is that <b>the</b> falciform ligament <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> two lobes. However, from a functional perspective (one that takes the arterial, portal venous, and systemic venous anatomy into account) <b>the</b> falciform ligament <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> medial and lateral segments of the left hepatic lobe.|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if {{a species of}} archaea exists {{in more than one}} form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes <b>separate,</b> <b>the</b> cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> cochlear duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Odontobatrachus is a genus {{of frogs}} in the {{comprising}} the family Odontobatrachidae. In a 2014 research project Barej, Rödel, Loader & Schmitz <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> genus from the established genus Petropedetes and <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> new {{family from the}} established family Petropedetidae.|$|R
50|$|This {{name comes}} from the fact that the via decumana or decimana (<b>the</b> tenth) <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Tenth Cohort from the Ninth in the legionary encampment, in the same way as <b>the</b> via quintana <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Cohort from the Sixth.|$|R
50|$|The {{saturation}} vapor {{curve is}} <b>the</b> curve <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> two-phase {{state and the}} superheated vapor state in the T-s diagram. The saturated liquid curve is <b>the</b> curve <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> subcooled liquid state and the two-phase state in the T-s diagram.|$|R
5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also {{requested}} that fences be put up {{around the perimeter of}} the pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there was an attempt to pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police stopped them.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|Carleton then {{launched}} his own offensive intended {{to reach the}} Hudson River, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to New York City. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This strategy would <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. <b>The</b> interatrial septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria and <b>the</b> interventricular septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> stylomandibular {{ligament}} <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> infratemporal region (anterior) {{from the}} parotid region (posterior), and {{runs from the}} styloid process to the angle of <b>the</b> mandible; it <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> parotid and submandibular salivary glands. It also becomes taut when the mandible is protruded.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> thin wires <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> scoring {{sections}} {{on the board}} occasionally overlap slightly, due to the manufacturing process. Any dart splitting the wires (landing in the tiny area where two wires overlap) is credited in the shooter's favor. For example, if the dart splits <b>the</b> wires <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> two and three point zones, the player is awarded three points. If the dart splits <b>the</b> wires <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> three point zone and the blue ring, the player is credited with three points.|$|R
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Further north {{along the}} Continental Divide, a short portion of the {{combined}} Continental and Laurentian divides <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie-Slave-Athabasca watershed, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a divide between streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean {{and those of the}} Hudson Bay watershed. This divide meets the Continental Divide at Snow Dome (also known as Dome), near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 she put {{her ideas}} into practice, {{establishing}} a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in Kingswood in the premises of a school which had originally been set by John Wesley. Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> sexes {{and set up a}} girls' reformatory in what is now the Red Lodge Museum in 1854, initially funded by Lady Byron.|$|E
50|$|Via a small isthmus in the east, the {{mountain}} {{is connected with}} {{the remainder of the}} large Qaarsorsuaq Island.
