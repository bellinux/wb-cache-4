In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past studies have examined the occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with <b>staggeringly</b> <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> of other mental disorders in adults. [...] The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al. (1999) also found a <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of comorbid disorders in a community-based sample of adolescents with panic attacks or juvenile panic disorder. Within the sample, adolescents were found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and specific phobia (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 youths with juvenile panic disorder were examined. Compared to non-panic anxiety disordered youths, children with panic disorder had higher rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the growing trend of cinematisation in computer and console games, where both visual styles and industrial practices are concerned. The ever-increasing runtime of cinematic cutscenes in games, and the stylization of game graphics {{in accordance with}} established film genres are of primary focus regarding the gaming industry's absorption and interpretation of cinematic visuals. Comparisons of film-game convergence {{are based on the}} proliferation of non-gameplay promotional trailers and their role in hype-generation; as well as game producer strategies of franchising, cross-promotion, and initial-sales business model. Comparison is thus accomplished with regards to a number of fundamental similarities in both industries' business and commercial tactics, as stemming from the risk and reward-based investment financing system prevalent in both industries. Finally, a selection of user and industry professional video responses to the aforementioned trends are examined, both for their value in counter-balancing the assumptions of success which often follow <b>staggeringly</b> <b>high</b> initial sales figures; and for their value in layering the depth of film-game convergence even further, as they respond to the recent, filmic trends in games using the very language of film...|$|R

Total world population reached 7 billion just after 2010 and is expected to count 9 billion by 2045. This paper first charts the differences in population growth between the world regions. Next, the mechanisms behind unprecedented population growth are explained and plausible scenarios for future developments are discussed. Crucial for the long term trend will be the rate of decline of the number of births per woman, called total fertility. Improvements in education, reproductive health and child survival will be needed to speed up the decline of total fertility, particularly in Africa. But in all scenarios, world population will continue to grow for some time due to population momentum.

Because of California’s <b>staggeringly</b> <b>high</b> growth rates, projects rejected at one location are likely to find their way to another site within the same market area. Does CEQA demand that a local government before voting to reject a project must pay attention to the likely environmental impacts of the site where the rejected (displaced) development is likely to arise? Two recently decided intermediate appellate court cases reached opposite answers to this question. This paper examines the two recent cases, Muzzy Ranch Company v.

But (as Barker suggests), the new Greek-Cretan press was not setting itself up as a competitor to the Aldine Press: the books outlined in its patent of 28 November 1498 (the Etymologicum Magnum and commentaries on Aristotle) were the only products of a short-lived endeavour which lasted from 1499 to 1500 - at just the time when the Aldine Press were taking a break from Greek printing.

40|$|The {{relapse rate}} for many {{psychiatric}} disorders is <b>staggeringly</b> <b>high,</b> indicating that treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions {{are not entirely}} effective. Therefore, in psychiatry, there is a current push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy and medication-based approaches.

Indeed, an increase in cognitive skills has been shown to have a long-lasting, positive impact on the patients' quality of life and their clinical symptoms. We hereby present four principal arguments supporting the use of event-related potentials (ERP) that are derived from electroencephalography, which allow the identification of specific neurocognitive deficiencies in patients. These arguments could assist psychiatrists in the development of individualized, targeted therapy, as well as a follow-up and rehabilitation plan specific to each patient's deficit. Furthermore, they {{can be used as a}} tool to assess the possible benefits of combination therapy, consisting of medication, psychotherapy, and "ERP-oriented cognitive rehabilitation". Using this strategy, specific cognitive interventions could be planned based on each patient's needs, for an "individualized" or "personalized" therapy, which may have the potential to reduce relapse rates for many psychiatric disorders. The implementation of such a combined approach would require intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers.
