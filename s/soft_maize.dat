40|$|The role of {{phenolic}} acids on sorghum and maize hardness {{was evaluated}} among eight cultivars {{of each of}} the cereals representing hard and soft classes. Bran and flour fractions were evaluated for monomeric and diferulic phenolic acids using high performance liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric (LC–MS/MS) techniques. Bran samples of harder grains had more phenolic acids than those of soft types. Intra-class testing showed slight differences in cultivars within the hard and soft classes. The content of phenolic acids was a useful indicator of hardness distinguishing between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>maize</b> and sorghum cultivars. Correlation coefficients between monomeric acids of maize bran, mostly ferulic acid, and grain hardness were higher than those of sorghum. Maize bran ferulic acid content was strongly correlated with Tangential Abrasive Dehulling Device (TADD) hardness (r = - 0. 776, p < 0. 001). This study is the first to show that there is a relationship between bran phenolic acid content and sorghum and maize hardness.

NIR hyperspectral images of two sets (12 and 24 kernels) of whole maize kernels were acquired using a Spectral Dimensions MatrixNIR camera with a spectral range of 960 - 1662 nm and a sisuChema SWIR (short wave infrared) hyperspectral pushbroom imaging {{system with a}} spectral range of 1000 - 2498 nm. Exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) was used on absorbance images to remove background, bad pixels and shading. On the cleaned images. PCA could be used effectively to find histological classes including glassy (hard) and floury (soft) endosperm. PCA illustrated a distinct difference between glassy and floury endosperm along principal component (PC) three on the MatrixNIR and PC two on the sisuChema with two distinguishable clusters. Subsequently partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to build a classification model. The PLS-DA model from the MatrixNIR image (12 kernels) resulted in {{root mean square error}} of prediction (RMSEP) value of 0. 18. This was repeated on the MatrixNIR image of the 24 kernels which resulted in RMSEP of 0. 18. The sisuChema image yielded RMSEP value of 0. 29.

40|$|In the {{province}} of Bolívar in the Andean region 212 farmers, six salesmen and 14 technicians, involved in maize production, were interviewed. The majority of the farmers interviewed were small-holders; 64 % of the farmers had a farm size of less than 4. 5 ha. Maize {{is the most important}} crop and is often grown in association with beans. Most maize, 96 %, is <b>soft</b> <b>maize</b> meant for human consumption. The cultivars grown are open pollinated ones. One cultivar, `Guagal', was grown extensively. A few others, among which an improved version of Guagal were of some importance. In the production of maize the farmers consider damage due to insects, wind (lodging), diseases, drought and hail, the low prices for their surplus maize and the high costs of fertilizers, chemicals, sowing seed and labour as the most important constraints. The seed for sowing the next crop mainly came from seed kept from the last harvest. Farmers indicated that they select from the harvested ears the healthy looking larger ones. Kernel type also was a selection criterion. Selection for plant type in the field was rarely done. Of the farmers 71 % stored the maize as kernels while 29 % stored the seed kept on the ears. The storage was predominantly done somewhere in the house in plastic (56 %) or cloth bags (14 %), in a pile (13 %), just on the floor (4 %) or in cans (4 %). Some farmers still had seed left from the last sowing and were willing to give a sample for testing. From 32 such samples the quality was assessed by INIAP, the Ecuadorean governmental research and breeding organisation. The samples were consistently of a low quality. Especially the vigour of the seedlings was poor and most of the seeds were infected or contaminated by fungi. In the region a few salesmen offer maize seed for sale of cultivar Guagal at prices affordable by the farmer. Of improved cultivars the prices were higher than most farmers are willing to pay. The technicians considered good seed quality and good maintenance of the cultivars effective methods in obtaining better yields.

40|$|The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has {{indicated}} that urban poverty is found primarily in squatter settlements. At present one in seven (13, 5 per cent) of all South African households live in informal settlements. The major research question is {{to what extent the}} interlocking micro-mechanisms identified by UNICEF as causes of malnutrition influence the nutrition and health of residents in an informal settlement in the Vaal Triangle. This question will be tested empirically against the UNICEF framework of immediate, underlying and basic causes of malnutrition. Pre-tested questionnaires were administered to 340 randomly selected care-givers. A previously validated quantified food frequency questionnaire was administered by trained enumerators as the test measurement, and 24 -hour recall as the reference measurement, for dietary intake and food consumption patterns. The data were statistically analysed for means and standard deviations. The great majority of the respondents (nine out of ten) live in corrugated iron shacks, and overcrowding is common; 32 per cent live in two rooms or fewer, 44 per cent in three to four rooms and 24 per cent in more than four rooms. Thirty-one per cent of the households consisted of six or more members, 19 per cent of five members, 22 per cent of four members and 28 per cent of three or fewer members. The unemployment rate was 94 per cent for respondents and 80 per cent for their partners. Two-thirds of care-givers (69 per cent) have an income below R 500 per month. The main health problems that were observed were chronic coughing (44 per cent) and headaches (54 per cent). The causes of these were not established. Diets were poor and consisted overwhelmingly of refined carbohydrates. The top 10 food items consumed were: stiff and <b>soft</b> <b>maize</b> meal porridge, brewed rooibos and leaf tea, coffee, mabela, white bread, crumbly maize porridge, carbonated cold drink and mageu. The daily intakes (mean and standard deviation) of various nutrients were: 4550 � 1993 �kJ energy, 20 � 9 �g protein, 21 � 21 �g fat and 182 � 78 �g carbohydrates. The results indicate that this is a poverty-stricken community with chronic household food insecurity and compromised nutrition. It is hoped that the knowledge gained from this survey will improve the planning and implementation of sustainable community-based interventions to promote urban household food security and combat nutrition-related diseases. ...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} (VAD) {{continues to}} be a major health problem in developing countries. In South Africa, in 1999, one out of three {{children under the age of}} six years in the country had poor/ marginal vitamin A status. Limpopo Province was one of the provinces that most seriously affected by VAD. The study aim was to explore and describe the consumption patterns of vitamin A-rich foods of 10 - 13 year old children living in a rural area in Venda, and consequently making recommendations on nutrition education in this regard. A survey was conducted in Vyeboom Village in Limpopo Province, at Makhado local municipality in the Vhembe District. About 155 school children aged 10 - 13 years (boys and girls) participated in this study, using convenience, random and stratified sampling to draw the sample from three primary schools (Avhatondwi, Tshirunzanani and Thomas Ntshavheni). Data was collected during winter of 2006 using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the 24 -hour recall and non-quantitative food-frequency questionnaires. The data was divided into four subsections regarding the 10 - 13 year old children that participated in this study, namely: the demographic information, food habits, food consumption patterns, and foods consumed rich in vitamin A. The SAS statistical analysis (version 8. 2) software was used to analyze the data from the questionnaire by means of descriptive statistics (percentages, frequencies, means and summary of the tables). Inferential statistics (two way tables and chi-square tests) were used to test the associations between two categorical variables. Mothers were the caretakers in the families, because she mostly played a major role in the decision-making, preparation and serving of the food that were consumed by these children. Social cultural factors influenced the children’s food intake, because some of these foods were especially low in vitamin A and high in sugar content (e. g. sweets), compared to those foods that children were forbidden to eat (e. g. liver) which were high in vitamin A and other nutrients. The foods that children were mostly forced to eat (dark green leafy vegetables) were very nutritious and given in order to prevent hunger and wastage (left-over in the morning). The general meal pattern of these children was three meals a day with two, one or no snacks in between meals. The mostly consumed foods during these meals were bread, tea, stiff and <b>soft</b> <b>maize</b> meal porridge, dark green leafy vegetables and meat (chicken). Dark green leafy vegetables played an important role in supplying beta-carotene to these children, while the intake of retinol-rich foods was poor because they are expensive and labeled as highly allergenic, whilst other foods were forbidden. Intake of fortified foods was very high because porridge was the staple food and commonly consumed during lunch and supper. The results provided insight regarding the food habits, consumption patterns and the intake of vitamin A rich foods and were used to substantiate recommendations aimed at the improvement of the intake vitamin A rich foods among the children.

40|$|Stress {{cracking}} due to {{high temperature}} drying has been of concern to the maize industry because {{it can lead to}} increases in broken grain and fine material during subsequent handling. In this study, several factors affecting physical characteristics of maize grain, particularly those related to stress cracking, were investigated. In the first year (1995 - 1996), the effects of several preharvest factors; hybrid, nitrogen, harvest grain moisture content, and postharvest drying factors including drying temperature and relative cooling rate on physical attributes and stress cracking in grain were investigated. Grain hardness (hard to soft endosperm ratio (H/S ratio)) was significantly affected by the interaction between hybrid and nitrogen. The effect of drying temperature and harvest moisture on drying time was dominant, while drying rate was significantly affected by hybrid and drying temperature. The effect of cooling rate on stress cracking and stress crack index (SCI) stood out among the main effects. At the lowest cooling rate of 0. 23 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, checked stress cracking (checking) was minimal, and SCI was less than 100. However, at higher cooling rates from 0. 55 to 1. 11 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, grains had more than 25 % multiple stress cracking, regardless of the levels of hybrid, nitrogen, harvest moisture and drying temperature. The predicted SCI for the three hybrids reached a maximum around at 0. 75 (°C/°C/min.) • 10 - 2, cooling rate, irrespective of levels of nitrogen and drying temperature. In the second experiment (1996 - 1997), the effects of grain hardness and morphological factors (grain size and shape) at a single grain drying rate and the development stress cracking over time were investigated. The re-parameterized Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) model successfully predicted the increasing rate (κ) and the maximum value (α) of percentage checking in various sizes, shapes and hardness of grains time after drying. From the data analysis, the maximum value of checking (α) showed a significant correlation with grain length (r = - 0. 707), thickness (r = 0. 620), roundness (r = 0. 703) and the shortest diffusion pathway (SDP; r = 0. 627). While, the increasing rate (κ) of percentage checking with time after drying was significantly correlated with grain bulk density (r = - 0. 564), hardness ratio (r = - 0. 611) and drying rate (r = 0. 551), {{and to a lesser extent}} (r > 0. 35), with the grain size parameters including hundred-grain weight, grain length, and width. Based on this result, it was suggested that removing small and rounded grains could reduce checked stress cracking by up to 40 to 50 % in some dent maize hybrids. In addition, the standardized multiple regression for single grain drying rate according to H/S ratio and grain weight accounted for from 65 to 74 % of the variation. Tempering grain at high temperatures reduced stress-cracked grains significantly. However, the effect of tempering on stress cracking in the hard grain hybrid was small. In the 1997 - 1998 experiment, a breakage tester (HT-I drop tester) was developed and single grain breakage at various grain temperatures and times after drying was determined. Both hard and <b>soft</b> <b>maize</b> hybrids had minimal breakage at high grain temperatures (78 to 110 °C), while decreasing grain temperature increased breakage exponentially. This indicated that grain temperature should be considered as a co-factor for measuring grain breakage. After drying at both 60 °C and 120 °C, the percentage breakage measured at ambient temperature increased rapidly during cooling in air at an ambient temperature of 20 °C and a relative humidity around 65 - 70 %. Breakage reached a maximum after about 10 minutes from the start of cooling. A Mitscherlich function was used to describe the chronological development of percent grain breakage and the analysis of the function parameters for the extent (maximum) and rate of breakage indicated that there was a significant interaction between hybrid and drying temperature for the development of grain breakage after drying. In conclusion, the MMF and Mitscherlich models described stress cracking and grain breakage during drying and cooling of maize grain. These studies provide valuable information to grain industries to assist with minimizing grain damage during drying...|$|E
40|$|Cropping system {{models are}} {{powerful}} tools for regional impact assessment, but their input data requirements for large heterogeneous areas {{are difficult to}} fulfil. Hence, the objectives of this paper are to present low-data approaches for specifying detailed management data required by cropping system models, and for calibrating default crop parameters applied to 12 regions in the European Union (EU). Various downscaling and upscaling procedures for different data types are applied to address both objectives. The Agricultural Production and Externalities Simulator (APES) model is used for illustrative purposes. Combining easy-to-collect regional crop management information and expert knowledge enables to develop generic, expert-based rules for specifying crop management. Effects of these expert-based management rules on simulated yields and nitrogen leaching are illustrated using APES. Simulated yields of grain <b>maize,</b> <b>soft</b> wheat and durum wheat using default crop parameters for phenology are compared with crop yields observed in 12 EU regions. The accuracy of the simulated yields was variable, but generally poor. A regional calibration factor Kpheno is developed based on the temperature sum of the average sowing and harvest dates of the three crops in each region. Applying this calibration factor improved the simulated yields in all cases.

This poster presents the baseline and the scenario results for several key agricultural products of Romania's model developed as part of AGMEMOD model. The model is an econometric, dynamic, multi-product partial equilibrium comodity model. The target of this approach is to evaluate the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms upon the country's agricultural sector in perspective of its accession to the EU. The selected commodities are: <b>soft</b> wheat, barley, <b>maize</b> and sunflower. The baseline scenario depicts the results of the agricultural sector in Romania if the country would not join the EU and would continue with its own agricultural policy as applied until now. The main conclusion coming from the analysis of the baseline scenario is that rather few significant changes in the Romanian agricultural production would have occurred, such as mod est positive evolution of production and consumption for wheat and sunflower, and some stagnation in barley and maize. The Accession scenario of the model indicates a significant positive effect upon the wheat, maize and sunflower production. Together with a moderate increase in the consumption, overall some surpluses for export would be available, modest for maize, but significant for sunflower.

The final image size was 570 × 219 pixels in 239 wavelength bands from 1000 to 2498 nm {{in steps of}} approximately 6. 5 nm. Multivariate image cleaning {{was used to remove}} background and optical errors, in which about two-thirds of all pixels were removed. The cleaned image was used to calculate a principal component analysis (PCA) model after multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and mean-centering were applied. It was possible to find clusters representing vitreous and floury endosperm (different types of endosperm present in varying ratios in hard and soft kernels) as well as a third type of endosperm by interactively delineating polygon based clusters in the score plot of the second and fourth principal components and projecting the results on the image space. Chemical interpretation of the loading line plots shows the effect of starch density and the protein matrix. The vitreous and floury endosperm clusters were used to make a partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model, using four components, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) for the y data (kernel hardness category) for the training set of over 85 %. This PLS-DA model could be used for prediction in a test set. We show how the prediction images can be interpreted, thus confirming the validity of the PCA classification.

40|$|Based on the {{hypothesis}} of “diversity”, SOLIBAM has designed and tested innovative strategies to develop specific and novel breeding approaches integrated with management practices to improve the performance, quality, sustainability and stability of crops adapted to organic and low-input systems. The SOLIBAM project {{has been carried out}} by 23 partners, representing 12 countries in Europe and Africa, {{within the context of a}} lack of adapted varieties specifically for organic and low input agriculture. A fundamental characteristic of these farming approaches is a wide range of variability within the farming system, combined with a wide range of environmental variation. Having a choice of adapted plants and practices is the only means to build a sustainable farmingsystem which is characterized by a complexity of interactions. As a basis the team - representing several kinds of actors, researchers, seed companies, farmer’s organisations and also involving end-users and consumers - therefore developed tools and methodologies to better understand and manage complexity. From more than 50 field experiments and case studies in 4 countries and 8 major crop models (durum and <b>soft</b> wheat, barley, <b>maize,</b> faba beans, bean, tomato and broccoli), combined with several competencies including genetics, plant breeding, agronomy, ecology, food science, statistics, sociology and economics, SOLIBAM has established 10 major concepts for cultivating diversity (resilience, robustness, functional biodiversity, yield stability, adaptability, intercropping, sustainability, evolutionary processes, organoleptic quality, participatory research), building strongtransdisciplinarity in a dynamic process of knowledge integration. Within SOLIBAM, plant diversity was observed, analysed, developed and enhanced by the creation of new populations and varieties exploited for novel crop management practices. Genetic structure, observed by relevant markers, of the different types of varieties and populations studied strongly reflected the selection / conservation history of the populations showing, in many cases, significant and rapid differentiation due to cultivation in contrasting agro-climatic conditions and to farmers’ breeding practices or breeding. In addition to activities devoted to field and crop studies, the overallfarm system has been assessed at three system levels: the cropping system, the farm and the chain from breeder to farmer (plant breeding and legal aspects) and to consumer (the food supply system). There was a specific focus on resource use efficiency, environmental impacts and socio-economic assessments in case studies from the UK, France, Italy and Portugal. Part of SOLIBAMs research was participatory in nature, based on the experience and skills of a number of partners to improve knowledge sharing and to involve several kinds of actor and their activities. In a number of cases, the transdisciplinarity within SOLIBAM has allowed links to bemade between scientific knowledge and practitioner ‘know-how’ in complementary ways. SOLIBAM has developed various agro-ecological innovations which are at the core of its strategies: - new approaches to plant breeding and development which simultaneously consider diversity and quality, performance and stability, co-breeding for intercropping, or crop-pollinator interactions; - new food products with improved quality properties;- new tools for participatory plant breeding and management (PPBM) in which farmers, researchers and other stakeholders together designed new breeding methods for decentralized programmes, tools for resource and trial management, and for the statistical analysis of results, along with integrating methodologies to better select for flavoursome products; - social innovation and collective action for decentralised and participatory research; - new modelling tools to better understand and assess resilience, viability and sustainability of farms. In conclusion, SOLIBAM identified three key words - Diversity, Participatory Innovation and Locality/Terroir - that should be at the cornerstone of future agricultural propositions for policy makers so as to adapt the seed system, knowledge system and food system to accommodate diverse cultivated crops...|$|R
40|$|Keywords; Maize (Zea mays L), Genotypes, Grain filling, Growth temperature, Kernels, Gas production, Starch degradation, Oven-drying, Silage, Ensiling temperature, Ensiling duration, Feeding value, Lactating cows Maize (Zea mays L.) {{is a major}} {{component}} in the ration of dairy cows {{in many parts of}} the world. The currently increasing economic importance of maize has highlighted the need to determine its nutritional value, and to assess the factors influencing its nutritive value. Genotypic make-up (especially differences in starch and endosperm), growing conditions, maturity stage at harvest, and post handling processes, like oven-drying, can influence nutritive value of maize kernels. Similarly, ensiling temperature and duration can affect feeding value of maize silage. This thesis is divided into three parts; the first aim was to characterize the dry matter (starch) accumulation of maize different genotypes in different environments under controlled (glasshouse) and on different locations (sand and clay) in field conditions. Maize genotypes used were different in starch structure and composition, and in type of endosperm. Starch structure refers to amylose and amylopectin; and composition refers to their proportions, whereas type of endosperm defines levels of vitreousness. The vitreousness is the ratio of vitreous (hard) to floury (<b>soft)</b> endosperm. Six <b>maize</b> genotypes, differing in amylose content and vitreousness, were grown under three contrasting day/night temperature regimes during grain filling and harvested at different maturity stages from two greenhouse experiments. Similar investigations were carried on another set of genotypes grown on sandy and clay soils and with different sowing times under field conditions. Water contents and dry matter (starch) accumulation were significantly influenced by growth temperature, genotype, soil type and sowing time (P< 0. 0001). The second aim of thesis was to establish a relationship between rumen in vitro starch degradation (feeding value) of maize kernels and different factors, like genotype, growth temperature during grain filling, and maturity stage. Oven-dried kernels of six maize genotypes, from the two greenhouse experiments mentioned before were investigated. Starch content was measured using an enzymatic method and the gas production technique was used to assess starch degradation in rumen fluid of dairy cows. The extent of starch degradation at different incubation times was calculated from measured gas production data (6, 12 and 20 h, respectively) and a published equation. At each maturity stage, whole kernel and starch degradation in rumen fluid depended on the genotype (P< 0. 0001), growing conditions (P< 0. 0001), starch content (P< 0. 0001) and starch amount (P< 0. 0001) in the kernels. The same but fresh (not oven-dried) maize kernel samples were investigated using gas production technique to determine the impact of oven-drying on rumen in vitro starch degradation of maize kernels. Oven-drying significantly (P< 0. 0001) influenced the rumen in vitro starch degradation in maize kernels various incubation times, with more starch being degraded in the fresh than in the oven-dried maize kernels, although the differences were small. There was a consistent and highly significant (P< 0. 009 to 0. 0002) interaction between oven-drying and genotype, with the high-amylose genotype showing larger effects of oven-drying than the other genotypes. The third aim of thesis was to investigate effect of ensiling temperature and duration on feeding value of maize silage. Samples of maize whole plants (dry matter 33 %) were collected from the medium vitreous endosperm cultivar, grown in different seasons on sandy soils. Maize plants were chopped and ensiled in mini silos at three different temperatures. Samples from the silos were taken after 0 (not ensiled, i. e. control), 4, 8 and 16 weeks of ensiling. The gas production technique was used to evaluate the influence of the ensiling temperature and duration of ensiling on the degradation of the fresh ground silage samples in rumen fluid. The final pH of the silages and the gas production was significantly influenced by ensiling temperature in both seasons (P< 0. 0001). Gas production and pH decreased with an increase in ensiling duration (P< 0. 0001). The relationship between pH and gas production was quadratic and depended on the ensiling temperature (P< 0. 002). It was found that ensiling temperature and ensiling duration determine the rate of change and final pH, and play a significant role in feeding value of maize silage. The finding of thesis can be used to determine the exact feeding value of maize kernels and silage, and also can be used as a tool to revise the current feeding evaluation systems i. e. shift from oven-dried to fresh samples...|$|R
40|$|Extension {{services}} established {{since independence}} have generally failed {{to live up}} to expectations. Increases in agricultural production in ACP countries have been achieved largely through the expansion of the cultivated land area and increased stock numbers rather than inherent increases in productivity. With a declining resource base, increases of this kind are clearly not sustainable. Alternative approaches to providing meaningful advice to farmers must be explored, if more efficient and productive farming systems are to be developed. One approach is to foster partnerships between NGOs and government services. The public sector must take the initiative. If food production in the developing world is to keep pace with population growth, more efficient farming practices must be introduced. These new practices should not be introduced at the expense of the environment or the resource base, but must be based on persuading conservative, risk-avoiding, resource-poor farmers to become more innovative. This must be achieved within a framework of fluctuating commodity prices, erratic policy making and increasing financial constraints. Functional, efficient and cost-effective advisory and distribution services to farmers are a major prerequisite to achieving longer-term sustainable food production. The post-independence period saw major investments in institutional strengthening, including the establishment of extension services, which were primarily crop orientated, and technical training. Agricultural extension was generally conceived as a 'good thing' that should be provided as a matter of course. Large and complex organizations evolved, often initiated with donor support, whose demands eventually exceeded the resources that the local economy could provide. Sadly, it is now all too common to find government services crippled through lack of resources; most recurrent funding may be committed to staff salaries alone. Yet without allowances, fuel, transport and equipment these staff remain office-bound and unable to fulfill any meaningful function. Various extension models have evolved and it is usual to find more than one model being used within a country. Most common are the multi-functional, broad-based services provided by ministries of agriculture. These are large hierarchical institutions with resident, village-based extension agents who cover all crops, and often livestock as well, and who are supported by subject-matter specialists at district and provincial levels. Field staff often have different and sometimes contradictory roles, including regulatory control and data collection in addition to general extension. In many countries, specific integrated development projects, usually financed through international loans, have developed parallel extension services, the numerous state Integrated Agricultural Development Projects (IAPDs) in Nigeria being an example. More specialized, commodity-based advisory services are commonly found throughout the ACP countries. Traditionally they focus on cash crops, usually for export, such as tea, coffee and tobacco and also on meat products. Such services usually operate outside the civil service regulations as independent, self-supporting legal entities. They can usually afford to offer better terms of service than government departments and are thus able to attract better-qualified staff. A degree of vertical integration is also common, with the provision of a range of specific activities including adaptive research, credit and input supply, advice and marketing. Examples of such organizations include Kenya's Tea Development Authority and the Compagnie Fran 7 aise pour le D 9 veloppement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) in West Africa. Many of these commodity-based parastatals take an active marketing role and are less involved with extension aspects; for example, the Grain Marketing and Dairy Marketing Boards in Zimbabwe. However, with a few notable exceptions, the achievements of parastatals have not been good. Poor management, political interference and the drop in commodity prices have been partly responsible for their demise. Most African parastatals are now insolvent and largely ineffective. Where the markets exist, both national and multi-national companies compete to supply fertilizers and agro-chemicals, or to buy primary produce. Either to increase their market share or to improve the quality of the product, private sector companies often provide a comprehensive and valuable advisory service to their clients. Some of the more effective cooperatives provide similar advisory services paid for by their members. The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) in Zimbabwe offers a highly effective service to its members including input supply, research, advice and marketing. These commercial cooperatives should not be confused with the numerous producer cooperatives that have largely failed in Africa. There is now increasing interest in privatizing, initially through introducing cost-recovery mechanisms, and a wide range of services to the smallholder sector, notably veterinary services. The United States' model, where universities link not only research and teaching but also provide an advisory service, is not generally found in ACP countries. Instead, most of these countries are well endow' with training institutions at all levels: universities, technical institutes and training centers. In many ways the investment in these institutions, again usually provide through donor support, has outstripped the local capacity to use them. In francophone countries the ministries agriculture have a more strategic role while fewer implementation responsibilities, a devolved to specialized agencies. Agricultural extension is often incorporated into community development programmes which may include credit provision, cooperative development and literacy campaigns, such as the animation rurale programmes in Senegal. Benefits that never materialized Given the investment that has gone into the provision of extension services, why ha the benefits not been more tangible? In attempt to overcome the economic crisis facing many ACP countries, 'structural adjustment' programmes have been introduced. Central to such policies is the perceived wisdom that public-sector spend must be reduced, currency rates reassessed and exports expanded, with cost-recovery or privatization being more appropriate than government subsidized services. The result is the now all-too-familiar picture of government services severely constrained by the lack of resources, extremely low staff morale and a virtual cessation of field activities. Many of the 'technical packages' that were to have transformed agricultural production have performed so poorly that benefits rarely materialized - the African 'Green Revolution' has never occurred. Dependence on irrigation and high levels of inputs, which were the prerequisites of increased production in Asia, combined with the poorer soils of Africa, meant that the transfer of 'Green Revolution' technology has not been appropriate for African conditions. Local crop varieties often perform as well as, or better than, many of the 'improved' varieties under local conditions both in terms of yield and socio-cultural acceptance. The classic example was the introduction of <b>softer</b> yellow <b>maize,</b> which is easier to mill than local white 'flint' varieties. Alas the uptake of the new varieties was poor since, unlike the yellow varieties, the hardness of local varieties enabled them to withstand weevil attack during storage. Furthermore, many of the new lines were hybrid varieties requiring new seed every season and a high level of inputs. The introduction of swamp rice in Sierra Leone using improved varieties had the potential to greatly increase yields. What was not taken into account was that such practices require a high initial labour input, for a product that is less acceptable to the local market and where producers face working in difficult conditions in the swamps, with greater exposure to disease. The introduction of exotic breeds of animals has long been a favorite of agricultural planners, despite the fact that in the majority of cases indigenous breeds, which have evolved and adapted to local conditions, outperform them. A farming systems approach Clearly orthodox extension approaches have largely failed to address the major problems facing resource-poor, risk avoiding peasant farmers. Historically, planners have failed to appreciate the wider context of food production in developing countries. Support services, research and extension have predominantly taken a paternalistic 'top down' approach to development - the last person to be consulted being the farmer! Under the existing constraints (social, economic and financial) facing smallholder production, it is often difficult to improve significantly on existing practices. This would indicate that technology transfer alone will not be the solution. Recognizing these problems has lead to greater interest in the 'farming systems' approach to agricultural development. Farming systems research (FSR) assumes a holistic view of the 'farm' and that to adequately address problems requires a multi-disciplinary approach, in particular the inclusion of the social sciences. An initial descriptive and diagnostic phase, usually undertaken through rapid rural appraisals (RRAs), leads consecutively into the design and field testing of appropriate interventions. The key is that farmers are involved at all stages, and only those interventions that work under village conditions are included in extension packages in similar situations. FSR clearly has merits over the more isolated discipline-based research, notably the commitment to farmer participation. In reality, FSR too has had its problems and, in practice, achieving true farmer participation can be fraught with difficulties. Nor does it do anything to overcome the institutional constraints facing most|$|R
