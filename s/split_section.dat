2500|$|Work {{hardening}} {{happens to}} all cases, even low-pressure handgun cases. The sudden {{increase in pressure}} upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the <b>split</b> <b>section</b> to be removed. [...] The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life. Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks, and {{may be a good}} choice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} bullets {{specifically designed to}} expand on impact were those fired by express rifles, which were developed in the mid 19th century. Express rifles used larger powder charges and lighter bullets than typical for the time to achieve very high velocities for black powder cartridges. One method of lightening the bullets used {{was to provide a}} deep cavity in the nose of the bullet. These were the first hollow-point bullets, and in addition to developing higher velocities, they also expanded significantly upon impact. These hollow-point bullets worked well on thin-skinned game, but tended to come apart on bigger game, resulting in insufficient penetration. One solution to this was the [...] "cruciform expanding bullet", a solid bullet with a cross-shaped incision in the tip. This <b>split</b> <b>section</b> expanded only to the depth of the incision, making it an early form of controlled expansion bullet.|$|E

5000|$|Today's plastic {{ski boots}} evolved from leather designs {{that in turn}} evolved from {{conventional}} winter hiking boots. These all followed the same basic layout; the boot was built {{on top of a}} semi-stiff sole of leather or (for a stiffer boot) wood. The upper shell consisted of single layer or multiple layers of leather and stiffeners that were formed around a foot-like wooden block, the [...] "last". Some models were designed with a single piece of leather wrapped over the toe area of the last, with {{the two sides of the}} leather meeting at the back of the heel, where they were stitched together. The designs normally left a slot-like opening and overlapping flaps running from the instep and up in front of the ankle. Laces threaded across the <b>split</b> <b>section</b> allow the boot to be tightened over the foot, and a tongue below the split sealed it to prevent water or snow entering.|$|E

North of Broad Street, which carries US 33 and US 250, SR 197 enters an industrial area and leaves the city of Richmond. The state highway follows Westwood Avenue through Henrico County. SR 197 expands to a divided highway as it passes under Interstate 195 (I-195) (Beltline Expressway) with no access, then crosses over CSX's RF&P Subdivision. North of the railroad tracks, Westwood Avenue splits to the east at a partial trumpet interchange; {{there is no direct}} access from westbound Westwood Avenue to eastbound SR 197 or from westbound SR 197 to eastbound Westwood Avenue.

5000|$|The {{head of the}} 5th Department was Julia Brystiger who, {{together}} with Radkiewicz organized the secret police's operations aimed at the Catholic Church in Poland. In October 1947, Brystiger - who was an interrogator of political prisoners widely known for her sadism and Gestapo-like methods of torture during questioning - presented a seminar entitled On the Clergy's Offensive Against Our Task at a conference for secret police chiefs and Radkiewicz was the main discussant. In her presentation Brystiger stated that the [...] "final time of merciless fight with the Church" [...] was coming soon and {{that in order to}} win it the secret services of the Communist party would need to employ [...] "any means necessary". Radkiewicz, in his follow up remarks noted that [...] "The clergy is not like the PSL (The Polish People's Party). With them it won't be as easy as it was with the PSL".

40|$|Abstract. Optimal {{controlled}} splitting is {{an emergency}} strategy to split the power system into several sub-regions based on global electrical information before {{the collapse of the}} system which is subject to severe disturbances. How to seek the optimal <b>splitting</b> <b>sections</b> rapidly and accurately is a key problem in controlled splitting field. A controlled splitting scheme based on layer expanding graph algorithm is presented in this paper. Firstly, source nodes of island regions extend out for the formation of the island regions. Secondly, island regions can be combined to make up synchronous sub-regions {{on the basis of the}} clustering of generators. At last, the optimal sections can be determined according to the initial and improved adjustment of <b>splitting</b> <b>sections.</b> Moreover, the scheme proposed can be adapt to the change of operation mode of the power system. The accuracy and effectiveness of the scheme is shown by the simulation results of CEPRI 36 -bus system...|$|R

This declaration was amended several times before November 15, 1975, when it {{was replaced by the}} European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries or [...] "AGR", which set up a route numbering system and improved standards for roads in the list. The AGR went through several changes, with the last one, as of 2011, in 2008. Reorganization of the E-roads network of 1975 and 1983 redefined the E71 designation previously associated with Hanover - Bremen - Bremerhaven road and assigned it to Košice - Budapest - Zagreb route. The same documents assigned the Zagreb - Bihać - <b>Split</b> <b>section</b> to the E59, as the E71 terminated in Zagreb at the time, however, the most recent revision of the E-network truncated the E59 in Zagreb, and transferred its former southern leg to the E71, extending the E71 considerably.|$|E
