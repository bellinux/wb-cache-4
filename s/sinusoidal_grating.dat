40|$|It {{is known}} that visual noise added to <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>gratings</b> changes the typical U-shaped {{threshold}} curve which becomes flat in log-log scale for frequencies below 10 c/deg when gratings are masked with white noise of high power spectral density level. These results have been explained using the critical-band-masking (CBM) model by supposing a visual filter-bank of constant relative bandwidth. However, some psychophysical and biological data {{support the idea of}} variable octave bandwidth. The CBM model has been used here to explain the progressive change of threshold curves with the noise mask level and to estimate the bandwidth of visual filters. Bayesian staircases were used in a 2 IFC paradigm to measure contrast thresholds of horizontal <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>gratings</b> (0. 25 - 8 c/deg) within a fixed Gaussian window and masked with one-dimensional, static, broadband white noise with each of five power density levels. Raw data showed that the contrast threshold curve progressively shifts upward and flattens out as the mask noise level increases. Theoretical thresholds from the CBM model were fitted simultaneously to the data at all five noise levels using visual filters with log-Gaussian gain functions. If we assume a fixed-channel detection model, the best fit was obtained when the octave bandwidth of visual filters decreases as a function of peak spatial frequency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{speed of}} 1 c/deg <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>gratings</b> of contrast 0. 02 {{was measured in}} the presence of high contrast (0. 50) 1 c/deg <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>gratings</b> (called modifiers). The modifiers drifted or were counterphase modulated at various temporal frequencies. The presence of a modifier with temporal frequencies (0 and 3 Hz) lower than the low contrast moving grating decreased its perceived speed while the presence of modifiers with higher temporal frequencies (8, 12 and 16 Hz) increased its perceived speed. A modifier of the same temporal frequency (6 Hz) as the standard grating had no effect upon the perceived speed of the low contrast gratings. Moving modifiers are more effective than counterphase flickering modifiers in biasing the perceived speed of low contrast gratings if they move {{in the same direction as}} the test grating and less effective if they move in the opposite direction. Finally, a modifier presented in an annulus surrounding the test grating is more effective than a modifier presented in a circular patch above or below the test grating in raising the perceived speed of low contrast gratings. This suggests that perceived speed depends on the ratio of low and high temporal frequency signals averaged over a significant area of the visual field. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R
