[...] "a woman {{came out of her}} house, holding a child saying, 'My baby, my baby, my baby can't breathe!'" [...] Kiedis said. [...] "the woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought, 'I'm gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> some air in this kid. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Alton, [...] "That trace is a {{good deal}} thicker than what you use in England. I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> him. Keep your thumb on the reel." ...|$|E
60|$|Fred. Please you, sir, I'll {{discourse}} with her, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> satisfy your highness.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> speak French," [...] {{said the}} girl, smiling dimly at her hostess. She {{appeared}} now almost to have collected herself.|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, {{and then}} putting {{the bill in}} his pocket, remarked: [...] "Anyhow, {{he gave me the}} wad. Let's <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{walk down}} to the Admiralty and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> hold of old Wilcock," [...] he continued. [...] "If he won't tell me anything, I'll wring the old beggar's neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} my gun, Bertie, {{and go up}} to the bushes by the ravine, and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a bird or two. There is no other shelter {{anywhere}} about here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He rides like an Italian," [...] Bransome declared, {{shutting}} up his glasses. [...] "There's never a {{thing in}} this race to touch him. I am going to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> any money on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't know,' she said. 'But isn't it a {{beautiful}} evening? I will {{just go and}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> catch the primroses opening.' ...|$|R
60|$|I COME NOW TO YOUR Questions; WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY BE MIXED WITH GALL, I WILL WITH PATIENCE <b>SEE</b> <b>IF</b> <b>I</b> <b>CAN</b> TURN THEM INTO FOOD.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{just looking}} to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> any {{feathers}} from that chicken," [...] replied Bobby Coon gravely, though {{his eyes were}} twinkling with mischief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saw them {{together}} down-stairs," [...] Richard declared. [...] "I'm {{off in a}} moment to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> hold of Crawshay and shake his hand.--So you're Sir Denis Cathley, eh, and you've chucked that other game altogether?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To look at you, I shouldn't {{say that}} you were," [...] said he. [...] "We {{are going to the}} court-house, and I will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a word with the young Hotspur and send him to you. Do you wait here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could help me get that school business, but since you can't, I must run up to the Union office and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a proof of it after it's set up, though I don't begin to suppose I can. Good night." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I've eaten five times, I've slept six times, and I've {{made a lot}} {{of things}} mine. Tomorrow, I'm gonna <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> have sex with something!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The thread {{must have}} been rotten,' she said to herself. 'I will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> break it.' But search as she would she could find none.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you stay}} here, master, I will go round and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find a place. I am more {{accustomed}} to these villages than you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "we maun {{just try}} Madge; and I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> her keepit in ony better order. And at ony rate, if he suld hear her {{skirting}} her auld ends o' sangs, he's no to ken for that that there's onybody wi' her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could help me get that school business, but since you can't, I must run up to the Union office and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> them to {{let me have a}} proof of it after they have set it up, though I don't begin to suppose they will.

6000|$|... "I {{should let}} her go on," [...] she said: [...] "it helps; it's {{the only thing that}} does help. I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> them to let her come into the wards. She ought {{to be in touch with}} {{suffering}} and the men; that kitchen work will try her awfully just now: Was he very young?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{let me go}} and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hunt up this Carlos Martine. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{at least}} have a talk with him, and learn how matters stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true enough," [...] {{said the}} Ork. [...] "But now I {{want to make}} a proposal. While you are getting acquainted with this new country, which looks as if it {{contains}} everything to make one happy, I would like to fly along--all by myself--and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find my home {{on the other side of}} the great desert. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> do, I will stay there, of course. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> fail to find Orkland I will return to you in a week, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do anything more to assist you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah! {{that did}} some damage!" [...] cried the youth, {{as he started}} to reload. [...] "Now I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hit the other bear---- Hello, he's gone, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody is coming. I'll <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> help!" [...] he cried, and {{ran down}} to the trail, {{swinging}} his lantern over {{his head as he}} went. In ten seconds a horseman burst into view, riding a beautiful racing steed. The newcomer was a well-known leader of the land boomers, who rejoiced in the name of Pawnee Brown.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so, dear Vicar, I {{propose to}} give him an {{opportunity}} of showing us what he can do. I have been thinking it all over as I drove here. On Tuesday next, I will invite just a few people of taste, and he shall bring his violin. Eigh? And if that goes well, I will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> some introductions and really push him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is up to}} no good," [...] Walter said to himself, [...] "for what {{dealings}} could {{a knight}} honestly have with the ruffians who haunt these swamps. It is assuredly no business of mine, but it may lead to an adventure, and I have had no real fun since I left Aldgate. I will follow and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{to the bottom of}} the mystery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O {{where will}} I get a gude sailor, To take my helm in hand, Till I {{get up to}} the tall top-mast; To <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spy land?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make a {{selection}} out of it--for business uses, I mean; {{we will keep}} the rest for Sundays. Give it to me in installments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I do now," [...] {{he replied}} cheerfully. [...] "I've just {{come over the}} {{mountains}} from the Quadling Country to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of any help to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} makes much odds, Chris, lots of the Boers have taken to clothes of {{very much the same}} colour; really, the only {{noticeable}} thing about us is our caps. If I come upon a loyalist I will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a couple of hats for us, either of straw or felt would be all right. Well, don't worry yourself; it will be a rum thing if I can't bring you out something for breakfast and dinner to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{short time}} Charley rose, and saying, [...] "I will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} better than dried meat for supper," [...] exchanged his rifle for Mr. Hardy's double-barreled gun, which was carried by Terence, and whistling for the retriever, strolled off up the stream. In ten minutes the double-barrels were heard at a short distance, and {{a quarter of an}} hour afterward again, but this time faintly. Ten minutes before the hour was up he appeared, wiping the perspiration from his face, with seven and a half brace of plump duck.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{becoming}} quite a philosopher, little mother," [...] Roland laughed. [...] "At any rate, as I said, {{things are better}} than I expected. Of course it is no good doing anything {{for the next day}} or two;" [...] and a shade passed over Roland's face as he thought how widely his Christmas day would differ from his anticipations of it; [...] "but next week I will go round and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> something to do. I am not particular what it is, as long as it enables me to stay at Brownsville." ...|$|E
60|$|Open {{your eyes}} now. I will. One moment. Has all {{vanished}} since? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> open and am for {{ever in the}} black adiaphane. Basta! <b>I</b> will <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{go back to}} the widder for a {{month and}} tackle it and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what I will do. To-morrow morning I'll go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{have a talk with}} old Rad----" ...|$|R
