40|$|ABSTRACT: Our {{study of}} the suction patellar-tendon bearing {{prosthesis}} showed that there is better contact between the stump and the prosthesis than there is with a strap-suspended patellar-tendon bearing prosthesis. The average difference in dis-placement {{between the two is}} 1. 15 centimeters and the difference in the excursion is primarily due to the difference in the movement of the soft tissues. With more soft tissue, movement of the stump is greater, and reduced movement gives a better sense of stability and a smoother gait. The patellar-tendon weight-bearing prosthesis (PTB) for amputees with below-the-knee stumps is satisfactory in about 90 per cent of users, but in some patients it gives rise to skin irritation or does not provide a sufficient sense of stability For these reasons we developed an analogue to the strap-suspended patellar-tendon weight-bearing prosthesis, a knee <b>suction</b> <b>prosthesis</b> suitable for below-the-knee stumps. Preliminary re-sults with this analogue, which we call a <b>suction</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> have been reported. In the present paper we report roentgenographic studies of the <b>suction</b> <b>prosthesis</b> using methods we have previously publishe...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies with}} the PTB-suction {{prosthesis}} and the ordinary PTB prosthesis have provided opportunities {{to analyze and}} under-stand some functional differences in the suspension of below-knee prostheses. In a roentgenological study of the stump-socket contact significantly less vertical displacement in the PTB-suction prosthesis has been shown. A study of the pressure variations in the suction socket verified the _theory of the necessary pressure gradient in the PTB-suction socket. Added negative pressure by muscle action was also observed. An electromyographic study suggested a muscular activity pattern in the <b>suction</b> <b>prosthesis</b> {{similar to that of}} a normal leg, as a contrast to the ordinary PTB prosthesis where simultaneous contractions of antagonistic muscles seemed to be the usual pattern. The latter is interpreted as a defence reaction. An optimal prosthesis has been deduced. It shall have a soft prosthetic socket with a perfect fit, a suction, adhesion and friction fixation and a pressure gradient between the skin and the socket wall with minimum compression distally. The plaster casting shall be done in a downward modelling manner making available space for soft tissue without compression...|$|E
