5|$|The 1967 film An Evening in Paris {{is mostly}} remembered because it {{featured}} Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{as the first}} Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973) and Qurbani (1980), Dimple Kapadia in Bobby (1973), and Parveen Babi in Yeh Nazdeekiyan (1982).|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has to <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth {{and taking care}} of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.|$|E

25|$|Equipment {{failure is}} one {{possible}} type of accident. In Białystok, Poland, in 2001 the electronics {{associated with a}} particle accelerator used {{for the treatment of}} cancer suffered a malfunction. This then led to the overexposure of at least one patient. While the initial failure was the simple failure of a semiconductor diode, it <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> series of events which led to a radiation injury.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s, {{the fair}} housing {{conflict}} of California would {{evolve into a}} collision of legislative action, racial backlash, and judicial ruling: the Rumford Act on the floors of the state capitol; Proposition 14 at the ballot box; Mulkey v. Reitman before the Supreme Court of California, and Reitman v. Mulkey before the Supreme Court of the United States. These events explicitly shaped a gubernatorial election in California, and arguably <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> sea change in political allegiances and presidential elections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the long}} run, the strike devastated the American steel industry. More than 85 percent of U.S. steel {{production}} had {{been shut down}} for almost four months. Hungry for steel, American industries began importing steel from foreign sources. Steel imports had been negligible prior to 1959. But during the strike, basic U.S. industries found Japanese and Korean steel to be less costly than American steel even after accounting for importation costs. The sudden shift toward imported steel <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> series of events, {{which led to the}} gradual decline of the American steel industry.|$|E

The two {{had known each other}} from their work together in Meany's previous band Earthsuit. Occasionally Paul would receive instrumental demo CDs from Darren. Fairly impressed with his efforts, Paul contacted Darren and asked if he could mess with the demos a bit, adding some ideas of his own. Darren obliged and the two would <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> sort of songwriting ping-pong match that would carry on for several months.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, took a {{personal}} interest in the anti-Soap Trust campaign. While extending assurances of “the strictest impartiality” to Lever, Northcliffe’s close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt revealed {{his support for the}} American’s activities as a 'trust-buster'. Roosevelt’s investigations of dishonest dealings among many American companies had been fully reported in Britain, eliciting a pious chorus of disapproval and claims that any similar wrongdoing by British firms would be unimaginable. But Northcliffe, pointing to the existence of a British Tobacco Trust, was not convinced. He <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> campaign of investigative journalism, some of which seems to have verged upon persecution; the clear objective of which was to smash Lever’s soap combine.|$|E
25|$|Once the rebellions {{had been}} put down, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest. Whether or not he {{intended}} a full-out imperial conquest is hard to say; he did, however, <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> historical trajectory {{that in just a}} few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. Abu Bakr began with Iraq, the richest province of the Sasanian Empire. He sent general Khalid ibn Walid to invade the Sasanianan Empire in 633. He thereafter also sent four armies to invade the Roman province of Syria, but the decisive operation was only undertaken when Khalid, after completing the conquest of Iraq, was transferred to the Syrian front in 634.|$|E
25|$|Greece {{occupied}} Smyrna/İzmir on 15 May 1919, while Mustafa Kemal Pasha (later Atatürk), who was {{to become}} {{the leader of the}} Turkish opposition to the Treaty of Sèvres, landed in Samsun on May 19, 1919, an action that is regarded as the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence. He united the protesting voices in Anatolia and <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> nationalist movement to repel the armies that had occupied Turkey (including Italy, France and Britain) and establish new borders for a sovereign Turkish nation. Having created a separate government in Ankara, Kemal's government did not recognise the abortive Treaty of Sèvres and fought to have it revoked. The Greek advances into Anatolia were eventually checked and the Greek army was forced into retreat.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr's Caliphate {{lasted for}} 27 months, {{during which he}} crushed the {{rebellion}} of the Arab tribes throughout the Arabian Peninsula in the successful Ridda Wars. In {{the last months of}} his rule, he sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests against the Sassanid Empire in Mesopotamia and against the Byzantine Empire in Syria. This would <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. He had little time {{to pay attention to the}} administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{with the}} {{blackmail}} instrument he needs, the President ignores Anderson's proof of Leffingwell's treachery and plots {{to use the}} photo to gain Anderson's silence.The President plants the photo with leftist Senator Fred Van Ackerman, thinking he will never need to use it. But the President has underestimated Van Ackerman's treachery and misjudged Anderson's reaction should the truth come out. After a series of circumstances involving Anderson's secret being revealed to his wife, the Washington press corps, and several senators, Anderson kills himself. Anderson's death turns {{the majority of the}} Senate against the President and the Majority Leader. Anderson's suicide and the exposure of the truth about Leffingwell's lies regarding his communist past <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction that ends several careers and ultimately rejects Leffingwell as a nominee to become Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|Le Verrier {{was unaware}} that his public {{confirmation}} of Adams' private computations had <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> British {{search for the}} purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Having been unsuccessful {{in his efforts to}} interest any French astronomer in the problem, Le Verrier finally sent his results by post to Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory. Galle received Le Verrier's letter on 23 September and immediately set to work observing in the region suggested by Le Verrier. Galle's student, Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, suggested that a recently drawn chart of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location, could be compared with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a stationary star.|$|E

25|$|With some hesitance, Gherman Pântea {{endorsed}} the Republic's union with Romania, affiliating {{with the local}} Bessarabian Peasants' Party, then with Romania's National Liberals. Having parallel careers as teacher, lawyer and journalist, Pântea remained a presence in Romanian political life, as member of Parliament, negotiator of détente with the Soviet Union, and three times Mayor of Chișinău. He was however mistrusted for his defense of arrested Bolsheviks, his critique of centralized government, and his alleged corruption. During World War II, Pântea was Mayor of Odessa under a Romanian occupation. He intervened to save Jews from the 1941 Odessa massacre and the subsequent deportations to camps in Transnistria. He had a tumultuous relationship with Ion Antonescu, the Romanian dictator, and was kept in check by the occupation authority. His administration managed to <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> plan for Odessa, and helped the city overcome devastation through the adoption of free trade, but also created various controversies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, Union {{commander}} in chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> grand strategy designed to press the Confederacy into submission. Control of the strategically important and agriculturally rich Shenandoah Valley was {{a key element in}} Grant's plans. While he confronted General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia {{in the eastern part of}} the state, Grant ordered Major General Franz Sigel's army of 10,000 to secure the Valley and threaten Lee's flank, starting the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Sigel was to advance on Staunton, Virginia in order to link up with another Union column commanded by George Crook, which would advance from West Virginia and destroy the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad and other Confederate industries in the area. Sigel's force totaled about 9,000 men and 28 cannons, divided into an infantry division commanded by Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan and a cavalry division commanded by Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel (detachments made during the campaign reduced the Union force to about 6,300 by the time of the battle).|$|E
25|$|New Orleans, {{the largest}} city in the Confederacy, was already under threat of attack from the north when David Farragut moved his fleet into the river from the south. The Confederate Navy had already driven off the Union {{blockade}} fleet in the Battle of the Head of Passes the previous October. Although the menace from upriver was geographically more remote than that from the Gulf of Mexico, a series of losses in Kentucky and Tennessee had forced the War and Navy Departments in Richmond to strip the region of much of its defenses. Men and equipment had been withdrawn from the local defenses, so that by mid-April almost nothing remained to the south except the two forts {{and an assortment of}} gunboats of questionable worth. Without reducing the pressure from the north, (Union) President Abraham Lincoln <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>a</b> combined Army-Navy operation to attack from the south. The Union Army offered 18,000 soldiers, led by the political general Benjamin F. Butler. The Navy contributed a large fraction of its West Gulf Blockading Squadron, which was commanded by Flag Officer David G. Farragut. The squadron was augmented by a semi-autonomous flotilla of mortar schooners and their support vessels under Commander David Dixon Porter.|$|E
