40|$|Characterization and {{monitoring}} data from implementation {{and the first}} two and one half years of vadose zone remediation operations indicate that this activity has substantially improved {{the performance of the}} A/M Area Groundwater Corrective Action Program. During this period, vadose zone remediation removed approximately 225, 000 lbs (100, 000 Kg) of chlorinated solvents (CVOCs) from the subsurface. Further, vadose zone remediation system operation increased the overall CVOC removal rate of the A/M Area Groundwater Corrective Action by 300 % to 500 % during this period versus the groundwater pump and treat system along.

40|$|Authentication {{is how we}} {{establish}} {{trust in}} monitoring systems and measurements to verify compliance with, for example, the storage of nuclear weapons material. Authentication helps assure the monitoring party that accurate and reliable information is provided by any measurement system and that any irregularities are detected. The U. S. is developing its {{point of view on}} the procedures for authentication of monitoring systems now planned or contemplated for arms reduction and control applications. The authentication of a system utilizes a set of approaches, including: functional testing using trusted calibration <b>sources,</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> documentation, <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> software, <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> hardware, random selection of hardware and software, tamper-indicating devices, and operational procedures. Authentication of measurement systems should occur throughout their lifecycles, starting with the elements of design, and moving to off-site authentication, on-siste authentication, and continuing with authentication following repair. The most important of these is the initial design of systems. Hardware and software design criteria and procurement decisions can make future authentication relatively straightforward or conversely very difficult. Facility decisions can likewise ease the procedures for authentication since reliable and effective monitoring systems and tampering indicating devices can help provide the assurance needed in the integrity of such items as measurement systems, spare equipment, and reference sources. This paper will summarize the results of the U. S. Authentication Task Force discussion on the role of procedures in authentication...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} recent interest in micro-credit programs, rigorous evidence on the impacts of forming self-help groups to mobilize savings and foster social empowerment {{at the local level}} is virtually non-existent, despite a large number of programs following this pattern. The authors use a large household survey to assess the economic and social impacts of the formation of self-help groups in India. They find positive impacts on empowerment and nutritional intake in program areas overall and heterogeneity of impacts between members of pre-existing and newly formed groups, as well as non-participants. Female social and economic empowerment in program areas increased irrespective of participation status, suggesting positive externalities. Nutritional benefit was more pronounced for new participants than for members of pre-existing groups.

40|$|Web {{advertising}} (ads) {{is currently}} a big issue for information seeking behavior on the Internet. Since websites are {{an important source of}} information in our daily lives, the websites have become popular media for advertising. The advertisers think that Web ads are {{the best way to get}} people to know quickly many things about a product or service [7]. However, from the viewers??? perspective, Web ads can be considered an obstacle to users??? information seeking on a website. Actually, Web ads received complains as being annoying or intruding, and it is considered to have negative effects such as affecting people???s task performance by many researchers [2, 5, 6]. The objective of this research is to know how Web advertising affects users??? information seeking, website <b>evaluation,</b> and <b>source</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Most previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of Web ads toward viewers. Not many studies researched on how Web ads affect users??? information seeking performance, website evaluation, and content <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a website. According to visual attention theory, since people???s visual attention is limited, the more attention Web ads received from a viewer, the less amount of attention was available for the visual search task and the more damaging it was to the search task [5]. Therefore, Web ads will affect people???s information seeking performance, and consequently it will influence website <b>evaluation</b> and <b>source</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the website. My research question is: how do different types of Web advertising which attract people???s attention at differing levels affect users??? information seeking performance, website <b>evaluation,</b> and <b>source</b> <b>evaluation?</b> I will employ an empirical research design with various levels of attention grabbing Web ads and users??? information seeking performance, website <b>evaluation,</b> and <b>source</b> <b>evaluation.</b> I will use a total of 200 college students as the sample population in this research, and I will randomly assign the participants into four different groups (50 participants in each group) : three experimental groups for low, medium, and high attention grabbing Web ads and one control group (a group with no Web ads).

The seismic hazard analysis for the study area was done using probabilistic approach to evaluate the peak horizontal acceleration at bed rock level.

40|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{remains a}} public health concern due to leads persistence in the environment from anthropogenic uses. Initial efforts to address the impacts of lead on vulnerable communities have included secondary prevention measures which typically occur after a child has been poisoned. However, in recent {{years there has been}} a pragmatic shift toward primary prevention efforts. This study evaluates lead hazards identified through primary prevention activities in residential housing within Clark County, Nevada, USA. It is the first study to systematically address and evaluate pre- 1978 housing in Southern Nevada. Risk assessments were conducted in 81 dwellings built prior to 1979 classified as a mobile, single family or multi family unit. Risk assessments included the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> lead hazards using a Niton X-ray Fluorescence analyzer and collection of dust and soil samples. Of the 81 homes inspected 60 (74 %) of the homes had lead-based hazards from traditional (paint, dust, soil) and non-traditional (tile) <b>sources.</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>of</b> lead-based paint hazards suggest that hazards within Clark County follow national trends, specifically that lead is found more frequently in older housing units. An <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> age of the home as a marker for dust and soil hazards indicated no statistically significant trend which could conclude that year of construction is not associated with such hazards. Data does suggest that non-traditional lead-based hazards such as tile are more commonly found in Southern Nevada Homes. Understanding housing characteristics, such as age of home, and their association to paint, dust and soil hazards can be used to develop targeted screening and education efforts that actively evaluate housing with the greatest risk of exposing humans to lead. Further, the identification of non-traditional lead hazards as a common source of exposure for Nevada residents indicates the need for prevention and educational efforts that address reducing risks associated with such hazards...|$|R

Grain molds {{are a major}} constraint to the sorghum production and for adoption of the improved cultivars. A complex of fungi causes grain mold. Information on genetics of grain mold resistance and mechanisms is required to facilitate the breeding of durable resistant cultivars. A genetic study was conducted using one white susceptible, three white resistant/tolerant sources, and one colored resistant source in the crossing programme to obtain four crosses. P 1, P 2, F 1, BC 1, and BC 2, and F 2 families of each cross were evaluated for the field grade and threshed grade scores, under sprinkler irrigation. Generation mean analyses and frequency distribution studies were carried out. The frequency distribution studies showed that grain mold resistance in the white-grained resistance sources was polygenic. The additive gene action and additive × additive gene interaction were significant in all the crosses. Simple recurrent selection or backcrossing should accumulate the genes for resistance. Epistasis gene interactions were observed in colored resistance × white resistance cross. Gene interaction was influenced by pronounced G × E.
