5|$|The Overman Committee was {{formally}} an ad-hoc <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Committee on the Judiciary, {{but had no}} formal name. It was chaired by Senator Lee Slater Overman and also included Senators Knute Nelson of Minnesota, Thomas Sterling of South Dakota, William H. King of Utah, and Josiah O. Wolcott of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was {{slated to}} play a major role in the Eisenhower/Nixon {{re-election}} bid. However, he had represented two Atlantic City clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who had been fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud, and on April 25, 1956, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one with close ties to Vice President Nixon.|$|E
50|$|Harry Coyne was <b>the</b> {{chairman}} <b>of</b> {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queensland War Council including those concerned with Anzac Cottage Trust and <b>the</b> commemoration <b>of</b> Anzac Day.

50|$|Acrimonious debates {{included}} {{that over}} <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> a new Canadian flag {{as well as}} the Munsinger Affair and other scandals. As Speaker, he attempted to bring in procedural reforms to make Parliament more efficient. He established four <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Special Committee on Procedure and Organization, each chaired by a member of a different political party.|$|R
5|$|Glenn was {{on several}} {{committees}} {{during his first}} term as Senator, including the Government Operations Committee, Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, and Energy Research and Water Resources Subcommittee, and was chair of the Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Federal Services <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Governmental Affairs Committee. Glenn introduced bills on energy policy to try to counter the energy crisis in the 70s. Glenn also introduced legislation based on nuclear non-proliferation, and was the chief author of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, the first of six major pieces of legislation that he produced on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords {{concluded}} that the Lords' record keeping should be improved, and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities. The {{first floor of the}} tower, used to store the documents, was renovated with brick vaulting, providing better fire protection than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of £6. The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} and <b>subcommittee</b> appointments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seated senator, as of May 2017 are as follows.|$|R
50|$|Hartman devoted {{attention}} to public policy, most particularly <b>the</b> fiscal economics <b>of</b> government spending, taxation, financial markets, welfare, and {{education at the}} state and national levels. He served as Chairman <b>of</b> two <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1986 Special Committee on Organization of State Agencies. He has also given formal testimony before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, The Texas Legislature, and The President’s Panel on Tax Reform.|$|R

5|$|The Overman Committee was {{a special}} <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary chaired by North Carolina Democrat Lee Slater Overman. Between September 1918 and June 1919, it {{investigated}} German and Bolshevik elements in the United States. It was an early forerunner of the better known House Un-American Activities Committee, and represented the first congressional committee investigation of communism.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only {{five months after the}} first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. The <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons. Both Daniel Akerson, General Motors CEO, and David L. Strickland, NHTSA administrator, denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of that commitment was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E
50|$|Established by the Legislative Reorganization Act <b>of</b> 1946, <b>the</b> Public Works Committee {{consolidated}} {{the responsibilities}} and jurisdictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Public Buildings and Grounds, Rivers and Harbors, Roads and Flood Control committees. These committees maintained their names, but became <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Public Works committee. Through this period, the government invested strongly in building road and federal highway infrastructure, with profound effects on cities and suburbs in the country.|$|R

5|$|A <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-1 Executive Committee, {{chaired by}} James B. Conant, and {{consisting}} of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, {{was appointed to}} look into the issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights <b>Subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a <b>subcommittee</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, Meeting for Sufferings absorbed various other {{powerful}} bodies, including the old Morning Meeting in 1901. It came under <b>the</b> direct authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yearly Meeting {{as part of}} a process of normalisation <b>of</b> Quaker institutions. <b>The</b> <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Meetings merged, and in 1965 Meeting for Sufferings was given <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> appointing their members. In return, it had to become more representative, drawing its membership directly from the monthly meetings (<b>the</b> basic unit <b>of</b> Quaker organisation) rather than quarterly meetings (larger assemblies of several monthly meetings).|$|R
50|$|Councils have {{historically}} had no split between executive and legislature. Functions are vested {{in the council}} itself, and then exercised usually by committees or <b>subcommittees</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council. <b>The</b> post <b>of</b> leader was recognised, and leaders typically chair several important committees, but had no special authority. <b>The</b> chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council itself is an honorary position with no real power. Under section 15 the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, committees must roughly reflect the political party makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council; before it was permitted for a party with control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council to 'pack' committees with their own members. This pattern was based on that established for municipal boroughs by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and then later adopted for county councils and rural districts.|$|R

On 4 April 1955, the tribe created a board <b>of</b> {{directors}} with <b>the</b> intent <b>of</b> forming a tribal organization before the Clewiston hearings which would begin in two days. From 6-7 April 1955, hearings were held and again Osceola and tribe representatives plead for <b>the</b> continuance <b>of</b> federal government supervision {{for the next}} 25 years and separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seminoles from the Miccosukee tribe and Traditional Indians.|$|R
