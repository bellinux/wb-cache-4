5|$|The {{comparative}} <b>simplicity</b> and regularity of the cerebellar anatomy led to {{an early}} hope that it might imply a similar <b>simplicity</b> of computational function, as expressed {{in one of the}} first books on cerebellar electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine <b>simplicity</b> also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine <b>simplicity</b> is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine <b>simplicity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of <b>simplicity,</b> other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Bangkok docked in Singapore on May 6, Kalākaua {{had had enough of}} formal events, turning down the offer of {{accommodations}} at Government House in favor of the <b>simplicity</b> of a hotel.

5|$|Created by {{roommates}} Michael Frederickson and Stephen Barlow {{and inspired}} by 1980s video games, Kanye Zone reached {{the front page}} of Reddit and received considerable media attention—Frederickson was interviewed by MTV, and several other news outlets reported on the game, some praising its <b>simplicity</b> and addictiveness. In May 2013, a follow-up game, titled Pitbull Party and based on the rapper Pitbull, was released.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience. Other criticisms {{included}} the <b>simplicity</b> of the writing {{and a lack of}} interesting stories. In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, which she has performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} <b>simplicity,</b> {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|For <b>simplicity,</b> {{clubs are}} listed under their {{name at the}} time of their last league fixture with United: for example, results against Ardwick are {{integrated}} into the records against Manchester City whilst the fixtures against Glossop are listed under the name the club had at the time rather than Glossop North End which they have subsequently become.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two years, Ne-Yo {{continued}} writing songs, {{some of which have}} not been officially released. He contributed songs to American singer Teedra Moses's 2004 album Complex <b>Simplicity,</b> Christina Milian's It's About Time, and the American boy band Youngstown, none of which, however, brought Ne-Yo much mainstream attention. Ne-Yo has also contributed songs to singers Mary J. Blige, B2K, Faith Evans, and Musiq, among others.|$|E

5|$|He {{notes the}} degree of {{artifice}} concealed behind the apparent <b>simplicity</b> of the imagery as everyday moments are captured. A piece of driftwood is tossed and broken by the waves; people stroll along the promenade; a group of dogs gather by the water's edge whilst ducks strut across the frame. A pool of water is shot at night {{with the sounds of}} a storm, and frogs croaking break the stillness.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} part of the {{documentary}} film Genre de Vie, about bicycles, cities and personal awareness. It looks at desired space and our own impact to the process of it. The film documents urban life empowered by the <b>simplicity</b> of the bicycle.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the <b>simplicity</b> of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
