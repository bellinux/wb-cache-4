2500|$|While it is {{said that}} the IDF's {{reprisal}} targeted killing policy has reduced the effectiveness of Palestinian attacks, it increased the number of Hamas attacks between 2001 and 2005. Although the total number of Hamas operations increased, deaths resulting from such attacks plunged from a high of 75 in 2001, to 21 in 2005. For example, after the targeting of Yassin in 2004 there was a severe {{increase in the number of}} attacks carried out (an increase of 299 attacks) yet there were only 4 suicide attacks, a decrease from the previous year. According to the report by A.E. Stahl, a Research Fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, following the targeted operation against Yassin, [...] "Suicide terrorism by Hamas decreased by ﬁve and the total number of deaths caused by <b>suicidal</b> <b>terrorism</b> also declined by 19. [...] Though the total number of attacks increased the total number of deaths decreased severely: attacks rose by [...] 299 but deaths fell by 27." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Terrorism in general, and <b>suicidal</b> <b>terrorism</b> in particular, is popularly seen as “irrational,” {{but many}} economists and {{political}} scientists argue otherwise. This paper distinguishes three different senses of irrationality: unresponsiveness to incentives, deviation from narrow self-interest, and failure of rational expectations. It concludes that an intermediate {{position on the}} rationality of terrorism is appropriate. The typical terrorist sympathizer deviates only slightly from homo economicus. But active terrorists arguably stray from narrow self-interest and rational expectations, and suicidal terrorists probably violate both. Deterrence remains a viable anti-terrorism strategy, but deviations from rational expectations increase the potential of persuasion and appeasement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the phenomenon of suicide bombing. It addresses the question of just how much a psychological understanding of the individuals involved can aid in prevention. The article looks at historical, epidemiological, and cultural perspectives and compares the nonpsychological and psychological approaches to suicide bombing. On the basis of the material available it seems that social processes such as group-dynamic indoctrination and political factors are decisive in analyzing this problem. Cultural, nationalistic, and religious factors are important. The conclusion is that in suicidal bombing, suicide is instrumental in the context of war, not in the context of psychopathology. Suicide bombing is instrumental in realizing fatalities, and it {{is only one of many}} weapons. The act of killing in warfare is more important to understanding <b>suicidal</b> <b>terrorism</b> than the act of suicide. This explains why psychological profiling of suicidal terrorists has to date not been successful...|$|E
