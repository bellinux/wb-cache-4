In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the Rio Earth Summit by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.|$|E

40|$|<b>Socially</b> <b>responsible</b> mutual funds, {{also known}} as <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>invested</b> funds, {{are one of the}} main {{instruments}} of <b>Socially</b> <b>Responsible</b> Investment (SRI). The term “fund ” is used to refer to a ready-made financial product where investor’s money is pooled into a portfolio and a fund/in-vestment manager decides which shares to buy. Therefore, this financial product is attractive for passive investors without a high degree of financial knowledge. Nevertheless, investment tools aimed at assisting the investors in their selection of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> companies which serve best their social and environmental values are rather scare and this lack of tools assisting inves-tors in SRI is even more important when we refer to <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> mutual funds.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} further drivers of the optimal proportion of SR investments that investors seek, we create the models  4 – 6, besides the regression models  1 – 3, {{to check the}} hypotheses H 2 a, H 2 b, and H 2 c. While the coefficient of LowRisk is positive, the variable HighReturn is negatively related to the optimal SR level in model  4. Investors who believe that SR investments are not as risky as conventional investments tend to seek a higher SR level in their portfolio. However, the same connection {{does not apply to}} a positive perception regarding the financial return of SR investments. Therefore hypothesis H 2 a is only partially supported. It should be noted that only SR investors believe in a superior financial performance of SR investments. Model  5 provides evidence that investors who regard a sustainable yield retention to be more important than SR considerations, which however cannot be achieved by SR investments, are more likely to seek for a lower optimal <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>invested</b> percentage. Furthermore, the positive coefficient of the SRI dummy shows that individuals who claim to implement their non-monetary or ethical objectives by SRI would also choose a higher proportion of SR investments. Hence, both hypothesis H 2 b and H 2 c are confirmed.|$|R

With regard to the dependence of microfinance funds' returns {{on the performance of}} stock and fixed income markets in developed and emerging economies we find slightly negative correlation when measured by the portfolio beta measure. Our regression analysis confirms that returns on investment in microfinance investment funds exceed the returns on the market portfolio. This result together with reported near-to-zero beta estimates as a proxy for the systematic risk may be taken to be a clear financial advantage of an inclusion of microfinance assets in a portfolio compared to pure stock or bond portfolios. The results based on CAPM beta and Jensen's alpha are confirmed by mean-variance spanning test.

Though the pyramid could be perceived to be a static snapshot of responsibilities, it is intended {{to be seen as a}} dynamic, adaptable framework the content of which focuses both on the present and the future. A consideration of stakeholders and sustainability, today, is inseparable from CSR. Indeed, there have been some appeals in the literature for CSR to be redefined as Corporate Stakeholder Responsibility and others have advocated Corporate Sustainability Responsibilities. These appeals highlight the intimate nature of these interrelated topics (Carroll and Buchholtz 2015). Furthermore, Ethical Corporation Magazine which emphasizes CSR in its Responsible Summit conferences integrates these two topics – CSR and Sustainability—as if they were one and, in fact, many business organizations today perceive them in this way; that is, to be <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> is to <b>invest</b> in the importance of sustainability which implicitly is concerned with the future.

A 2004 Mercer survey reveals that 89 % of investment managers in Asia and 69 % of investment managers in Europe believe that SRI would be in the investment mainstream in the coming ten years, but only 36 % of investment managers in the U. S. share that belief. ! Nevertheless, a broad range of institutional investors do tollow SRI, even in the U. S., ttom the giant CalPERS fund, which serves public employees in California, to the medium-sized Christian Brothers Investment Service, which manages money for more than 1, 000 Catholic institutions, and the relatively small New England Foundation for the Arts. Institutional investors who care about socialresponsibility do not neglect investment returns. A representative of Bon Secours Health Systems, a Catholic health-care ministry, for efanlple, told Dugan [2005], "As a Catholic organization We need to maximize returns to serve the ministries. " Indeed, pressure to maximize returns might be more intense among institutional investors than among individual investors, because institutional investors must serve constituents and answer to boards that are obliged by fiduciary laws to give priority to low risk and high expected returns in their investment choices. Institutional investors who consider SRI ask: How are <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> companies different from conventional companies? Are the returns of socially r~sponsible stocks likely to be higher or lower than those df conventional stocks?

As a result, his approach was widely discussed with both affirmative and skeptical views by the mainstream media. The Wall Street Journal commented that Lane’s theories added a new variation to the socially responsible theme. “Lane made the case that the way to do right by your conscience and your portfolio is to drop the typical SRI strategy of ‘negative screening.’ Instead, Lane’s way is to match the specific values of an investor with companies that have similar operational values.” [...] Elizabeth Wine, reporter for On Wall Street magazine, noted that Advocacy Investing has become the new generation of <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investing.</b> She wrote, [...] "Advocacy investing pushes the idea of sustainability, not just in the narrow environmental sense, but also {{in the sense of a}} company's long term potential to compete and succeed." [...] Stasia Swisler, President and CEO for the Giving Trust praised the approach by stating that “In the wake of ethics and governance scandals, this guide boldly takes <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investing</b> to a new level.” Acknowledging that Lane’s approach provides an invaluable tool for fiduciaries considering <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investing</b> and advances original research finding competitive financial performance for positive screening, book commentator, William Baue cautioned readers to take the findings with the same grain of salt that Lane sprinkles on others’ research as Lane excluded mutual funds from the purview of his study for practical reasons.

40|$|In theory, investors {{choosing}} to <b>invest</b> only in <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> entities restrict their investment universe and should thus be penalized in a mean-variance framework. When computed, this penalty is usually viewed as valid for all <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> investors. This paper shows however that the additional cost for <b>responsible</b> <b>investing</b> depends essentially on the investors’ risk aversion. Social ratings are introduced in mean-variance optimization through linear constraints {{to explore the}} implications of considering a social responsibility (SR) threshold in the traditional Markowitz (1952) portfolio selection setting. We consider optimal portfolios both with and without a risk-free asset. The SR-efficient frontier may take four different forms depending {{on the level of}} the SR threshold: a) identical to the non-SR frontier (i. e. no cost), b) only the left portion is penalized (i. e. a cost for high-risk-aversion investors only), c) only the right portion is penalized (i. e. a cost for low-risk aversion investors only) and d) the whole frontier is penalized (i. e. a positive cost for all the investors). By precisely delineating under which circumstances SRI is costly, those results help elucidate the apparent contradiction found in the literature about whether or not SRI harms diversification. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
