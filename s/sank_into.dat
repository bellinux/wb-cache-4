5|$|The {{economic}} focus {{began to}} change as the country <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E

50|$|The final climactic {{scene at}} the end of The Mummy is located within Hamunaptra. The city <b>sinks</b> <b>into</b> the sand, and the main {{characters}} barely escape with their lives. The main antechamber, filled with mounds of treasure and gold, also <b>sinks</b> <b>into</b> the sand.|$|R
5|$|Hyde Park {{hosted a}} Great Fair {{in the summer}} of 1814 to {{celebrate}} the Allied sovereigns' visit to England, and exhibited various stalls and shows. The Battle of Trafalgar was re-enacted on the Serpentine, with a band playing the National Anthem while the French fleet <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the lake. The coronation of King George IV in 1821 was celebrated with a fair in the park, including an air balloon and firework displays.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1692 an {{earthquake}} struck Port Royal. About {{two-thirds of the}} town, amounting to 33 acres (13 ha), <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> Kingston harbour immediately after the main shock. Palisadoes cemetery, including Morgan's grave, {{was one of the}} parts of the city to fall into the sea; his body has never been subsequently located.|$|E
5|$|Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, {{thought her}} too ugly and too dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E

5|$|Three dams {{were built}} {{from the island}} to the mainland. The center dam divided the dock area in half, another was further west and a third dam {{extended}} east across {{what would be the}} entrance. The two outer dams completely closed off the site from the sea. The center dam was built without much difficulty by simply tipping material to form an embankment, although some of the earth <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the mud, so more had to be added.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting to}} be summoned to his unit, Tolkien <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> boredom. To pass the time, he {{composed}} a poem entitled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> obscurity.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{land was}} {{to some extent}} held collectively in South Wales, as in feudal England, with villages {{surrounded}} by ridge-and-furrow open fields. In contrast, in North Wales, farmers {{living in the same}} hamlet may have co-operated to the extent of sharing plough teams, but land was held by individuals. Throughout the Middle Ages, sheep were less significant than hardy upland cattle. Welsh medieval land holdings, however, were disrupted by partible inheritance (where all the land was shared amongst all the sons of a landowner), creating small farms which often <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> poverty. Partible inheritance was abolished by Parliament in 1542.|$|E
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{release from}} Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she {{received}} a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, {{and was forced to}} formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 32. At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.|$|E

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
5|$|Defoe {{was finally}} imprisoned on 21 May 1703, after {{avoiding}} his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made {{to stand in}} the pillory on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> ruin. The whole affair left a lasting impression on him, which can be felt in his writings. In the years following his arrest and release, Defoe made several attempts to explain The Shortest Way and his own viewpoint. Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703). The suspected involvement of the Tory Speaker of the House, Robert Harley, in obtaining the release of Defoe is credited as the beginning of their professional relationship, in which Defoe worked as a propagandist for Harley, after he succeeded Nottingham as Secretary of State in 1704.|$|E
5|$|George Steinbrenner {{bought the}} club in 1973 and {{regularly}} invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players. Yankee Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 {{as the home of}} a more competitive Yankees team. Despite clubhouse disputes, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.|$|E
50|$|The Schiotz {{tonometer}} {{consists of}} a curved footplate which {{is placed on the}} cornea of a supine patient. A weighted plunger attached to the footplate <b>sinks</b> <b>into</b> the cornea. A scale then gives a reading depending on how much the plunger <b>sinks</b> <b>into</b> the cornea, and a conversion table converts the scale reading into IOP measured in mmHg.|$|R

5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as it <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but this was the first hard evidence of an impact.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold <b>sank</b> <b>into</b> the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
