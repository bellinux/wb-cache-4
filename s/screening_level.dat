40|$|Soil <b>Screening</b> <b>Levels</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to be used in}} conjunction with vapor intrusion criteria and groundwater criteria for identifying sites posing a low-threat to human health. That is, these Soil <b>Screening</b> <b>Levels</b> are just one of three sets of criteria that should be evaluated to determine if a site is low-threat. The Soil <b>Screening</b> <b>Levels</b> discussed in this document have been developed for benzene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to define sites that are low-threat with respect to “direct contact ” with soil and inhalation of soil emissions. The exposure pathways considered in the site conceptual model are: ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil and inhalation of dust and volatile emissions from soil. Note these exposure pathways are assumed to occur simultaneously, i. e., the <b>screening</b> <b>levels</b> are protective of the cumulative exposure from all four exposure pathways. Standard USEPA risk assessment equations were used to derive the <b>screening</b> <b>levels.</b> The exposure parameter values, chemical toxicity values, and chemical fate and transport properties are based on standard values used in California. Two sets of <b>screening</b> <b>levels</b> were developed for two soil horizons: one from 0 to 5 feet below ground surface (bgs), and one from 5 to 10 feet bgs.

40|$|EPA is {{implementing}} a new tiered process to conducting ecological risk assessments, {{which will be}} used under the FIFRA regulatory framework. This approach will include probabilistic tools and methods at the more refined, higher levels (tiers) to provide information regarding the probability or likelihood of the impact {{as well as the}} magnitude or severity of the effect. This new process will be used to better characterize the impact of pesticides on non-target terrestrial and aquatic organisms. The results of these analyses will in turn be used by risk management divisions in decision-making. Under this new tiered approach, <b>screening</b> <b>level</b> (deterministic) assessments are first conducted and are generally based on conservative assumptions and generic data.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for <b>screening</b> <b>level</b> ecological risk assessment. In this paper, we first established a mass spectrum library including 50 phenols using retention time locking (RTL) technology and deconvolution reporting software (DRS). Distribution of phenols in surface water of the Taihu Lake was screened. Among the 22 identified phenols, 14 phenols were quantified. The concentrations of total phenols ranged 675. 2 - 3346. 1 ng L(- 1). The distributions of ecological effect quotients (EEQs) of 14 phenols were characterized {{in terms of the}} exposure concentration distributions (ECDs) and species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Those phenols with EEQs exceeding the threshold proposed by Water Environment Research Foundation of Alexandria were selected as priorities. As a result, 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP), p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) and pyrocatechol were determined as potential ecological risk stressors in surface water of the Taihu Lake.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to estimating concentrations of alpha-emitting contaminants (e. g. U, Th, Ra, Pu, Am) in soil samples has been evaluated. The Victoreen Alpha Activity Monitor {{has been designed to}} empirically assay soil samples using low-resolution alpha spectroscopy, of thick soil samples. Pre-processing of the soil samples is minimal, involving only drying the soils and milling them to reduce inhomoceneities. Several laboratory tests of the instrument have been conducted.

Using acquisition times of 1 to 24 hours the instrument Generated alpha assays of eighteen reference and field soil samples which were in good agreement with radiochemical analyses. It was observed that the alpha activity due to a 10 pCi/g {sup 239 }Pu spike added to a clean soil could be very readily distinguished from the 14 pCi/g background activity of the soil.

40|$|Abstract: Consumption of fish has {{well-known}} {{human health}} benefits, though some fish may contain {{elevated levels of}} mercury (Hg) that are especially harmful to developing children. Fish length is most often the basis for establishing fishery harvest regulations that determine which fish will ultimately be consumed by humans. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the relationship between fish length and Hg accumulation in regard to harvest regulations for effective fishery and public health policy. We examined this relationship for three sportfish from six lakes across North Carolina, USA. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) had the lowest Hg levels and only the very largest fish in the most contaminated site exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Hg <b>screening</b> <b>level.</b> Black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) had an intermediate level of Hg and larger individuals exceeded the USEPA screening level; however, they tended not to exceed this level before reaching the harvest length limit.

Transport in the vadose zone was simulated assuming one- and two-dimensional model geometries, a range of biodegradation rates, and conservative (default) model parameters.

However, sequestration sites may pose risks to people who live in their vicinity. CO 2 release from the sequestration formation through abandoned wells to the vadose zone and then from the vadose zone into people’s houses could cause exposure to high levels of CO 2. CO 2 is different from many other chemicals that may be released into the environment because its effects are acute instead of chronic. Existing literature on the health effects of CO 2 in humans was surveyed to establish risk-based <b>screening</b> <b>levels</b> that could be used near a sequestration site. Two potential <b>screening</b> <b>levels</b> were identified: (1) one person in a million becomes dizzy from inhalation of CO 2 {{in the basement of a}} house (3. 7780 % CO 2), and (2) one person in a million loses consciousness from exposure to CO 2 (6. 6744 % CO 2). A hypothetical risk assessment was conducted using a semianalytical wellfield model developed at Princeton University coupled with analytical models of diffusion through the vadose zone and foundation walls. The assessment assumed that a wellfield in Alberta, Canada, was transformed into a sequestration site with an injection rate of 43, 200 t-CO 2 /day and that a subdivision has been built near the site.
