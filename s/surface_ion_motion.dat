40|$|Previous {{applications}} of corona discharges {{for analysis of}} failure due to <b>surface</b> <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> and for design evaluation have generally involved high-voltage devices operating above 100 V. Devices operating at lower voltages, however, also may be subject o surface ion failure mechanisms, as described here. A corona discharge controlled by a grid electrode is {{shown to be a}} sensitive technique for evaluating devices operating at tens of volts. A procedure for calibrating the surface voltage of the device after corona charging is also described. In the application to a junction field effect transistor inte-grated circuit, the technique confirmed the susceptibility of failed devices to net surface charge and the ffectiveness of the process changes instituted to prevent failure due to surface charge accumulation. The method showed, also, that a de-vice is "good " by design and not because its surface is free of ions. The deposition of i ns from a corona discharge onto the surface of high-voltage integrated circuits (HVICs) is use-ful for design verification and failure analysis of these de-vices (1, 2). The corona, an atmospheric pressure high-vol-tage discharge, is a nondestructive means of depositing surface charges onto insulator surfaces. These deposite...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the nucleation {{and growth}} of carbon nanotube and nanocone arrays on Ni catalyst nanoparticles on a silicon surface exposed to a low-temperature plasma are investigated numerically, using a complex model that includes <b>surface</b> diffusion and <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> equations. It is found {{that the degree of}} ionization of the carbon flux strongly affects the kinetics of nanotube and nanocone nucleation on partially saturated catalyst patterns. The use of highly ionized carbon flux allows formation of a nanotube array with a very narrow height distribution of half-width 7 nm. Similar results are obtained for carbon nanocone arrays, with an even narrower height distribution, using a highly ionized carbon flux. As the deposition time increases, nanostructure arrays develop without widening the height distribution when the flux ionization degree is high, in contrast to the fairly broad nanostructure height distributions obtained when the degree of ionization is low...|$|R

It is revealed that Ni catalyst patterns of different degrees of order, with Ni nanoparticle sizes up to 12. 5 nm, exhibit different kinetics of saturation with carbon on the Si surface. It is shown that in the cases examined (surface coverage in the range of 1 - 50 %, highly disordered Ni patterns) the relative pattern saturation factor calculated as the ratio of average incubation times for the processes conducted in the neutral and ionized gas environments reaches 14 and 3. 4 for Ni nanoparticles of 2. 5 and 12. 5 nm, respectively. In the highly ordered Ni patterns, the relative pattern saturation factor reaches 3 for nanoparticles of 2. 5 nm and 2. 1 for nanoparticles of 12. 5 nm. Thus, more simultaneous saturation of Ni catalyst nanoparticles of sizes in the range up to 12. 5 nm, deposited on the Si substrate, can be achieved in the low-temperature plasma environment than with the neutral gas-based process...|$|R

40|$|High order {{harmonic}} generation from solid targets {{is a compelling}} route to generating intense attosecond or even zeptosecond pulses. However, the effects of <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> on the generation of harmonics have only recently started to be considered. Here, we {{study the effects of}} <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> in harmonics production at ultrahigh laser intensities interacting with solid density plasma. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we find that there is an optimum density for harmonic production that depends on laser intensity, which scales linearly with a(0) with no <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> but with a reduced scaling if <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> is included. We derive a scaling for this optimum density with <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> and also find that the background <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> induces Doppler red-shifts in the harmonic structures of the reflected pulse. The temporal structure of the Doppler shifts is correlated to the envelope of the incident laser pulse. We demonstrate that by introducing a frequency chirp in the incident pulse we are able to eliminate these Doppler shifts almost completely. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> on Landau damping {{has been studied}} {{by the use of}} {{one-dimensional}} Vlasov-Poisson simulation. It is shown that the <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> may significantly change the development of the linear Landau damping. When the ion mass is multiple of proton mass, its motion will halt the linear Landau damping at some time due to the excitation of ion acoustic waves. The latter will dominate the system evolution at the later stage and hold a considerable fraction of the total energy in the system. With very small ion mass, such as in electron-positron plasma, the <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> can suppress the linear Landau damping very quickly. When the initial field amplitude is relatively high such as with the density perturbation amplitude δn/n 0 [*]>[*] 0. 1, the effect of <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> on Landau damping is found to be weak or even ignorable...|$|R

40|$|Shear modulus {{of solid}} neutron star crust is {{calculated}} by thermodynamic perturbation theory {{taking into account}} <b>ion</b> <b>motion.</b> At given density the crust is modelled as a body-centered cubic Coulomb crystal of fully ionized atomic nuclei of one type with the uniform charge-compensating electron background. Classic and quantum regimes of <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> are considered. The calculations in the classic temperature range agree well with previous Monte Carlo simulations. At these temperatures the shear modulus is given by the sum of a positive contribution due to the static lattice and a negative ∝ T contribution due to the <b>ion</b> <b>motion.</b> The quantum calculations are performed for the first time. The main result is that at low temperatures the contribution to the shear modulus due to the <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> saturates at a constant value, associated with zero-point ion vibrations. Such behavior is qualitatively similar to the zero-point <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> contribution to the crystal energy. The quantum effects may be important for lighter elements at higher densities, where the ion plasma temperature is not entirely negligible compared to the typical Coulomb ion interaction energy. The results of numerical calculations are approximated by convenient fitting formulae.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} direct {{interaction}} of sheared mean flow with zonal flows (ZF) {{and the effect}} of parallel <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> on ZF generation in ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) background turbulence. An analytical model for the direct interaction of sheared mean flows with zonal flows is constructed. The model used for the toroidal ITG driven mode is based on the equations for ion continuity, ion temperature and parallel <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> whereas the ZF evolution is described by the vorticity equation. The behavior of the ZF growth rate and real frequency is examined for typical tokamak parameters. It is shown that in general the zonal flow growth rate is suppressed by the presence of a sheared mean flow.

Radiation sources with numerous applications, especially in medical treatments, will benefit greatly from that. High energy physics and particle physics are the main target since Plasma Wakefield Accelerators are proposed to be used as the afterburner in the future electron-positron collider aiming to investigate the super symmetric particles [12]. Although recent experiments have successfully demonstrated Plasma Wakefield Accelerators in the current regime of beams, one must not simply generalize the current experimental results to the future extreme regime of beams due to the different physics phenomena such as <b>ion</b> <b>motion,</b> multiple ionization, etc.; In this thesis, the effect of <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> in the extreme regime of ultra high intensity, ultra low emittance electron beams in future plasma wakefield accelerators is studied and analyzed. Although <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> is almost negligible in the current experiments regime, we will show why it will be a serious issue to account for in the future high energy beams. The reason is that it results in a severe emittance growth hence quality degradation of the beam. Therefore, it has been a subject of debate {{over the past few years}} whether it is going to be a serious bottleneck for the future’s ultra high energy electron beam experiments.; We, however, for the first time, show how the <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> can be reduced. Emittance preservation is a key element for the realization of the Plasma Wakefield Accelerators.

Both analytical and numerical computations are carried out to elucidate the role of damping and scan rate in influencing coherence in <b>ion</b> <b>motion</b> associated with the forward and reverse scan. Adopting the Dehmelt approximation, our analytical study is carried out on a damped, driven Duffing oscillator with positive octopole nonlinearity. Using the method of multiple scales, we derive approximate slow flow equations which describe the <b>ion</b> <b>motion.</b> The phase portraits generated from the slow flow equations, {{in the vicinity of}} the jump, display two stable equilibria (centers) and an unstable fixed point (saddle). Numerical studies on the original equation are used to understand the influence of damping and scan rate in causing coherent ion ejection in these experiments. In the forward scan experiments, for a given damping, low scan rates result in coherent <b>motion</b> of <b>ions</b> of a given mass at the jump point. At this point, the amplitude and phase of ions of a given mass, starting at different initial conditions, become effectively identical. As the scan rate is increased, coherence is destroyed. For a given scan rate, increasing damping introduces coherence in <b>ion</b> <b>motion,</b> while decreasing damping destroys this coherence. In reverse scan experiments, for a given damping, very low scan rates will cause coherent <b>ion</b> <b>motion.</b> Increasing the scan rate destroys this coherence.
