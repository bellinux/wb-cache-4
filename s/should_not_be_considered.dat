5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{questioned}} the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the Historia's account of {{the arrival of the}} Germanic invaders in Kent <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of}} the NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E
5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking two of the four submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E

5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a criminal but {{a prisoner of war}} and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even in the}} {{treatment}} of NSAID-induced ulcers, omeprazole proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol, but was significantly better tolerated, so misoprostol <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a first-line treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of Sprague showed no {{interest to the}} invention by Lehovec. Nevertheless, on April 22, 1959 he filed a patent application at his own expense, and then left the United States for two years.

25|$|Thus, in {{speaking}} about southeastern Europe, many classic conceptions and systematizations {{of human development}} during the Palaeolithic (and then by implication the Mesolithic) <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> correct in all cases.
