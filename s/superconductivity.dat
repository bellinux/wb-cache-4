5|$|The {{theory of}} low {{temperature}} <b>superconductivity</b> {{has been well}} understood since the BCS theory of 1957. It {{is based on a}} peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature <b>superconductivity,</b> and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for <b>superconductivity</b> to occur.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{conducted}} other {{investigations that}} were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, <b>superconductivity,</b> and other research.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, yttrium barium {{copper oxide}} {{was found to}} achieve {{high-temperature}} <b>superconductivity.</b> It was only the second material known to exhibit this property, {{and it was the}} first known material to achieve <b>superconductivity</b> above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.]] for YBCO is 93 K and the boiling point of nitrogen is 77 K.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{films with}} defects {{produced}} by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit <b>superconductivity</b> having Tc=3.2 K.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{together}} with Satyendra Nath Bose, Einstein developed {{the theory of}} Bose–Einstein statistics and Bose–Einstein condensates, which {{form the basis for}} superfluidity, <b>superconductivity,</b> and other phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–gallium–cobalt alloy (PuCoGa5) is an {{unconventional}} superconductor, showing <b>superconductivity</b> below 18.5K, {{an order of}} magnitude higher than the highest between heavy fermion systems, and has large critical current.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature <b>superconductivity</b> are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, <b>superconductivity,</b> and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} {{when it is}} cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This is because europium is divalent in the metallic state, and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local magnetic moment (J = 7/2) suppresses the <b>superconductivity,</b> which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu3+).|$|E
5|$|Helium at low {{temperatures}} {{is used in}} cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely {{low temperatures}} required for <b>superconductivity,</b> such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for <b>superconductivity.</b> The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits <b>superconductivity</b> properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in the yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') superconductor developed at the University of Alabama and the University of Houston in 1987. This superconductor is notable because the operating <b>superconductivity</b> temperature is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1K). Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of <b>superconductivity</b> and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of <b>superconductivity,</b> based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

The institution conducts $150million annually in research, and operates more than 40 research centers and institutes on campus. Interdisciplinary research includes <b>superconductivity,</b> space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence. Awarding more than 9,000 degrees annually, UH's alumni base exceeds 260,000. The {{economic impact of the}} university contributes over $3billion annually to the Texas economy, while generating about 24,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature <b>superconductivity,</b> topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E
5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} <b>superconductivity.</b> In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The inner campus {{contains}} the academic {{core of the}} university and consists of the M.D. Anderson Library, the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics including the Physics Department, the College of Technology, and the HonorsCollege. The interior of the campus has the original buildings: the Roy G. Cullen Building, the Old Science Building, and the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. Academic and research facilities include the Cullen Performance Hall, the Science and Engineering Research and Classroom Complex, and Texas Center for <b>Superconductivity,</b> and various other science and liberal arts buildings. This area of campus features the reflecting pool at Cullen Family Plaza, the Lynn Eusan Park, and various plazas and green spaces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Superconductivity</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of certain materials exhibiting zero electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields below a characteristic temperature. The history of <b>superconductivity</b> began with Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's discovery of <b>superconductivity</b> in mercury in 1911. Since then, many other superconducting materials have been discovered and the theory of <b>superconductivity</b> has been developed. These subjects remain active areas of study {{in the field of}} condensed matter physics.|$|E
25|$|The {{cryotron}} is {{a switch}} that operates using <b>superconductivity.</b> The cryotron {{works on the}} principle that magnetic fields destroy <b>superconductivity.</b> The cryotron was invented by Dudley Allen Buck in 1957.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consultant}} to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on <b>superconductivity.</b> Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed in 1932 that the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys <b>superconductivity</b> varies with the shape of the body. Laue published a total of 12 papers and a book on <b>superconductivity.</b> One of the papers was co-authored with Fritz London and his brother Heinz. Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} many {{technological}} applications of <b>superconductivity,</b> including superconducting magnets.|$|E
25|$|Until 1986, {{physicists}} {{had believed}} that BCS theory forbade <b>superconductivity</b> at temperatures above about 30K. In that year, Bednorz and Müller discovered <b>superconductivity</b> in a lanthanum-based cuprate perovskite material, {{which had a}} transition temperature of 35K (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1987). It was soon found that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium (i.e.,making YBCO) raised the critical temperature to 92K.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Fritz London {{proposed}} BEC as {{a mechanism}} for superfluidity in 4He and <b>superconductivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of nanotechnology, heat {{resistance}} and <b>superconductivity</b> {{are some of the}} more heavily studied properties.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic <b>superconductivity</b> {{has been}} reported, {{although}} other experiments {{found no evidence}} of this, leaving the claim a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|M.I. Zelikin {{proposed}} (2006) {{an explanation}} (with a rigorous mathematical foundation) {{based on the}} hypothesis of plasma <b>superconductivity</b> (see also).|$|E
25|$|Scientists and technologists {{routinely}} achieve temperatures {{close to}} absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as <b>superconductivity</b> and superfluidity.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, room-temperature <b>superconductivity</b> was {{attained}} in YBCO for picoseconds, using short {{pulses of}} infrared laser light to deform the material's crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{proposed}} that the same mechanism that produces <b>superconductivity</b> could produce a superinsulator state in some materials, with almost infinite electrical resistance.|$|E
25|$|A {{narrow band}} or {{strongly}} correlated electronic system and degenerated ground states are important points to understand in explaining <b>superconductivity</b> in fullerene solids. When the inter-electron repulsion U {{is greater than}} the bandwidth, an insulating localized electron ground state is produced in the simple Mott–Hubbard model. This explains the absence of <b>superconductivity</b> at ambient pressure in caesium-doped C60 solids. Electron-correlation-driven localization of the t1u electrons exceeds the critical value, leading to the Mott insulator. The application of high pressure decreases the interfullerene spacing, therefore caesium-doped C60 solids turn to metallic and superconducting.|$|E
25|$|Onnes {{conducted}} an experiment, in 1912, on the usability of <b>superconductivity.</b> Onnes introduced an electric current into a superconductive ring {{and removed the}} battery that generated it. Upon measuring the electric current, Onnes found that its intensity did not diminish with the time. The current persisted due to the superconductive state of the conductive medium. In subsequent decades, <b>superconductivity</b> was found in several other materials. In 1913, lead was found to superconduct at 7 K, and in 1941 niobium nitride was found to superconduct at 16 K.|$|E
25|$|Many other cuprate superconductors {{have since}} been discovered, and the theory of <b>superconductivity</b> in these {{materials}} {{is one of the}} major outstanding challenges of theoretical condensed matter physics.|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} {{focuses on}} cuprate <b>superconductivity,</b> conceptual issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, superfluidity in highly degenerate atomic gases, low temperature properties of amorphous solids and topological quantum computation.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Bardeen, in {{collaboration}} with Leon Cooper and his doctoral student John Robert Schrieffer, proposed the standard theory of <b>superconductivity</b> known as the BCS theory (named for their initials).|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the heat capacity and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which <b>superconductivity</b> is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Superconductivity</b> was {{discovered}} on April 8, 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was studying {{the resistance of}} solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently produced liquid helium as a refrigerant. At the temperature of 4.2K, he observed that the resistance abruptly disappeared. In the same experiment, he also observed the superfluid transition of helium at 2.2K, without recognizing its significance. The precise date and circumstances of the discovery were only reconstructed a century later, when Onnes's notebook was found. In subsequent decades, <b>superconductivity</b> was observed in several other materials. In 1913, lead was found to superconduct at 7K, and in 1941 niobium nitride was found to superconduct at 16K.|$|E
