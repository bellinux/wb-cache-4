40|$|Abstract: Cyberworlds are {{distributed}} systems where data and their dependencies are constantly changing and evolving. In such business application systems, combinatorial explosion happens because you must modify schemas and application programs whenever schemas change, {{if you use}} existing techniques. To solve the problem, we have developed a data processing system called Cellular Data System (CDS) based on the cellular model, which is considered the most appropriate to model cyberworlds, using an algebra system called Formula Expression. In this paper, we design and implement a condition formula and its processing maps as an important function in CDS. A condition <b>formula</b> <b>search</b> is a very effective measure {{when you want to}} analyze data in cyberworlds without losing consistency in the entire system, since you can search for the data you want without changing application programs, if you employ a condition <b>formula</b> <b>search.</b> That is, a condition <b>formula</b> <b>search</b> is an analysis measure for the worlds under the assumption of frequent changes of schemas. Therefore, if you use CDS, the development process is completely different from the general one, since {{we do not have to}} design business specification clearly at requirements analysis.

This model assumes that there is a stationary searcher having a 'cookie-cutter' sensor located {{in the center of the}} search area. A Monte-Carlo simulation computer program was used to generate the non-detection probabilities. The output of this program was used to construct the required mathematical model. The model predicts, and simulation supports, that as the mean segment length of the random tour becomes small with respect to the square root of the area size, the probability of non-detection approaches that previously obtained for a diffusing target. In the opposite extreme, the probability of non-detection approaches the general form of Koopman's random <b>search</b> <b>formula.</b> Keywords: Diffusion; RATSIM Computer program; FORTRAN; RATSIM (Random Tour Simulation).

40|$|The {{computation}} {{of image}} segmentation {{has become more}} complicated with {{the increasing number of}} thresholds, and the option and application of the thresholds in image thresholding fields have become an NP problem at the same time. The paper puts forward the modified discrete grey wolf optimizer algorithm (MDGWO), which improves on the optimal solution updating mechanism of the search agent by the weights. Taking Kapur’s entropy as the optimized function and based on the discreteness of threshold in image segmentation, the paper firstly discretizes the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and then proposes a new attack strategy by using the weight coefficient to replace the <b>search</b> <b>formula</b> for optimal solution used in the original algorithm. The experimental results show that MDGWO can search out the optimal thresholds efficiently and precisely, which are very close to the result examined by exhaustive searches. In comparison with the electromagnetism optimization (EMO), the differential evolution (DE), the Artifical Bee Colony (ABC), and the classical GWO, it is concluded that MDGWO has advantages over the latter four in terms of image segmentation quality and objective function values and their stability...|$|E

Potentially active compounds of the leaves include vitamins, simple/complex polysaccharides, minerals, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of aloe in patients with gingivitis. Methods: Using the <b>search</b> <b>formula</b> "Gingivitis [title/abstract] AND Aloe vera/ Aloe [all fields]", electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Science direct and Cochrane library were searched for clinical trials on treatments containing aloe for gingivitis and relevant articles with English full-text from 2000 until 2017 were finally included.  Results: Total of 8 clinical trials were finally included in this paper. Various preparations of aloe such as mouth rinse and dentifrice have been investigated in patients with gingivitis. Each study has measured the periodontal health via a specific index including plaque index, gingivitis index, and bleeding index, as well as the microbial count and composition of the oral cavity and biomarkers of inflammation in crevicular fluid and aloe could significantly improve the above mentioned parameters.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{was motivated by}} a study performed by Commander Submarine Force Pacific (COMSUBAC) of detection rates for a random search model. COMSUBPAC's study included that the probability of nondetection to time t, PND (t), was not of the form exp (-y t), as believed by many. The target motion model used for that study was a new and interesting model, therefore this investigation began by analyzing that model. This investigation discovered that the density of targets for COMSUBPAC's motion model was not uniform over the search area, which {{might lead to a}} nonexponential form for PND (t). To lend support to the hypothesis that a uniform distribution of target position can lead to an exponential form of PD (t) the target motion was altered to achieve a uniform target density. The same basic target motion was used because of its inherent advantages over other target motion models. Three different types of boundary reflection patterns were analyzed for their ability to create a uniform target density. Two of those patterns were successful, but only one was suitable for further analysis. Support for the hypothesis was achieved when the PND (t) using this new uniform density target motion model was found to be of exponential form. It was also discovered that the exponential detection rates for this new simulation model were very close to the detection rates predicted by B. 0.

40|$|Background: Arachidonic acid (ARA) is a {{precursor}} of various lipid mediators. ARA metabolites such as thromboxane A 2 cause platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, thus {{may lead to}} atherosclerotic disease. It is unclear whether dietary ARA influences the ARA-derived lipid mediator balance and the risk for atherosclerotic diseases, such as cerebral ischemia. Considering the function of ARA in atherosclerosis, {{it is reasonable to}} focus on the atherothrombotic type of cerebral ischemia risk. However, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the effect of habitual ARA exposure on cerebral ischemia risk. We aimed to systematically evaluate observational studies available on the relationship between ARA exposure and the atherothrombotic type of cerebral ischemia risk in free-living populations. Summary: The PubMed database was searched for articles registered up to June 24, 2014. We designed a PubMed <b>search</b> <b>formula</b> as follows: key words for humans AND brain ischemia AND study designs AND ARA exposure. Thirty-three articles were reviewed against predefined criteria. There were 695 bibliographies assessed from the articles that included both ARA and cerebral ischemia descriptions. Finally, we identified 11 eligible articles and categorized them according to their reporting and methodological quality. We used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Statement (STROBE) checklist to score the reporting quality. The methodological quality was qualitatively assessed based on the following aspects: subject selection, ARA exposure assessment, outcome diagnosis, methods for controlling confounders, and statistical analysis. We did not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity among the studies. All eligible studies measured blood ARA levels as an indicator of exposure. Our literature search did not identify any articles that evaluated dietary ARA intake and tissue ARA as assessments of exposure. Seven of the 11 eligible articles were considered to be of low quality. No articles reported a dose-dependent positive association between an increased cerebral ischemia risk and ARA exposure. However, most studies did not assess the risk in each subtype of cerebral ischemia, thus various etiological types of cerebral ischemia risk were involved in their results. Key Messages: We did not find a positive association between ARA exposure and cerebral ischemia risk. Eligible studies reported inconsistent findings: cerebral ischemia risk did not change or significantly decreased. We could not draw any conclusions due to the limited number of eligible high-quality studies. Further evidence from well-designed observational studies is required. Simultaneously, in order to develop effective preventive measures against cerebral ischemia, it is imperative to establish standardized definitions, nomenclatures, classifications, and diagnostic procedures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Computational {{fixed point}} theorems {{can be used}} to {{automatically}} verify existence and uniqueness of a solution to a nonlinear system of n equations in n variables ranging within a given region of n-space. Such computations succeed, however, only when the Jacobi matrix is nonsingular everywhere in this region. However, in problems such as bifurcation problems or surface intersection problems, the Jacobi matrix can be singular, or nearly so, at the solution. For n real variables, when the Jacobi matrix is singular, tiny perturbations of the problem can result in problems either with no solution in the region, or with more than one; thus no general computational technique can prove existence and uniqueness. However, for systems of n complex variables, the multiplicity of such a solution can be verified. That {{is the subject of this}} paper. Suchverification is possible by computing the topological degree, but suchcomputations heretofore have required a global search on the (n − 1) -dimensional boundary of an n-dimensional region.
