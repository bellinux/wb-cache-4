25|$|Neither Pliny nor Trajan {{mentions}} {{the crime that}} Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> to what that crime could be, but a likely element may be the stubborn refusal of Christians to worship Roman gods; making them appear as objecting to Roman rule.|$|E

She also decided to greet anyone properly dressed—regardless of race—who attended her afternoon receptions, but never questioned why blacks failed to call on her. The <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> was that White House security prevented them from doing so.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have long}} debated {{how and why}} many Bosnians {{converted}} to Islam. There is no <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> to this question, and the underlying reasons are complex and numerous. One important {{fact is that the}} Ottomans did not, as a rule, actively seek to convert their Christian subjects to Islam (the many generations it took for Bosnia to become predominantly Muslim and the retaining of Slavic customs among converts testify to this). The Ottoman Empire at the time was centered on militaristic expansion independent of religion, and the primary split was not between Muslims and nonbelievers but between the military-administrative class (the Ottomans) and various classes of serfs (known as rayah), neither of which was exclusive to any particular faith. Though the state eventually acquired a more Islamic focus, by this time, Muslims already made up a large majority of Bosnia's population.|$|E
25|$|In 1175, {{the emperor}} was seriously ill {{and decided to}} entrust the regentship of his son Lý Long Trát to Tô Hiến Thành. The regent was {{appointed}} to the position of chancellor of the Lý Dynasty (Thái phó bình chương quân quốc trọng sự) and granted the title Prince (Vương) — an unprecedented act of a Lý emperor for a title that was reserved exclusively for members of the royal family. During the Lý Dynasty, Tô Hiến Thành was the only possessor of the title Prince who did not come from the Lý royal family. From the fourth month of 1175, Tô Hiến Thành began his regency because the emperor was not able to rule the country as the crown prince was only two years old. The emperor died in the seventh month in 1175 and began the campaign of the Empress Mother in supporting another prince, Lý Long Xưởng, to replace the infant emperor Lý Long Trát, now Lý Cao Tông. The Empress Mother tried to bribe Tô Hiến Thành's wife and persuaded the regent many times. Tô Hiến Thành refused by a <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> that he had to follow the order of the late emperor and preferred being honest to being rich but disloyal. His firmness in refusing the proposal of the Empress Mother and controlling the army and order during the funeral time made other officials believe in Lý Cao Tông. They therefore declined the campaign of replacing him by the prince Lý Long Xưởng.|$|E

The <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> is quite probably yes as the band use a refreshing formula that challenges the Church instead of serving up milk and cookies". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three out of five stars, opining [...] "Overall, Lifesong is musically an assortment of experimentation and familiarity, as the band continues to offer songs with relatable messages to the church body. Frontman and chief songwriter Mark Hall's strained, shouting-style vocals is [...] still an acquired taste, along with his straightforward and often simplistic lyrics, but Lifesong is a noteworthy second chapter in an already impressive career for this young band". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting [...] " [...] comes from the school of U2-influenced modern-worship music, so its songs predictably build to sweeping choruses and dramatic climaxes. The band's message is more distinctive, calling out the [...] "happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples" [...] to offer themselves to the lonely, the grieving, the desperate".|$|E
500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the <b>simple</b> <b>answer</b> is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia.

40|$|Young {{children}} {{answer questions}} with longer delays than adults do, and they don't reach typical adult response times until several years later. We hypothesized that this prolonged pattern of delay in children's timing results from competing demands: {{to give an}} answer, children must understand a question while simultaneously planning and initiating their response. Even as children get older and more efficient in this process, the demands on them increase because their verbal responses become more complex. We analyzed conversational question-answer sequences between caregivers and their children from ages 1; 8 to 3; 5, finding that children (1) initiate <b>simple</b> <b>answers</b> more quickly than complex ones, (2) initiate <b>simple</b> <b>answers</b> quickly from an early age, and (3) initiate complex answers more quickly as they grow older. Our results suggest that children aim to respond quickly from the start, improving on earlier-acquired answer types while they begin to practice later-acquired, slower ones...|$|R
