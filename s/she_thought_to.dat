25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes at what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a tanker as it {{emerged from a}} rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|E
25|$|Tunny {{returned}} to waters off Toagel Mlungui and resumed patrols. On {{the morning of}} 29 March, she observed {{a large number of}} small vessels leaving Malakal Harbor, none worth an attack. Apparently, the enemy had somehow received word of the Fifth Fleet's impending bombing attack on Japanese installations in the Caroline Islands and made a desperate attempt to clear the area. Late in the afternoon, a larger formation appeared: the 63,000-ton battleship Musashi, the light cruiser , and three destroyers, also fleeing the expected aerial bombardment. After a daring approach, Tunny fired six torpedoes at the battleship from her bow tubes. The torpedoes passed directly under an alert destroyer of the screen which immediately hoisted flags to warn the battleship, swung parallel to the torpedo tracks, and made a run on the submarine. Tunny went deep and ran for the southwest while the destroyer dropped 38 depth charges in a short, but concentrated counterattack. One torpedo had found its mark on the battleship's bow, which caused flooding of the hydrophone compartment and 18 casualties. Toward sunset, the submarine lost contact with the formation. Later that night, she encountered what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the same force and was held down for two hours by one of the escorting ships. Hits by two of Tunnys torpedoes had damaged but failed to slow the powerful battleship. However, Musashi was still forced to return to port for repairs and upgrades, which kept her out of action for most of April.|$|E

500|$|Murasaki {{disliked the}} men at court whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was {{involved}} romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself, [...] "'You know what? Don’t even {{think that you can}} keep on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances reached a point where she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.|$|E
500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E

500|$|Swift self-penned [...] "Our Song" [...] for {{the talent}} show of her {{freshman}} {{year in high school}} with no intentions of including it on her debut album. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates. [...] "I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one", she said. The writing process, as with her lead single [...] "Tim McGraw", took place in approximately 20 minutes. Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines. [...] "They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'", Swift recalled. When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift, Swift [...] "stood by" [...] "Our Song", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she [...] "knew there was something about it." [...] She concluded, [...] "I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing." [...] Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase [...] "Play it again", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose [...] "Our Song" [...] to be the third single from Taylor Swift, which Swift was surprised yet glad about.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{motorcade}} {{turned the corner}} onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a motorcycle backfiring and {{did not realize that}} it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures [...] "of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all".|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{revealed}} that Darren's ex-girlfriend, Cindy Cunningham would {{become involved in}} the storyline when Margaret begins trying to [...] "push" [...] Cindy and Darren together. Nancy begins to suspect Darren is having an affair with Cindy which begins because he has [...] "been behaving a bit strangely" [...] while planning the secret wedding. When Cindy helps Darren with planning the wedding they embrace which is witnessed by Nancy which [...] "confirms everything that <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>To</b> Nancy, it seems that everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". Her portrayer explained that she would have expected Nancy to confront Cindy but Nancy can not [...] "bring herself to do it. [...] you see that this relationship has meant more to Nancy than any other. She's deeply, deeply hurt". Dawson explained that the storyline is [...] "just a case of Nancy getting things misconstrued" [...] and {{that it is not a}} [...] "obvious affair plot".|$|E

Mead {{wrote about}} Blavatsky, [...] "I know {{no one who}} detested, more than she did, any attempt to hero-worship herselfshe {{positively}} physically shuddered at any expression of reverence to herselfas a spiritual teacher; I have heard her cry out in genuine alarm at an attempt to kneel to her made by an enthusiastic admirer." [...] Leo Klejn wrote about Blavatsky, [...] "Indefatigability and energy of this woman were surprising. She had a revolutionary's merits." [...] Another person who said Blavatsky was a remarkable woman was a former associate {{and publisher of the}} Theosophical magazine [...] "Lucifer" [...] 1887–1889, Mabel Collins. After leaving the movement she said [...] "She taught me one great lesson. I learned from her how foolish, how 'gullible', how easily flattered human beings are, taken en masse. Her contempt for her kind was on the same gigantic scale as everything else about her, except her marvellously delicate taper fingers. In all else, she was a big woman. She had a greater power over the weak and credulous, a greater capacity for making black appear white, a larger waist, a more voracious appetite, a more confirmed passion for tobacco, a more ceaseless and insatiable hatred for those whom <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be her enemies, a greater disrespect for les convenances, a worse temper, a greater command of bad language, and a greater contempt for the intelligence of her fellow-beings than I had ever supposed possible to be contained in one person. These, I suppose, must be reckoned as her vices, though whether a creature so indifferent to all ordinary standards of right and wrong can be held to have virtues or vices, I know not." ...|$|E
