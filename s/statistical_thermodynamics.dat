25|$|There {{are three}} {{equilibrium}} ensembles {{with a simple}} form that can be defined for any isolated system bounded inside a finite volume. These are the most often discussed ensembles in <b>statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|In {{association}} with Clausius, in 1871, the Scottish mathematician and physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated a new branch of thermodynamics called <b>Statistical</b> <b>Thermodynamics,</b> which functions to analyze {{large numbers of}} particles at equilibrium, i.e., systems where no changes are occurring, such that only their average properties as temperature T, pressure P, and volume V become important.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{scientists}} such as Ludwig Boltzmann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and James Clerk Maxwell gave entropy {{a statistical}} basis. In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic {{way to measure}} the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the logarithm {{of the number of}} microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in <b>statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> i.e. according to Erwin Schrödinger, has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy E over N identical systems.|$|E
25|$|One {{special class}} of {{ensemble}} is those ensembles {{that do not}} evolve over time. These ensembles are known as equilibrium ensembles and their condition is known as statistical equilibrium. Statistical equilibrium occurs if, for each state in the ensemble, the ensemble also contains all of its future and past states with probabilities equal to the probability of being in that state. The study of equilibrium ensembles of isolated systems {{is the focus of}} <b>statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case of ensembles that change over time, and/or ensembles of non-isolated systems.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig Boltzmann {{suggested}} in 1877 {{that the energy}} levels of a physical system, such as a molecule, could be discrete. He was {{a founder of the}} Austrian Mathematical Society, together with the mathematicians Gustav von Escherich and Emil Müller. Boltzmann's rationale for the presence of discrete energy levels in molecules such as those of iodine gas had its origins in his <b>statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> and statistical mechanics theories and was backed up by mathematical arguments, as would also be the case twenty years later with the first quantum theory put forward by Max Planck.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{application}} of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was extended {{early on to}} the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged in the following decades. <b>Statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{is commonly}} used to explain the thermodynamic behaviour of large systems. This branch of statistical mechanics, which treats and extends classical thermodynamics, is known as <b>statistical</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> or equilibrium statistical mechanics. Microscopic mechanical laws do not contain concepts such as temperature, heat, or entropy; however, statistical mechanics shows how these concepts arise from the natural uncertainty {{about the state of}} a system when that system is prepared in practice. The benefit of using statistical mechanics is that it provides exact methods to connect thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behaviour, whereas, in classical thermodynamics, the only available option would be to just measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials. Statistical mechanics also makes it possible to extend the laws of thermodynamics to cases which are not considered in classical thermodynamics, such as microscopic systems and other mechanical systems with few degrees of freedom.|$|E
