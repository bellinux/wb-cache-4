While this study provides quantitative and empirical evidence relating the mixing time to core structure of <b>social</b> <b>graphs,</b> it also agrees with our previous remarks on the potential relationship between the tight-knit community structure and slow mixing <b>social</b> <b>graphs.</b> Equipped with with these findings, we advance this vein of research in several directions.

40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} many social media sites with {{a very large number}} of users. Users of social media sites and {{relationships}} between them can be modelled as a graph. Such graphs can be analysed using methods from social network analysis (SNA). Many measures used in SNA rely on computation of shortest paths between nodes of a graph.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ever-increasing}} {{popularity of}} social networks opens {{new directions for}} leveraging social networks to build primitives for security and communication, in many contexts. Such primitives utilize the trust in these social networks to ensure collaboration and algorithmic properties exhibited in such networks to argue for the effectiveness of such primitives. Despite the importance of such properties and their quality to the operation of these primitives, less effort is made to measure these properties and understand the relationship among them and to other characteristics of social networks. We extend our earlier results measuring the mixing time, to investigate a new property used for building Sybil defenses, namely the expansion of <b>social</b> <b>graphs.</b> We measure the expansion of <b>social</b> <b>graphs,</b> and show quantitatively that, with a few exceptions, it is sufficient to support Sybil defense mechanisms based on expansion. We relate the mixing time of <b>social</b> <b>graphs</b> to graph degeneracy, which captures cohesiveness of the graph.

We analyze two recently proposed schemes and their fitting into the model. We also point out disadvantages in each method and present several elegant techniques to fill the gap between them.

40|$|Degree {{distribution}} {{models are}} incredibly important tools for analyzing {{and understanding the}} structure and formation of social networks, and can help guide the design of efficient graph algorithms. In particular, the Power-law degree distribution has long been used to model the structure of online social networks, and {{is the basis for}} algorithms and heuristics in graph applications such as influence maximization and social search. Along with recent measurement results, our interest in this topic was sparked by our own experimental results on <b>social</b> <b>graphs</b> that deviated significantly from those predicted by a Power-law model. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of these deviations, and propose an alternative model with significant implications on graph algorithms and applications. We start by quantifying this artifact using a variety of real <b>social</b> <b>graphs,</b> and show that their structures cannot be accurately modeled using elementary distributions including the Power-law. Instead, we propose the Pareto-Lognormal (PLN) model, verify its goodness-of-fit using graphical and statistical methods, and present an analytical study of its asymptotical differences with the Power-law. To demonstrate the quantitative benefits of the PLN model, we compare the results of three wide-ranging graph applications on real <b>social</b> <b>graphs</b> against those on synthetic graphs generated using the PLN and Power-law models. We show that synthetic graphs generated using PLN are much better predictors of degree distributions in real graphs, and produce experimental results with errors that are orders-of-magnitude smaller than those produced by the Power-law model...|$|R

Orion uses a landmark-based approach, which does not {{take account of the}} shortest-path distances be-tween non-landmark nodes in coordinate calculation. Such biased input for the coordinate system cannot characterize the graph structure well. In this paper, we propose Pomelo, which calculates the graph coordinates in a decentralized manner.

By introducing the novel partial BFS, the com-putational overhead of Pomelo is tunable.
