50|$|Each {{power has}} one home port, to which newly {{manufactured}} ships and aircraft are stationed upon completion. During the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Phase,</b> aircraft may {{be transferred to}} any region, while it takes ships or fleets several weeks to travel from region to region. There are also 14 key regions throughout the world which are vital strategic ports with repair facilities for ships. As not all ports have this capability, control of these key regions is crucial {{in order to maintain}} the fighting capabilities of one's fleet at sea with less turnaround time for ship repair when ships are damaged in combat. The invasion of a central naval port in itself however, does not guarantee the surrender of a naval power, and may require the entire surrounding region to be occupied before starting the invasion.|$|E

40|$|Review of the {{strategy}} literature indicates there has been five phases {{in the evolution of}} the field since World War II. The paradigm was at its peak in the 1970 s with the <b>strategic</b> planning <b>phase,</b> however, prescriptive approaches to strategy formulation and implementation were demonstrated to be inadequate in this period in the face of environmental uncertainty. In the 1980 s the field evolved into the <b>strategic</b> management <b>phase</b> with a focus on the combination of the firm’s resources to achieve competitive advantage. The prescriptive literature progressed further in this decade with Porter’s strong contribution in understanding the external context confronting organisations. The resource-based view of the firm, grounded in the descriptive literature, also enhanced the paradigm’s knowledge of the firm’s internal processes. However, despite these developments by the mid- 1980 s it was evident that the <b>strategic</b> management <b>phase</b> was not addressing shortcomings in strategy implementation. At this time a greater sense of the importance of organisational culture and internal politics developed in {{the strategy}} process. The ineffectiveness of strategic management in this decade led many experts to emphasise the need for strategic thinking. In the 1990 s a debate has evolved as to whether strategy should be practiced as art, science or a combination of both. ...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{development}} involves myriads of interrelated processes {{which include}} series {{of decision making}} functions. Decision making is a multi-level process that influences {{the success of a}} proposed housing project. A housing project may fail or suffer some of serious setback if the decision making function is flawed or has been made on an ad hoc basis or based on unreliable, imperfect or hazy information. Decisions have to be made empirically using scientific methods and tools based on accurate and reliable data and information in today’s business environment. The main aim {{of this study is to}} develop a process model for investment decision making in housing development at the <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> of the project that is, initiation and feasibility stages in Malaysia. The objectives of this study are three pronged – one, to identify the decision making practiced among Malaysian housing developers, two to identify the methods and tools used by them to make decisions and three to determine the types of information required for making decisions. This research involved the development of theoretical model by synthesising the models developed by a number of prominent authors and researchers on the subject of decision making. It also uses the Delphi method to collect and analyse the appropriate data and information. For a start of the study, 50 numbers of developers were selected as samples. But only 34 responded to the second stage of the information gathering process. At the final stage of the study only 12 developers or participants were left for the final process of the study. The data was analysed using the descriptive statistical techniques. This study affirms that Malaysian developers tend to make their investment decisions based on simple interpolation of historical data and using simple statistical or mathematical techniques in deciding the investment. This study suggested that the Malaysian housing developers skipped several important decision making functions. These shortcomings were mainly due to time and financial constraints and the lack of statistical or mathematical expertise among the professionals and managers in the organisations. The findings allowed a critical review of the theoretical model which followed by the development of a revised process model of decision making for housing development at <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> i. e. at the initial and feasibility stages...|$|E

This study discusses the needs and problems developing nations may encounter in developing such a management system and also considers the ways and means to meet these needs and overcome these problems. The study suggests that coastal nations should adopt an integrated three phased ocean policy process consisting of a (1) priority establishment phase (policy formulation) (2) <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> (planning) and (3) tactical phase (management). The study further discusses the institutional problems which will accompany a nation ocean management effort. Because governmental institutions are arranged according to the major economic and social sectors and because ocean uses cross all sectoral boundaries the administration of the EEZ as a unit does not conform well to any individual sector. Thus the idea of comprehensive and integrated institutions for national ocean management is also explored. The institutional problem is highlighted by several case study examples...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} of handling the airspace sector congestion subject to continuously growing air traffic, we suggest to create a collaborative working plan during the <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> of air traffic control. The plan obtained via a new decision support tool {{presented in this article}} consists in a schedule for controllers, which specifies time of overflight on the different waypoints of the flight plans. In order to do it, we believe that the decision-support tool shall model directly the uncertainty at a trajectory level in order to propagate the uncertainty to the sector level. Then, the probability of congestion for any sector in the airspace can be computed. Since air traffic regulations and sector congestion are antagonist, we designed and implemented a multi-objective optimization algorithm for determining the best trade-off between these two criteria. The solution comes up as a set of alternatives for the multi-sector planner where the severity of the congestion cost is adjustable. In this paper, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to solve an artificial benchmark problem involving 24 aircraft and 11 sectors, and is able to provide a good approximation of the Pareto front.

40|$|Although the {{technological}} approach of Knowledge Management (KM) is greatly shared, without awareness, when elaborating KM initiative’s strategy, we can confuse {{the notions of}} information and knowledge, and disregard the importance of individual’s tacit knowledge used in action. Therefore, to avoid misunderstanding during the <b>strategic</b> orientation <b>phase</b> of a general KM initiative development, it is fundamental to clearly distinguish the notion of information from the notion of knowledge. Further, we insist on the importance to integrate the individual {{as a component of}} the Enterprise’s Information and Knowledge System (EIKS). In this paper, we argue that Knowledge cannot be considered as an object such as data are in digital information systems. Consequently, we propose an empirical model enabling to distinguish the notions of information and knowledge. This model shows the role of individual’s interpretative frameworks and tacit knowledge, establishing a discontinuity between information and knowledge. This pragmatic vision needs thinking about the architecture of an Enterprise’s Information and Knowledge System (EIKS), which must be a basis of discussion during the <b>strategic</b> orientation <b>phase</b> of a KM initiative.

40|$|Among many {{behaviour}} changes {{associated with}} recent declines in HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe, {{the number of}} men reporting buying sex halved between 1999 and 2005 possibly due to economic deterioration reducing disposable income. As the economy recovers, a key question is how this is reflected in sexual behaviour trends. A recent modelling analysis of the modes of transmission of HIV in Zimbabwe suggested diminished role for sex work in driving new infections. A central conclusion was that the analysis was hampered by a lack of contemporary data on sex work in Zimbabwe. As Zimbabwe enters a new <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> of policy towards interventions, the data of the women at risk study are timely. Sex workers – defined broadly as women > 17 years old who received money, goods or any form of material benefit in exchange for sexual intercourse – were enrolled into a 12 month cohort across four socio-economic areas in rural Zimbabwe. Biological and behavioural data were collected. Two methods were used to recruit women: a venue-based strategy; and a modified snowball. Women were asked questions for 20 - 30 minutes in a face-to-face interview delivered either onsite in venues or at an arranged meeting time.

40|$|Most {{impacts on}} {{providing}} ecosystem services (ESs) {{are related to}} land use changes that may cause ecosystem fragmentation and loss of ecosystem functions. Spatial planning, focusing on sustainable landscape development, should consider the local potential for providing ESs as well possible impacts due to land use changes. The results {{of a large number}} of recent studies on ES assessment are difficult to replicate and integrate into landscape planning or definition of land use policies. The time and resource constraints, needed in data gathering and analysis, limit local administrations in the concern about ES. Extending the approach of spatially explicit benefit transfer, we present an expert-based estimation of land use potential in providing ES. We enhanced ES estimations related to different land use classes (in terms of D/ha year) by considering “local conditions” such as elevation and distance from urban areas, assuming these spatial characteristics can affect ES provisioning. The adaptation for “local conditions” was performed through expert consultation, using Delphi survey and focus groups, involving 46 experts from 10 Italian research institutions. In detail, we used land cover maps for 1990 and 2000, and aggregated the results on the province scale. The results show spatial pattern of gains and losses in ES values for Italian provinces. The province level of aggregation seems to be effective for dealing with <b>strategic</b> <b>phase</b> of spatial planning.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{comparative}} study of the strategy formation process in nine Irish small/medium enterprises (SMEs). The study adopted a longitudinal-processual approach which is still rare in the literature. A conceptual framework was developed from the literature based on three main variables - entrepreneurship, context and history. Realised strategy was seen {{to be the result of}} the interplay between these elements over time. The use of this framework facilitated the development of the study’s main contributions. Among these contributions, the study identified, and distinguished between two types of entrepreneurs - 2 ̆ 7 the pragmatic’ and 2 ̆ 7 charismatic’ types - based on orientation towards risk, underlying personalities and world views. The study also revealed a phase pattern of strategy formation - an early fluid, quasistrategic phase linked through a 2 ̆ 7 defining episode’ (usually a crisis) to a more formal and focused <b>strategic</b> <b>phase.</b> This phase model is developed in the study and presents a perspective on strategy formation in S M E s which departs from the normative rational planning model that still tends to dominate in the literature on SMEs.
