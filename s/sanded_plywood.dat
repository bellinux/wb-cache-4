The examination of trace amounts of intermediate target materials collected {{on the surface of}} spent bullets provides crucial information needed for trajectory reconstruction. Determining the origin of an unknown material adhered to a spent bullet allows for the identification of intermediate targets the bullet either contacted or penetrated during flight. Although significant information can be obtained from examination of these trace materials adhered to spent bullets, this aspect of trajectory reconstruction is often ignored. 	The ability of different bullet types to collect trace materials from intermediate targets and the ability to associate these trace materials to their origin was examined using microscopy and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). Full metal jacket (FMJ), jacketed hollow point (JHP), and lead round nose (LRN) bullets were fired into sheets of five different commonly used building materials (oriented strand board, <b>sanded</b> <b>plywood,</b> white melamine board, synthetic PVC board, and medium density fiberboard) to produce a total of 45 spent bullets to be examined. 	All spent bullets were examined and photographed using a DSLR camera paired with a stereomicroscope. The spent bullets were then examined using DART/MS to determine if any ion profiles generated from the trace materials could be associated with those of the intermediate target building materials which the bullets were fired through. 	The collection of trace material from all five types used was highly dependent on the type of bullet. Very minimal amounts of trace materials were observed on the majority of LRN bullets, which failed to produce an identifiable ion signature. The FMJ bullets that were fired through PVC material collected trace material that produced an ion profile, while all other building materials failed to transfer to the FMJ bullets. All JHP bullets collected significant amounts of the five building materials tested inside the hollow point cavity and along the nose of the bullet. In every spent JHP bullet sample, the trace material collected produced a unique ion profile. Additionally, MS data from four of the five building materials tested matched the MS data generated from trace material collected on JHP bullets from the respective target materials...|$|E

50|$|The boomerang is then thrown {{several times}} to check if it works. The extreme {{subtleties}} of the aerodynamic forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional <b>sanding.</b> <b>Plywood</b> boomerangs may be heated {{for a short time}} in a microwave oven which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. Angle of attack of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall dihedral angle of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.|$|R

50|$|Floors may be {{built on}} beams or joists or use {{structures}} like prefabricated hollow core slabs. The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure but the support and subfloor together always provides {{the strength of a}} floor one can sense underfoot. Nowadays, subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of moisture resistant ('AC' grade, one side finished and <b>sanded</b> flat) <b>plywood</b> or composite sheeting, jointly also termed Underlayments on floor joists of 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12's (dimensional lumber) spaced generally on 16 in centers, in the United States and Canada. Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the 1/2 in sheet material above. These are manufactured in 2 x 2 ft squares and the edges fit together like a mortise and tenon joint. Like a floor on joists not on concrete, a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation about acoustic absorption of mortars with partial replacement of <b>sand</b> by waste (<b>plywood</b> formwork, rice husk, and thermoplastic shoe counters), examining {{different levels of}} replacement (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 %, and 50 %). The measurement of acoustic absorption was performed using a plane wave impedance tube with 100 mm diameter, using mortar samples of 20 mm, in frequency range 200 – 2000 Hz. Results demonstrated that some composite with waste presented noise reduction coefficient (NRC) above the reference mortar (NRC = 0. 0343), such as a composite with 50 % rice husk (NRC = 0. 2757) and other with 50 % of plywood waste (NRC = 0. 2052). Since {{there is virtually no}} cost or difficulty to use these residuals, it may be concluded that it is a sustainable alternative to improve the acoustic comfort and reduce the impact of the waste on the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{institution}} of property rights, {{as an important}} category of constraints or restrictions on human behaviour, provides rules of competition, and delineates the social and legal relationship between a resource owner and the others throughout the world. Forms of ownership rights to resources affect the efficiency of their use. The consensus {{is that in a}} real world with significant transactions costs and scarce resources, private property right systems lead to more efficient resource allocation than the others do. Previous studies about economic implications of non-exclusive resources have focused on the problems of resource misallocations. A few studies also worked on the effects that alternate property rights structures have on the prices and variations in prices of non-exclusive resources. However, the economic analysis of property rights attribute of natural resources used as building materials, such as natural sand and wood, is still an unexplored research area. The objective of the whole research is to empirically verify Angello and Donnelley's (1975) property rights thesis, as reinterpreted by Lai (1993 a) and Lai and Yu (1995), that the variations in prices of non-exclusive resources are much greater than those under more exclusive ownership; and to identify, alternatively, the factors that might have affected ownership rights, inferred from changes in the variations in prices of the resources. In this thesis, published historical data of natural sand, Total declared costs of new buildings completed, Gross & Usable floor area, Gross value of construction work, and published government data of prices for selected buildings materials, namely Portland cement, <b>sand,</b> hardwood, and <b>plywood,</b> were used. The prices of captured and cultured shrimps, which are collected from super market and street market by the author, were also checked and used. These resources are subject to different degrees of access restrictions and, hence, are good candidates for testing the hypotheses. Basically, the hypotheses formulated in this research are strongly supported. The main findings are that the variations in prices of non-exclusive resources are greater than those of exclusive resources; for the same resource, the price ratios of exclusive resource and non-exclusive resource would fall over time. This is an original contribution to the theory of property rights. The originality of this dissertation lies in its exploration of the economic relationship between property rights ownership and selected building materials, {{as well as in the}} application of variances to the research of building materials. This is a novel contribution to research on Hong Kong’s sustainable development as she heavily relies on the real estate market for economic development. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
