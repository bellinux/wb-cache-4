5000|$|The first pioneer Louis Cosset, {{came from}} Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan, was {{established}} in Saint-Narcisse about 1804. Among the other early settlers, many came from the neighboring parishes of St. Lawrence River. The settlement expansion forced the new pioneers to cross a moraine an estimated one kilometer wide. This moraine path of the Mauricie, between <b>Saint-Paulin</b> at the west end and Saint-Raymond at the East end, is about 120 kilometers length. It {{is referred to as}} [...] "Saint-Narcisse Moraine" [...] because this moraine is more prominent at the height of Saint-Narcisse. This geological formation was shaped about 11,000 years ago, {{at the end of the}} last glacial period, with the deposition of various layers of rock at the foot of the gigantic glaciers.|$|E
40|$|In {{the initial}} phase of ripening, the {{microflora}} of bacterial smear surface-ripened cheeses such as Limburger, Taleggio, Brick, Munster and <b>Saint-Paulin</b> {{and that of}} surface mould-ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie may be similar, but ¨ {{at the end of}} the ripening, bacteria such as BreÕibacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Micrococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and moulds such as Penicillium camemberti are, respectively, the dominant microorganisms. Yeasts such as Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Debaryomyces spp., Geotrichum candidum, Pichia spp., Rhodotorula spp., Saccharomyces spp. and Yarrowia lipolytica are often and variably isolated from the smear surface-ripened cheeses. Although not dominant within the microorganisms of the smear surface-ripened cheeses, yeasts establish significant interactions with moulds and especially bacteria, including surface bacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Some aspects of the interactions between yeasts and bacteria in such type of cheeses are considered in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|Last year Trapist cheese, {{the product}} of the monastery Marija Zvijezda in Banja Luka, celebrated 120 years of its production. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present, through {{historical}} development and Trapist cheese characteristics, such an important anniversary to Croatian cheese making industries. The paper describes the way of Trapist cheese from France to Banja Luka, from where it was spread through many countries, especially to former Austro- Hungarian empire. On its way it was also adopted by Croatia through the lastcentury. Organoleptic properties of Trapist cheese, from different origin, as well as its comparison with <b>Saint-Paulin</b> cheese, which can be considered as heritable of the original Port-du Salut, i. e. Port-Salut, are also presented. The same comparison is made with regard to technological process and chemical composition. As a conclusion it is recommended that Croatian types of Trapist cheese should be protected by legislation and defined as standard types...|$|E
