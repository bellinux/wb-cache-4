The fractions of the cluster luminosities in dwarf galaxies fainter than our limits are < 3 × 10 − 3 and < 3 × 10 − 4, respectively. Thus, 2 / 7 of the SNe would be associated with ≤ 3 × 10 − 3 of the luminosity attributed to galaxies.

It uses some basics of a well-known recent Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing proposed by Ulungu et al., which is referred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature as U-MOSA. However, some drawbacks of this algorithm have been found, and are substituted by other ones, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acceptance decision criterion. The MC-MOSA has shown better performance than <b>the</b> U-MOSA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> numerical experiments.

The traditional method is not suitable for real time processing especially when the amount of stream sequences is very large. In this paper, we propose HBR (Hierarchical Boolean Representation), a novel technique for correlation analysis in stream time series. The original stream sequences are transformed into the Macro-Boolean series and the Micro-Boolean series successively, and the candidate correlation set can be easily obtained by simple bit operations. With huge amount of stream series, this method can quickly get the correlation pairs of series efficiently by reducing complicated calculation in a little space. Meanwhile, this approach can update the Boolean series incrementally with very low cost and adjust some important coefficients adaptively by the stream feature. The experimental evaluations show that HBR has excellent computation complexity with high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient method for constructing the basis conversion matrix between two given finite field representations where one is composite. We are motivated {{from the fact}} that using certain representations, e. g. low-Hamming weight polynomial, or composite field representations, permit arithmetic operations such as multiplication and inversion to be computed more efficiently. An earlier work by Paar defines the conversion problem and outlines an exponential time algorithm that requires an exhaustive <b>search</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Another algorithm by Sunar et al provides a polynomial time algorithm for the limited case where the second representation is constructed (rather than initially given).
