40|$|This thesis {{provides}} experimental {{static and}} dynamic results for four pairs of seals, including {{a pair of}} smooth seals and three pairs of centrally <b>grooved</b> <b>seals.</b> The <b>grooved</b> <b>seals</b> have <b>groove</b> depth to clearance ratios (Dg/C) of 5, 10, and 15. The radial clearance of each test seal is 0. 0891 mm. Test conditions include three shaft rotational speeds from 4000 to 10000 rpm, three inlet oil pressures from 24 to 70 bars, and seal dimensionless eccentricities from 0 (centered) to 0. 7. For each pair of test seals, dynamic results include stiffness and damping coefficients; static results include stator position, attitude angles, and seal leakage. Stiffness, damping, and leakage are compared among the seal pairs with various groove depths. Results show that all rotordynamic coefficients consistently decrease with increasing <b>seal</b> <b>groove</b> depths, and <b>seal</b> leakage remains constant through varying groove depths. Additionally, a comparison is made between experimental results of all test seals and XLLubeGT. XLLubeGT is a computer model developed at Texas A&M University, which uses a Reynolds equation + energy equation model to predict dynamic performance of a <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> It operates {{on the assumption that}} the groove is large enough to create separate lands within the seal, creating a zero or negligible pressure perturbation across the seal.

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the tip seal in a tip <b>seal</b> <b>groove,</b> the <b>sealing</b> mechanism of the tip seal is clarified and a design guideline of the tip <b>seal</b> <b>groove</b> is obtained...|$|R

40|$|Helical <b>groove</b> <b>seal</b> is {{designed}} in reactor coolant pump {{to control the}} leakage along the front surface of the impeller face due to its higher resistance than the circumferentially <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> The flow and the friction factors in helical <b>groove</b> <b>seals</b> are predicted by employing a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. The friction factors of the helical <b>groove</b> <b>seals</b> with helix angles varying from 20 [*]deg to 50 [*]deg, at a range of rotational speed and axial Reynolds number, were, respectively, calculated. For the helically grooved stator with the helix angle greater than 20 [*]deg, the leakage shows an upward trend with the helix angle. The circumferentially grooved stator has a lower resistance to leakage than the 20 [*]deg and 30 [*]deg stators. It can be predicated that, for a bigger helix angle, the friction factor increases slightly {{with an increase in}} high axial Reynolds number, which arises from the high-pressure operation condition, and the friction factor is generally sensitive to changes in the helix angle in this operation condition.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{significant}} efforts {{have been made to}} introduce film riding sealing technology on large industrial or aerospace gas turbines. The main challenge comes from the high surface speeds and high temperatures, which lead to large thermal distortions.

To design a seal pad that maximizes force at relatively high film heights, it is important to select the <b>seal</b> <b>groove</b> type that looks the most promising to deliver this characteristic. Several groove types have been assessed as part of this study.

To perform the experiments conveniently and economically, six plates with nozzles and <b>sealing</b> <b>grooves</b> are used to construct a hexahedral shell of the mini heat exchanger based on bolted connections, and the units are easily to be disassembled so that the heat transfer array can be replaced if necessary. The arrangement of micro-tubes is similar to that in the conventional micro shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The experiments are carried out under atmospheric pressure condition, so the inlet temperatures and mass flow rates for both shell-side and tube-side fluids can be adjusted. The heat transfer coefficient is calculated to evaluate the heat transfer efficiency of the array of micro-tubes, and the influences of some parameters, such as tube {{inner diameter}}, tube spacing distance, inlet temperature difference, inlet mass flow rates, etc., on the heat transfer coefficient are investigated. By comparing the heat transfer coefficient of the mini heat exchanger with that of the conventional shell-and-tube heat exchanger, it is revealed that the heat transfer enhancement is realized by using the array of micro-tubes.

A comprehensive analysis is proposed to resolve the effect of modifying the <b>seal</b> <b>grooves</b> geometry on gas film pressure distribution and the seal performance. The effect of the fluid state and the rotational speed on the gas seal performance and internal flow field are studied and presented. The fluid state effect on the gas seal internal flow and performance is studied, Laminar and turbulent flow with RNG K-? turbulence model and LES is examined for the same geometrical and operating conditions. Also different rotational speed effect on gas seal performance is examined for 0, 2500, 5000, 7500 and 10380 rpm. Three taper spiral grooves are studied each with three different angles, including taper grooves in the radial, circumferential and combined radial-circumferential directions. The laminar flow simulation for the dry gas seal agree well with the experimental results more than the turbulent flow simulation which overestimate the pressure distribution inside the seal.

40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the seat ring sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>groove.</b> These <b>sealing</b> surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R

40|$|Rotary engines offer {{higher power}} density, fewer parts and lower {{vibrations}} than conventional reciprocating piston engines. However, rotary engines {{are more difficult}} to seal because of the rotor shape which leads to higher gas leakage and oil consumption resulting in lower efficiency and higher emissions. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a set of multiscale models to assess rotary engine performances by estimating gas leakage, oil consumption, wear and friction. An oil seal multiscale model is developed to estimate internal oil consumption guided by oil transport visualization experiments carried using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A finite element beam model is used to predict the clearance between the oil seals and the side housing for each crank angle in the cycle. From seal-housing clearance, oil transport through the oil seals is calculated using a control volume approach. The main mechanism leading to internal oil consumption is outward scraping of the oil seals due to a lack in conformability of the seals to the distorted side housing, especially next to the intake and exhaust ports. A set of multiscale models are developed for the performance of the apex and side seals. The models are formulated to couple gas flow to the dynamics and deformation of the seals while accurately describing the interfaces between the seals and their profile and groove. The models are used to predict apex and side seal behavior and understand the mechanisms leading to gas leakage. The main leakage mechanisms identified are leakage through (1) the corner seal clearance, (2) the spark plug holes, (3) the flanks of the seals at high speed, and (4) the side piece corner for the apex seals and at the ends of the side seals. The apex seal model shows good agreement with experiments, especially for the pressure in the apex <b>seal</b> <b>groove.</b> It is the first time such comprehensive models are developed for rotary engines and they will be valuable tools to help design more efficient and environment-friendly rotary engines. by Mathieu Picard.
