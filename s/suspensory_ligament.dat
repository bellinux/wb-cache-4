5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. He seemed to have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament,</b> the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E

5000|$|The zonule of Zinn (...) (Zinn's membrane, ciliary zonule) (after Johann Gottfried Zinn) is {{a ring of}} fibrous strands {{forming a}} [...] (little band) that connects the ciliary body with the {{crystalline}} lens of the eye. These fibers are sometimes collectively {{referred to as the}} <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the lens, as they act like <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{infrequent}} complication is injuring of the ureter at {{the level}} of the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of the ovary.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{developments}} of other tissues from the mesonephric duct that persist, e.g. {{the development of}} the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of the ovary.|$|E
25|$|In the female, on {{the other}} hand, the Wolffian bodies and ducts atrophy, leaving behind only {{remnants}} in the adult, involving e.g. {{the development of the}} <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of the ovary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Suspensory</b> <b>ligaments.</b> The {{subcutaneous}} {{layer of}} adipose {{tissue in the}} breast is traversed with thin <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> (Cooper's ligaments) that extend obliquely to the skin surface, and from the skin to the deep pectoral fascia. The structural stability provided by the Cooper's ligaments derives from its closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the fibroblast, interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, axilla, and thorax ligaments.|$|R
50|$|The <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> of Cooper play an {{important}} role in the change in appearance of the breast that often accompanies the development of inflammatory carcinoma of the breast in which blockage of the local lymphatic ducts causes swelling of the breast. Because the skin remains tethered by the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> of Cooper, it takes on a dimpled appearance reminiscent of the peel of an orange (peau d'orange). Carcinomas can also decrease the length of Cooper's ligaments leading to a dimpling.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being attached to the fasciæ and the pubic ramus, it is bound {{to the front of}} the pubic symphysis by the fundiform and <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments.</b>|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} not only to palpate the SDFT but {{the branches of the}} SDFT, the DDFT, check ligament, and <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> as well. These structures could have been damaged {{at the same time as}} the SDFT. Both legs should be checked, although tendinitis usually only occurs in one leg.|$|E
25|$|Seabiscuit {{was injured}} during a race. Woolf, who was riding him, {{said that he}} felt the horse stumble. The injury was not life-threatening, {{although}} many predicted Seabiscuit would never race again. The diagnosis was a ruptured <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> in the front left leg. With Seabiscuit out of action, Smith and Howard concentrated on their horse Kayak II, an Argentine stallion.|$|E
25|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} or {{symphysis pubis}} is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami {{of the left}} and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.|$|E
50|$|The Derby was {{ultimately}} Caractacus' last start. He was entered for the 1862 St. Leger Stakes, but he injured both <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> in his front legs {{shortly before the}} running and was permanently retired from racing.|$|R
50|$|Opposite of {{fixating}} on a near object, the {{ciliary muscle}} relaxes and {{the diameter of}} the lens increases to increase the lens’ size. The tension along the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> is increased to flatten the lens and decrease the curvature and achieve a lower refractive power.|$|R
50|$|Cooper's ligaments (also {{known as}} the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> of Cooper and the fibrocollagenous septa) are {{connective}} tissue in the breast that help maintain structural integrity. They are named for Astley Cooper, who first described them in 1840. Their anatomy can be revealed using Transmission diffraction tomography.|$|R
500|$|The {{clitoral}} body extends up {{to several}} centimeters before reversing direction and branching, resulting in an inverted [...] "V" [...] shape that extends {{as a pair of}} crura ("legs"). The crura are the proximal portions of the arms of the wishbone. Ending at the glans of the clitoris, the tip of the body bends anteriorly away from the pubis. Each crus (singular form of crura) is attached to the corresponding ischial ramus– extensions of the copora beneath the descending pubic rami. Concealed behind the labia minora, the crura end with attachment at or just below the middle of the pubic arch. Associated are the urethral sponge, perineal sponge, a network of nerves and blood vessels, the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> of the clitoris, muscles and the pelvic floor.|$|E
500|$|The {{front and}} back legs of a giraffe {{are about the same}} length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are {{articulated}} by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee. It appears that a <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. The foot of the giraffe reaches a diameter of , and the hoof is [...] high in males and [...] in females. The rear of each hoof is low and the fetlock is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support to the animal's weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.|$|E
2500|$|Proximal check {{ligament}} desmotomy {{has been}} shown to return horses to work faster, but is thought by some to predispose to <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> injury.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} fixate on a near object, the ciliary muscle {{contracts}} around the lens to decrease its size. The <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> relax and the radial tension around the lens is released. This causes the lens {{to form a}} more spherical shape achieving {{a higher level of}} refractive power.|$|R
50|$|The uterus {{contains}} three <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> {{that help}} stabilize {{the position of}} the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus.|$|R
50|$|When the eye {{focuses on}} distant objects, the lens holds {{itself in a}} {{flattened}} shape due to traction from the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments.</b> Ligaments pull {{the edges of the}} elastic lens capsule towards the surrounding ciliary body and by opposing the internal pressure within the elastic lens, keep it relatively flattened.|$|R
2500|$|Anaesthesia of an {{affected}} joint {{is a more}} definitive way of {{confirming the}} presence of pain arising from that joint. Introduction of local anaesthetic into a joint should abolish or at least significantly lessen the lameness. [...] This technique is not absolutely specific, as the distal pouches of the tarsometatarsal joint are immediately adjacent to the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament.</b> This means that anaesthetic in the tarsometatarsal joint can occasionally desensitize pain arising from <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament,</b> giving the false impression that joint pain has been abolished.|$|E
2500|$|Prognosis is {{excellent}} in uncomplicated cases. The horse {{will be able}} to return to full work once the inflammation and pain ceases. Although the horse usually recovers quite quickly, horses with [...] "blind splints" [...] may take longer because there may be impingement on the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament.</b> [...] The calcification of the splint is usually a permanent blemish, though over a period of many years, the excess calcification may be reabsorbed to some degree, occasionally {{to the point that the}} splint is no longer visible.|$|E
2500|$|Because the splint bone {{does have}} some {{mobility}} independent of the cannon bone, it can cause tension and strain on the periosteum of the splint bone where the interosseous ligament attaches. The horse will then lay down new bone and the area will become inflamed. [...] "Blind splints" [...] are named because the bony reaction happens on the inside border between the splint bone and cannon bone, where {{it can not be}} seen, and is usually not palpable. Besides causing pain as any active splint reaction can, the swelling can impinge on the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament.</b> This condition is difficult to diagnose, but ultrasound is generally diagnostic. [...] MRI and CT also show these well.|$|E
40|$|Fractures and dislocations of {{the outer}} {{clavicle}} commonly occur due to a direct blow to the shoulder. Nonoperative treatment can be offered to most patients with mild to moderately displaced acromioclavicular dislocation. If there is a disruption of the <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments</b> of the clavicle, surgical reduction and stabilisation is the preferred option. 4 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The breast-lift {{correction}} of a sagging bust is a surgical operation that cuts and removes excess tissues (glandular, adipose, skin), overstretched <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments,</b> excess {{skin from the}} skin-envelope, and transposes the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. In surgical practice, mastopexy can be performed as a discrete breast-lift procedure, and as a subordinate surgery within a combined mastopexy–breast augmentation procedure.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0-4.5 mm milk ducts are {{immediately}} surrounded with {{dense connective tissue}} that support the glands. The glandular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported by estrogen. When a woman ceases menstruation and her estrogen levels decrease, breast atrophy occurs; milk gland tissue atrophies, withers, and disappears, resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue, superﬁcial fascia, <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligaments,</b> and the skin envelope.|$|R
2500|$|Merry Hampton {{was kept}} in {{training}} at four and was entered in races such as the Jubilee Stakes at Kempton and the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. On his debut he was made 75/20 favourite for the City and Suburban handicap at Epsom on 11 April, despite carrying top weight of 122 pounds. He was never in contention and was virtually pulled up by Jack Watts, finishing tailed off last of the fourteen runners. Watts reported that the colt seemed [...] "dazed and stupid" [...] during the race, leading to speculation that Merry Hampton had been [...] "got at", possibly with an injection of opium. A veterinary examination however, revealed that the colt's <b>suspensory</b> <b>ligament</b> in his left foreleg, which had troubled him for many months, had [...] "gone" [...] and Merry Hampton never raced again.|$|E

40|$|Using {{classical}} {{methods of}} anatomical examination: preparation of topographic-anatomical sections, simple and thin section under microscopic control, {{the method of}} vascular injection with the aim to visualize them for further section and making photo documents, - the peculiarities of the structure, topography and morphometric data of 30 fetuses of various age groups of fetal period were studied. The peculiarities of the constituents and dynamics of morphometric changes of the ligaments of internal female reproductive organs were detected. Wide uterine ligaments as well as proper ovarian ligaments appeared to be of little importance as their structure and topography remain the most stable. From our point of view, it is connected with the peculiarities of their genetically caused embryonic morphogenesis.
