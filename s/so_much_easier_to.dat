25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding ploughs with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|E

In {{a letter to}} his friend Marjorie Robinson he described the investiture at Buckingham Palace, remarking that the Queen [...] "might have been any nice shy young lady in D.H. Evans or Kendal Milnes". Just over two years later Cardus was awarded a knighthood, the first music critic to receive such an honour, although in all likelihood it was awarded as much for his cricket writing. Years previously Beecham had advised: [...] "In the unlikely event of you being offered a knighthood, Neville, take it. It makes tables at the Savoy <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> come by".|$|E

50|$|Their {{habitat is}} the lower {{intertidal}} zones on out to waters {{as deep as}} 50 - 60 feet (13-15 m). They prefer sand, mud, and gravel substrates, normally burying themselves 12 - 16 inches (30 - 41 cm), <b>so</b> they are <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> dig than geoducks. Their preferred substrates are also preferred by butter and littleneck clams, so horse clams are often taken incidentally in commercial harvesting.|$|R
60|$|I am by {{no means}} sure that if the good people of Milby had known {{the truth about the}} Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been {{considerably}} disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they imagined.

60|$|And {{these two}} were {{alone with the}} sunset and with the stubble--alone in this vastness which is so like the sea--alone--two tiny, moving black specks with a {{background}} of radiance and a golden haze to envelop them.

6000|$|These words often puzzle {{and pain}} really good people, because {{they seem to}} put the hardest duty first. It seems, at times, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> love one's {{neighbour}} than to love God. And strange as it may seem, that is partly true. St. John tells us so--'He that loves not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?' Therefore many good people, who really do love God, are unhappy at times because {{they feel that they}} do not love him enough. They say in their hearts--'I wish to do right, and I try to do it: but I am afraid I do not do it from love to God.' ...|$|R
40|$|PLDA is {{a popular}} {{normalization}} approach for the i-vector model, and it has delivered state-of-the-art performance in speaker verification. However, PLDA training requires {{a large amount of}} labeled development data, which is highly expensive in most cases. A possible approach to mitigate the problem is various unsupervised adaptation methods, which use unlabeled data to adapt the PLDA scattering matrices to the target domain. In this paper, we present a new `local training' approach that utilizes inaccurate but much cheaper local labels to train the PLDA model. These local labels discriminate speakers within a single conversion only, and <b>so</b> are <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain compared to the normal `global labels'. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can deliver significant performance improvement, particularly with limited globally-labeled data. Comment: O-COCOSDA 201...|$|R

40|$|To {{minimize}} the longitudinal strip thickness {{error in the}} hydraulic cold rolling industries and improve traditional AGC control scheme on this problem, we put forward a secure gauge control system based on Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) and intelligent PI control strategy. The traditional automatic gauge control (AGC) scheme depended on personal experience about the parameters. The new gauge control system decreases the longitudinal strip thickness error via fuzzy control and ARM-based computing. Besides, this new system can be smaller than the traditional AGC system, and <b>so</b> is <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> transport. The Fuzzy control scheme can increase the robustness of the ARM-based gauge control system against some disturbances. The Matlab-based experimental simulations show that our secure gauge control system with Fuzzy control and ARM {{is better than the}} traditional one...|$|R
