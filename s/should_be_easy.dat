The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs.) Here the language and measures <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> and flowing with chearfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit together.|$|E

25|$|Bounding volumes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to {{test for}} intersection, for example a sphere or box (slab). The best {{bounding}} volume {{will be determined by}} the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space and a box is much better. Boxes are also easier for hierarchical bounding volumes.|$|E

Because it’s {{extremely}} important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as GUS and Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP {{may be influenced by}} the green tissue autofluorescence. Quantitative PCR could be an alternative method for chimera detection.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in {{question}} {{is not one of}} her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough to check out.|$|E
25|$|The coat is medium {{length and}} can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is {{frequently}} feathering on the legs and tail, {{as well as on}} the ear. As a working dog, the coat <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of a flush-toilet may be rated by a Maximum Performance (MaP) score. The low end of MaP scores is 250 (250grams of simulated fecal matter). The high end of MaP scores is 1000. A toilet with a MaP score of 1000 should provide trouble-free service. It should remove all waste with a single flush; it should not plug; it should not harbor any odor; it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to keep clean. The United States Environmental Protection Agency uses a MaP score of 350 as the minimum performance threshold for HETs. 1.6 gpf toilets are also sometimes referred as ULF (Ultra Low Flow) toilets.|$|E

500|$|Professor Jim Whitehead listed Defender as {{the first}} {{horizontally}} scrolling shooting game, and describes it as a breakthrough title for its use of full 2D motion, multiple goals, and complex gameplay that provides players with several methods to play. James Hague of Dadgum Games called Defender a landmark title from the 1980s. Stearny said that the game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen. Cuciz stated that Defenders use of scrolling introduce the [...] "first true 'gaming environment'". He further said that though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Stearny described it {{as the most important}} space game in the early 1980s. He commented that its realism and technological advances pushed developers to create more popular games, citing Gorf and Phoenix as examples. Vince listed the game as a classic title that introduced new technology, specifically scrolling. Ellis stated that prior to Defender, companies designed video games to have a balanced challenge. They believed games <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough to attract players, but difficult enough to limit play time to a few minutes; anything too challenging would dissuade players. Loguidice and Barton commented that Defenders success, along with , illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games, which spurred developers to create more complex game designs.|$|E
2500|$|Thus at {{any point}} there should be one special {{coordinate}} system, [...] "at rest relative to the aether". Maxwell noted in the late 1870s that detecting motion relative to this aether <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> enough—light travelling along with {{the motion of the}} Earth would have a different speed than light travelling backward, as they would both be moving against the unmoving aether. Even if the aether had an overall universal flow, changes in position during the day/night cycle, or over the span of seasons, should allow the drift to be detected.|$|E

2500|$|Colonizing Mercury {{would involve}} similar {{challenges}} as the Moon {{as there are}} few volatile elements, no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system. [...] Geologist Stephen Gillett has suggested this will make Mercury an ideal place to build solar sails, which could launch as folded up [...] "chunks" [...] by mass driver from Mercury's surface. [...] Once in space the solar sails would deploy. Since Mercury's solar constant is 6.5 times higher than Earth's, energy for the mass driver <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to come by, and solar sails near Mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near Earth. This could make Mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to (and terraform) Venus. Vast solar collectors could also be built on or near Mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plug and}} {{socket-outlet}} system defined in BS1363 {{is a result of}} one of the report's recommendations. [...] Britain had previously used a combination of 2A, 5A and 15A round pin sockets. [...] In an appendix to the main report (July 1944), the committee proposed that a completely new socket-outlet and fused plug should be adopted as the [...] "all-purpose" [...] domestic standard. [...] The main report listed 8 points to consider in deciding the design of the new standard. The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for terminals, bottom entry for the cable, and contact design. [...] The appendix added 5 further [...] "points of technical detail" [...] including requirements that plugs could not be inserted incorrectly, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to withdraw, and should include a fuse.|$|E
2500|$|Consider {{a smooth}} surface [...] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Near to any point, [...] can be {{approximated}} by its tangent plane at that point, which is an affine subspace of Euclidean space. Differential geometers in the 19th century {{were interested in the}} notion of development in which one surface was rolled along another, without slipping or twisting. In particular, the tangent plane to a point of [...] can be rolled on : this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to imagine when [...] is a surface like the 2-sphere, which is the smooth boundary of a convex region. As the tangent plane is rolled on , the point of contact traces out a curve on [...] Conversely, given a curve on , the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve: in particular, a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve is identified with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve. These identifications are always given by affine transformations from one tangent plane to another.|$|E

30|$|The filler-gap {{dependency}} in {{the subject}} RC can be resolved at minimal cost to working memory because there is just one intervening element (the complementizer that), which {{does not have a}} discourse referent. In the direct object relative clause, on the other hand, two items with discourse referents (the NP the boy and the verb help) intervene between the filler and the gap in the direct object relative clause, making it more difficult to process. In the same manner, subject RC’s <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than indirect object RC’s, and direct object RC’s <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than their oblique counterparts.|$|R
