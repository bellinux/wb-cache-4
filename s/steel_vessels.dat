25|$|In {{a typical}} wooden sailboat, the hull is {{constructed}} of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often {{referred to as}} ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In fiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or <b>steel</b> <b>vessels</b> to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.|$|E
25|$|Plans for naval reform took Konstantin's {{attention}} {{at the start of}} his brother's reign. He visited England and France in 1857 to study modern navies. Knowing Russia was an inferior military power, Konstantin made concerted efforts to modernize the Russian fleet. Under his orders, old wooden frigates equipped with cannon were replaced with new iron and <b>steel</b> <b>vessels</b> outfitted with modern French and German artillery. Beginning in 1857, he supervised a comprehensive building program that completely transformed the Imperial Navy and made it into a world superpower. Under his plans, the Baltic fleet received eighteen battleships, twelve frigates, and one hundred cannon boats, while the Pacific Fleet was reinforced with twelve new armored vessels, nine transport ships, and four frigates. Only the Black Sea Fleet was largely neglected due to the restriction forced upon Russia after the Crimean War. Nevertheless, he added nineteen new vessels, the maximum allowed to the Empire.|$|E

Bhavnagar manufactures fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) boats and <b>steel</b> <b>vessels</b> at the shipbuilding facility of Alcock Ashdown (Gujarat) Ltd. The prominent industries located in Bhavnagar are Alcock Ashdown (Government of Gujarat undertaking), Tamboli Castings Limited, Excel, SteelCast Bhavnagar, Investment & Precision Castings, Elite Chemicals and Sound Build Care Pvt Ltd. Ruvapari Road and Nari Road are areas where most industries are clustered. Bhavnagar has about 150 units manufacturing plastic monofilaments, and more than 400 units manufacturing plastic cloth, twine, ropes, films, and multifilament yarn. Some sections of the society depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The city is a prominent trading post for cotton products.

50|$|Mr. Coffinberry {{soon became}} {{convinced}} of the utility of building iron and <b>steel</b> <b>vessels.</b> After a thorough investigation of the subject, taking into his counsel such veteran owners of lake craft as Capt.

These gentlemen also conveyed their conclusions to Gen. O. M. Poe, United States engineer, who then designed the locks at the Sault Ste. Marie to allow passage of vessels with 300 to 600 feet keels. Thus it was that Mr. Coffinberry, and these gentlemen became the pioneers of the modern lake freighter. After founding the plant and laying the keel of the iron steamer Onoko, the firm was incorporated under the name of the Globe Ship Building Company, of which Mr. Coffinberry was chosen president and financial manager.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} a conceptual {{analysis of the}} feasibility of lead–bismuth coolant application for cooling the melting unit <b>steel</b> <b>vessel</b> designed for implementation of a new efficient radwaste reprocessing technique. In support of the lead–bismuth coolant feasibility, the main advantages and specific features of its application are presented, taking into account significant experience acquired in Russia in handling this coolant (nuclear submarines reactor units and circulation loops), availability of job-proved methods and equipment for the coolant quality control, coolant properties ensuring fire and explosion safety and heat removal capability under high temperature and low pressure conditions. Preliminary calculated estimates were made as for temperature distributions during lead–bismuth cooling of the melting unit <b>steel</b> <b>vessel.</b> Calculations were made for the melting unit normal operation, {{in the presence of}} refractory coating and slag lining of a certain thickness formed on the vessel inner surface.
