40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to identify a suitable parameter to assess the oil oxidation and to study the possibilities of delaying the oxidation of moderately oxidized unrefined almond oil by adding <b>supplementary</b> <b>amounts</b> of α-tocopherol. Three oil samples, with initial peroxide values of 13. 3, 19. 5 (moderately oxidized oils), and 28. 9 (oxidized oil), were supplemented with 100, 250 and 500 ppm of α-tocopherol and subjected to the oxidation at 50 °C for 9 days. The level of oxidation was determined by measuring peroxide value (PV), conjugated dienes (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Chemometric analysis indicated that, under the conditions of the present study, PV was the most suitable indicator of oil oxidation. The results have shown that the α-tocopherol could have an anti- oxidant or pro-oxidant effects, depending on its concentration and initial level of oil oxidation. Results also show that α-tocopherol addition at all the concentrations tested resulted in pro-oxidation of the moderately oxidized oils; hence additional supplementation with α-tocopherol could not be recommended to delay oxidation of unrefined almond oil...|$|R

Traditionally, cell culturing is undertaken with fetal bovine serum, which increases the risk of transinfection and immunologic responses (Chen et al. 2012). Researchers have used human platelet lysate for cell culturing during pulp tissue regeneration, implying that the use of autologous medium is a possibility (Chen et al. 2012). Besides increasing the quantity of the stem cells, culturing stem cells with different vehicles can induce them to differentiate into specific target tissues. For instance, dexamethasone and ascorbic acid in culture media lead to greater osteogenic differentiation (Wang et al. 2013). Tooth germ cell-condition medium (TGC-CM) has been introduced for its inductive properties in odontoblastic differentiation (Huo et al. 2010), which can be prepared from three sources: human, rat and porcine. Wang et al. (2011 b) reported that culturing DPSCs using porcine-derived TGC-CM resulted in greater regular odontoblast-like cell layer formation compared with human-derived TGC-CM. Huo et al. (2010) prepared TGC-CM from rats in two stages, embryonic and neonatal, and cultured dermal multipotent stem cells in these two media. They observed that embryonic TGC-CM was more bone inductive rather than odontoblastic (Huo et al. 2010).

Various surface treatment techniques were used to incorporate nitrogen into the CoCrMo alloy: without any plasma assistance, by floating potential radio-frequency plasma assisted nitriding (FPPAN), by plasma based ion implantation (PBII) with several high voltage accelerations (up to 20 kV). Without plasma activation, no nitrogen is incorporated in the CoCrMo. On the contrary, all the plasma or PBII treated samples show {{the formation of a}} nitrogen-rich f. c. c. γN phase. The layer nitrided over few microns has a nitrogen composition ranging from 30 at. % to about 20 at. % near the nitrided layer-substrate interface, with an enhanced surface microhardness.

Since both RGD and EGF are much smaller than a NeutrAvidin molecule (0.9, 6.4 and 60  kDa, respectively) the surface coverage for a given solution concentration can be taken to be the same for NeutrAvidin–biotin–RGD as for NeutrAvidin–biotin–EGF.

The most common defrosting technique is to reverse the cycle. Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the defrosting energy is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its refrigeration circuit involves a piece of refrigeration circuit that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out defrosting with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for defrosting. Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A <b>supplementary</b> <b>amount</b> of vapour flows out of the water evaporator and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the defrosting energy. The liquid returns back to the water evaporator by gravity. This defrosting system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as defrosting time was short. Using this defrosting technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while defrosting thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent defrosting sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients. A numerical study was carried out to assess the performance improvement achieved on a heating sequence.

40|$|The 2 -oxo acid {{dehydrogenase}} complexes {{are large}} multienzyme complexes that catalyse the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation {{of a specific}} 2 -oxo acid to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivative. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) converts {{the product of the}} glycolysis, pyruvate, to acetyl-CoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC functions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle itself by converting 2 -oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. The branched-chain 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCDHC) is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Since these complexes play vital roles in metabolism, impairment in their functioning by genetic defects naturally causes severe diseases in humans, e. g. lactic acidosis (PDHC deficiency) and maple syrup urine disease (BCDHC deficiency) (Patel & Harris, 1995). The 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes have a very similar design and share many structural and catalytic properties. They convert their substrate by the combined activity of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase (El), an acyltransferase (E 2), and a lipoamide dehydrogenase (E 3). The E 2 component forms the central oligomeric core of the complex to which the peripheral subunits El and E 3 are noncovalently bound. The acyltransferase (E 2) component is a highly segmented and multifunctional protein in which three different independently folded domains can be recognised, connected by mobile linker sequences. The N-terminal part consists of one to three lipoyl domains (- 80 amino acid residues each) containing the covalently bound prosthetic group lipoic acid. Between the lipoyl domain(s) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (- 29 kDa), which bears the acyltransferase active site and which aggregates to form the oligomeric core of the complex, the peripheral subunit-binding domain (- 35 amino acid residues) is found. The lipoyl domains {{play a crucial role in}} coupling the activities of the three multienzyme components by providing swinging arms that are mobile and responsible for substrate channelling among the three successive active sites. A specific lysine side chain of each lipoyl domain is modified with lipoic acid to form a lipoyl group, which transports acyl groups from El to E 2, and reduction equivalents from E 2 to E 3. The structure of the lipoyl domain is required for the efficient reaction of its lipoyl group with the El component. Furthermore, for E. coli PDHC and OGDHC it was shown that lipoyl domains can only be reductively acylated by the El enzyme of their parent complex, which indicates that molecular recognition occurs between El components and lipoyl domains (Graham et al., 1989). The research presented in this thesis aimed at gaining insight in the interaction between lipoyl domains and El components, and in particular what part of the lipoyl domain determines the specificity of the reductive acylation reaction. By the determination and comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the lipoyl domains of PDHC and OGDHC from A. vinelandii, for which their specificities in the reductive acylation reaction were determined, we expected to shed already some light on this process of molecular recognition. It also provides the structural basis for further studies on the specific interaction between El and the lipoyl domain, some of which are described in this thesis. The results of this work are summarised hereafter. The N-terminal lipoyl domain (residues 1 - 79) of the Up component of PDHC and the single lipoyl domain of the E 2 o component of OGDHC have both been sub-cloned and expressed in E. coli (chapters 2 and 3). The expression exceeded the capacity of the E. coli cells to lipoylate all the produced lipoyl domain, and only 5 - 10 % of the lipoyl domain was found to be modified with lipoic acid. The unlipoylated and lipoylated forms of the lipoyl domain could be separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Addition of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>amount</b> of lipoic acid to the growth medium resulted in full lipoylation of the expressed lipoyl domain. The ability of the purified lipoylated lipoyl domains to become reductively acylated by the El components of their parent complex proved that their folding and modification were correct. The correct modification of the E 2 p lipoyl domain has been confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NMR studies of the A. vinelandii lipoyl domains have resulted in sequential 1 H and 15 N resonance assignments and the secondary structure of both domains (chapters 2 and 3). The 2 D 1 H-NOESY spectra of the unlipoylated and lipoylated forms of the Up lipoyl domain are almost superimposable, except for several additional resonances that could be assigned to the lipoic acid moiety, and small differences in chemical shift of protons of residues in the direct vicinity of the lipoyl-lysine residue (chapter 2). No changes in NOE intensities connecting these residues nor addition or loss of NOEs could be observed however, suggesting that the structure of the lipoyl domain is not altered much if any upon lipoylation. A detailed comparison of the NMR-derived parameters of both lipoyl domains, i. e. chemical shifts, NH-exchange rates, NOEs, and 3 J HNαcoupling constants suggests a high structural similarity in solution between the two lipoyl domains, despite their amino acid sequence identity of only 25 % (chapter 3). The three-dimensional solution structures of the two lipoyl domains have been determined using distance geometry and/or dynamical simulated annealing calculations (chapters 4 and 5). The overall fold of both lipoyl domains is very similar and can be described as a beta-barrel-sandwich hybrid, which is now known to be typical for lipoyl domains. The domain is formed by two very similar and almost parallel four-stranded antiparallel P-sheets connected by loops and turns. The β- sheets each consist of three major and one minor strand, and are formed around a well-defined core of hydrophobic residues. At the far end of one of the sheets the lipoyl-lysine residue is presented to the solvent in a beta-turn connecting two successive strands. The N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the folded domain meet at the exact opposite of the domain in two adjacent beta-strands of the other sheet. The lipoyl domains display a remarkable internal symmetry that projects one beta- sheet onto the other beta-sheet after rotation of approximately 180 ° about a 2 -fold rotational symmetry axis. The last six and two C-terminal residues of the cloned fragments of the PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domains, respectively, are poorly defined and belong to the flexible linker sequences connecting the lipoyl domains to the remainder of the acyltransferase chain. These residues also show a significant narrower linewidth of their amide protons in the NMR spectra, which is an indication of increased mobility. The number of long-range NOE-distance constraints that have been obtained for the two lipoyl domains is not very large, but is comparable to the number obtained for other lipoyl domains, i. e. from B. stearothermophilus PDHC and E. coli PDHC (Dardel et al., 1993; Green et al., 1995). This seems inherited with the particular type of protein structure, in combination with the absence (A. vinelandii PDHC lipoyl domain) or low amount (only one Trp residue in the core of the A. vinelandii OGDHC lipoyl domain) of aromatic residues. Many long-range contacts between hydrophobic residues in the core of the domains are side-chain side-chain contacts. The unambiguous assignment of many of these contacts is impaired by overlap, and these contacts will only be accessible after 13 C- labelling of the lipoyl domains. Although the three-dimensional structures of the lipoyl domains that have been determined are not of high resolution, they provide good and suitable structural models for comparisons and the design of significant mutants to investigate the specific interactions between lipoyl domains and other complex components. A comparison of the structures of the A. vinelandii PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domains with those of the PDHC lipoyl domains of B. stearothennophilus and E. coli shows that their overall fold is strikingly similar. In particular, that fact that the two A. vinelandii lipoyl domains, for which their specificity in the reductive acylation reactions has been demonstrated now (chapter 6), have similar structures, indicates that molecular recognition of lipoyl domains by El is a result of only delicate differences among lipoyl domains. On the basis of a careful comparison of lipoyl domain structures and sequences, potential residues of the lipoyl domain that could be important for molecular recognition are proposed. These include residues of an exposed loop connecting the first two beta-strands in the sequence, and which lies close in space to the lipoylation site. In this loop the largest structural differences among lipoyl domains are found. Other potential candidates are the two amino acid residues immediately succeeding the lipoyl-lysine residue. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments of the exposed loop of the A. vinelandii OGDHC lipoyl domain, and cross-acylation experiments of A. vi nelandii PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domains catalysed by E. coli complexes, were performed to investigate the role of this loop in molecular recognition (chapter 6). These experiments indicate that this loop is very likely involved in the interaction with the El component, but that it is probably not the single determinant conferring specificity to the reductive acylation reaction. Additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments on this loop and the residues following the lipoyl-lysine residue are required to further investigate their role in molecular recognition. All studies on the interaction between lipoyl domains and El components are impaired by the lack of a three-dimensional structure of any El component. Furthermore, although the interaction between the lipoyl domain and El is specific, it is supposedly weak (Graham & Perham, 1990). This has been substantiated by initial NMR experiments in which, upon addition of A. vinelandii E 1 p to the 15 N-labelled lipoylated E 2 p lipoyl domain (1 : 2 ratio), no broadening or shift of the lipoyl domain resonances could be observed (Berg et al., 1996) (not described in this thesis). From addition of pyruvate to this NMR sample it was suggested that also the acetylated form of the lipoyl domain does not bind to E 1 p, at least not under the applied conditions. Together this implies that the lipoyl domain does not interact (strongly) with the El component, except when the hydroxyethyl-ThDP moiety is present in El. Such a ping-pong type of mechanism may be advantageous for the lipoyl domain that needs to interdigitate rapidly among the different active sites in the complex, but is unfortunately less advantageous for the observer. A final remark is dedicated to the rotational flexibility of the lipoyl group of the lipoyl domain, that is thought to be required to act as a swinging arm in the complex (Reed, 1974). Recently, the X-ray crystal structures of the H-protein of the glycine decarboxylase system with its lipoyl group loaded with methylamine (Cohen-Addad et al., 1995), and of the biotinyl domain of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Athappilly & Hendrickson, 1995), showed that their lipoyl/biotinyl group binds back to the protein surface. This may even not be very surprising considering the hydrophobic nature of the lipoyl group, and the question if this also could happen with lipoyl groups of 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes is therefore relevant. In the case of the H-protein, only the methylamine-loaded form of the lipoyl group binds to the protein, while the oxidised lipoyl group does not. Furthermore, the methylamine-loaded lipoyl group binds to residues that are conserved in H-proteins, several of which are located in a N-terminal helix that is absent in lipoyl domains. In the case of the biotinyl domain, the biotinyl group is partly buried in a thumblike protruding loop that is not found in lipoyl domains. For the lipoyl domains of 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes no X-ray crystal structures, or NMR structures of their lipoylated form, are available. As mentioned earlier, only small differences in chemical shifts of residues close in space to the lipoylation site (average difference - 0. 15 ppm), including residues of the exposed loop (average difference - 0. 07 ppm), are observed between the lipoylated and unlipoylated forms of the lipoyl domain (chapter 2). These differences are considered too small to suggest binding of the lipoyl group to e. g. the exposed loop. Together with the fact that in the H-protein and the biotinyl domain the lipoyl/biotinyl group binds to parts of the protein that are absent in lipoyl domains, this indicates that the lipoyl groups of 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes are likely to swing freely...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ruminal {{acidosis}} {{remains an}} important and prevalent disorder of economic and welfare concern to the dairy industry worldwide. There are inconsistencies in the diagnostic techniques and definitions of ruminal acidosis and a requirement for further information on the pathogenesis of ruminal acidosis, in particular {{in regard to the}} role of feed substrates, such as starch, sugar, and protein (Chapter 1). A greater understanding of changes to the microbiome during ruminal acidosis, feed management, and the possible synergistic effects of feed additive control agents is also required (Chapter 1). Consequently, the overall hypothesis of this thesis, which was supported, is that starch-, sugar-, and protein- or amino acid-based feed substrates would produce different ruminal and blood measures and distinct rumen bacterial community composition associated with different risks of ruminal acidosis. Secondly, that partial mixed ration feeding strategies and feed additive control agents would promote favorable ruminal conditions and reduce the risk of ruminal acidosis, which was also supported; however, whether feed additive control agents reduced the risk of ruminal acidosis was equivocal. Heifers exposed to a single feeding of grain and fructose had an increased risk of ruminal acidosis and accumulated ruminal lactate, compared to those fed grain only (Chapter 2). This highlights that diets with high sugar content should be fed with caution and increase the risk of ruminal acidosis when physically effective fiber is inadequate. Different oxidative stress responses were not observed among treatment groups of heifers fed single exposures of different substrates (Chapter 3) or different feed additives over a 20 d period (Chapter 7), but were evident in a heifer with acute clinical ruminal acidosis (Chapter 8). This suggests oxidative stress responses may only occur during acute clinical ruminal acidosis. Distinct ruminal bacterial community composition occurred among heifers fed a single exposure to different substrates (Chapter 4) and also among lactating cows fed different feeding strategies at different <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>amounts</b> (Chapter 5) and these communities were associated with rumen fermentation characteristics. Cattle appeared to have host specific rumen bacteria and a core microbiome (Chapters 4 and 5). This suggests that host specificity in rumen ecosystems may be associated with the individual susceptibilities of cattle to ruminal acidosis and a need to tailor feed management and control for ruminal acidosis for individual cattle. <b>Supplementary</b> feeding <b>amount</b> and ruminal concentrations of propionate and valerate appeared to have the largest association with ruminal bacterial communities in Chapter 5 and may be good predictors of ruminal acidosis. A partial mixed ration feeding system, compared with component feeding, decreased ruminal acidosis (Chapter 5), suggesting benefits of this feeding system; however, milk production and milk component benefits were not observed for this feeding system. Feed additive control agents perturbed the rumen by different mechanisms but had minimal synergistic effects when combinations of feed additives were fed and ruminal acidosis control was equivocal (Chapters 6 and 7). Feed additives may not be capable of controlling ruminal acidosis in all cattle when large amounts of readily fermentable carbohydrates are fed (Chapter 7). Concentrations of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) : butyrate, propionate, valerate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and caproate were below detectable limits in a heifer with acute clinical ruminal acidosis 24 h after she consumed a ration with 19. 1...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} how the social policy of Age Pension provision {{has affected the}} life-chances of elderly Australians. Based upon a 1982 social survey of fifty pensioners living in Sydney, the study explores the adequacy of income provision {{and its implications for}} {{the quality of life in}} retirement, so as to yield an experiential account of life on the pension. Participants were questioned about a range of historical and contemporary influences upon their present living standards, so as to illuminate the central research themes of adequacy and deprivation. The study found that one half of the sample recorded a worse standard of living on the pension. They adjusted to relative poverty with stoicism, and tended to discount any deprivations suffered. This survey indicates that forward financial planning towards retirement is unlikely amongst those of modest socio-economic status. Economic 'self reliance' through past savings or present part-time work cannot be expected, nor does the 'family' provide an income security 'safety net', so the pension must be sufficient rather than <b>supplementary</b> in its <b>amount.</b> The study suggests a range of social policy targets, proposes a common retirement age of 65 years for both sexes, and floats a proposal for a 'survival bonus', so as to reach those pensioners in greatest need...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Mobility and {{persistence}} of metribuzin (Lexone DF) and its metabolites (deaminated, DA; diketo, DK; deaminated-diketo, DADK) were studied using 75 -cm x 15 -cm field lysimeters packed with Plainfield sand, {{and subjected to}} two moisture regimes (rainfall, supplementary watering). Atrazine was applied to all lysimeters as an internal reference. Each lysimeter set consisted of 24 lysimeters, divided into two moisture treatments of six pairs each. Effluent was monitored for metribuzin, DA, DK, DADK, atrazine and desethylatrazine. Selected core pairs were sectioned (7 x 10 cm) and analyzed to determine mobility {{and persistence}} for each chemical at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 21. No chemicals moved more than 30 cm, nor were they detected in the effluent of cores receiving rainfall. In cores receiving <b>supplementary</b> watering, substantial <b>amounts</b> of metribuzin moved more than 30 cm by week 2 and eluted on 21 occasions throughout the study. The DADK and DK were much more mobile than metribuzin in the lysimeters, eluting more frequently than metribuzin. Metribuzin and metabolites were considerably more mobile than either atrazine or desethylatrazine in Plainfield sand. Metribuzin disappearance closely followed first-order kinetics with t 1 / 2 values of 3. 08 and 2. 04 weeks, respectively, for the rainfall and supplementary watering treatments. The primary degradation pathway for metribuzin was through the DK intermediate rather than the DA intermediate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of <b>supplementary</b> choline on <b>amount</b> of choline passing to quail meat and reduction of fat deposition in liver. A hundred and thirty-six one-day-old Japanese quails were divided into eight equal groups of 17 quails each. The experiment was designed based on completely randomized design in two controls and six treatment groups: high stocking density, basal diet, control group (HSD; control 1); normal stocking density, basal diet, control group (NSD; control 2); HSD, basal diet + 900 mg kg– 1 choline (A); NSD, basal diet + 900 mg kg– 1 choline (B); HSD, basal diet + 1800 mg kg– 1 choline (C); NSD, basal diet + 1800 mg kg– 1 choline (D); HSD, basal diet + 3600 mg kg– 1 choline (E); and NSD, basal diet + 3600 mg kg– 1 choline (F). Feeds and water were supplied ad libitum. Continuous light was provided. Quails were kept in cages of 50 × 100 cm in size. The choline content of quail meat increased with increasing amount of added choline to feed. The highest choline content (439. 2 and 561. 2 mg kg– 1) in quail meat was detected in E and F groups which fed the 3600 mg kg– 1 choline supplemented diet. The total lipid content of liver in E and F groups was reduced by 42 % compared with the control groups. We recommend the use of supplementary choline that can improve the amount of choline passing to quail meat and reduction of fat deposition in liver...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{supplementary}} food containing nony {{fruit juice}} was tested on honeybee colonies in honey producing. The aims {{of this research}} were (1) to determine the preference level of honeybees to the supplementary food containing honey and nony mixture, (2) to identify the organoleptic properties of the produced honeyessence of nony, (3) to determine fiber content of produced honey-essence of nony, and (4) to identify the colours of honey produced. The design used in the experiment was Latin Square Design. There were four treatments namely each concentration : A (0 %) as control, B (12, 5 %), C (25 %) dan D (37, 5 %) in dilution of <b>supplementary</b> food an <b>amount</b> of 600 grams wich consist of nony fruit juice and water. Each composition of dilution were A (300, 0, 300), B (225, 75, 300), C (150, 150, 300) dan D (75, 225, 300). Every one replication was done for six days with six day interval. The result were as follows: The higher concentration of nony juice in the food suplement the smaller food were taken. The differences in the olour, the flavour and {{the taste of the}} artificial honey didn’ depend on the amount of the food suplement taken honey bees, but depend on nony fruits juice concentration in the honey produced. The higher concentration of nony fruit juice in the artificial honey produced the darken in colour, sour in taste and the weaken in flavour. Feeding with food suplement containing nony juice increases the fiber content in the honey...|$|R
40|$|A two-year {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{feasibility}} of a targeted selective treatment to control gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in 24 groups of first grazing season (FGS) cattle. A two-step procedure aiming at defining exposure risk at group level and at identifying the most infected individuals within groups through measurement of the average daily weight gain (ADWG) at housing was used. The {{first step was to}} define retrospectively, by grazing management practices (GMP) indicators, two levels of groups’ exposure to GIN determined by anti O. ostertagi antibody ODR level (cut-off 0. 7). For the low level of exposure, no relationship between parasitological parameters and heifer growth was seen, whereas for the high level ADWG was negatively correlated with increasing Ostertagia ODR values. The best classification was obtained with an expert system modelling the number of Ostertagia L 3 generations on plots. GMP input for the expert system included standard data (turnout/housing data and <b>supplementary</b> feeding <b>amount)</b> combined with paddock rotation planning and monthly temperatures. The threshold of 3 successive generations of L 3 or more on plots allowed identifying the groups according to low or high infection exposure level, except two groups that were misidentified as being highly exposed. In the second step, individual ADWG was found to be negatively associated with Ostertagia ODR in heifers from groups classified as highly exposed (≥ 3 generations of L 3). In these groups, sensitivity and specificity of ADWG thresholds were calculated for several individual Ostertagia ODR thresholds. The best compromise between sensitivity (i. e., correctly treating the heifers that need to be treated) and specificity (i. e., not treating animals that should not be treated) was equivalent respectively to 76 % and 56 % (AUC ≈ 0. 7) and was reached using an end-season ADWG threshold of 683 g/day to detect animals exhibiting an Ostertagia ODR cut-off at 0. 93. Other ADWG thresholds were proposed taking into account the farmers’ or the veterinarians’ objectives: either maximizing the production through both an increase of the ADWG threshold and the sensitivity or keeping a significant nematode population in refugia with a corresponding limitation of anthelmintic treatments through a decrease of ADWG threshold and an increase of the specificity. Finally, a targeted selective treatment for FGS cattle based on GMP and flexible ADWG thresholds seems feasible at housing without laboratory analysis, accepting that some resilient animals with high Ostertagia ODR will not be treated due to their ability to perform under parasitic challenge...|$|R
