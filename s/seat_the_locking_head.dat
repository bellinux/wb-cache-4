40|$|<b>The</b> <b>lock</b> {{complex at}} Terneuzen {{is the main}} {{entrance}} for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The {{construction of a new}} large <b>lock</b> at <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between <b>the</b> existing <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> ground level is situated at NAP + 6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP - 2. 85 meter. <b>The</b> new <b>lock</b> will have larger dimensions than <b>the</b> current <b>locks.</b> It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must be able to use <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct <b>the</b> new <b>lock</b> with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for <b>the</b> new <b>lock</b> in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for <b>the</b> new <b>lock</b> <b>head.</b> (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls {{around the perimeter of the}} caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>heads</b> with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing <b>the</b> complete <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> including <b>the</b> gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>head,</b> is <b>the</b> best conceivable option.

40|$|In general, an inland {{navigation}} lock has a structural lifespan of about 100 years, while {{in most cases}} this lock is not big enough anymore after 25 - 50 years. This {{is caused by the}} growing ship dimensions and/or intensities. A functional flexible <b>lock</b> is <b>the</b> solution for extending the functional lifespan. This type of lock is, with or without a few structural adjustments, capable of serving the shipping traffic for its whole structural lifespan. This design approach will be applied on <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> complex ‘Sluis Sambeek’, which is located in the Meuse route. The first part of the study is carried out {{on the basis of the}} Life Cycle Management (LCM) approach. The LCM is started with a trend forecast, from which follows that the future ship sizes are normative for <b>the</b> required <b>lock</b> dimensions. After that, three alternatives are elaborated: 1. Zero-alternative: renovation of <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> 2. Functional flexible lock: standard lock that is built large enough at once. 3. Structural flexible lock: a relatively easy extendable navigation <b>lock.</b> <b>The</b> maximum dimensions are reached stepwise. Alternative 2 appears to be the least expensive option for ‘Sluis Sambeek’. Although alternative 3 is the most expensive option, this alternative is elaborated further, because it is the most innovative option and could be a better solution for another <b>lock</b> reconstruction. <b>The</b> structural flexibility in alternative 3 is formed by <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> chamber which exists of relatively simple replaceable sheet pile walls, and by floatable <b>lock</b> <b>heads</b> that can be replaced by wider <b>lock</b> <b>heads.</b> <b>The</b> construction planning and <b>the</b> structural <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> design are <b>the</b> innovative parts that are elaborated most specifically.

50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and <b>locks</b> into <b>the</b> selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel.

40|$|This master thesis {{researches}} {{the necessity}} and possibilities of new/innovative lock gate technologies for future large & high <b>head</b> <b>locks,</b> like <b>the</b> Panama Canal Expansion Project. A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 of <b>the</b> worlds largest <b>locks</b> throughout time, analyzing {{the development and}} application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that <b>the</b> required <b>lock</b> gate dimensions {{of a number of}} future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high <b>head</b> <b>lock</b> gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> structure, minimizing recess dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $ 2, 000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.

This corridor {{is one of}} the longest ones in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and crosses both EU countries and non-Member States. In order to increase the transport capacity along this axis, many projects are supported by the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency as part of the priority project 18. The increase of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> capacity of <b>the</b> Meuse River in Belgium to reach class ECMT VIb, allowing the traffic of boats carrying up to 9, 000 tonnes, {{is one of the}}se projects. <b>The</b> new <b>lock</b> at Ampsin-Neuville will have a 225 m x 25 m chamber, with a 4. 70 m <b>head.</b> This <b>lock</b> will be built between an existing 136 m x 16 m <b>lock</b> and <b>the</b> weir. As <b>the</b> existing <b>lock</b> is equipped with lateral translation gates, these gates recesses constrain significantly the location of <b>the</b> new <b>lock.</b> Therefore, a through-the-head filling system has been preferred to the longitudinal culvert system selected for similar <b>locks</b> on <b>the</b> River Meuse. This paper focuses on the design of the upstream head of this new lock, equipped with short culverts and a dissipation chamber. In order to guide the design of this filling system, a scale model of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> has been set-up at the Hydraulics Research Laboratory of Walloon waterways administration. The specific aim of this model was to investigate different configurations of the conduit network and of the dissipation chamber in order to limit the hawser forces encountered by vessels in <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> chamber, through a reduction of waves and free-surface slopes in <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> itself, and a sufficient uniformity in flow distribution at the dissipation chamber outlet. A composite modelling approach has been used in conjunction with this physical model to optimise the design. The key parameter {{in the design of the}} dissipation chamber was the placement of energy and momentum dissipation devices. In order to guide this design, and to limit the number of tests in the scale model, 2 D numerical simulations of the flow inside the chamber were run in a variety of configurations such as e. g. longitudinal walls, square columns in aligned or staggered layout, round columns in aligned and staggered layouts. The best options were tested in the scale model. Head-losses and velocity distribution at the exit of the dissipation chamber were measured, for different combinations of upstream water level and discharge through the culverts, representative of different stages of the filling process.

40|$|Ho Chi Minh City has to {{deal with}} severe {{flooding}} in the rainy season. To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. <b>The</b> navigation <b>lock</b> provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for <b>the</b> navigation <b>lock</b> focuses only on <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> <b>head.</b> Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for <b>the</b> navigation <b>lock</b> are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate.

50|$|Before firing, {{the bolt}} body is {{separated}} from <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> bolt <b>head</b> by a stiff spring. As the shotgun recoils after firing, inertia causes the bolt body to remain stationary while the recoiling gun and <b>locked</b> bolt <b>head</b> move rearward. This movement compresses the spring between the bolt head and bolt body, storing the energy required to cycle the action. Since the spring can only be compressed a certain amount, this limits the amount of force the spring can absorb, and provides an inherent level of self-regulation to the action, allowing {{a wide range of}} shotshells to be used, from standard to magnum loads, as long as they provide the minimum recoil level to compress the spring. Note that the shotgun must be free to recoil for this to work—the compressibility of the shooter's body is sufficient to allow this movement, but firing the shotgun from a secure position in a rest or with the stock against the ground will not allow it to recoil sufficiently to operate the mechanism. Likewise, care must be exercised when modifying weapons of this type (e.g. addition of extended magazines or ammunition storage on the stock), as any sizable increase in weapon mass can reduce the force of recoil below that required to cycle the action.|$|R
