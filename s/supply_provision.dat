50|$|A Distribution Transformer Monitor (DTM) is a {{specialized}} hardware device that collects and measures information relative to electricity passing into {{and through a}} distribution transformer. The DTM is typically retrofit onto pole top and pad mount transformers. A pole top (above ground) or pad mount (below ground) transformer commonly powers anywhere from 5-8 homes in the US and is the last voltage transition in stepping down voltage before {{it gets to the}} home or business. Standard positioning of DTM devices occurs at the transformer bushings, but sometimes they are attached directly onto the secondary electricity lines. DTM devices commonly consist of highly accurate non-piercing or piercing sensors, onboard communications modules to transmit information, and a power <b>supply</b> <b>provision.</b> The DTM device reports to a collection engine, and/or existing SCADA/MDM system where relevant transformer data is stored and presented to the user; analytics platforms are oftentimes employed to interpret the information being captured and reported by the DTM.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} achieve {{the target of the}} Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2015, which include the {{improvement}} of water supply service coverage in Indonesia, investment in water supply infrastructure need to be increased. On the other hand, Indonesia is faced with its limited capacity in financing public infrastructure development. Despite government efforts in encouraging private investment in infrastructure through public-private partnership (PPP) scheme, private sector involvements in public water <b>supply</b> <b>provision</b> are still low. The major issues perceived to be the cause of this situation are mostly related to the risk and uncertainty problem inherent within the framework of a long term PPP contract. It is perceived that the effectiveness in managing the risks {{is one of the key}} success factor of PPP scheme in infrastructure, and in particular in water <b>supply</b> <b>provision.</b> The paper tries to explore important risk factors in PPP water supply investment in Indonesia, through a comprehensive study on the current practices in Indonesia as well as in other places in the world. It can be said that political uncertainties, regulatory mechanism and other components of the scheme contributing to the project revenue, in the local as well as global perspective, as the major risk issues faced by the private sector when they decide to invest in water supply, in particular in Indonesia. The study shows that exchange rate fluctuations, government controlled water price and rate of non-revenue water are among the most serious risk factors faced by the investors. The paper discusses also various possible risk mitigation tools to minimize the risk in order to improve the willingness of the private sector in the scheme...|$|E

Data from a household survey, archives, GIS-based mapping, and interviews are used to document governance failures that create disincentives for utilities to connect poor households and for poor households to connect. The paper concludes by suggesting that the debate over the relative merits of public and private provision has diverted attention from the pressing issue of governance reform, and by raising the question of whether household provision of networked water supply by monopolistic providers (whether public or private) is universally feasible given the current water supply policy norms. water infrastructure poverty access Asia Jakarta...|$|E

40|$|Drinking {{water is}} a basic {{requirement}} for life and a determinant of standard of living. However, besides government efforts, supply and demand side factors of both surface and groundwater determine the level of drinking water available to people. The supply and demand factors increase with the natural and human factors like pollution. This limits drinking water <b>supply</b> <b>provision</b> and raise the delivery cost. Decline in groundwater table and availability of surface water, particularly in summer months, has put {{large number of people}} in risk for drinking water. Poor water quality problem has also been observed in more number of habitations. Inadequate resource management and institutional system seems to be the major causes for the present problems. This paper examines the nature and magnitude of environmental problems, causes and impacts in drinking water supply. The study observes that activities like operation and maintenance of drinking water supply schemes; water quality monitoring; groundwater conservation and rainwater harvesting measures have to be implemented for better provision of drinking water supply. Further, an integrated institutional system for water quality monitoring and groundwater rechargin...|$|E

40|$|Dracunculiasis {{continues}} to be a major public health problem among many rural communities in Africa and the Indian Sub-continent which depend upon unprotected water sources for drinking. It is a painful and debilitating disease which is exclusively transmitted through drinking water from contaminated open sources. Various risk factors are implicated in dracunculiasis transmission which are related to water sources. Dracunculiasis is highly seasonal, with most of the cases appearing in the eariy dry season, end of dry season or early wet season depending upon local conditions. Its social, educational and economic cost to the individual, the household and the community is considerable and well documented. Unfortunately, no drug has been effective for its treatment, but prevention is attainable through water <b>supply</b> <b>provision,</b> when affordable, or health education promoting the filtering of drinking water and avoidance of water sources by sufferers of the disease. Such interventions are presently used as a strategy for its eradication. International awareness of dracunculiasis has been growing recently {{as a result of the}} International Water Decade (1981 - 1990). It was targeted for eradication by 1995 by several international organizations and by national governments in endemic countries. This paper concludes by discussing the different strategies used in its eradication and the prospect of achieving the eradication goal by 1995 as planned...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{electrification}} (RE) can be modelled as a multifactorial task {{connected to}} {{a large number of}} variables: decision makers need to choose the appropriate options by considering not only the techno-economic competitiveness but also socio-cultural dynamics and environmental consequences, making the task intricate. Many rural electrification projects have failed due to lack of attention to the issues beyond financial and technical dimensions. This paper presents a standardized approach for decision making concerning the extension of electricity services to rural areas. This approach first determines whether the <b>supply</b> <b>provision</b> should be grid expansion or off-grid on the basis of levelized cost of delivered electricity. If the grid expansion is found nonviable over off-grid options then a multicriteria decision aiding tool, SMAA- 2 (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis), will evaluate off-grid technologies by aggregating 24 criteria values. While applying this approach, the delivered costs of electricity by the grid in remote areas within the 1 - 25. km distances vary in a range of 0. 10 - 7. 85 US$/kW. h depending on the line lengths and load conditions. In the off-grid evaluation, the solar PV (photovoltaic) and biogas plants are found as the most preferable alternatives with 59 % and 41 % acceptability in their first rank, respectively.
