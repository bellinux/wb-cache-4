5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do <b>so.</b> <b>Still,</b> many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E

From here he went along the Persante to reach the besieged fortress. Short of Kolberg, the Russian forces commanded by Pyotr Rumyantsev stopped him at the village of Spie in a three-hour battle. On 17 October he tried to break through to Gollnow with 5500 men to secure supplies from there, but the Russian general, William Fermor, stopped him at the bridge over the Ihna, in an artillery duel. Ultimately, when he could not relieve the fortress, Kolberg had to capitulate on 16 December 1761.|$|E

2500|$|Of course, the Coriolis force does still {{impact the}} {{direction}} of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is <b>so</b> <b>still</b> that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine {{the direction of}} the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect is likely to be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction such as any residual rotation of the water and the geometry of the container. Despite this, the idea that toilets and bathtubs drain differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has been popularized by several television programs and films, including Escape Plan, Wedding Crashers, The Simpsons episode [...] "Bart vs. Australia", Pole to Pole, and The X-Files episode [...] "Die Hand Die Verletzt".

2500|$|The {{new data}} {{that had been}} {{collected}} on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry. One of the major outcomes of these datasets was that all along the globe, a system of mid-oceanic ridges was detected. An important conclusion was that along this system, new ocean floor was being created, {{which led to the}} concept of the [...] "Great Global Rift". This was described in the crucial paper of Bruce Heezen (1960), which would trigger a real revolution in thinking. A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was, and still is, being continually created along the oceanic ridges. Therefore, Heezen advocated the so-called [...] "expanding Earth" [...] hypothesis of S. Warren Carey (see above). <b>So,</b> <b>still</b> the question remained: how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth? In reality, this question had been solved already by numerous scientists during the forties and the fifties, like Arthur Holmes, Vening-Meinesz, Coates and many others: The crust in excess disappeared along what were called the oceanic trenches, where so-called [...] "subduction" [...] occurred. Therefore, when various scientists during the early sixties started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor, the pieces of the theory quickly fell into place.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think <b>so</b> <b>still</b> and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
