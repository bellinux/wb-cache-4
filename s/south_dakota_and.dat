5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a somewhat stark boundary in terms of geographic, social and political differences between eastern and western <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> refer to the two resulting regions, divided by the Missouri, as West River and East River.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota.

At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers , with peaks that rise from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The Black Hills are the location of Black Elk Peak (7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level), the highest point in <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> also the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Two billion-year-old Precambrian formations, the oldest rocks in the state, form the central core of the Black Hills. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone, which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E

5|$|A growing {{population}} and political concerns (admitting two states meant having four new senators for the Republican Party) caused Dakota Territory {{to be divided}} in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889. Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accomplishments in sports {{have been attributed}} to Clement, but cannot be confirmed because of poor record keeping at the time. These claims include winning tennis championships in Iowa and <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> setting world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball, where it is claimed that Clement threw a baseball 275 feet.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the state}} are the shorter Interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around {{southern}} and eastern Sioux Falls. Several major U.S. highways pass through the state. U.S. routes 12, 14, 16, 18 and 212 travel east and west, while U.S. routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Montana are the only states sharing a land border which is not traversed by a paved road.|$|E

All four ships were retired post-war; <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Indiana were scrapped, Massachusetts and Alabama retained as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|Land speculators founded two {{of eastern}} South Dakota's largest present-day cities: Sioux Falls in 1856 and Yankton in 1859. In 1861, the Dakota Territory was {{established}} by the United States government (this initially included North Dakota, <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> parts of Montana and Wyoming). Settlement of the area, mostly by people from the eastern United States as well as western and northern Europe, increased rapidly, especially {{after the completion of}} an eastern railway link to Yankton in 1873.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 16, 1910. At least one theater advertised the film as a comedy instead of a drama. The film had a wide national release, theaters showing the film include those in Kansas, Pennsylvania, <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> Arizona. The film was shown in Singapore in 1913.|$|E

5|$|While on {{the faculty}} at the University of Chicago, Kelsey was awarded her M.D. during 1950.

Kelsey left the University of Chicago in 1954, {{decided to take a}} position teaching pharmacology at the University of <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> moved with her husband and two daughters to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she taught until 1957.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Clement {{was born}} in Hudson, South Dakota, then part of the Dakota Territory, on March 20, 1888 to Harriet Clement, one of the {{original}} settlers of Eden, <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> her husband, who died when Amanda was very young. In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. The umpire for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was knowledgeable about the game, serve as the umpire. In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to umpire a baseball game. Her performance was so well received that she was hired to umpire further semi-professional games.|$|E
