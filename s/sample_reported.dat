2500|$|The {{experience}} of sensing {{the presence of}} a deceased loved one is a commonly reported phenomenon in bereavement. It can {{take the form of a}} clearly sensory impression or can involve a quasi-sensory 'feeling' of presence. Rees conducted a study of 293 widowed people living in a particular area of mid-Wales. [...] He found that 14% of those interviewed reported having had a visual hallucination of their deceased spouse, 13.3% an auditory one and 2.7% a tactile one. These categories overlapped to some extent as some people reported a hallucinatory experience in more than one modality. Of interest in light of the previous heading was the fact that 46.7% of the <b>sample</b> <b>reported</b> experiencing the presence of the deceased spouse. Other studies have similarly reported a frequency of approximately 50% in the bereaved population.|$|E

50|$|The LGBTQ population, {{while still}} {{open to the}} same disparities as racial {{minority}} groups, is often confronted {{with the problem of}} being denied mental health treatment because of the gender they identify as or their sexual orientation. In a study conducted by The National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 19% of the LGBTQ <b>sample</b> <b>reported</b> being denied the healthcare they needed. In addition, 28% of the <b>sample</b> <b>reported</b> being harassed or even physically assaulted during the health visit. While denial of treatment and harassment during treatment are large causes of the disparities among mental health care quality, the lack of knowledge is also of concern among the LGBTQ population. As it is such a newly developing field of study, there is very little knowledge or research conducted that relate specifically to LGBTQ health and healthcare. Because of this, about 50% of the LGBTQ population report having to teach aspects of their health and treatment to the health care providers.|$|E

Allowing for the mass of the interstitial air, the true density of the structure is approximately 2.1 mg/cm3 (2.1 kg/m3), which is only about 1.76 times the density of air itself at 25 °C.

The bottom land was characterized by spruce, fir, grasses, shrubs, herbs, and sedges that display boreal woodland marshes. The most recent study of the valley published in 2007, examined megafaunal herbivores for their trophic relationships. The carbon nitrogen isotope ratios from preserved bone collagen and other fossilized organic matter indicated C-4 plants and grasses were absent in the bottomlands of the valley, with C-3 vegetation dominant.|$|E

50|$|Apart from crime surveys, {{there have}} been a small number of surveys, with {{representative}} samples, that have asked women about sexual violence.

A survey of a representative sample of women aged 18- 49 years in three provinces of South Africa found that in the previous year 1.3% of women had been forced, physically or by means of verbal threats, to have non-consensual sex. In a survey of a representative sample of the general population over 15 years of age in the Czech Republic, 11.6% of women reported forced sexual contact in their lifetime, 3.4% reporting that this had occurred more than once. The most common form of contact was forced vaginal intercourse.|$|E

Recently they administered a survey over phone to 500 rare disease patients/caregivers with the following objectives: to measure frequency of patient innovation in a population of rare diseases patients; to measure efforts by patients to share their solutions with others; to explore which factors drive patients to come-up with solutions and share them with others. The solutions reported by patients were validated for their novelty by two medical professionals. 40 individuals (8% of <b>sample)</b> <b>reported</b> solutions that they personally find valuable, and that are also evaluated as novel by expert medical evaluators.

Behavior that appears neither in criminal trials nor in clinical studies (for example, because the individuals concerned do not commonly seek professional help) is therefore under-reported. Rehor therefore surveyed 1,764 female participants in [...] "kink" [...] behavior (mostly association with BDSM) in 2010-11, receiving 1,580 valid responses. What Rehor calls [...] "urine play" [...] is relatively infrequent, with only 36.52% of her sample reporting having done it or having had it done to them. In contrast, 93.99% of her <b>sample</b> <b>reported</b> having done spanking or having had it done to them, and 61.96% reported having used or been exposed to feathers/fur. It is impossible to extrapolate Rehor's data onto the general population, but her study does give a guide to prevalence in the North American BDSM community.|$|E
5000|$|Some Chinese provinces allow village {{residents}} to designate someone {{to vote on}} their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that [...] "In practice, one family member often casts votes {{for everyone in the}} family even if they are present for the election. In 1997, a Carter Center delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the International Republican Institute had made a similar recommendation. Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the Wenzhou people doing business outside. Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent. Some villages required a notary to validate faxed proxy votes; some villages asked for faxed signatures; more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. Taicang government reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the <b>sample</b> <b>reported</b> that they actually went to the central polling station to vote.|$|E
5000|$|According to data {{available}} for 2011, 47.7 percent {{of girls and}} 56.7 percent of boys attended primary school. The low school enrolment rate was attributed to cost, with girls’ participation further reduced by early marriage, sexual harassment, unwanted pregnancy, domestic responsibilities, and certain socio-cultural biases. Domestic workers are generally not permitted by their employers to attend school.A 2004 government study found {{there is a large}} gap between the capacity of the schools and the number of potential students. According to the study, preschools served only 16% of the potential student population. Within the school system, the northern provinces were the most underprivileged, with only 5.7% of all teachers working in the Adamawa, North, and Extreme North provinces combined. The study showed that elementary schools only had enough seats for 1.8 million students, although 2.9 million attended school.After these findings, Cameroonian government launched a three-years programme to construct and renovate schools, improve teacher competency, and provide instructional materials, which was apparently renewed in 2010.

5000|$|User {{innovation}} {{is the idea}} that more users and consumers than suppliers are the innovators of new products. Eric von Hippel {{was one of the first}} to notice this trend and explore it. Products made by manufacturers are typically developed to meet a wide range of the needs of a wide range of people. Therefore, when a particular user experiences needs that are not yet felt by the majority of consumers, they make the adjustments themselves to meet their own needs. Often, these ideas are then fed back to manufacturing companies from these users in the hope that the product will then be produced for them. This process is called [...] "free revealing". User innovation can be seen across a wide range of products, from home cleaning equipment, to medical devices. In the field of scientific instruments, Hippel's research has even found that user {{innovation is}} a dominant influence. [...] User innovation extends not only to tangible products but also to services. Hippel found that eighty-five percent of individuals self-provided themselves with accounting and banking processes before banks offered this service. More recently, with Pedro Oliveira and colleagues studied the role of patients of chronic diseases, and their caregivers, in creating new solutions to help them cope with their health conditions. They administered a survey to 500 rare disease patients/caregivers and found that 40 individuals (8% of the <b>sample)</b> <b>reported</b> solutions that they personally find valuable, and that are also evaluated as novel by expert medical evaluators.
