5|$|Goeslaw later {{provided}} the soundtracks for 2003's Eiffel I'm in Love, 2005's Apa Artinya Cinta (What does Love Mean), 2007's The Butterfly, and 2009's Ketika Cinta Bertasbih (When Love Prays). She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her previous work in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she had to be extra careful.|$|E
5|$|Kana Hanazawa {{stated that}} she was happy to have been {{selected}} to be in Steins;Gate as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was not common {{to be able to}} play a part in a serious game. She also thought that the game gives the player more of a thrilling sensation rather than a frightening one and it entices the player to continue reading.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the light}} novel varied. Draper Carlsen wrote that the {{characters}} and premise lacked the strength to make the novel compelling, though <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the response of others may differ. Grading the novel a B, Eries wrote that the novel would appeal to fans of the manga, although she found the story arcs varying in quality and content, from junior-high school romance to philosophy on death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Mühe was married to his third wife, stage actress Susanne Lothar, and living in Berlin with her and their two children, Sophie Marie and Jakob. Mühe and Lothar starred {{together}} in Mühe's last film, Nemesis (2010), which deals with a couple's troubled relationship. However, Lothar, who died in 2012, launched a lawsuit to block the film from release for nearly three years, apparently because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it would cast the couple in a bad light.|$|E
5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. She listened to the song with Madonna {{a number of times}} and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E

5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was not quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|She {{was also}} a believer and a {{practitioner}} of magic, performing curses against those who she felt deserved it: in one case she cursed a fellow academic, Jaroslav Černý, when <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his promotion {{to the position of}} Professor of Egyptology over her friend Walter Bryan Emery was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to have created a wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Skirth {{gave the}} memoir to his {{daughter}} Jean in 1975, two years {{before his death in}} 1977 Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they remain to this day.|$|E

5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> {{every day}} <b>that</b> they were alien in their tastes and aims; their pleasures {{were not the}} same, and though it was sweet, though it was charming, to have him give up so willingly all his preferences, <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> without knowing <b>that</b> the time must come when this could not be so, {{that it was all}} wrong.|$|R

5|$|The {{script was}} partly based on Burke's own {{experience}} of giving up alcohol at a young age, since <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> her narrative {{had not yet been}} told on film. She and Ponsoldt wrote the script over six months, and the main roles were cast in September 2011. The film's US$500,000 budget was financed by independent investors including Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf. It was shot in Los Angeles in October 2011. It premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012 and was released by Sony Pictures Classics on October 12, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with Winstead's performance receiving unanimous praise, and was nominated for several awards for her acting.|$|E
5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E

5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{appears to}} have been unimpressed by this plan. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> marrying the son of a count diminished her {{imperial}} status and was probably also unhappy about marrying someone so much younger than she was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours, eventually intervened to persuade her {{to go along with the}} engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over the course of the next year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in Le Mans by the bishops of Le Mans and Séez. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve more into the teen pop and R genres, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> restyling herself to match {{the image of her}} contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of whom were disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and cracking the top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E
