25|$|During {{the rest}} of the 1820s the {{agriculture}} and cattle ranching expanded, as did the trade in hides and tallow. The new church was completed, and the political life of the city developed. Los Angeles was separated from Santa Barbara administration. The <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> which provided water from the river was rebuilt. Trade and commerce further increased with the secularization of the California missions by the Mexican Congress in 1833. Extensive mission lands suddenly became available to government officials, ranchers, and land speculators. The governor made more than 800 land grants during this period, including a grant of over 33,000-acres in 1839 to Francisco Sepulveda which was later developed as the westside of Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|The Roman consuls {{realised}} {{that they}} had to cut off Agrigentum from the outside world and blockade the city to cause starvation in order to force its inhabitants to surrender. The Romans began digging a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and small forts surrounding the city so the inhabitants would not have enough time to prepare for the siege. The consuls divided their forces, with one force near the Temple of Asklepios to the south {{of the city and the}} other force stationed to the west of the city. There was a stalemate for five months until November 262 BC when supplies began to run out in Agrigentum. Hannibal became increasingly concerned over the limited resources, so he sent urgent messages to Carthage appealing for help. Carthage sent a relief force from Africa commanded by Hanno, whom historians believe to have been the son of Hannibal. There are varying accounts as to the details of Hanno’s army. Polybius, the Greek historian, stated that there were about 50 elephants, Numidian cavalry, and mercenaries. Diodoros, another historian, wrote there were 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 60 elephants. Yet another historian, Orosius refers to 30,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, and 30 elephants.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{manner of}} this type of field {{fortification}} was to close potential vehicular transport and attack routes with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, dragon's teeth and mine fields. These obstacle-zone are followed by a quite small but peculiarly complex <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and barbed wire obstacles, which protects the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge-layer tanks and engineer teams. The semi-mobile engagement is the main point, soldiers fight in open firing positions, while bunkers served as only shelters during bombardments. Thus it is possible to quickly reallocate between the points of defense (manpower not locked in pillboxes), and counterattacks feasible by defense force. The main defense line usually lies at hilltop {{on the edge of a}} forest, divided into circularly defensible independent subsectors (platoon size) which allow a full 360° arc of fire. A sector includes 3 (or more) trench-rings and no more than a few ferro-concrete shelters surrounded by a wide zone of anti-personnel obstacles and 2 (or more) [...] "V" [...] or [...] "U" [...] shaped anti-tank trenches or dragon's teeth. 3-4 independent sectors connect by communication trenches into a defensive zone or fortress (company or battalion size).|$|E
50|$|The city's {{water supply}} <b>system</b> {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> entering {{through the main}} gate and flowing to the royal palace. It was feudalized and became privately owned by royal grant, its distribution carried out through concession fees imposed by each owner.|$|R
50|$|After {{the mines}} were exhausted, the {{population}} dropped considerably {{and was replaced}} by cattle ranchers. An extensive <b>system</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>ditches</b> was built throughout the valley. Ranching in the Wet Mountain Valley continues to this day.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{settlers}} built a water <b>system</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> (zanjas) {{leading from}} the river {{through the middle of}} town and into the farmlands. Indians were employed to haul fresh drinking water from a special pool farther upstream. [...] The city was first known as a producer of fine wine grapes. The raising of cattle and the commerce in tallow and hides would come later.|$|R
60|$|During the {{two days}} that we {{remained}} here, I {{walked out into the}} surrounding country to catch insects, shoot birds, and spy out the nakedness or fertility of the land. I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about ten or twelve miles inland, where it is bounded by a wide range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of cocoa-nut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxuriant rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe. The whole surface of the country is divided into irregular patches, following the undulations of the ground, from many acres to a few perches in extent, each of which is itself perfectly level, but stands a few inches or several feet above or below those adjacent to it. Every one of these patches can be flooded or drained at will by means of a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and small channels, into which are diverted the whole of the streams that descend from the mountains. Every patch now bore crops in various stages of growth, some almost ready for cutting, and all in the most flourishing condition and of the most exquisite green tints.|$|E
50|$|The boktjasker of Bedekaspel {{is located}} near the {{drainage}} smock mill Agnes. The <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> do not form a complete circle so the mill can only operate with southerly to westerly winds. In 2011 the mill {{was in a state}} of disrepair.|$|E
50|$|Kealia {{was once}} an ancient {{fishpond}} supplied with water from the Waikapu Stream in the West Maui Mountains and Kolaloa Gulch originating from Haleakalā. Native Hawaiians may have raised awa (milkfish, Chanos chanos) and amaama (flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus) using a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and sluice gates to let nearby fish from Māalaea Beach into the pond.|$|E

Using generalized linear models and canonical correspondence analyses we identified crucial factors affecting dragonfly communities and suggested implications for restoration ecology practise...|$|R
50|$|The Pueblo {{people of}} the Rio Grande valley had {{developed}} primitive irrigation systems by the 10th century AD, and by the 13th century {{most of the major}} pueblos had been established. The Pueblo <b>system</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>ditches</b> is one <b>of</b> the oldest <b>of</b> the irrigation <b>systems</b> in North America. These systems used a main acequia (shared irrigation ditch) into which water was diverted from the river, with secondary ditches leading off the main channel named for specific families. Maintenance of the main acequia would be a community responsibility. The Spanish arrived in New Mexico in 1598, and steadily expanded their presence, founding Albuquerque in 1706. The Spanish used Indian labor to extend the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>ditches.</b> Again, once a community grew large enough they would form a community association to look after maintenance. The Spanish were familiar with Moorish irrigation techniques, and may have adapted them to the canals that had been built by the Pueblos.|$|R
5000|$|The Stokes Bay Lines {{were part}} of the great Victorian {{fortification}} of Portsmouth Harbour under Lord Palmerston. In 1857 Major Jervois had proposed a complex <b>system</b> <b>of</b> moats (<b>ditches),</b> ramparts and batteries to close off the gap between the new fort at Fort Gomer, and the earlier fort at Fort Gilkicker, and Fort Monckton. This defensive moat was to become the ‘Stokes Bay Lines’.|$|R
50|$|Up to the 1880s, the six southeastern {{counties}} of Missouri's Bootheel, swampy {{and subject to}} flooding, remained heavily forested, underdeveloped, and underpopulated. Beginning in the 1880s, railroads opened up the Bootheel to logging. In 1905, the Little River Drainage District constructed an elaborate <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches,</b> canals, and levees to drain swampland. As a result, population more than tripled from 1880 to 1930, and cotton cultivation flourished. By 1920 it was the chief crop, attracting newcomers to the farms from Arkansas and Tennessee.|$|E
5000|$|Willow Palisade ( [...] ; m=) was a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and {{embankments}} {{planted with}} willows intended to restrict movement into Manchuria, {{built by the}} Qing dynasty during the later 17th century. It is often conveniently divided into three connected sections: the western and eastern sections, forming the Inner Willow Palisade around Liaodong Peninsula, and the northern section, {{also known as the}} Outer Willow Palisade, separating the traditionally Manchu areas (to the east) from the traditionally Mongol area (to the west) north of the Inner Palisade.|$|E
50|$|In 1644, {{after the}} Ming dynasty's capital of Beijing was sacked by the peasant rebels, the Jurchens (now called Manchus) allied with Ming general Wu Sangui and {{seized control of}} Beijing, overthrowing the {{short-lived}} Shun dynasty and establishing Qing dynasty rule (1644-1912) over all of China. The Willow Palisade was a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and embankments built by the Qing dynasty during the later 17th century to restrict the movement of Han civilians into Jilin and Heilongjiang. Only bannermen, including Chinese bannermen, were allowed to settle in Jilin and Heilongjiang.|$|E
50|$|Zdanovich {{estimates}} that approximately 1,500 to 2,500 {{people could have}} lived in Arkaim. Surrounding Arkaim's walls, were arable fields, 130-140 metres by 45 metres (430-460 feet by 150 feet), irrigated by a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> canals and <b>ditches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{fortified}} {{village with}} its <b>system</b> <b>of</b> ramparts and <b>ditches</b> around {{a settlement of}} about twenty roundhouses is {{in the care of}} Historic Scotland, who describe it as [...] "one of the best-preserved examples in Scotland of an Iron age fort".|$|R
40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in October 2014 at land west of Cheltenham Road, Evesham, Worcestershire. Twenty-two trenches were excavated. A field <b>system,</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> enclosing furrowed fields, {{was recorded in}} the south-east of the site. Whilst two <b>of</b> the <b>ditches</b> contained small, abraded sherds of probable Roman pottery, and the alignment <b>of</b> the <b>ditches</b> matched that <b>of</b> a Roman settlement revealed previously to the south-east of the site, other ditches in the same system contained post-medieval artefacts. Therefore, the date of origin <b>of</b> the field <b>system</b> remains in question, although no other Roman features or artefacts were revealed to suggest that Roman settlement per se continued into the proposed development site...|$|R
50|$|Saigō and his {{remaining}} samurai were pushed back to Kagoshima where, {{in a final}} battle, the Battle of Shiroyama, Imperial Army troops {{under the command of}} General Yamagata Aritomo and marines under the command of Admiral Kawamura Sumiyoshi outnumbered Saigō 60-to-1. However, Yamagata was determined to leave nothing to chance. The imperial troops spent several days constructing an elaborate <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches,</b> walls and obstacles to prevent another breakout. The five government warships in Kagoshima harbor added their firepower to Yamagata's artillery, and began to systematically reduce the rebel positions.|$|E
50|$|The Boulevard is {{the main}} {{residential}} area and the original setting of the town. There are many unique things about the boulevard. First, {{it is in the}} shape of a horseshoe with a large park down the middle. Also, a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> parallel the roads and drain into the canal, giving each landowner who pays for a share access to irrigation water. This comes from the days when farming was intended to be done inside the city. It is now used for gardening or watering the lawn. It also now includes a frisbee golf course along the west side.|$|E
50|$|Enschede {{was granted}} city rights around 1300 which were {{confirmed}} in 1325 by Bishop Jan III van Diest and henceforth {{was allowed to}} protect itself with a wall. Because a stone wall was too expensive (since stone had to be imported), Enschede had a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches,</b> palisades and hedges instead, which is still reflected in the street-names Noorderhagen and Zuiderhagen (North Hedge and South Hedge, respectively). The city plan of this era is still recognisable in the street-pattern. The city was spared destruction in 1597 at its capture during the Eighty Years' War when after a short siege, the Spanish garrison surrendered {{the city and the}} defences were razed.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} Europeans found up to 200 sub-bands of Coahuiltecan Indians in {{the vicinity}} of the springs; however, they were soon displaced by the Lipan Apaches. Spanish missionaries built a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> aqueducts and <b>ditches</b> to carry water from the springs to the local missions, including The Alamo.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} {{employment}} of the railroad, Shearer, with Dr. Frank J. Lemon as his partner, opened Toppenish's first drugstore in 1905. About a year later, Shearer sold out, turning {{his attention to the}} newly organized Yakima Produce and Trading company, with George Plank, A.W. McDonald and M. McDonald as partners. The company bought some acreage and leased more sagebrush land to develop the 1700-acre ranch near Satus Station. Mr Shearer had a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>ditches</b> constructed leading from Satus Creek to the acreage.|$|R
40|$|The {{seepage flow}} through porous soil to a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> {{parallel}} <b>ditches</b> above a horizontalimpermeable boundary is studied, and {{a theory of}} hydrodynamics is developed with the objectof providing a scientific basis for the design <b>of</b> <b>ditches.</b> The unsteady nature of the seepage flow is taken into account because the water tablerises to maximum height after irrigation or rains, and falls gradually due to the influence ofof ditches. The treatment {{is based on the}} so-called seperation of variables, which is usefulfor solving a non-linear differential equation (1). The solution compared with the exprimental results obtained by means of the sand-models having the fairly large scales.

50|$|As {{part of an}} {{extensive}} fenland region, Cottenham is drained by a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and lodes which {{are believed to have}} been built or at least significantly expanded by the Romans. The northern regions of the parish drain into the Roman Car Dyke, a large drainage ditch which traverses the Fens in between the River Cam and the River Great Ouse, and the central village drains into Cottenham Lode, one of the many Cambridgeshire Lodes used to connect villages to the River Great Ouse as it travelled towards The Wash. The north-east of the parish is bounded by a section of the major Roman road, Akeman Street.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to this movement, the Portuguese army inverted its dispositions {{and headed to the}} South slope of the hill. Since they were fewer than the enemy and had less ground to cover, they attained their final position very early in the afternoon. To calm the soldiers' nervousness and to improve his army's defensive position, general Nuno Álvares Pereira ordered the construction of a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches,</b> pitches and caltrops. This application of typical English tactical procedures had also been used by the Portuguese on the previous battle of Atoleiros and was especially effective against cavalry (the speciality of both the Castilian and the French armies).|$|E

50|$|In 1848, {{after several}} modifications, the lands were {{purchased}} by Juan Ignacio Jimenez, from Cuencame. The purchase included {{the entrance of}} the river Nazas (Cañon de Calbazas), where he built Calbazas Dam and a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> canals and <b>ditches</b> to irrigate the lands of the Haciendas of Sacramento, Noé, Santa Rosa, Torreón and San Ignacio.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{high-resolution}} space-borne {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) imagery with pixel sizes smaller than 1 m 2 {{can be used to}} complement archaeological surveys on intertidal flats. After major storm surges in the 14 th and 17 th centuries (“Grote Mandrenke”), vast areas on the German North Sea coast were lost to the sea. Areas of settlements and historical farmland were buried under sediments for centuries, but when the surface layer is driven away under the action of wind, currents, and waves, they appear again on the Wadden Sea surface. However, frequent flooding and erosion of the intertidal flats make any archaeological monitoring a difficult task, so that remote sensing techniques appear to be an efficient and cost-effective instrument for any archaeological surveillance of that area. Space-borne SAR images clearly show remains of farmhouse foundations and <b>of</b> former <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches,</b> dating back to the times before the “Grote Mandrenke”. In particular, the very high-resolution acquisition (“staring spotlight”) mode of the TerraSAR/TanDEM-X satellites allows detecting various kinds of remains of historical land use at high precision. Moreover, SARs working at lower microwave frequencies (e. g., that on Radarsat- 2) may complement archaeological surveys of historical cultural traces, some of which have been unknown so far...|$|R
50|$|The Battle of the Silarius River was the final, {{decisive action}} of the Roman Servile Wars. It {{occurred}} {{near the mouth of}} modern Sele River, southern Campania, southern Italy. Marcus Licinius Crassus trapped Spartacus in Bruttium by building a 60 kilometers long <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> and walls. After a failed truce, Spartacus gathered his army together for battle. He ordered his horse to be brought to him, drew his sword, and slew the animal. He proclaimed to his troops that if he should win the day, he would have many horses to choose from, but if he should lose the upcoming battle and the Romans should win the day, he would not need one.|$|E
50|$|The {{dry climate}} of the area (at an {{elevation}} of approximately 8800 feet) requires the diversion {{of water from the}} Illinois River through a complex <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> to irrigate wetland meadows and fill water fowl brood ponds. Periodic burning, irrigation and various grazing systems are management tools used on the refuge meadows to maintain vegetative vigor for nesting purposes. Manipulation of water levels in the shallow ponds is intended to assure adequate aquatic vegetation for food and escape cover. The ponds also produce many insects and other invertebrates (protein) needed by most female waterfowl for successful egg laying. These insects also serve as an essential food item for the growth of ducklings and goslings during the summer months.|$|E
50|$|The Kleine Aller {{rises in}} the Brome village of Wiswedel at 78 m above sea level. It drains the Kiebitzmoor west of Tülau, through a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> that has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, and also drains the Vogelmoor north of Barwedel. In this region it is joined by the tributary of the Rhodische Aller. Finally the Kleine Aller flows southwards, past Bergfeld, Barwedel, Tiddische, Hoitlingen and Jembke. From Jembke it forms {{the border between the}} district of Gifhorn and the city of Wolfsburg. The river also passes Wolfsburg-Brackstedt and Wolfsburg-Warmenau to enter the Aller Canal south of Weyhausen at a height of 55.5 m above sea level and at a point a few hundred metres after it branches away from the River Aller itself.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{drainage}} in landscapes with {{a surplus of}} water will be in focus. A water system perspective will be applied to ditching. Upstream–downstream relations—whether small, as in this article, or comprehensive—cannot be disregarded when studying water systems. A central task {{in this article is}} to describe and interpret the ways these dependences have been controlled. In the article, building drainage systems is regarded as the construction <b>of</b> water <b>systems</b> that extends over, encloses and binds together ever larger areas of the water landscape. Examples from slightly more than 500 years of Swedish drainage history are used in the article. As with other activities involving water, the Swedish state has built up social institutions to regulate these activities. These codes of rules coordinating the management and build-up <b>of</b> drainage <b>systems</b> are interpreted from a water system perspective. Reading the sources and results from Swedish agrarian research in light of this new perspective and using a long time perspective, establishes the legacy of the laws on ditch digging. In the article the physical and social dependence that are built in <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>ditches</b> are demonstrated. Simultaneously the new water systems contributed to building a hybrid landscape, as well as they created new communities of which the Swedish farmer became a part...|$|R
