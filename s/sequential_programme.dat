50|$|The {{opportunity}} for pupils regularly {{to take part}} in retreats, devised and directed according to their stage at the school, {{is an essential part of}} the Jesuit educational ideal. A retreat is a time when, away from their usual environments of home and school, the pupils can reflect on their lives and on their relationships with others and with God. The college offers a <b>sequential</b> <b>programme</b> of retreats, carefully structured in content and style to address the perennial and changing needs of the pupils as they move through the school. Members of Years 7, 9 and 11 have retreat days each year and these take place in the Pastoral Centre, a detached property which stands on the college site. Residential retreats are organised for members of the upper years, Year 10 and the Sixth Form. A variety of centres and formats are used. Recently, these retreats have been held at St John's Beaumont, a Jesuit youth centre in Hampstead, and at the De La Salle centre at Kintbury.|$|E

There arevarious techniques for Face and eye detection butMSNN technique is used for the experiment. This technique consist of different stages: the firststage extracts features using morphologicaloperations; the second stage performsclassification of outputs from the last featureextraction layer. For Eye detection we conducted anotherexperiment by choosing different images. All theimages are tested by <b>sequential</b> <b>programme.</b> HitMiss Transform is used for grey scale images toextract the information from face. MSNN is wellefficient from other techniques.

50|$|The {{configuration}} of the original consecutive building sequence of John Rothe's three houses (dating respectively to 1594, 1604 and 1610) has survived intact. Rothe's <b>sequential</b> building <b>programme</b> is significant, as he deliberately built three independent houses rather than extending the first house to accommodate the needs of his growing family. In this, he followed the pattern of development chosen by his wife's family (the Archers) in their arrangement of the Archer house and the house built behind it, now known as 'The Hole in the Wall'.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of formal {{techniques}} {{in the development of}} safety critical software and in particular the formal specification and validation of embedded control requirements for gas turbine engines (such as those used to power aircraft). It proposes novel techniques for use in the formal validation of control requirements and discusses their application in an industrial setting. This is achieved in three key stages. Firstly, we extend the Generalised Substitution Language, and therefore the principles of weakest precondition calculus, to embrace differential constraints. Our approach is based on generalising the traditional view that a Generalised Substitution specifies a fragment of a <b>sequential</b> <b>programme.</b> We consider a Generalised Substitution to represent an autonomous transformation which is ‘clocked ’ repeatedly to perform its computation at regular intervals. In the case of such components composed synchronously, we can generalise the notion of weakest precondition to traces (sequences of values) of inputs and outputs. In our approach we characterise traces with first order constraints as ‘step’ predicates over adjacent elements in the trace. We refer to these as ‘acceptance criteria’. We also generalise our calculus t...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{sequential}} matching and inverse selection probability weighting {{to estimate}} dynamic casual effects. The sequential matching estimators extend simple, matching estimators based on propensity scores for static causal analysis {{that have been}} frequently applied in the evaluation literature. A Monte Carlo study shows that the suggested estimators perform well in small and medium seize samples. Based on {{the application of the}} sequential matching estimators to an empirical problem - an evaluation study of the Swiss active labour market policies - some implementational issues are discussed and results are provided.

40|$|A two-period trade theoretic {{model is}} used to analyse the effects of {{liberalisation}} programmes in a financially repressed economy (where official bank loan and deposit rates are artificially low). Financial repression creates incentives for households to overcome the capital controls and invest abroad (capital flight). It is shown that capital controls, financial regulation and trade policies are intimately related {{in the sense that}} some financial repression and capital controls are optimal if imports are subject to tariffs, and tariffs are optimal if there is financial repression. Hence, <b>sequential</b> liberalisation <b>programmes</b> may lead to a deterioration of welfare. It is shown that the presence of capital flight improves the possibilities that financial deregulation may succeed even when trade has not been completely liberalised...|$|R
40|$|Lechner and Miquel (2001) {{approached}} the causal analysis of sequences of interventions from a potential outcome perspective based on selection on observable type of assumptions (sequential conditional independence assumptions). Lechner (2004) proposed matching estimators for this framework. However, many practical issues {{that might have}} substantial consequences for interpretation of the results have not been thoroughly investigated so far. This paper discusses some of these practical issues. The discussion is related to estimates based on an artificial data set for which the true values of the parameters are known and that shares many features of data {{that could be used}} for an empirical dynamic matching analysis.

40|$|Sequential {{strategies}} of assigning persons to different subsequent programmes {{play an important}} role in the activation of unemployed people through active labour market programmes. Especially for unemployment benefit II recipients it could be necessary to participate in different programmes to achieve integration. Therefore, it is important not only to know the selectivity and effects of single programmes but also of programme sequences. This descriptive study investigates the programme sequences of unemployment benefit II recipients considering different subgroups of them. We use a sample of persons, who were registered unemployed and received unemployment benefit II on 30 th September 2006. We analyse for individuals, who received permanently unemployment benefit II until the start of the first programme, in how many and in which programmes they participated and which were the most frequent combinations within nearly two years. Moreover the transition rates into the first and second programme are discussed. Last, but not least sequences of two or three programmes are analysed for different subgroups, who also participated in two or three programmes. The most frequent sequences consist of classroom trainings and One-Euro-Jobs. Results indicate that it is also important to distinguish between different groups of unemployed persons. Sequences consisting of One-Euro-Jobs are often applied to groups with long duration of unemployment benefit II receipt and low education, whereas different active labour market programmes like subsidized employment schemes are provided for the better risks which participated in more than one programme. Our sample is selective: the better risks in our sample leave the unemployment benefit II receipt earlier than our bad risks (sorting effect), which are more likely to participate on two or three <b>sequential</b> <b>programmes</b> or even in longer programmes like One-Euro-Jobs.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the process of planning an intervention program aimed at improving reading fluency in children with developmental dyslexia. Reading fluency is considered a crucial component in achieving literacy, especially regarding its role in facilitating reading comprehension. Improving reading fluency is particularly important for children with developmental dyslexia as they have difficulties automatizing word recognition. These difficulties lead to suboptimal reading skills that ultimately affect reading comprehension. This study shows the steps involved in planning an intervention program that combines accelerated and repeated reading, two methodologies commonly used to improve fluency. This is a structured and <b>sequential</b> training <b>programme</b> which includes syllable, word and text reading. The aim is to automatize the reading of sublexical units-which are easily recognizable in Spanish-to facilitate faster and more efficient word recognition. This will improve fluency when reading full texts. The program also includes metaphonological ability training...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether fertilization failure was due to spermatozoal or oocyte factors. Twenty-five unfertilized oocytes and from 12 IVF/GIFT couples showing total or partial fertilization failure were evaluated for sperm zona binding potential under hemizona assay (HZA) conditions. Hemizonae were separately incubated with a sperm sample from the husband and that of a fertile control. Tight sperm binding to hemizonae was assessed. First, among the 12 patients, result showed a possible zona defect thought to be the cause of fertilization failure in five cases. Second, in two cases, fertilization failure was possibly caused by poor sperm binding potential of spermatozoa. Third in two cases, fertilization failure was possibly caused by an oocyte defect, and fourth, three cases showed a mixture of possible causes. The results stress the need to develop a <b>sequential</b> analytic <b>programme</b> for those couples with repeated total or partial fertilization failure. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of ICSI has provided a unique means of allowing couples suffering from severe male infertility to achieve their reproductive goals. However, despite the great therapeutic advantages of the technique, ICSI often provides solutions to clinicians {{in the absence of}} an aetiological or pathophysiological diagnosis. The development of a sequential diagnostic schedule for patients consulting for fertility disturbances would be an ideal method of approach. Since sperm morphology recorded by strict criteria has often been correlated with fertilization failure, the present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between normal morphology and chromatin staining among fertile and subfertile men. Both chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3) and acidic aniline blue (AAB) were employed to record chromatin packaging quality among 58 men visiting the andrology laboratory. Intra- and inter-assay variations were initially recorded for fertile sperm donors. The coefficients of variation (CV) for all intra- and inter-assay assessments were 14 % normal forms), namely 49 % vs. 29 % for CMA 3 and 51 % vs. 26 % for AAB staining, respectively. Chromatin packaging assessments should be a valuable addition to the <b>sequential</b> diagnostic <b>programme</b> in an assisted reproduction arena. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of diagnostic techniques in andrology {{as a second}} level of approach to the diagnosis of male factor infertility has enthused the focus of researchers on the {{development of}} a <b>sequential</b> diagnostic <b>programme</b> for these men. Semen samples of 78 men form couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation therapy were used in the study. The semen samples were used to test sperm functional aspects known to interfere with fertilisation. These tests included semen profile, DNA integrity, apoptosis, chromatin packaging, acridin orange staining, zona binding capacity, zona-induced acrosome reaction (AR). Results were correlated with fertilisation outcome. Statistical analyses of the recorded data were carried out using a logistic regression analysis model on all sperm functional tests. A negative and significant association with the fertilisation rates was recorded for DNA damage (r=- 0. 56; P≤ 0. 0005). A positive significant correlation was recorded between fertilisation rates and sperm with normal DNA (r=- 0. 57, P≤ 0. 0004), and zona-induced AR (r= 0. 33, P≤ 0. 002). Diagnostic andrology can be regarded as a mandatory part of the male factor patient's work-up schedule to assist clinicians with the most suitable therapeutic modality to follow. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a sequential diagnostic schedule for patients consulting for infertility disturbances would be an ideal method of approach for clinicians {{in the absence of}} an aetiological or pathophysiological diagnosis. Since sperm morphology recorded by strict criteria has often been correlated with fertilization failure, the present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between normal morphology as well as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) rates, with chromatin staining among fertile and subfertile men. Two semen smears were prepared from each specimen obtained from 72 men to record normal morphology and chromatin packaging as recorded by chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3) staining. Following the semen analyses, the 72 men were divided into the two morphological groups, namely 4 % normal forms. Significantly different percentages of CMA 3 staining (mean ± SE) were recorded between the two morphological groups, namely 65. 9 % ± 3. 5 and 44. 5 % ± 1. 7 (P ± 0. 001). A highly negative significant correlation existed between percentage of normal morphology as recorded by strict criteria and CMA 3 staining. A highly significant and positive correlation was recorded for normal morphology and IVF rates (r ± 0. 45, P ± 0. 0001). A significant negative correlation (r ± - 0. 51, P ± 0. 0001) existed between CMA 3 values and IVF rates. The discriminating power of nuclear maturity, as recorded by CMA 3 staining, to identify abnormal morphology values and poor IVF rates was calculated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses. The areas under the ROC curves were 0. 86 for sperm morphology and 0. 74 for IVF rates. The calculated threshold values for CMA 3 staining to distinguish between morphology groups were 48 and 50 % for IVF.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} bath and an ultrasonic probe {{have been used}} to develop rapid versions of the three-stage Community Bureau of Reference (BCR, now the Standards, Measurement and Testing <b>Programme)</b> <b>sequential</b> extraction procedure. The effect of the ultrasonic treatments on the extraction of copper, iron, manganese and zinc from a sewage sludge-amended soil has been assessed. Recoveries similar to those of conventional shaking (i. e., conventional value, +/- 30 %) could generally be obtained for copper, manganese and zinc, but not for the important matrix element iron. With the use of compromise sonication conditions, steps 1, 2 and 3 of the sequential extraction (excluding the hydrogen peroxide digestion in step 3, which was not performed with sonication) could be completed in 3, 5 and 1 min, respectively, using the ultrasonic probe, and in 3, 1 and 1 h, respectively, using the bath. The extraction procedures developed using the soil performed well when applied to lake sediment BCR CRM 601. Analyte partitioning was generally similar to that obtained with mechanical shaking, and overall metal recoveries were 84 - 98 % of those obtained with the conventional BCR protocol, except for copper extracted with the probe (74 %). Poorer performance (analyte recoveries, 58 - 104 %) was obtained when the methods were applied to an intertidal sediment. This highlights the difficulty of developing a version of the BCR extraction, with ultrasonic assistance, which gives a performance equivalent to conventional shaking when applied to different substrates...|$|R
