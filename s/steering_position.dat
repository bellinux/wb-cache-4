25|$|The large {{watertight}} cabin gave it self-righting capability. Two survivor cabins {{are situated}} below decks where first aid and emergency equipment is stowed. The hull {{is divided into}} 26 watertight compartments as protection against sinking should it be holed. There is also a flying bridge above the main cabin with an auxiliary <b>steering</b> <b>position</b> {{which can be used}} when additional height or visibility is required during an operation. The boat won a Design Council award in 1982.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, Otso was a {{significant}} departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended bridge wings on top of the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main <b>steering</b> <b>position,</b> which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline. Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the Imperial Russian era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the flag of Finland, blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, Otso had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986. Later her crew has been further reduced to 20. Otso was also the first icebreaker in which the lifeboats, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.|$|E
25|$|The LCA's crew of four ratings {{included}} a Sternsheetsman, whose action station {{was at the}} stern to assist in lowering and raising the boat at the davits of the Landing Ship Infantry (LSI), a Bowman-gunner, whose action station was {{at the front of}} the boat to open and close the armoured doors, raise and lower the ramp, and operate the one or two Lewis guns in the armoured gun shelter opposite the <b>steering</b> <b>position,</b> a stoker-mechanic responsible for the engine compartment, and a Coxswain who sat in the armoured steering shelter forward on the starboard side. Though in control of the rudders, the coxswain did not have direct control of the engines and gave instructions to the stoker through voicepipe and telegraph. The craft relayed signals and orders to the other two craft in the group by signal flags in the earlier part of the war, but by 1944 many of the boats had been fitted with two-way radios.|$|E
50|$|To {{meet the}} {{pressing}} demand for military vehicles during World War II, several Commonwealth countries designed light armoured vehicles based on CMP chassis made in Canada. Special chassis {{were created to}} aid in this purpose, featuring rear mounted engines and central <b>steering</b> <b>positions.</b> Armoured cars used these or standard chassis depending on design and availability.|$|R

500|$|On 7 July, the Mediterranean Fleet sortied {{to cover}} more Malta convoys, {{but they were}} spotted by the Italians that evening. The next day, a bomb dropped by Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers struck the ship's bridge, killing 18 crew members instantly, {{including}} the captain. As {{a result of the}} attack, the ship could not be steered from the bridge and was uncontrolled for a time before the aft <b>steering</b> <b>position</b> could take over. Despite an inoperable bridge, the ship remained with the fleet and participated in the Battle of Calabria on the 9th, although she was ordered away from the battleline to escort the aircraft carrier [...] Repairs were completed by the end of August when Gloucester, now assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, participated in Operation Hats. At the end of September, the ship ferried 1,200 troops to Malta, together with Liverpool. Gloucester spent {{most of the rest of}} the year escorting convoys to and from Greece and Malta, although she escorted the aircraft carrier [...] during the Battle of Taranto on 11 November and ferried troops to Piraeus, Greece, on the 17th.|$|E
500|$|When Belfast {{was first}} {{opened to the}} public, {{visitors}} were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure. As of 2011, nine decks {{are open to the}} public. Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the quarterdeck with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the River Thames. The Imperial War Museum's guidebook to HMS Belfast divides the ship into three broad sections. The first of these, [...] "Life on board the ship", focuses on the experience of serving at sea. Restored compartments, some populated with dressed figures, illustrate the crew's living conditions and the ship's various facilities such as the sick bay, galley, laundry, chapel, mess decks and NAAFI. Since 2002, school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard Belfast overnight, sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck. The second section, [...] "The inner workings", below the waterline and protected by the ship's armoured belt, contains core mechanical, electrical and communication systems. As well as the engine and boiler rooms, other compartments include the transmitting station (housing the ship's Admiralty Fire Control Table, a mechanical computer), the forward <b>steering</b> <b>position</b> and one of Belfasts six-inch shell rooms and magazines. The third section, [...] "Action stations", includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship's armament, fire control, and command facilities. Areas open to the public include the operations room, Admiral's bridge and gun direction platform. During 2011, two of these areas were reinterpreted. The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express, a large British-Australian-American joint exercise held off North Borneo in 1961. The reinterpretation included an interactive audio-visual plotting table. [...] In July 2011, the interior of Y Turret, the aftmost 6-inch turret, was redisplayed using audio-visual and atmospheric effects, seeking to evoke the experience of a gunner at the Battle of North Cape. To emphasise the range of the ship's armament, the forward six-inch guns of A and B Turrets are trained on the London Gateway service area on the M1 motorway, some 12.5 miles away on the outskirts of London. A 4-inch gun mount and a shell hoist are kept in working order and used during blank-firing demonstrations by the Wavy Navy re-enactment group. In addition to the various areas of the ship open to visitors, some compartments have been fitted out as dedicated exhibition space. Permanent exhibitions include [...] "HMS Belfast in War and Peace" [...] and [...] "Life at Sea". The cost of admission to HMS Belfast includes a multilingual audio guide.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945 after 10 {{years service}} which {{included}} busy service {{through the second}} world war H F Bailey ON777 was replaced with a new No 1 lifeboat in December 1945 named The Millie Walton (ON 840). This lifeboat had originally been destined for Douglas on the Isle of man and had only been sent to Cromer for evaluation. Millie Walton was a Watson-class lifeboat but had a new midship <b>steering</b> <b>position</b> which the Cromer crew found much to their liking and so after request from the Cromer crew she remained at Cromer. In 1948 Millie Walton was renamed Henry Blogg in homage to Cromer’s famous lifeboat man Henry Blogg who was the Coxswain. Henry Blogg made his last voyage on the Millie Walton under the new coxswain Henry [...] "Shrimp" [...] Davies on 4 September 1948 at the age of 71.

Each traction wheel is {{operated by a}} DC motor with independent control system. This system {{is made up of}} a chopper, an encoder and a microcomputer. The IPC transmits the velocity values and acceleration ramp references to the PIC microcontrollers. As each traction wheel control is independent, it's possible to obtain different speed values for each wheel. This process facilities the direction and drive changes. Two different strategies for speed velocity control were implemented; one works with PID, and the other with fuzzy logic. There were no changes in circuits and feedback control, except for the PIC microcontroller software. Comparing the two different speed control strategies the results were equivalent.
