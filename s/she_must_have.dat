5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> lived in the closet for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
5|$|In {{later life}} she {{converted}} to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely {{retiring from the}} world. Even in her eighties, however, she was still active in the literary world, entertaining female artists such as Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake {{after the collapse of}} the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so it is evident that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> died before this date.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{contemporaneous}} {{or nearly}} contemporaneous sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, according to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly contemporaneous Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

25|$|What {{the woman}} who labors wants {{is the right to}} live, not simply exist— the right to life as the rich woman has the right to life, and the sun and music and art.

25|$|When Surry was {{originally}} built at Harwich in 1811 {{she had two}} decks with a height between decks of 5ft. 8 ins. However, about 1818, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> received a major refit - the Shipping Registers after 1819 record her as having three decks. She was owned by the well-known London firm of F. & C.F. Mangles. She was described for many years as a first-class ship built of first-class materials.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Vanstone {{began by}} {{referring}} to the long and intimate friendship which had existed between Miss Garth and herself. She now felt it due to that friendship to explain confidentially the motive which had induced her to leave home with her husband. Miss Garth had delicately refrained from showing it, but <b>she</b> <b>must</b> naturally <b>have</b> felt, and <b>must</b> still be feeling, great surprise at the mystery in which their departure had been involved; and <b>she</b> <b>must</b> doubtless <b>have</b> asked herself why Mrs. Vanstone should {{have been associated with}} family affairs which (in her independent position as to relatives) must necessarily concern Mr. Vanstone alone.|$|R
25|$|In December 629, {{on the eve}} of the Conquest of Mecca, Muhammad sent Al-Zubayr and Ali to {{intercept}} a spy who was carrying a letter to the Quraysh. When they could not find the letter in her baggage, they realised <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> concealed it on her person, so they threatened to strip her. The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali brought it back to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.|$|E
25|$|The Purana {{presents}} seven {{teachers and}} their hagiographic stories, describing for example Kapila, the Samkhya philosopher, as someone who was born as a full grown adult, who teaches his mother {{that in order to}} reach liberation, <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> bhakti, jnana (wisdom), and vairagya (dispassion), with bhakti being the most important. Other teachers such as Narada and Suka described in the Purana, however, present Bhakti with less prominence, and emphasize Advaita philosophy and Jnana yoga instead but then add that adoring Hari (Krishna) has the same liberating benefits.|$|E
25|$|Welden didn't {{return to}} campus. Her roommate thought <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{gone to the}} library to study for exams, but the next morning, Welden still hadn't returned. Once the college administrators were notified, they {{immediately}} started {{a search of the}} campus itself. The Bennington County State's Attorney was notified, and the county sheriff was brought in to help with the search. Over the next couple of days, her visit to the Long Trail was discovered when one of the hikers she had approached identified her from the photo in the Bennington Banner newspaper, where he worked.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor came out, {{and said}} in a low voice, [...] "There's nothing to be anxious about, but <b>she</b> really <b>must</b> <b>have</b> quiet. I'll send Mrs. Morrell down to see you, after tea. She's quiet itself." ...|$|R

25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} hikers were {{walking down the}} trail as Welden was walking up. She {{approached}} them and asked them a few questions about the Long Trail. She continued walking in a northerly direction on the road portion of the trail now known as Harbour Road. Welden was on the Long Trail {{late in the afternoon}} and darkness was falling as she approached the end of Harbour Road. She may have continued into quickly darkening woods and it was presumed that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> continued her Long Trail walk along the Bolles Brook valley, although there are no known confirmed sightings of her past the Fay Fuller Camp.|$|E
25|$|When Gojong {{reached the}} age of 15, his father decided it was time for him to be married. The Daewongun was diligent to search for a queen who would serve his purposes: <b>she</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> no close {{relatives}} who would harbor political ambitions, yet come from a noble lineage so as to justify his choice to the court and the people. Candidates were rejected one by one, until both the Daewongun's wife Yeoheung (Princess Consort to the Prince of the Great Court; Yeoheung Budaebuin; 여흥부대부인, 驪興府大夫人) and his mother proposed a bride from their own clan, the Yeoheung Min. The two women described the girl persuasively: she was orphaned and possessed beautiful features, a healthy body, and an ordinary level of education.|$|E
60|$|But {{evening after}} evening passed away, {{and she saw}} no sign of him. She felt the futility, the humiliating uselessness of these nightly peregrinations {{in search of a}} man who seemed to have a hundred more {{desirable}} occupations than that of meeting his wife. But she had not the power to drift out towards freedom now. She obeyed mechanically because <b>she</b> <b>must.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> sworn to obey and he had bidden her come and wait for him.|$|R
60|$|Fred demurred, but Tom must be satisfied. Also Laura, a handsome, clever girl, the bride, <b>she</b> also <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a {{great and}} jolly feast. It appealed to her educated sense. She had been to Salisbury Training College, knew folk-songs and morris-dancing.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a dreary}} comfort! Philippa {{had gone before}} me; the prints of the one small foot were hers. <b>She</b> <b>must,</b> then, <b>have</b> hopped all the way! Could such a mode of {{progression}} be consistent {{with a feeling of}} guilt? Could remorse step so gaily? ...|$|R
