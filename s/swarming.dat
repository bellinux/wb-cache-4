5|$|Locusts are the <b>swarming</b> {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned {{grasshoppers}} {{in the family}} Acrididae. <b>Swarming</b> behaviour {{is a response to}} overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a <b>swarming</b> one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E

5|$|<b>Swarming</b> {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the <b>swarming</b> form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for <b>swarming.</b>|$|E
40|$|Measurements on krill from {{distinct}} <b>swarms</b> and echo-sounder {{measurements of}} the same <b>swarms</b> have been analysed using multivariate methods. The analysis has addressed the problems of whether krill <b>swarms</b> in a small area may be of {{a limited number of}} types, and whether the biological characteristics of the krill could be related to the echo-sounder {{measurements of the}} <b>swarm.</b> The main sources of biological variation between krill in different <b>swarms</b> seemed to be related to size and maturity. Krill <b>swarms</b> did not appear to form groups based on biological similarity, and <b>swarms</b> caught in the same haul were as different as <b>swarms</b> caught in different hauls. However, <b>swarms</b> could be divided into groups on the basis of time of day and <b>swarm</b> depth. The biological features (size, maturity, sex ratio and moult stage) of krill in the <b>swarms</b> were not related to echo-sounder observations (horizontal and vertical extent, depth and density of <b>swarms),</b> although some degree of separation between <b>swarms</b> containing large and small krill may be possible if the shape of the <b>swarms</b> is considered.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for organizing <b>swarms</b> of robots into a formation utilizing artificial potential fields generated from normal and sigmoid functions. These functions construct the surface which <b>swarm</b> members travel on, controlling the overall <b>swarm</b> geometry {{and the individual}} member spacing. Nonlinear limiting functions are defined to provide tighter <b>swarm</b> control by modifying and adjusting a set of control variables forcing the <b>swarm</b> to behave according to set constraints, formation and member spacing. The <b>swarm</b> function and limiting functions are combined to control <b>swarm</b> formation, orientation, and <b>swarm</b> movement as a whole. Parameters are chosen based on desired formation as well as user defined constraints. This approach compared to others, is simple, computationally efficient, scales well to different <b>swarm</b> sizes, to heterogeneous systems, and to both centralized and decentralized <b>swarm</b> models.

40|$|<b>Swarm</b> {{computing}} involves devices operating like a <b>swarm</b> of insects. A <b>swarm</b> {{device is}} a small mobile robot with sensing capabilities. Therefore, <b>swarm</b> computing is significantly different from traditional computing methods in that <b>swarm</b> programs {{must be able to}} handle unknown environments and nodes that are capable of moving. Because <b>swarm</b> computing differs so drastically from traditional computing, traditional programming techniques will not work in <b>swarm</b> computing. Before such techniques can be developed for <b>swarm</b> computing, a better understanding needs to be gained of a <b>swarm</b> of computing devices. Through experimentation, I sought to gain an understanding of the basic principles of <b>swarm</b> computing. I used the libraries in the <b>Swarm</b> Development Group's package to create multiple programs implementing the same <b>swarm</b> behavior (primitives). Having wrote these programs, I ran them in the <b>Swarm</b> simulator and compare characteristics such as the power consumption of nodes. Having completed this project, I delivered a set of <b>swarm</b> primitives and information that I have gathered on basic <b>swarm</b> behavior. These primitives are not particularly useful by themselves but they can be combined and integrated to form <b>swarm</b> applications that actually perform a useful task. Ideally, other researchers can use my insights to develop future <b>swarm</b> programs. The researchers can then write programs for <b>swarms</b> of computational devices to accomplish such tasks as the exploration of Mars, clearing the blockage in arteries or other tasks that require the coordination of a multitude of devices. iii Table of Contents Abstract [...] . ii List of Tables [...] ...|$|R

This paper describes {{a simple but}} effective algorithm for emergent <b>swarm</b> taxis (<b>swarm</b> motion toward a beacon) in a 2 D or 3 D wireless connected <b>swarm</b> of minimalist mobile robots. The paper then undertakes a deep analysis of the <b>swarm</b> taxis by identifying both first and second order micro-level robot interactions and quantifying the contribution of each such interaction to the macro-level <b>swarm</b> behaviour. From the analysis we develop a simple quantitative model that is able to predict <b>swarm</b> velocity with reasonable accuracy.

5|$|Some millipedes are {{considered}} household pests, including Xenobolus carnifex which can infest thatched roofs in India, and Ommatoiulus moreleti, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical <b>swarming</b> behaviour, which {{can result in}} home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake millipede (Blaniulus guttulatus) is a noted pest of sugar beets and other root crops, {{and as a result}} {{is one of the few}} millipedes with a common name.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in <b>swarming</b> behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to <b>swarming</b> in honeybees.|$|E
40|$|The Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation {{algorithm}} {{is widely used}} to solve multiobjective optimisation problems. This algorithm optimises one objective using a <b>swarm</b> of particles where their movements are guided by the best solution found by another <b>swarm.</b> However, the best solution of a <b>swarm</b> is only updated when a newly generated solution has better fitness than the best solution at the objective function optimised by that <b>swarm,</b> yielding poor solutions for the multiobjective optimisation problems. Thus, an improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation {{algorithm is}} introduced by incorporating the nondominated solutions as the guidance for a <b>swarm</b> rather than using the best solution from another <b>swarm.</b> In this paper, the performance of improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm is investigated using performance measures such {{as the number of}} nondominated solutions found, the generational distance, the spread, and the hypervolume. The results suggest that the improved Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm has impressive performance compared with the conventional Vector Evaluated Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimisation algorithm...|$|R

5|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for <b>swarming.</b> The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E

5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing the blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, <b>swarming</b> is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
5|$|As a {{personal}} cavalry escort, Constantius provided Julian with 200 scholares, a regiment of cataphractarii (heavily armoured cavalry) and some mounted archers (in total 360 men).

He spent the winter of 355/356 with his escorting troops at Vienna (Vienne), not far South of Lugdunum (Lyons). For the 356 campaigning season, Julian's first task was to link up with the main Gaul comitatus, which had wintered at Remi (Reims) {{under the command of}} the magister equitum, Ursicinus' recently appointed successor, Marcellus. This involved a long march through country <b>swarming</b> with Alamanni raiding bands, many of which were as large or larger than Julian's own escort and expert at ambuscades.

5|$|In 1636 {{the boat}} of Massachusetts trader John Oldham was seen {{anchored}} off Block Island, <b>swarming</b> with Indians. The Indians fled at {{the approach of}} the investigating colonists, and Oldham's body was found below the main deck. The attackers were at the time believed to be from tribes affiliated with the Narragansetts, but Narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to the protection of the Pequots. At the time the Pequots were aggressively expansionist in their dealings with the surrounding native tribes (including the Narragansett), but had generally kept the peace with the English colonists of present-day southern New England. The accusation of the Narraganssetts angered Massachusetts authorities (then under governor Henry Vane), who were already upset that the Pequots had earlier failed to turn over men implicated in killing another trader on the Connecticut River. This second perceived affront produced calls in Massachusetts for action against the Pequots.
