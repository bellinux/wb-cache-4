25|$|A great {{boon for}} {{the economy of the}} village was the {{building}} of the Kennels in 1836 for the Duke of Buccleuch's pack. The hunting season brought many visitors and this led to the building of the Buccleuch Arms Hotel. At this time the local smiddy showed good business sense by moving from the east end of the village to the present location at the west end, in order, we can <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> be nearer the Kennels which, at one time, stabled as many as fifty horses.|$|E
25|$|According {{to another}} theory, {{the name is}} a {{corruption}} of two words which mean the Friars’ Hill; those who favour this idea allege that St. Ninian, by planting a religious house near the head {{of what is now}} the Friars’ Vennel, {{at the close of the}} fourth century, became the virtual founder of the Burgh; however Ninian, so far as is known, did not originate any monastic establishments anywhere and was simply a missionary.

25|$|<b>Suppose,</b> <b>to</b> the contrary, {{that there}} is a function, f, on the natural numbers with f(n+1) an element of f(n) for each n. Define S = {f(n): n a natural number}, the range of f, which can be seen to be a set from the axiom schema of replacement. Applying the axiom of {{regularity}} to S, let B be an element of S which is disjoint from S. By the definition of S, B must be f(k) for some natural number k. However, we are given that f(k) contains f(k+1) which is also an element of S. So f(k+1) is in the intersection of f(k) and S. This contradicts {{the fact that they are}} disjoint sets. Since our supposition led to a contradiction, there must not be any such function, f.|$|E

[...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club.

2500|$|In 1798, Thomas Robert Malthus wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in {{response}} to Godwin's views on the [...] "perfectibility of society." [...] Malthus wrote that populations are inclined to increase in times of plenty, and that only distress, from causes such as food shortages, disease, or war, serves to stem population growth. Populations in his view are therefore always doomed to grow until distress is felt, at least by the poorer segment of the society. Consequently, poverty was felt to be an inevitable phenomenon of society.Let us imagine for a moment Mr. Godwin's beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this difficulty {{might be expected to}} press under so perfect a form of society.... Let us suppose all the causes of misery and vice in this island removed. War and contention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds no longer collect together in great and pestilent cities.... Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, and in a healthy situation.... And the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of persons, and the produce of the island, we <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolence, guided by impartial justice, will divide this produce among {{all the members of the}} society according to their wants....With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause of depopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known....|$|E

Engineer and CEO of the Yugoslav institute for urbanism and dwelling [...] "Juginus", Mirko Radovanac, revived the idea in the 1990s. After conducting extensive surveys (traffic analysis, interviews with the commuters, climatic, geological, urban and other researches), [...] "Juginus" [...] presented the project in 1993. They proposed that the terminuses should be at the Sports Center Košutnjak and Block 44 in the neighborhood of Savski Blokovi in New Belgrade, across the Sava. Stops in between would include the major public transportation roundabout in Banovo Brdo, Makiš and Ada Ciganlija, five in total. They called it the [...] "ideal route". The plan also included construction of commercial areas around the terminuses, which would cover [...] and help with the profitability of the project. Apart from being ecological and an attraction, it was estimated that it would shorten the trip for 45 minutes. City government included the project into the city's General Urban Plan, which envisioned the construction in phases, the first being a [...] long section Block 44-Ada Ciganlija. It would lay on 8 steel pillars, [...] above the ground and the trip would last for 3 minutes.
