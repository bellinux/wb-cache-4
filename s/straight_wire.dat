The <b>Straight</b> <b>Wire</b> fibula, {{also known as the}} Soldier’s type or Legionnaire's type, is a very plain design. It resembles the violin bow fibula of over one {{thousand}} years earlier except that the bow has slightly more of an arch and the spring in (short) bilateral not unilateral. The <b>Straight</b> <b>Wire</b> fibula is found through the 1st century AD.|$|E

Using different configurations a certain variation [...] is, as seen above, possible.

A tip-back bend will make a curvature during activation and straighten during deactivation.|$|E

30|$|The maximum {{force of}} the bent wires was {{significantly}} higher than that of the <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> throughout the experiment groups and control group (p[*]<[*] 0.00). After wire bending, the maximum force increased from 28.4 [*]±[*] 0.42  N to 32.5 [*]±[*] 3.224  N (p[*]<[*] 0.05). After immersion in artificial saliva for 4  weeks, there was a mild decrease in maximum {{force of the}} <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> as pH increased, whereas a dramatic drop in maximum force in bent wires was noticed (Fig.  4). Yet pH did not make significant influence on SS wires regarding the maximum force values in either the bent or <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.127).|$|R
30|$|The {{flexural}} Young’s modulus of SS wires {{had been}} distinctively reduced after bending (p[*]<[*] 0.000).

This discrepancy between the bent and <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> was not diminished by immersion in artificial saliva of various pH. On the contrary, the discrepancy was enlarged as pH increased, which was mainly contributed by the decrease of Young’s moduli of bent wires because Young’s moduli of <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> were hardly influenced by pH (p[*]=[*] 0.772) (Fig.  4). The lowest Young’s modulus measured {{in this study was}} 242 [*]±[*] 35.07  GPa, marked by the bent wires immersed in pH 7.6 (Table  1).|$|R

30|$|Compared to {{the wires}} in control group, the surface {{roughness}} of the bent and <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> immersed in pH 5.6 and 7.6 were significantly rougher (p[*]<[*] 0.000) (Table  1).

There is no difference in surface roughness of wires between the control and pH 6.6 groups (p[*]=[*] 0.740). A bigger distribution of data for the immersion groups than for the control group was observed, where higher SD were noted for immersion groups than for control groups.

50|$|Several {{species of}} corvids {{have been trained}} to use tools in {{controlled}} experiments. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the New Caledonian crow. One individual called “Betty” spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem. She was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well. Betty tried poking the <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> at the meat. After a series of failures with this direct approach, she withdrew the wire and began directing it {{at the bottom of the}} well, which was secured to its base with duct tape. The wire soon became stuck, whereupon Betty pulled it sideways, bending it and unsticking it. She then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat. In all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> provided, she also made and used a hook in the same manner, but not before trying the <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> first.|$|E

40|$|Thin wire {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} curved wire segments in [1], but a special procedure was needed to evaluate the self and near-self terms. The procedure involved associating the singular behavior with a straight segment tangent to the curved source segment, permitting use of algorithms for <b>straight</b> <b>wires.</b> Recently, a procedure that avoids the singularity extraction for <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> was presented in [2 - 4]. In this paper, the approach in [4] is applied to curved (or higher-order) wires using a procedure {{similar to that used}} in [1] for singularity extraction. Here, the straight tangent segment is used to determine the quadrature rules to be used on the curved segment. The result is a formulation that allows for a general mixture of higher-order basis functions [5] and higher-order wire segments...|$|R

30|$|Mean surface {{roughness}} values, flexural Young’s moduli, and maximum force values of bent wires are {{significantly different from}} those of the <b>straight</b> <b>wires,</b> which was the main effect of wire bending, ignoring the influence of pH. A significant effect was found between Ra-values regarding the main effect of pH, ignoring the influence of shape. There was a significant interaction effect of bending and pH on flexural Young’s moduli of stainless steel archwires, while pH did not show much impact on the maximum force values of those stainless steel wires. Bigger surface irregularities were seen on SEM images of <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> immersed in artificial saliva at pH 5.6 compared to artificial saliva at other pH values. Surface depth (Rz) was more sensitive than Ra in revealing {{surface roughness}}, both measured from 3 D reconstructed SEM images.

5000|$|As {{described}} by Buck, a <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> of tantalum ( [...] having lower Tc) is wrapped {{around with a}} wire of niobium {{in a single layer}} coil. Both wires are electrically isolated from each other. When this device is immersed in a liquid helium bath both wires become superconducting and hence offer no resistance to the passage of electric current. Tantalum in superconducting state can carry large amount of current as compared to its normal state. Now when current is passed through the niobium coil (wrapped around tantalum) it produces a magnetic field, which in turn reduces (kills) the superconductivity of the tantalum wire and hence reduces the amount of the current that can flow through the tantalum wire. Hence one can control the amount of the current that can flow in the <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> with the help of small current in the coiled wire. We can think of the tantalum <b>straight</b> <b>wire</b> as a [...] "gate" [...] and the coiled niobium as a [...] "control".|$|E

30|$|Determining {{the surface}} {{roughness}} {{of stainless steel}} wires is a fundamental concern in corrosion resistance of a wire for orthodontic clinic. Straight archwires are hardly used in a patient’s mouth, and wire bending {{is an integral part}} of the orthodontic treatment. Even though the preformed SS archwires are popularly used nowadays, the chairside wire bending is inevitable due to the variations in the malocclusions of individual patient. In this research it is determined that bent SS wires have a highly significantly rougher surface than <b>straight</b> SS <b>wires,</b> ignoring pH. These divergences in surface roughness between bent and <b>straight</b> <b>wires</b> could be caused by the use of pliers when bending the wires, which could easily cause damages to the protective oxide layer.|$|R

40|$|The traveling-wave energy, which {{multiply}} diffracts on a <b>straight</b> thin <b>wire,</b> {{is represented}} as a sum of terms, each with a distinct physical meaning, that can be individually examined in the time domain.

As is common with asymptotic solutions, when the electrical length of wire is smaller than 0. 2 lambda the results lose accuracy.
