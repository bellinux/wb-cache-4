MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two chemically activated soft liner materials (Sofreliner S; GC Reline Ultrasoft) were tested. Twenty cylindrical specimens (30. 0 x 1. 0 mm) were prepared for measuring water absorption and solubility and another twenty (30. 0 x 3 mm) for analyzing <b>Shore</b> A <b>hardness</b> and color stability.

30|$|Figure  7 {{represents}} the <b>Shore</b> D <b>hardness</b> (ASTM D 2240) of pure PMMA and its nanocomposites. The hardness of PMMA nanocomposites increases with incorporation of nanoclay and compatibilizer.

The model is used in modelling shore A hardness on samples with standard thickness (over 6 mm) and the result is validated against published experimental data. FE indentation models of thin samples are then developed and successfully used to predict the <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of thinner samples over a property range relevant to gasket applications. A chart linking <b>shore</b> <b>hardness,</b> Young’s modulus and samples thickness is established and used to analyse <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> of three cases including silicone rubber made in the lab with different thicknesses, thin silicone rubber gasket and an EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) gasket for plate heat exchangers. In all of the cases, the estimated E values based on <b>shore</b> <b>hardness</b> tests are able to predict the deformation of the material under different loading conditions including tensile and compression tests on samples of different shapes. In shore OO hardness modelling, the numerical results show a good agreement with analytical solution for spherical indenters.
