We measured <b>SP,</b> <b>soil</b> CO 2 fluxes (< 1 to 5. 0 x 104 g m- 2 d- 1), and temperatures (26 to 80 oC) within an area surrounding a normal fault, adjacent to Comalito cinder cone (2002 - 2003). These variables are well spatially correlated. Wavelengths of SP anomalies are = 100 m, and high horizontal SP gradients flank {{the region of}} elevated flux and temperature. Carbon isotopic compositions of soil CO 2 (d 13 C = - 3. 3 to - 1. 1 ?) indicate a deep gas origin. Given {{the presence of a}} deep water table (100 to 150 m), high gas flow rates, and subsurface temperatures above liquid boiling points, we suggest that rapid fluid disruption is primarily responsible for positive SP anomalies here.

In another treatment, litter was removed and replaced by litter from the other plant community. Net N mineralization was measured in situ after 5 years. Less soil organic matter and soil N was found in plots in which litter had been removed, compared with control plots, or plots to which litter had been added, but these differences were significant for the Erica <b>sp.</b> <b>soils</b> only. Plots in which litter had been replaced and control plots did not differ significantly in the amount of soil organic matter. However, in both plant communities, the differences agreed with the faster decomposition rate of Molinia sp. litter compared with Erica sp. litter.

40|$|Electric {{resistivity}} tomography (ERT), self-potential (<b>SP),</b> <b>soil</b> CO 2 flux, {{and temperature}} {{are used to}} study the inner structure of La Fossa cone (Vulcano, Aeolian Islands). Nine profiles were performed across the cone with a measurement spacing of 20 m. The crater rims of La Fossa cone are underlined by sharp horizontal resistivity contrasts. SP, CO 2 flux, and temperature anomalies underline these boundaries which we interpret as structural limits associated to preferential circulation of fluids. The Pietre Cotte crater and Gran Cratere crater enclose the main hydrothermal system, identified at {{the centre of the}} edifice on the base of low electrical resistivity values (b 20 Ω m) and strong CO 2 degassing, SP, and temperature anomalies. In the periphery, the hydrothermal activity is also visible along structural boundaries such as the Punte Nere, Forgia Vecchia, and Palizzi crater rims and {{at the base of the}} cone, on the southern side of the edifice, along a fault attributed to the NW main tectonic trend of the island. Inside the Punte Nere crater, the ERT sections show an electrical resistive body that we interpret as an intrusion or a dome. This magmatic body is reconstructed in 3 D using the available ERT profiles. Its shape and position, with respect to the Pietre Cotte crater fault, allows replacing this structure in the chronology of the development of the volcano. It corresponds to a late phase of activity of the Punte Nere edifice. Considering the position of the <b>SP,</b> <b>soil</b> CO 2 flux, and temperature maxima and the repartition of conductive zones related to hydrothermal circulation with respect to the main structural features, La Fossa cone could be considered as a relevant example of the strong influence of preexisting structures on hydrothermal fluid circulation at the scale of a volcanic edifice...|$|E

Enhanced biofilm formation was observed when the isolates were tested in LB medium, at 30 °C, at pH 7. 2, and in the presence of as little as 2 mM glucose respectively. It was also shown that all SVCs displayed significantly greater capacity to form biofilms than the corresponding LCVs when cultured in LB at 37 °C.

Poultry dropping was the organic nitrogen source of one heap while pig waste was used for the other heap. Samples were taken weekly and analyzed using soil dilution method for isolation of moulds on potato dextrose agar medium. The qualities of composts after eight weeks were evaluated by performance and yield of tomato crops. Eleven fungal isolates were obtained in compost containing poultry dropping and nine fungal isolates were obtained from compost containing pig manure. The predominant mycoflora of poultry dropping compost at 3 weeks of composting was Fusarium pallidoroseum (23. 08 %) while Aspergillus fumigatus (38. 96 %) dominated compost containing pig waste. Fungi isolated from the composts included cellulolytic fungi like Chaetomium sp. and Phoma <b>sp.</b> <b>Soil</b> amended with both composts improved the growth and yield of tomato crop significantly.

We utilize δ 13 C and 14 C data of bulk and size-separated soil organic matter (SOM) to infer {{the time course of}} changes in vegetation and soil carbon stocks. δ 13 C values of bulk SOM indicate a shift from grass (C 4) - to tree (C 3) -derived carbon in the woodland compared with the grassland.

Sugarcane filter cake (blothong, Indonesian, SFC) and rice husk ash (RHA) are locally available in Coban Rondo, Malang, East Java and hence potentially used for soil amendment. To study the effects of SFC and RHA on P availability, P uptake and plant growth (Brassica <b>sp.),</b> <b>soil</b> samples were taken from 0 - 20 cm depth, incubated with SFC (21. 37 Mg. ha - 1) and RHA (44. 64 Mg. ha - 1).

Crop parameters (height, number of leaves, total dry weight) and P-uptake were also measured at 2, 4, 6 weeks after planting. The results showed that RHA was more effective than SFC to decrease P retention and increase P availability (120 % on RHA; and 78 % on SFC). Soils having higher organic matter tended to have higher P availability. As a consequence, RHA and SFC increased P-uptake respectively 3 and 2 times in soil rich in organic matter, and 1. 9 and 2. 7 times in soil low in organic matter compared to untreated soil.

In addition to conventional analytical techniques, solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to follow the cellular distribution of [1 - 13 C]acetate {{in the presence of}} unlabeled phenol. With 5 mM acetate as the primary substrate, Pseudomonas sp. 9 S 8 D 2 removed 1 mM phenol (secondary substrate) at a rate of 2 nmol/mg of total cell protein. Although extensive acetate metabolism was indicated by a significant redistribution of the carboxyl label, this redistribution was not affected by the presence of phenol as a secondary substrate. When the {{primary and secondary}} substrate roles were reversed, however, the presence of 1 mM phenol altered the metabolism of 0. 1 mM acetate, as evidenced by both the two- to fourfold increases in carboxyl label that appeared in terminal methyl and acyl chain methylene carbon resonances and the decrease in label that occurred in the carbohydrate spectral region. These results suggest that, when phenol is present as the primary substrate, acetate is preferentially shuttled into fatty acyl chain synthesis, whereas phenol carbon is funnelled into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, simultaneous use of a xenobiotic compound and a natural substrate apparently does occur, and the relative concentrations of the two substrates do influence the rate and manner in which the compounds are utilized.

The large SP responses over both ore zones are simulated using new methods which allowed the width and depth of oxidation to be computed. Conventional and compensation array resistivity responses best define the deposits. Computer simulation shows that dipole- dipole and Unipole arrays are most useful. First order IP responses are large and similar, but the ore zones are not easily distinguished from polarizable host rocks. Second order responses, at Woodlawn, better define these lithologies and cross-plots of EM coupling removed first order parameters prove useful. The supergene and gossan zones are defined as sources of electrical anomalies and correlate with interpreted SP sources. Seismic velocities of fresh Woodlawn ore samples indicate only small contrasts with host rocks. Refraction travel-time data are highly complex but host rocks are clearly distinguished by their seismic velocities. Both deposits appear as low velocity zones at the general bedrock level which are shallower and narrower than the electrical sources associated with the ore zones. Extensive model simulation shows that the Reciprocal interpretation method is most useful when compared to other time- term methods for refraction interpretation but has some limitations. Computer simulation shows the significance of non- critical refractions, diffractions and laterally hidden zones which define the lateral resolution of the refraction method.

40|$|Ph. D., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Introduced {{plants will}} lose {{interactions}} with natural enemies, mutualists and competitors from their native ranges, and possibly gain interactions with new species, under new abiotic conditions {{in their new}} environment. The use of biocontrol agents {{is based on the}} premise that introduced species are liberated from their natural enemies, although in some cases introduced species may not become invasive because they acquire novel natural enemies. In this study I consider the potential for the biocontrol of Bryophyllum delagoense, a Madagascan endemic, and hypothesize as to why this plant is invasive in Australia and not in South Africa. Of the 33 species of insects collected on B. delagoense in Madagascar, three species, Osphilia tenuipes, Eurytoma bryophylli, and Rhembastus sp. showed potential as biocontrol agents in Australia. Surveys in southern Africa revealed that B. delagoense had acquired 14 species of insects, compared to only two in Australia, which supported the hypothesis that an introduced plant is less likely to become invasive in regions where there are many closely related species. A beetle, Alcidodes sedi, was found to be widespread and damaging in South Africa and also sufficiently host specific for release in Australia. Studies were also undertaken to determine the biology of B. delagoense and characteristics of the recipient environments in Australia and South Africa. Analysis of soils in South Africa found that B. delagoense has the ability to grow on a range of soils and is tolerant of moderate shade. Bryophyllum delagoense exhibited phenotypic plasticity by re-allocating resources to stem production in light-limited; and to root production in nutrient- or water limited, environments. Competition trials indicated that B. delagoense is a weak competitor with overgrazing and the concomitant reduction in fires facilitating invasions. The absence of damaging natural enemies and characteristics of the Australian environment may make it more prone to B. delagoense invasions than in southern Africa. The study indicates that no single trait or group of traits can completely explain the invasive ability of a plant species because the success of an invader often depends on complex interactions between the species and its recipient environment. This has widespread implications for predicting the invasibility of imported plants.

It is said that about 40 % of the nitrogen applied percolate below the vadose zone of a clay loam soil which can even more leach from sandy soils. HYDRUS- 2 D model was used to analyse different fertilizer placement strategies in the furrow in order to reduce nitrogen leaching from a furrows prepared in different soil textures. Strategies of soil management included controlled or normal (Sn), compacting furrow bottom (Sc) and covering bottom of furrow with plastic sheet (<b>Sp).</b> <b>Soils</b> used for analysis consisted, sandy loam, loam and clay. Considered placements of fertilizer included fertilizer at the sides and bottom of furrow (P 1) near ridge the ridge top (P 2). Results of simulations obtained with HYDRUS showed that for the considered soil textures 25 % to 60 % water can be saved Sc, which can further be enhanced from 50 % to 95 % using Sp. Simulated results revealed that 15 % to 99 % nitrogen leaching can be reduced by using fertilizer placement P 2. About 10 % to 98 % reduction in nitrogen leaching can be achieved if we adopt soil management strategies reported in this study.

40|$|Contamination of {{groundwater}} {{is a great}} concern in many irrigated areas of the world. In irrigated areas of world, about 90 % of land is irrigated with furrow irrigation method. It {{is said to be}} water use efficient method than the conventional methods but is said to be capable of leaching large quantities of nitrogen to the groundwater. It is said that about 40 % of the nitrogen applied percolate below the vadose zone of a clay loam soil which can even more leach from sandy soils. HYDRUS- 2 D model was used to analyse different fertilizer placement strategies in the furrow in order to reduce nitrogen leaching from a furrows prepared in different soil textures. Strategies of soil management included controlled or normal (Sn), compacting furrow bottom (Sc) and covering bottom of furrow with plastic sheet (<b>Sp).</b> <b>Soils</b> used for analysis consisted, sandy loam, loam and clay. Considered placements of fertilizer included fertilizer at the sides and bottom of furrow (P 1) near ridge the ridge top (P 2). Results of simulations obtained with HYDRUS showed that for the considered soil textures 25 % to 60 % water can be saved Sc, which can further be enhanced from 50 % to 95 % using Sp. Simulated results revealed that 15 % to 99 % nitrogen leaching can be reduced by using fertilizer placement P 2.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to investigate the basipetal translocation of nematicidal activity from foliar treatments of carbofuran and its analog, 2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 -benzofuranyl ([dibutylamino]thio) methyl carbamate, on corn in microplot studies and on tobacco and potato in field trials. Two and three foliar applications of either product at 2, 400 μg/ml (9 - 20 Kg ai/Ha) significantly reduced populations of Pratylenchus penetrans in roots and populations of Tylenchorhynchus claytoni, Xiphinema americanum, and Hoplolaimus <b>sp.</b> in <b>soil.</b> In most cases {{there was no difference}} in control between two or three chemical applications. Foliar treatments with carbofuran were equivalent to, or better than, soil treatment, although rates of applications were different...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this greenhouse study was to evaluate the effects of four different concentrations of biofertilizers containing Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp. and Streptomyces <b>sp.</b> on <b>soil</b> properties and to evaluate the growth of Brassica oleraceae var. capitata. The application treatments included control (no fertilizer) and four concentration of diluted biofertilizer per pot (20 ml, 40 ml, 60 mland 80 ml). The application of biofertilizer containing benefi cial bacteria signifi cantly increased the growth of B. oleraceae. The useof biofertilizer resulted higher biomass weight and length as well as root length. This greenhouse study also indicated that differentamount of biofertilizer application had almost similar effects. Microbial inoculum not only increased plant harvest, but also improvedsoil properties, such as number of microorganisms, respiration and urease activities...|$|R

40|$|Two {{new species}} of plant {{parasitic}} nematodes (Tylenchorhynchus quaidi n. sp. and T. tritici n. sp.) from Pakistan are described and illustrated. Tylenchorhynchus quaidi n. <b>sp.,</b> from <b>soil</b> around roots of potato (Solanum tuberosum) from an experimental field of NNRC, Karachi, Pakistan, is distinguishable from other species by its peculiar sunken dome-shaped head. Although similar to T. goffarti, it differs by head shape, areolation of lateral field, ratios a (23 - 28 vs. 29 - 37) and c (11 - 14 vs. 13 - 20), and a vagina that is half sclerotized and half unsclerotized. Tylenchorhynchus tritici n. <b>sp.,</b> from <b>soil</b> around roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum) from Campbellpur, Pakistan, is similar to T. ventrosignatus and T. nordiensis. It differs from T. ventrosignatus by a continuous lip region, number of head annules (2 - 3 vs. 4), coarse body annulation, absence of a wave-like structure near the vulva, and by tail shape and number of tail annules (15 - 23 vs. 28 - 32). It differs from T. nordiensis by stylet length (12. 4 - 14. 6 vs. 11 - 13 μm), shape of stylet knobs, number of head annules (2 - 3 vs. 4), non-areolated lateral field in region of phasmids, and not fusing in posterior third of tail. Morphometrics of Tylenchorhynchus claytoni from soil around stunted maize (Zea mays L.), in Muscatine County, Iowa, and several other populations are given. Detailed morphometric data on T. claytoni based on topotypes collected from type locality and several other populations revealed that this species shows variations {{in the shape of}} tail in females, number of tail annules (and sometimes annules extending further back on the terminus, almost being an annulated terminus), position of phasmid, and shape of lip region. The subgenus Bitylenchus is proposed as a new synonym of Tylenchorhynchus and its species referred to the latter genus...|$|R
40|$|The {{immobilization}} {{potential of}} Sb(III) and Sb(V) by freshly crushed steel slag fines (SSF) media was evaluated. The SSF media was characterized as USCS <b>SP</b> type <b>soil</b> with < 5 % passing the No. 200 (0. 075 mm) sieve. Despite its granular nature, the mineralogy and residual lime content make the SSF media quite reactive {{and there is}} interest in potentially using SSF media in firing range back stop berms. Accordingly, the SSF media was individually spiked Sb(III) and Sb(V) solutions having target doses equivalent to 100 mg/kg to 10, 000 mg/kg to gauge {{the ability of the}} SSF media to immobilize antimony, an alloy used in munitions. After 30 days of mellowing, all samples were air-dried and tested for pH, total metal concentrations, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) leaching performance.
