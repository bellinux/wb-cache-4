5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{began to think}} of a supernatural <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the pirate genre.

5|$|O'Reilly's {{later years}} were troubled with poor health, {{including}} {{the loss of}} a leg. In late 1988, he suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalised for two months. He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, aged 86. O'Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the international stage.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as <b>spin.</b> <b>On</b> the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
5|$|The roster was {{selected}} internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the selection process, which took around {{three to four}} months, {{was to create a}} cast featuring a wide variety of characters. Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well they fit within the Injustice storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development. The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties, allowing them to put their own <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, such as Darkseid, Scarecrow, Metallo, and Gorilla Grodd, also appear as non-player characters, making cameo appearances in story cutscenes, stages, and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, Scorpion from the Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Sydney, Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match, {{removing}} Hutton in both innings. He {{had another}} notable innings {{when he joined}} Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. In particular, Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon standing around 40 yards behind the bat. They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership in 40 minutes, which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking. Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace, and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston. However, a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball; he was caught behind for 11, giving England a dramatic victory. After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last Test performance {{in front of his}} home crowd at the MCG, with some tight <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> a dry surface. He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before cleaning up the tail with three quick wickets. This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs. Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be the his last Test on Australian soil. Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes; it was Australia's third consecutive Test defeat, the first time they had suffered a hat-trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. Johnston had less success outside the Tests, which were played on bowler-friendly surfaces. He managed only 13 wickets at 30.38 in five matches.|$|E
5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear {{during the course of}} that lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in damp weather conditions with intermittent rain. Coulthard achieved his second pole position of the season, his first at the Hockenheimring, with a time of 1:45.697. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Michael Schumacher who was 1.3 seconds slower than Coulthard. Fisichella qualified third, though he was happy with his performance despite using his team's T-car after suffering a <b>spin</b> <b>on</b> his first run. He was later fined $5,000 for not placing his car at the pit-lane weighbridge. Häkkinen qualified fourth, three hundredths of a second slower than Fisichella. Häkkinen later admitted that he was cautious about going off the race track due to the weather conditions. de la Rosa qualified fifth giving Arrows their best qualifying performance of the season. Trulli and Wurz were satisfied with their sixth and seventh place qualifying positions. Herbert in the quicker of the two Jaguars took eighth. Villeneuve secured ninth using his team's spare car after spinning on track which disrupted Frentzen's running. Irvine rounded out the top ten. Verstappen had problems starting his engine, resulting in a lack of qualifying laps but managed to clinch eleventh. Zonta qualified twelfth having used a new engine and could not set a faster lap time after being blocked by Jean Alesi. He was ahead of Alesi's teammate Nick Heidfeld. Ralf Schumacher qualified in 14th, quicker than teammate Button in 16th. They were separated by Salo. Frentzen spent the majority of qualifying 107% outside of the pole sitters time but took 17th; his first quick time was disallowed after cutting the chicane to set a faster lap and to run in clean air. Barrichello used his teammate's car after his developed oil-leak issues and qualified 18th. Sauber's Pedro Diniz took 19th, in front of Alesi in 20th. The Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in 21st and Marc Gené in 22nd.|$|E
