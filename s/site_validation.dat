40|$|Referenzgelände-Methode für die EMV-Meßgeländeüberprüfung Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMC) compliance {{testing for}} the CE-certification of electronic apparatus involves {{the measurement of}} radiated-emissions in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 1 GHz. To achieve equivalent test results from different testing laboratories, test sites must be of validated, standard performance. This paper suggests two substantial improvements to the standard <b>site</b> <b>validation</b> procedure: (i) Precise, numerically calculated reference values of site attenuation for tuned dipoles are given. (ii) The new "site-reference method " for <b>site</b> <b>validation</b> is suggested. It avoids {{the determination of the}} antenna factors of transmit and receive antenna and minimizes uncertainties in the measurement result. This improves the reliability of judgements upon site performance and helps to economize the design of test facilities, e. g. anechoic chambers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the latest {{techniques}} for validation of anechoic chambers are described. The Short Dipole <b>Site</b> <b>Validation</b> Method (SDSV) {{is based on}} the use of the CISPR 16 dipole in an expanded, non-resonant frequency range. The SDSV idea is great as it combines advantages of the Site Reference method (direct comparison of two site attenuations, no antenna factors involved, quasi-swept frequency scan, fast, volumetric) with advantages of the tuned half-wave dipole method (numerically calculable, very accurate). We have compared site validations done according to the Site Reference Method to SDSV results. Thereby we encountered several disadvantages of this new SDSV procedure. Due to the high antenna factors below the resonance frequency a good dynamic range of the test receiver is required. Another problem is the amount of time needed for the measurements. A set of at least three dipole pairs is required to cover the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz instead of two broadband antennas. The antenna pattern of dipole and broadband antenna are different this leads to different results in the <b>site</b> <b>validation.</b> For chamber validation the performance of the chamber itself should be checked. Therefore the antenna system for the validation procedure must be calibrated under exactly the same setup conditions (including antenna mast, tripod and antenna cables) as used for <b>site</b> <b>validation.</b> In the numerical simulation of the SDSV reference these influences can not be considered. Finally there is no reason to prefer the SDSV method to the site reference method...|$|E
40|$|Some {{emission}} and susceptibility EMC standards already require measurements above 1 GHz or test <b>site</b> <b>validations</b> (IEC 2006, CISPR 2006). A simple {{assignment of}} the established measurement methods below 1 GHz to the frequency range above 1 GHz bears some risks. The ratio between the physical size of the equipment under test (EUT) and the wave-length rises with frequency. This increases the electrical size of the EUT. The directivity may become larger and the radiation pattern of the EUT is getting more complex which reduces the probability to detect the maximum emission with a simple planar cut scan. To analyse these effects in more detail this paper shows radiation characteristics of an exemplary EUT. The influence of a receiving antenna height scan and the angle increment of the turntable scan on the detection of the maximum of the electrical field strength will be discussed. As a result some ideas {{will be given to}} reduce the measurement time but keeping the reliability of the measurement results constant. © Author(s) 2008...|$|R

This study evaluates incoming longwave radiation measured at two nearby glacier stations in the high Andes of the Norte Chico region of Chile. These data are the first published records of atmospheric longwave radiation measurements in this region. Nine previously published optimised parameterisations for clear sky emissivity all pro-duced results with a {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) ~ 20 W m− 2 and bias within ± 5 W m− 2, which is inline with findings from other regions. Six optimised parameterisations for incoming longwave in all sky conditions were trialled for application to this site, five of which performed comparably well with RMSE on daytime data < 18 Wm− 2 and bias within ± 6 Wm− 2 when applied to the optimisation site and RMSE < 20 Wm− 2 and bias within ± 10 W m− 2 when applied to the <b>validation</b> <b>site.</b> The parameterisation proposed by Mölg et al.

This model was originally developed using citizen reports of coyote sightings to predict {{the probability of a}} human-coyote interaction based on proximity to habitat features. Because the data were obtained from surveys, researchers could not separate patterns of site occupancy by coyotes from possible patterns of detection by respondents. Nevertheless, the model could be an indicator of site occupancy within the suburban matrix. We sought to evaluate the predictive power of the human-coyote interaction model with data gathered via a more rigorous method. To build a set of <b>validation</b> <b>sites,</b> we surveyed 11 parks in Westchester County and one park in Bronx County, NY with camera traps between April and October of 2010. The probability of photographing a coyote in a single trap-night was 0. 06 ± 0. 12 and all sites had > 0. 9 probability of detecting a coyote at least once given the total trap-nights at each <b>site.</b> During <b>validation,</b> we also added four additional sites that had been surveyed by other researchers with camera traps as additional “present” sites. Predictions of coyote presence or absence based on the human-coyote interaction model for these 16 <b>validation</b> <b>sites</b> were compared to the observed survey results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediment {{resuspension}} is {{an important}} factor in controlling the impact of any localised point source impacts such as salmon farms; at high-flow (dispersive) sites, resuspension can significantly reduce potential effects. Depositional modelling (DEPOMOD) is widely used to predict localised seabed impacts and includes an optional flow-related resuspension module. This study examined the observed impacts at 5 farms with contrasting flow regimes to evaluate the role of modelled resuspension dynamics in determining impacts. When resuspension was included in the model, net particle export (i. e. no significant net downward flux of organic material) was predicted at the most dispersive sites. However, significant seabed effects were observed, suggesting that although the model outputs were theoretically plausible, they were inconsistent with the observational data. When the model was run without resuspension, the results were consistent with the field survey data. This retrospective validation allows a more realistic estimation of the depositional flux required, suggesting that approximately twice the flux was needed to induce an effect level at the dispersive sites equivalent to that at the non-dispersive sites. Moderate enrichment was associated with a flux of 0. 4 and 1 kg m− 2 yr− 1, whilst highly enriched conditions occurred in response to 6 and 13 kg m− 2 yr− 1, for low and dispersive sites, respectively. This study shows that the association between current flow, sediment resuspension and ecological impacts is more complex than presently encapsulated within DEPOMOD. Consequently, where depositional models are employed at dispersive <b>sites,</b> <b>validation</b> data should be obtained to ensure that the impacts are accurately predicted...|$|R
