500|$|Mice {{that produce}} {{truncated}} versions of BRCA2 are viable but sterile. [...] BRCA2 mutant rats have a phenotype of growth inhibition and sterility in both sexes. [...] Aspermatogenesis in these mutant rats {{is due to}} a failure of homologous chromosome <b>synapsis</b> during meiosis.|$|E
500|$|In {{the plant}} Arabidopsis thaliana, {{loss of the}} BRCA2 homolog AtBRCA2 causes severe defects in both male meiosis and in the {{development}} of the female gametocyte. [...] AtBRCA2 protein is required for proper localization of the synaptonemal complex protein AtZYP1 and the recombinases AtRAD51 and AtDMC1. [...] Furthermore, AtBRCA2 is required for proper meiotic <b>synapsis.</b> [...] Thus AtBRCA2 is likely important for meiotic recombination. [...] It appears that AtBRCA2 acts during meiosis to control the single-strand invasion steps mediated by AtRAD51 and AtDMC1 occurring during meiotic homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages.|$|E
500|$|DMC1 (DNA meiotic {{recombinase}} 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. [...] DMC1 {{promotes the}} formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. [...] Human DMC1 interacts directly with each {{of a series of}} repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. [...] BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. [...] The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with DMC1. [...] The ssDNA complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous ssDNA from another chromosome during the <b>synapsis</b> stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to {{play a key role in}} recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiotic recombination.|$|E
2500|$|Rice {{is used as}} a model {{organism}} {{for investigating}} the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and DNA repair in higher plants. [...] Meiosis is a key stage of the sexual cycle in which diploid cells in the ovule (female structure) and the anther (male structure) produce haploid cells that develop further into gametophytes and gametes. So far, 28 meiotic genes of rice have been characterized. [...] Studies of rice gene OsRAD51C showed that this gene is necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA, particularly the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis. [...] Rice gene OsDMC1 was found to be essential for pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, and rice gene OsMRE11 was found to be required for both <b>synapsis</b> of homologous chromosomes and repair of double-strand breaks during meiosis.|$|E

50|$|Chromosomal {{crossover}} (or crossing over) is {{the exchange}} of genetic material between homologous chromosomes that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. It {{is one of the}} final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called <b>synapsis.</b> <b>Synapsis</b> begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Synapsis</b> (also called syndesis) is the {{pairing of}} two {{homologous}} chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs {{prior to their}} segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. <b>Synapsis</b> takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex. Autosomes undergo <b>synapsis</b> during meiosis, and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex. Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present {{at one end of}} each sex chromosome.|$|E

50|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} {{occurs at}} two separate stages during meiosis called prophase I and prophase II (see meiosis diagram). In a diploid cell {{there are two}} sets of homologous chromosomes of different parental origin (e.g. a paternal and a maternal set). During the phase of meiosis labeled “interphase s” in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so {{that each of the}} chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called <b>synapsis</b> (see <b>Synapsis).</b> During <b>synapsis,</b> genetic recombination usually occurs. Some of the recombination events occur by crossing over (involving physical exchange between two chromatids), but most recombination events involve information exchange but not physical exchange between two chromatids (see Synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA)). Following recombination, chromosome segregation occurs as indicated by the stages metaphase I and anaphase I in the meiosis diagram.|$|E

50|$|A {{knockout}} {{model for}} MAEL, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila’s Maelstrom, {{was created by}} homologous recombination in mice to create Mael null mice. In the knockout mice, meiotic chromosome <b>synapsis</b> is defective. In addition, spermatogenesis fails due to sperm DNA damage caused by the derepression of transposable elements.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>synapsis,</b> {{a type of}} {{recombination}} {{referred to}} as synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) occurs frequently. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired non-sister homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over. Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (see Genetic recombination).|$|E
50|$|Four genes {{involved}} in DNA double-strand break repair and chromosome <b>synapsis</b> (TEX11, TEX15, MLH1 and MLH3) have key roles in genomic integrity, meiotic recombination and gametogenesis. Polymorphisms in these genes were tested for associations with male infertility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms {{in two of}} these genes (TEX11 and MLH3) {{were found to be}} associated with male infertility involving azoospermy or oligospermia.|$|E
5000|$|Ceratiomyxa plasmodia is diploid and {{can often}} be found {{emerging}} from rotting wood and spreading into a thin layer. The plasmodium then fruits to form sporangia: erect pillar or wall-like structures. The sporangia mature in about six hours. Many small stalks emerge from the sporangia to form protospores. Meiosis then begins in the protospores. <b>Synapsis</b> of the chromosomes in prophase is achieved at this stage.|$|E
5000|$|In mice, {{disruption}} of an ortholog of the TEX15 gene caused a drastic reduction in testis size and meiotic arrest in males. [...] TEX15, in mice, {{is required for}} chromosome <b>synapsis,</b> meiotic recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. [...] Furthermore, TEX15 regulates the loading of recombination proteins (RAD51 and DMC1) onto sites of DNA double-strand breaks, and its absence causes a failure of meiotic recombination.|$|E
5000|$|Pairing (<b>synapsis)</b> of the X and Y {{chromosomes}} {{and crossing}} over (recombination) between their pseudoautosomal regions {{appear to be}} necessary for the normal progression of male meiosis. [...] Thus, those cells in which X-Y recombination does not occur will fail to complete meiosis. Structural and/or genetic dissimilarity (due to hybridization or mutation) between the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes can disrupt pairing and recombination, and consequently cause male infertility.|$|E
5000|$|PALB2 mutant male mice {{have reduced}} {{fertility}}. [...] This reduced fertility {{appears to be}} due to germ cell attrition resulting from a combination of unrepaired DNA breaks during meiosis and defective <b>synapsis</b> of the X and Y chromosomes. The function of homologous recombination during meiosis appears to be repair of DNA damages, particularly double-strand breaks (also see Origin and function of meiosis). The PALB2-BRCA1 interaction is likely important for repairing such damages during male meiosis.|$|E
50|$|Current {{and future}} {{research}} {{on the subject of}} homologous chromosome is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both homologous chromosome <b>synapsis</b> as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis. Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} steps which {{catalyze}} {{the movement of}} the transposon, including Tnp binding, <b>synapsis</b> (the creation of a synaptic complex), cleavage, target capture, and strand transfer. Transposase then binds to the DNA strand and creates a clamp over the transposon end of the DNA and inserts into the active site. Once the transposase binds to the transposon, it produces a synaptic complex in which two transposases are bound in a cis/trans relationship with the transposon.|$|E
5000|$|The him-14 gene of {{the worm}} Caenorhabditis elegans encodes an {{ortholog}} of MSH4. [...] Formation of crossovers during C. elegans meiosis requires the him-14(MSH4) gene. Loss of him-14(MSH-4) function severely reduces crossing over, resulting {{in lack of}} chiasmata between homologs and consequent missegregation. Thus, in C. elegans, segregation apparently does depend on crossovers between homologous pairs. Him-14(MSH4) functions during the pachytene stage of meiosis, indicating {{that it is not}} needed for establishing the preceding stages of pairing and <b>synapsis</b> of homologous chromosomes.|$|E
5000|$|A nuclear complex {{containing}} FANCC protein (as well as FANCA, FANCF and FANCG) {{is essential}} for the activation of the FANCD2 protein to the mono-ubiquitinated isoform. [...] In normal, non-mutant, cells FANCD2 is mono-ubiquinated in response to DNA damage. Activated FANCD2 protein co-localizes with BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein) at ionizing radiation-induced foci and in synaptonemal complexes of meiotic chromosomes. Activated FANCD2 protein may function prior to the initiation of meiotic recombination, perhaps to prepare chromosomes for <b>synapsis,</b> or to regulate subsequent recombination events.|$|E
5000|$|In the non-mutant mouse, FANCD2 is {{expressed}} in spermatogonia, pre-leptotene spermatocytes, and in spermatocytes in the leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene stages of meiosis. [...] In synaptonemal complexes of meiotic chromosomes, activated FANCD2 protein co-localizes with BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein). [...] FANCD2 mutant mice exhibit chromosome mis-pairing during the pachytene stage of meiosis and germ cell loss. [...] Activated FANCD2 protein may normally function prior to the initiation of meiotic recombination, perhaps to prepare chromosomes for <b>synapsis,</b> or to regulate subsequent recombination events.|$|E
50|$|RecA's {{association}} with DNA major {{is based on}} its central role in homologous recombination. The RecA protein binds strongly and in long clusters to ssDNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. The protein {{has more than one}} DNA binding site, and thus can hold a single strand and double strand together. This feature makes it possible to catalyze a DNA <b>synapsis</b> reaction between a DNA double helix and a complementary region of single stranded DNA. The RecA-ssDNA filament searches for sequence similarity along the dsDNA.The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances sequence complimentarity recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading). The reaction initiates the exchange of strands between two recombining DNA double helices. After the <b>synapsis</b> event, in the heteroduplex region a process called branch migration begins. In branch migration an unpaired region of one of the single strands displaces a paired region of the other single strand, moving the branch point without changing the total number of base pairs. Spontaneous branch migration can occur, however as it generally proceeds equally in both directions it is unlikely to complete recombination efficiently. The RecA protein catalyzes unidirectional branch migration and by doing so makes it possible to complete recombination, producing a region of heteroduplex DNA that is thousands of base pairs long.|$|E

The {{chromosome}} {{group of}} the presynaptic germ-cells {{is made up of}} two equivalent chromosome-series, and that strong ground exists for the conclusion that one of these is paternal and the other maternal.2. The process of <b>synapsis</b> (pseudo-reduction) consists in the union in pairs of the homologous members (i. e., those that correspond in size) of the two series.3. The first post-synaptic or maturation mitosis is equational and hence results in no chromosomic differentiation.4. The second post-synaptic division is a reducing division, resulting in the separation of the chromosomes which have conjugated in <b>synapsis,</b> and their relegation to different germ-cells.5. The chromosomes retain a morphological individuality throughout the various cell-divisions." [...] W. S. Sutton, The Chromosomes in Heredity 1903 The chromosome theory of inheritance is credited to papers by Walter Sutton in 1902 and 1903, as well as to independent work by Theodor Boveri during roughly the same period. Boveri was studying sea urchins, in which he found that all the chromosomes had to be present for proper embryonic development to take place. Sutton's work with grasshoppers showed that chromosomes occur in matched pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes which separate during meiosis and [...] "may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity".|$|E
