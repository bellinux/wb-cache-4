50|$|With the {{evolution}} of the Ditrysia in the mid-Cretaceous, there was a major reproductive change. The Ditrysia, which comprise 98% of the Lepidoptera, have two separate openings for reproduction in the females (as well as a third opening for excretion), one for mating, and one for laying eggs. The two are linked internally by a <b>seminal</b> <b>duct.</b> (In more basal lineages there is one cloaca, or later, two openings and an external sperm canal.) Of the early lineages of Ditrysia, Gracillarioidea and Gelechioidea are mostly leaf miners, but more recent lineages feed externally. In the Tineoidea, most species feed on plant and animal detritus and fungi, and build shelters in the larval stage.|$|E

50|$|Females have a penis-like structure, {{called the}} gynosome {{that has a}} tube leading into their body to where their {{genitalia}} are located. Neotrogla males have a structure resembling that of a vagina. However, {{on the inside of}} their body, they have male genitalia. When the female inserts her organ into the male, the tip of the pseudo penis inflates. When this tip inflates, species specific ridges and spines flare up that match up with the walls of the male’s <b>seminal</b> <b>duct.</b> This serves two functions, to stimulate the male’s reproductive organs, and to keep the male and female locked together. After they have been locked together, {{the only way to get}} the two to part would be to rip off the abdomen of the male. During the lengthy, 40- to 70-hour copulation process, these male genitalia structures ejaculate inside of the male’s body. The sperm is then deposited into the female’s structure and then travels through a spermathecal duct to where it can fertilize the eggs.|$|E

40|$|Eubrachyurans are {{currently}} {{divided into two}} subsections based on the anatomical position of the <b>seminal</b> <b>duct</b> termini. Heterotremes have the seminal ducts passing through the pereiopod 5 coxae, emerging externally {{in the form of}} “penes ” to contact the basal segments of the gonopods. Thoracotrematous crabs, on the other hand, have the “male openings ” located on sternite 8 and the ejaculatory ducts never pass through the pereiopod 5 coxae. Some brachyurologistsmaintain in the literature that the heterotreme-thoracotreme distinction re ects the extremes of two evolutionary grades. According to this speculation, “advanced ” thoracotrematous crabs probably arose from intermediate goneplacid forms which, in turn, originated out of the Heterotremata in response to selection pressures for improved locomotion. The cladistic hypothesis of De Saint Laurent (1980), in contrast, positions Heterotremata and Thoracotremata as sister groups. Indeed, the heterotreme-thoracotreme difference considered alone does support two discrete types as no truly intermediate <b>seminal</b> <b>duct</b> condition bridges the subsections.

Furthermore, one farmer reported a large reduction in yield with final harvest only equaling the stocking weight.

Histopathological examination revealed very light (1 or 2 cells per section) infections with Cherax giardiavirus and sometimes mild atrophy of hepatopancreatic cells.

40|$|Sperm {{selection}} for {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} (ICSI), based on standard morphology, can fail to select normal cells, and actual methods to evaluate their physiological status do not allow their later use for ICSI. Some authors have demonstrated that sperm selection based on high-magnification morphology {{is associated with a}} better ICSI outcome, above all in subjects with severe testicular failure. In this study there was an evaluation of mitochondrial function, chromatin structure and sperm aneuploidies on whole sperm samples from 30 subjects: 10 normozoospermic controls and 20 patients that were severely oligozoospermic due to testicular damage or partial obstruction of the <b>seminal</b> <b>ducts.</b> All severely oligozoospermic patients showed worse mitochondrial function and chromatin status, while sperm aneuploidies were significantly increased only in those subjects with severe testicular damage (P < 0. 001).

Interestingly, these parameters were further improved when nuclear vacuoles were lacking. These results suggest a strong relationship between high-magnification morphology and the status of spermatozoa, and they may explain the better results of ICSI obtained using spermatozoa selected by high-magnification microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{investigation}} of canine testicular function {{is complicated by}} the difficulty in the evaluation of seminiferous tubules. Until recently, testicular biopsy was the only diagnostic option for dogs with persistent oligo/azoospermia. In human andrology, testicular fine needle aspiration (TFNA) is currently considered a useful method in the evaluation of azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia, and has long replaced classical biopsy to evaluate spermatogenesis. In order to verify its diagnostic efficacy for the clinical approach to canine oligo- or azoospermia, TFNA was performed in seven adult (two oligozoospermic and five azoospermic) dogs. After sedation, a fine (21 - 23 gauge) butterfly needle connected to a 50 -ml syringe was inserted into each testicle; strong suction was applied and the aspirated fluid squirted on a glass slide, smeared out, air-dried and stained with a modified May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Under light microscopy, Sertoli cells (all those found in each investigated field) and spermatogenic cells (n = 100) were counted on each smear in order to differentiate spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, early spermatids, late spermatids and spermatozoa, and calculate their relative percentages.

Results have highlighted a significant prevalence (p < or = 0. 01) of severe duct system obstructive anomalies (type III) in children with cryptorchidism (group B) and in children with vaginal duct patency (group C).
