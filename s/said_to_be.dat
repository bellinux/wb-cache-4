5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons {{than the number of}} protons in nuclei, the object is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E

5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
