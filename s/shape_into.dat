5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design over and over, they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a fount of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then on through the supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, but he managed to change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been shred down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to the ravages of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} an object might already be mathematically determined, {{but it may be}} too complex to use a known formula.

If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers. This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.|$|E

In June 1946, the Naga National Council submitted a four-point memorandum to officials discussing the independence of India from British colonial rule. The memorandum strongly protested against the grouping of Assam with Bengal and asserted that Naga Hills should be constitutionally included in an autonomous Assam, in a free India, with local autonomy, due safeguards and separate electorate for the Naga tribes.|$|E

25|$|Philip Johnson's {{design is}} a cenotaph, or empty tomb, that symbolizes {{the freedom of}} Kennedy’s spirit. The {{memorial}} is a square, roofless room, 30 feet (9m) high and 50 (15m) by 50 feet (15m) wide with two narrow openings facing north and south. The walls consist of 72 white precast concrete columns, most of which seem to float with no visible support two feet above the earth. Eight columns extend to the ground, acting as legs that seem {{to hold up the}} monument. Each column ends in a light fixture. At night, the lights create the illusion that the structure is supported by the light itself. The corners and “doors” of this roofless room are decorated with rows of concrete circles, or medallions, each identical and perfectly aligned. These decorations introduce the circular <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> the square architecture of the Kennedy Memorial.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} site is the stone enclosure reflecting that of the Great Zimbabwe tradition. This enclosure measures 20 meters in diameter with a height of 50 cm, making it much smaller in size than the enclosure of Great Zimbabwe. The stone enclosure was constructed without mortar {{in a similar fashion}} to Great Zimbabwe, further emphasizing its association with this tradition. Construction was undertaken with the use of limestone, differing from other Great Zimbabwe associated sites that used granite. This was due to the higher availability of limestone in the surrounding region which follows the pattern of other periphery sites of the Great Zimbabwe tradition that utilized resources from the surrounding region, rather than importation of granite for the construction of the stone enclosures. Great Zimbabwe stone enclosure construction was affected by the given location of the site with the availability of stone determining the size of the stone enclosure of the particular site. Granite was the most malleable construction material used by the Great Zimbabwe tradition, but as for limestone at Manyikeni, this material was much more difficult to <b>shape</b> <b>into</b> building blocks. As a result, the use of limestone was partly responsible for the much smaller size of the stone enclosure at the site.|$|E
