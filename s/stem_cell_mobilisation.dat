40|$|BACKGROUND: Autologous {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} {{is widely used}} to restore functioning bone marrow in people with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma after myeloablative chemotherapy. Results of some clinical trials indicate that plerixafor in addition to granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) compared to G-CSF only could lead to an increased mobilisation and release of CD 34 -positive cells, facilitating effective apheresis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional plerixafor to G-CSF for haematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> in people with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1990 to September 2015), as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology; American Society of Clinical Oncology; European Hematology Association; American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation; European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation) for studies. Two review authors independently screened search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing plerixafor in addition to G-CSF compared to G-CSF only for <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> in people with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma of all stages and ages. We included full text as well as abstracts and unpublished data if sufficient information on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes was available. We excluded cross-over trials, quasi-randomised trials, and post-hoc retrospective trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened {{the results of the}} search strategies, extracted data, assessed quality, and analysed data according to standard Cochrane methods. We performed final interpretation with an experienced clinician. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four RCTs fitting the inclusion criteria. However, two of these closed prematurely due to low recruitment and did not report results. The remaining two trials evaluated 600 participants with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In both studies the experimental group received G-CSF plus plerixafor and the control group received G-CSF plus placebo. The meta-analysis showed no evidence for differences between plerixafor and placebo group regarding mortality at 12 months (600 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1. 00, 95...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} no standard salvage chemotherapy regimen in relapsed and refractory lymphoma. Gemcitabine {{is a novel}} nucleoside analogue, which acts synergistically with cisplatin both in vitro and in clinical studies. We evaluated the combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin and methylprednisolone (GEM-P) in 41 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The best-achieved response rate (RR) was 79 % (95 % CI 64 – 91), with a complete RR of 21 %. In patients with chemo-resistant disease, the RR was 63 %. Myelosuppression was the main toxicity, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 17. 1, 61. 0 and 53. 7 % respectively. Only one patient had neutropenic sepsis {{and none of the}} patients suffered from haemorrhage.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the value of IRF in guiding <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> harvest and examine the correlation between IRF and PB CD 34 + cells count. Daily pre-harvest tests, i. e.

Existing salvage regimens have response rates of 60 – 85 %, considerable toxicity and frequent treatment delay or dose reduction. We report a gemcitabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone regimen (GemCis) with intensive growth factor and platelet support and no treatment delay. Seventeen patients with relapsed or refractory biopsy proven HL were treated. Toxicity, transfusion requirement, stem cell harvesting and engraftment data were collected. Response assessment was by computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Overall and complete response rates were high (94 % and 65 %, respectively). There were no episodes of febrile neutropenia, treatment delays or hospital admissions. All 15 patients intended for autograft were successfully harvested.

40|$|Collective cell {{migration}} {{is absolutely essential}} {{for a wide variety}} of physiological episodes including the re-epithelialisation component of tissue repair. However, the investigation of such processes has been frustrated by difficulties in quantitatively analysing the behaviours of a large body of cells within a migrating epithelial sheet, which previously required manually tracking a large number of individual cells, or using advanced computational techniques. Here, we describe a novel and simpler image subtraction method with which we can visualise and quantify collective <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> as a ‘white wave’ that propagates back from the leading edge of a scratch-wounded monolayer of cultured epithelial cells. Using this technique, we show that actomyosin constriction negatively regulates <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> and that the advancement of cell sheets and the mobilisation of rows of cells behind their leading edges are independently regulated. We also show that there is a finite limit to the number of rows of cells mobilised after wounding. Moreover, our data suggest that enhancing <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> by release from myosin II contractility, accelerates the healing of large wounds in the long term, thus raising the possibility that the <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> ‘wave’ we reveal here might be a therapeutic target for improving wound healing...|$|R

40|$|The anti-CD 52 (Campath- 1) {{monoclonal}} antibodies (Mabs) have {{a substantial}} history of use for controlling graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Now, with {{the availability of a}} humanised form, alemtuzumab (Campath- 1 H), and the demonstration that this agent can reduce the tumour burden in B-CLL, a new niche may be found - as a potentially curative agent in which its tumour purging ability in vivo combines with its role as a conditioning agent in nonmyeloablative transplantation. Review of the literature shows that alemtuzumab has unique advantages as a method of depleting malignant lymphocytes, including those in patients resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Alemtuzumab can also be used in BMT for depletion of normal T and B lymphocytes of both the recipient and donor for prevention of graft rejection and GVHD. It allows good stem cell recovery with resultant rapid engraftment, has a low risk of EBV-triggered secondary malignancy and does not interfere with blood <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation.</b> As a method of eliminating the malignant clone in B-CLL, alemtuzumab has shown remarkable efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients, a number of whom have progressed to autologous or allogeneic transplantation.

These results indicate that the combination of tumour-depleting and immunosuppressive properties of alemtuzumab should be explored, with the hope of providing improved treatment options for elderly patients with advanced B-CLL or indolent lymphoma whose prognosis is too poor currently to allow treatment with traditional regimens of high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy...|$|E

METHODS: Twenty-four patients with acute on chronic liver failure were randomised to receive standard therapy, standard therapy+granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (5 microg/kg/day for 6 days) and standard therapy+granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (15 microg/kg/day s. c. for 6 days). Data on CD 34 +cell mobilisation were compared to age-matched peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cell donors treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. On day third of treatment, the expression level of CXCR 4, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and very late activation antigen 4 was analysed in mobilised CD 34 + cells. RESULTS: CD 34 cell count increased after the second day of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor injection in both treatment groups compared to the linear increase observed in control. After the fifth day the increase was significantly higher in healthy donors versus patients with acute on chronic liver failure. A decrease in the expression of CXCR 4, very late activation antigen 4 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor compared to premobilisation values was observed. No major side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment is able to induce CD 34 mobilisation in patients with acute on chronic liver failure.

40|$|AMD 3100 is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} antagonist of the CXCR 4 receptor; {{it has been shown}} to block the route of entry of HIV into host T-cells. This compound and its analogues have since been found to act as haematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> agents and, more recently, as anti-cancer agents. Here, we have examined a fluorescent derivative of AMD 3100, L 1, which offered the potential to assess the behaviour of AMD 3100 at the cell surface by using optical imaging modalities. The binuclear ZnII, CuII and NiII complexes of L 1 have also been investigated as these metals have been previously shown to enhance the binding properties of AMD 3100. Furthermore, ZnII and CuII are known to enhance and quench, respectively, the fluorescence of similar anthracenyl-based ligands. Whilst L 1 demonstrates an ability to inhibit the binding of the anti-CXCR 4 monoclonal antibody 12 G 5 (IC 50 = 0. 25 – 0. 9 μM), the incorporation of an anthracenyl moiety resulted in a significantly reduced affinity for CXCR 4 compared to AMD 3100 (IC 50 = 10 nM). We observed no significant increase in fluorescence intensity following incubation with murine pre-B cells overexpressing CXCR 4 compared to a control cell line. This limits the usefulness of L 1 as a fluorescent imaging probe. Interestingly, the ZnII complex, which carries an overall + 4 charge, revealed marginally higher specificity and reduced toxicity in vitro compared to the free ligand, albeit with reduced affinity for CXCR 4 (IC 50 = 1. 8 - 5 μM). We suggest that the incorporation of an anthracenyl group contributes to the lipophilic character of the free ligand, thereby resulting in transport across the plasma membrane. This effect is seemingly diminished when the ligand is complexed to charged metal ions...|$|E
40|$|In healthy individuals, skin {{integrity}} is maintained by epidermal stem cells which self-renew and generate daughter cells that undergo terminal differentiation. Despite accumulation of senescence markers in aged skin, epidermal {{stem cells are}} maintained at normal levels throughout life. Therefore, skin ageing is induced by impaired <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> or reduced number of stem cells {{able to respond to}} proliferative signals. In the skin, existence of several distinct stem cell populations has been reported. Genetic labelling studies detected multipotent stem cells of the hair follicle bulge to support regeneration of hair follicles but not been responsible for maintaining interfollicular epidermis, which exhibits a distinct stem cell population. Hair follicle epithelial stem cells have at least a dual function: hair follicle remodelling in daily life and epidermal regeneration whenever skin {{integrity is}} severely compromised, e. g. after burns. Bulge cells, the first adult stem cells of the hair follicle been identified, are capable of forming hair follicles, interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands. In addition, – at least in murine hair follicles – they can also give rise to non-epithelial cells, indicating a lineage-independent pluripotent character. Multipotent cells (skin-derived precursor cells) are present in human dermis; dermal stem cells represent 0. 3 % among human dermal foreskin fibroblasts. A resident pool of progenitor cells exists within the sebaceous gland, which is able to differentiate into both sebocytes and interfollicular epidermis. The self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation of skin stem cells make these cells attractive for ageing process studies but also for regenerative medicine, tissue repair, gene therapy and cell-based therapy with autologous adult stem cells not only in dermatology. In addition, they provide in vitro models to study epidermal lineage selection and its role in the ageing process...|$|E

AIM: The aim {{of the present study}} was to study the -feasibility and outcome of delivering a regimen including in vivo and in vitro purging and double HDT in patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with advanced multiple myeloma were enrolled in a program of vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone chemotherapy, high dose cyclophosphamide/granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> CD 34 selection of harvested stem cells (in vitro purging), double HDT (cyclophosphamide/epirubicin in the first, busulphan/melphalan in the second) rescued by CD 34 (+) -selected cells, the second rescue using cells harvested following the first HDT (in vivo purging) and interferon maintenance. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent of patients completed the program. Fifty-three per cent of withdrawals were as a result of insufficient stem cells. This correlated to previous chemotherapy. Therapy-related mortality was 6 %. CD 34 (+) selection achieved more than a 2 -log reduction of CD 38 (++) cells; in vivo purging achieved 80 %. Although similar numbers of CD 34 (+) cells were reinfused at both HDT, platelet recovery was slower after the second HDT. Additional complete remissions were achieved after each phase of therapy, 3 % at the end of vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone and 33 % after completing planned HDT. Factors associated with longer overall survival included age less than 60 years (P = 0. 044), serum beta- 2 -microglobulin below 3 micro gamma/L at entry (P = 0. 042) and less than 2 months between the two HDT (P = 0. 024). The only factor associated with a longer event-free survival was less than 2 months between HDT on study (P = 0. 038). CONCLUSIONS: (i) dose intensification with two HDT delivered within 2 months might be associated with a better patient outcome, (ii) early mobilisation should be incorporated in multiple myeloma HDT programs and (iii) higher CD 34 (+) doses may be required for tandem transplants...|$|E

Since then three more transplant centres have been established: Prince of Wales Hospital (1991) mainly in paediatric transplant, Queen Elizabeth Hospital (1995) and Tuen Mun Hospital (2006) in adult autologous transplant. Up {{to the end of}} 2008, a little over 2000 transplants have been performed in Hong Kong, and QMH takes up about 85 % {{of the total number of}} cases. A unified HSCT registry in Hong Kong is desirable and is yet to be established. At QMH, by the end of 2008, a total of 1708 transplant procedures have been performed with 83 % (1417) being first-time transplants and the rest (291, 17 %) are repeat transplants mostly for relapsed patients. The numbers of male and female patients are 955 and 753, respectively. The median age is 35. 4 years (range, 3 months to 67 years) with 85. 8 % of the transplants performed in adults (> 18 years). The type of donor includes 34 % autologous, 1 % syngeneic, 38 % related allogeneic and 27 % unrelated allogeneic.

Behandlingen delas upp i fem faser: induktionsbehandling, stamcellsmobilisering, stamcellsskörd, konditionering med högdoscytostatika och stamcellsåtergivning/transplantation. Initialt behandlades alla patienter som genomgick autolog stamcellstransplantation inom slutenvården under den sista behandlingsfasen, det vill säga i samband med konditionering och stamcellsåtergivning.

The treatment consists of five stages: induction treatment, <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> stem cell harvest, conditioning with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue (transplantation). Historically all patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation received treatment as inpatients but this practice has since the 1990 ies, due to for instance financial reasons, gradually shifted into an outpatient {{approach to this}} line of care. Thus, for the patient the outpatient approach entails myeloablative conditioning and stem cell transplantation as inpatient followed by post transplant care as outpatient part of the home clinic’s outpatient program. Outpatient care following autologous stem cell transplantation {{has proven to be}} a safe, highly appreciated and cost effective method of care without any adverse effects on behalf of the patients with regards to clinical outcome, mortality and/or comorbidity. Objectives The aim of this study is to ascertain whether or not there is a difference in degree of chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting between an outpatient population and an inpatient population following autologous stem cell transplantation. Methods A total of 91 patients, 33 of whom were included in an outpatient program while remaining 58 were treated as regular inpatients, participated in the study. Patients each day filled out a diary with regards to nausea and emesis during the entire treatment phase. Submitted data was then analysed concerning parameters related to chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting. Results The result shows that the outpatient population suffers less in general than the inpatient population in terms of chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting. Conclusion To conclude, this study suggests a positive correlation between outpatient care following autologous stem cell transplantation and a lower incidence of chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and vomiting. ...|$|E
40|$|CML is {{characterized}} by the presence of the oncogenic t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome that generates the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Imatinib is a 2 -phenylpyrimidine derivative that induces a complete cytogenetic response in 87 % of patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive CML by competitively blocking the ATP binding cleft of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. The notably high rate of complete cytogenetic responses has influenced the prognosis and management of CML patients. However, resistance to imatinib can cause relapse. The aim of this project was to reevaluate the place of autologous SCT in the imatinib era. To assess the possibility of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> <b>mobilisation</b> (SCM) during imatinib therapy G-CSF-induced SCM and subsequent leukapheresis were performed in 18 CML patients in CCR. During imatinib therapy and SCM peripheral blood, bone marrow and apheresis products were analysed by nested and quantitative RT-PCR and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A total of 18 patients were investigated, 15 patients in chronic phase and three patients in accelerated phase. The male to female ratio was 10 : 8. The mean duration of CML before SCM was 40. 6 months (range: 8 - 91 months) and the mean duration of imatinib therapy was 16. 2 months (range: 6 - 27 months). In all patients a complete cytogenetic response was confirmed twice in consecutive cytogenetic analyses. Subsequently all patients were stimulated with 10 µg/kg BW G-CSF and continued imatinib therapy (400 mg imatinib daily in chronic phase patients and 600 mg imatinib daily in accelerated phase patients). A successful separation of ≥ 2. 0 x 10 ^ 6 /kg BW CD 34 + cells could be achieved in 12 patients (67 %) with a mean yield of 3. 2 x 10 ^ 6 /kg BW CD 34 + cells (range: 2. 0 - 4. 9 x 10 ^ 6 /kg BW). The mean yield of CD 34 + cells after a median of five days of G-CSF administration was 2. 8 x 10 ^ 6 /kg BW (range: 0. 7 - 4. 9 x 10 ^ 6 /kg BW). Apheresis generated insufficient amounts in four patients with a harvest of < 2. 0 x 10 ^ 6 CD 34 + cells/kg BW. The circulating CD 34 + cells were < 5 /µl in two patients indicating unsuccessful mobilisation. 21 stem cell products from 14 patients were analysed by quantitative and qualitative PCR. All harvests were BCR-ABL-negative in quantitative RT-PCR. After first round qualitative RT-PCR, all but one stem cell products, were also BCR-ABL-negative. In contrast, the nested PCR was BCR-ABL-negative in 12 of 21 assays (57 %). BCR-ABL-negative CD 34 + cells could be generated in seven patients. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicating that differences in the mean peripheral blood and bone marrow BCR-ABL load prior to SCM compared to the mean value 1 - 2 months after SCM were not significant. The results of qualitative PCR prior to SCM and 1 - 2 months after SCM were unchanged. An increase of BCR-ABL transcripts after SCM was detected in two patients, while a decrease was detected in another two patients by negative nested PCR. This dissertation demonstrated the safety and efficacy of autologous stem cell apheresis under imatinib therapy in CML patients in CCR. Successful apheresis could be generated in 12 patients. Even seven BCR-ABL-negative stem cell products could be obtained suggesting that in vivo purging was successful. The incidence of relapse caused by resistance requires further studies to optimise the therapy of CML. Autologous stem cell apheresis and transplantation could be an alternative temporary therapeutic option at relapse...|$|E
