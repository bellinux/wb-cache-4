5000|$|Michael Moriarty, Deputy Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department, {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of state regulatory efforts to have U.S. regulators encourage the development of insurance securitizations through cat bonds in the United States instead of off-shore, through encouraging two different methods—protected cells and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>reinsurance</b> <b>vehicles.</b> [...] In August 2007 Michael Lewis, the author of Liar's Poker and Moneyball, wrote an article about catastrophe bonds that appeared in The New York Times Magazine, entitled [...] "In Nature's Casino." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Because of population growth, resulting real estate development, and using real estate values in hazard-prone areas, the nation is increasingly exposed to much higher property-casualty losses [...] both insured and uninsured [...] from natural catastrophes than in the past. In the 1990 s, a series of natural disasters, (1) {{raised questions about the}} adequacy of the insurance industry's financial capacity to cover large catastrophes without limiting coverage or substantially raising premiums and (2) called attention to ways of raising additional sources of capital to help cover catastrophic risk. Catastrophe risk includes exposure to losses from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes, which are infrequent events that can cause substantial financial loss but are difficult to reliably predict. The characteristics of natural disasters prompt most insurers to limit the amount and type of catastrophic risk they hold. Risk-linked securities {{that can be used to}} cover risk from natural catastrophes employ many structures and include catastrophic bonds and catastrophic options. GAO identified and analyzed several issues that might affect the use of risk-linked securities. First, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and insurance industry representatives are considering revisions in the regulatory accounting treatment of risk transfer obtained from nonindemnity-based coverage that would allow credit to the insurer similar to that now afforded additional reinsurance. Such a revision has the potential to facilitate the use of risk-linked securities. Second, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is proposing a new U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles interpretation, which would increase independent capital investment requirements that allow the sponsor to treat <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>reinsurance</b> <b>vehicles</b> (SPRV) and similar entities as independent entities and report SPRV assets and liabilities separately. Third, "pass-through" tax treatment [...] which eliminates taxation at the SPRV level [...] with favorable implementing requirements could facilitate expanded use of catastrophe bonds. Finally, catastrophe bonds, most of which are noninvestment-grade instruments, have not been sold to a wide range of investors beyond institutional investors. ...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{catastrophe}} {{bonds are}} issued by <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>reinsurance</b> companies domiciled in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, or Ireland. These companies typically participate {{in one or}} more reinsurance treaties to protect buyers, most commonly insurers (called [...] "cedants") or reinsurers (called [...] "retrocedents"). This contract may be structured as a derivative in cases in which it is [...] "triggered" [...] by one or more indices or event parameters (see below), rather than losses of the cedant or retrocedent.|$|R
5000|$|Another area of covergence is the {{emergence}} of pure insurance risk hedge funds, that function economically like fully collaterallized reinsurers and sometimes operate through <b>reinsurance</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but take the form of hedge funds.|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how state governments in the sixteen southern states employ <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities for financial management, their characteristics, and how they fit into state debt management. The study analyzes the characteristics of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities: the formal differences between subsets of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities and their functions and uses. The findings indicate that the formal differences between subsets of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities support the theoretical concept that public authorities, government corporations, and special districts underlie the conceptual entity {{commonly referred to as}} a <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entity. The analysis supports the findings that the formal differences between public authorities, government corporations, and special authorities include the ability to control the amount of information reported to the state government, the financial aspects that each entity possesses, and the ability to issue debt in the market place. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> {{entities}} {{were used}} {{for more than just}} circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|R

5000|$|Following Russia's 2011 police reform, Russian OMON {{units were}} to be renamed Distinctive Purpose Teams (KON), while OMSN (SOBR) would become <b>Special</b> <b>Purpose</b> Teams (KSN).

40|$|In {{addition}} to the ordinary corporate income tax, <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> taxes are sometimes levied to extract abnormal profits arising {{from the use of}} natural resources. Such dual tax regimes exist in Norway for oil and hydropower, where the corresponding <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax bases are unaffected by any derivatives payments. Dual tax firms with hedging programs therefore face the risk of potentially large discrepancies between the tax bases for corporate income tax and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax. I investigate how this tax base asymmetry influences the extent of hedging of value-maximizing firms facing hedgeable as well as unhedgeable risk. Dual tax firms facing deadweight costs in low-profit events generally demand less hedging than ordinary firms, but otherwise respond similarly to characteristics of the underlying risk exposures. The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax does not influence firms' hedge portfolios in the absence of deadweight cost.
