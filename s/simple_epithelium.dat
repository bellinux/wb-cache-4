2500|$|Trichoplax is a small, flattened, animal around [...] across. Like an Amoeba, {{it has no}} regular outline, {{although}} the lower surface is somewhat concave, and the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> enclosing a loose sheet of stellate cells resembling the mesenchyme of some more complex animals. The epithelial cells bear cillia, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor.|$|E

In humans, a <b>simple</b> columnar <b>epithelium</b> lines most {{organs of}} {{the digestive tract}} including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.

50|$|Club {{cells are}} found in the ciliated <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium.</b> These cells may secrete glycosaminoglycans to protect the {{bronchiole}} lining. Bronchiolar cells gradually increase in number as the number of goblet cells decrease.|$|E
50|$|In general, simple {{epithelial}} tissues {{are classified}} by {{the shape of}} their cells. The four major classes of <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> are: (1) simple squamous; (2) simple cuboidal; (3) simple columnar; (4) pseudostratified.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ascending}} limb of loop of Henle {{is divided}} into 2 segments: Lower end of ascending limb is very thin and is lined by <b>simple</b> squamous <b>epithelium.</b> The distal portion of ascending limb is thick and is lined by <b>simple</b> cuboidal <b>epithelium.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bowman's capsule has {{an outer}} parietal layer {{composed}} of <b>simple</b> squamous <b>epithelium.</b> The visceral layer, composed of modified <b>simple</b> squamous <b>epithelium,</b> is lined by podocytes. Podocytes have foot processes, pedicels, that wrap around glomerular capillaries. These pedicels interdigitate with pedicels of adjacent podocytes forming filtration slits.|$|R

50|$|Serous cystadenomas are {{diagnosed}} by histomorphologic examination, by pathologists. Grossly, they are, usually, unilocular cysts that contain clear, straw-coloured fluid. Microscopically, the cyst lining {{consists of a}} <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> with cilia that may be columnar or flat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> is {{a single}} layer of cells with every cell {{in direct contact with}} the {{basement}} membrane that separates it from the underlying connective tissue. In general, it is found where absorption and filtration occur. The thinness of the epithelial barrier facilitates these processes.|$|E
50|$|The pharynx is {{surrounded}} by an atrium, through which water is expelled through a second, usually smaller, siphon. Cords of connective tissue cross the atrium to maintain the general shape of the body. The outer body wall consists of connective tissue, muscle fibres, and a <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> directly underlying the tunic.|$|E

50|$|Stratified {{epithelium}} {{differs from}} <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> {{in that it}} is multilayered. It is therefore found where body linings have to withstand mechanical or chemical insult such that layers can be abraded and lost without exposing subepithelial layers. Cells flatten as the layers become more apical, though in their most basal layers the cells can be squamous, cuboidal or columnar.|$|E
50|$|Lancelets have no {{respiratory}} system, breathing solely {{through their}} skin, {{which consists of}} a <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Despite the name, little if any respiration occurs in the gill slits, which are solely devoted to feeding. The circulatory system does resemble that of primitive fish in its general layout, but is much simpler, and does not include a heart. There are no blood cells, and no haemoglobin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} shapes of epithelial cell: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. These {{can be arranged}} {{in a single layer}} of cells as <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium,</b> either squamous, columnar, cuboidal, pseudo-stratified columnar or in layers of two or more cells deep as stratified (layered), either squamous, columnar or cuboidal. All glands are made up of epithelial cells. Functions of epithelial cells include secretion, selective absorption, protection, transcellular transport, and sensing.|$|E

50|$|Trichoplax is a small, flattened, animal around 1 mm across. Like an Amoeba, {{it has no}} regular outline, {{although}} the lower surface is somewhat concave, and the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> enclosing a loose sheet of stellate cells resembling the mesenchyme of some more complex animals. The epithelial cells bear flagella, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor.|$|E
50|$|The {{epidermis}} of land planarians {{is composed}} by a <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> of cubic or columnar cells. The cells are ciliated {{only on a}} ventral region, called creeping sole, which the animal uses to glide over surfaces. Numerous secretory cells open throughout the epidermis, the most characteristic ones being the rhabditogen cells, which produce a secretion {{in the form of}} small rod-like structures, the rhabdites. Rhabditogen cells are very numerous on the dorsal epidermis, but rare on the ventral side.|$|E
50|$|By layer, {{epithelium}} is classed {{as either}} <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium,</b> only one cell thick (unilayered) or stratified epithelium as stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium that are {{two or more}} cells thick (multi-layered), and both types of layering {{can be made up}} of any of the cell shapes. However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as pseudostratified columnar epithelium.|$|E

50|$|The term pseudostratified {{is derived}} from the {{appearance}} of this epithelium in section which conveys the erroneous (pseudo means almost or approaching) impression that {{there is more than one}} layer of cells, when in fact this is a true <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> since all the cells rest on the basal lamina. The nucleous of these cells, however, are disposed at different levels, thus creating the illusion of cellular stratification. Not all ciliated cells extend to the luminal surface; such cells are capable of cell division providing replacements for cells lost or damaged.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the spectrum of cytokeratin 1 - 20 expression in healthy cornea, limbus and conjunctiva. The next aim {{was to determine whether}} the expression of cytokeratin 7 can be a marker of limbal stem cell deficiency. Materials and methods: The spectrum of cytokeratins was studied using immunofluorescent staining of cryosections from healthy cornea, limbus and conjunctiva. The expression of cytokeratin 7 was detected by immunofluorescent staining on Millicell membranes. The epithelium of healthy cornea and conjunctiva and the epithelium of the cornea and conjunctiva of patients suffering from limbal stem cell deficiency were assessed. Results: The typical corneal cytokeratin 3 / 12 was present in the corneal epithelium. Cytokeratins characteristic of <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> (cytokeratins 8, 18, 19), stratified epithelium (cytokeratins 4, 5, 13, 14) and hyperproliferation (cytokeratin 16) were also present in the human cornea. The limbal epithelium was positive for cytokeratins characteristic of <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> (cytokeratins 8, 18, 19), stratified epithelium (cytokeratins 4, 5, 13, 14, 15) and the cornea-specific cytokeratin 3 / 12.

40|$|The tonofilament-associated protein antigens {{recognized}} in epithelial cells {{by a group}} of six monoclonal antibodies have been studied by immunofluorescence and gel immunoautoradiography. The monoclonal antibodies were generated against detergent insoluble cytoskeleton extracts from a cultured <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> derived cell line, Ptk 1 cells. They show various tissue specificities, and while they all recognize components {{at the low end of}} the molecular weight range for intermediate filament proteins, they confirm that single antibody species can react with multiple polypeptides of different molecular weights in the tonofilament complex. The monoclonal antibodies described here demonstrate the presence of a <b>simple</b> <b>epithelium</b> antigenic determinant associated with intermediate filaments that is not detectable in the specialized cells of squamous and keratinizing epithelia but can reappear in such cells after transformation...|$|E
