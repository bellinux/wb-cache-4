40|$|This study disentangles the prefrontal network {{underlying}} executive functions {{involved in}} the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). During the WCST, subjects have to perform two key processes: first, they have to derive the correct <b>sorting</b> <b>rule</b> for each trial by trial-and-error, and, second, they have to detect when this <b>sorting</b> <b>rule</b> is changed by the investigator. Both cognitive processes constitute key components of the executive system, which is subserved by the prefrontal cortex. For the current fMRI experiment, we developed a non-verbal variant of the WCST. Subjects were instructed either to respond according to a given <b>sorting</b> <b>rule</b> or to detect the correct <b>sorting</b> <b>rule,</b> like in the original version of the WCST. Data were obtained from 14 healthy male volunteers and analysed using SPM and a random effects model. All conditions activated a fronto-parietal network, which was generally more active when subjects had {{to search for the}} correct <b>sorting</b> <b>rule</b> than when the rule was announced beforehand. Significant differences between these two conditions were seen in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the parietal lobe. In addition, the data provided new evidence for the assumption of differentiated roles of the left and right prefrontal cortex. Although the right PFC showed a general involvement in response selection and the execution of goal directed responses, based on given rules, the left PFC was only activated when inductive reasoning and feedback integration was required...|$|R

To address {{inadequacy}} of association rules interestingness measure method currently, {{we present a}} novel method to measure interestingness with relatedness among items in frequent itemsets. It firstly computed relatedness between frequent k-itemsets and each subset of frequent 2 -itemsets, which is a linear combination of Complementarity Intensity (CI), Substitutability Intensity (SI) and Mutual Interaction (MI). The mean of relatedness of all frequent 2 -itemsets subsets was regarded as relatedness of frequent k-itemsets. Finally weighted computation method of association rule interestingness was given according to principle of objective interestingness of association rule is inversely proportional to relatedness of frequent itemsets.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the approximation quality for <b>sorting</b> <b>rules,</b> {{which is based}} on Rough Set Data Analysis. Several types of rules are discussed: The "nominal nominal " case (NN) (the classical Rough Set approach), "nominal ordinal" (NO) rules, and "ordinal ordinal" (OO) rules, and its generalisation to "(nominal, ordinal) ordinal" rules (NO-O). We provide a significance test for the overall approximation quality, and a test for partial influence of attributes based on the bootstrap technology. For the bivariate case, the relationship of [...] statistics and the proposed approximation quality measure is discussed. It can be shown that in this case a simple linear transformation of the Kendall tau correlation forms an upper bound for the approximation quality of <b>sorting</b> <b>rules.</b> A competing model is also studied. Whereas this method is a promising tool in case of searching for global consistency, we demonstrate that in case of local perturbations in the data set the method may offer questionable results, and that it is dissociated from the theory it claims to support.

40|$|A new {{associative}} classification algorithm {{based on}} weighted voting (ACWV) is presented. ACWV {{takes advantage of}} two methods: the optimal rule method preferring high-quality rules and the voting method considering {{the majority of the}} rules. Moreover, the method takes into account both the length and convictions of rules to calculate their weights. First, ACWV builds a class-count FP-tree (called CCFP-tree) from the given historical data. After that, the weighted voting result for a new instance can be obtained from the CCFP-tree directly without storing, retrieving and <b>sorting</b> <b>rules</b> explicitly. The label of the class with maximal sum of weighted votes is then that of the new instance.

We administered a common executive function task, the Dimensional Change Card Sort, which requires children to sort picture cards by one dimension (e. g., color) and then switch to sort the same cards by a conflicting dimension (e. g., shape). After a week or after a month delay, we administered the second rule again.

40|$|Various {{applications}} of information theoretical and combinatorial methods in data mining are presented. An axiomatization {{has been introduced}} {{for a family of}} entropies including both Shannon entropy and the Gini index as special cases. These entropies, and distances based on them, were then applied to decision tree construction. It has been shown experimentally that trees using distances based on generalized entropies as splitting criteria are smaller than those constructed using other criteria without significant loss in accuracy. One of the major problems in association rule mining is the huge number of rules produced. This work contains contributions to two principal methods of addressing the problem: <b>sorting</b> <b>rules</b> based on some interestingness measure, and rule pruning.

Heart rate indexes can provide critical information about how individuals monitor feedback cues indicating that performance should be adjusted. In this study, children of three age groups (8 – 10, 12 – 14, and 16 – 18 years) performed a rule change task in which <b>sorting</b> <b>rules</b> needed to be detected following positive or negative feedback. The number of perseverative errors was lower for 16 - to 18 -year-olds than for 8 - to 10 -year-olds, and 12 - to 14 -year-olds performed at an intermediate level. Consistent with previous Wndings, heart rate slowed following feedback indicating a rule change, and the magnitude of slowing was similar for all age groups. Thus, 8 - to 10 -year-olds are already able to analyze feedback cues. In contrast, 12 - to 14 -year-olds and 16 - to 18 -year-olds, but not 8 - to 10 -year-olds, showed heart rate slowing following performance errors, suggesting that with age children are increasingly able to monitor their performance online.

CFSR-RFP was also routed to the outer membrane, but CFNSR-RFP was located in the inner membrane, consistent with previous data showing that this sequence functions as an inner membrane retention signal.

Ex-post, there are around 0 - 5 % of top performing UK and US equity mutual funds with truly positive-alpha performance (after fees) and around 20 % of funds that have truly poor alpha performance, with about 75 % of active funds which are effectively zero-alpha funds. Key drivers of relative performance are, load fees, expenses and turnover. There is little evidence of successful market timing. Evidence suggests past winner funds persist, when rebalancing is frequent (i. e., less than one year) and when using sophisticated <b>sorting</b> <b>rules</b> (e. g., Bayesian approaches) - but transactions costs (load and advisory fees) imply that economic gains to investors from winner funds may be marginal. The US evidence clearly supports the view that past loser funds remain losers. Broadly speaking results for bond mutual funds are similar to those for equity funds. Sensible advice for most investors would be to hold low cost index funds and avoid holding past ‘active’ loser funds. Only sophisticated investors should pursue an active ex-ante investment strategy of trying to pick winners - and then with much caution...|$|E
