If the exhibition continued, the gallery would be risking prosecution. This was on the evidence of the eyewitness reports of the undercover council officer who paid five pounds to watch the act through a <b>spy</b> <b>hole,</b> and was reported by The Scotsman as saying 'she's still wearing the G-string but he's got all his kit off and they're definitely at it.' ...|$|E

50|$|After being unceremoniously {{fired by}} California Fidelity Insurance {{at the end}} of H is for Homicide, Kinsey has found herself new office space with her attorney, Lonnie Kingman, at the {{beginning}} of I is for Innocent. Lonnie has a case he wants Kinsey's help with - 6 years ago, David Barney was acquitted of killing his estranged wife, talented but insecure society house-designer Isabelle Barney, by shooting her dead through the <b>spy</b> <b>hole</b> of her front door. David's desperation to rebuild the marriage after the split netted him an injunction for harassment, so he was the obvious suspect, particularly since he inherited Isabelle's multimillion-dollar business, but the prosecution couldn't make it stick. Now Isabelle's previous husband, Kenneth Voigt, is trying again in the civil courts, in an attempt to secure the fortune for his and Isabelle's daughter Shelby, and Lonnie needs some evidence. The previous PI on the case, Morley Shine, has just died of a heart attack, and Lonnie asks Kinsey to step in.|$|E

These holes were created when knots in the wood popped out. Naturally gangs of kids gathered around the knotholes.|$|R

As the main theme of the festival was âgangster moviesâ, Cox&Grusenmeyer decided to make a playful variation on a detective newspaper by punching several <b>spy</b> <b>holes</b> in the newspaper.

50|$|The {{building}} {{consisted of}} three wings enclosing an inner courtyard, flanked in the corners by round towers. Only the east and south parts remain, the agricultural buildings attached to the ancient walls reproducing the earlier layout. Of the towers, all that remain are that in the south-east and traces of the south-west. The pigeon loft {{was built on the}} base of a tower. A demolished wall near the chapel reveals the former gatehouse which led into the courtyard. The chapel still has sculptures and two mullioned windows decorated with mouldings.

5000|$|While {{the women}} of Armagh prison had been {{operating}} under a [...] "no work" [...] protest {{for quite a while}} to no avail, the events of 7 February 1980 served as a catalyst which would escalate their protest into a [...] "dirty" [...] one, mirroring the actions of their male counterparts in Long Kesh. After weeks of being served poor food, the women were told that their lunch on this afternoon would be chicken and apple pie. As they arrived to being eating, the warden informed them that their cells were to be searched during their meal; this warning which was generally ignored due to the astonishingly good food they were being served, and the searches went on unimpeded. During the meal, however, an increased number of guards, some rumoured to have been brought over from Long Kesh for extra reinforcement, entered the room, causing panic and an uprising among the women. This panic led to a prisoners' rebellion, during which the women were locked into two mass cells as their own cells were torn apart looking for clothing which could be identified as military-like uniforms. After the search was completed, the women were returned to their cells but were also informed that they were to be [...] "Adjudicated" [...] for their roles in the riot; they were subsequently beaten by guards in riot gear and confined to their cells for 24 hours, during which time they were denied access to the bathroom and given little food to eat. Over the course of their confinement, their chamber pots began to fill, forcing the women to dump the urine out of <b>spy</b> <b>holes</b> in their doors (these were subsequently nailed shut) and to throw the excrement out their windows (which were then boarded up). By 12 February 1980, it was official: Armagh Dirty Protest had begun.|$|R
