5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E

5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, {{as he took}} on the <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E
5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known T. rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

Vi ville identifiera vad samvetsstress kan vara för yrkesgruppen socialarbetare vars arbetsuppgift innefattar myndighetsutövning och vad i arbetet som orsakar samvetsstress. Sex stycken kvalitativa intervjuer genomfördes med socialarbetare vars yrke innefattar myndighetsutövning. Resultatet visar att samtliga intervjupersoner upplever samvetsstress när de beskriver sig ha svårt att hantera sitt dåliga samvete och att detta leder till negativa psykiska och fysiska stressymptom. Intervjupersonerna beskriver dock upplevelsen av samvetsstress i olika grad vilka kategoriserades: ständig närvaro av samvetsstress, närvaro av samvetsstress i vissa situationer samt medveten bortträngning av samvetsstress. Resultatet visar vidare att samvetsstress kan skapas av de krav och förväntningar som organisationen, brukare och anhöriga samt socialarbetaren själv har om de upplevs som övermäktiga och motstridiga. Vår studie indikerar på ett behov av vidare forskning om samvetsstress hos socialarbetare.

We conducted six qualitative interviews with social workers whose profession includes exercise of public authority.

The interviewees described, however, the experience <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> conscience in various degrees which were categorized: constant presence <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> conscience, presence <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> conscience in specific situations, and conscious suppression <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> conscious. The result further shows that <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> conscious can be created by the demands and expectations that the organisation, clients and their relatives, as well as the social workers have, if they are experienced as overwhelming and conflicting.
