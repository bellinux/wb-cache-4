25|$|Fischer–Tropsch plants {{associated}} with coal or related solid feedstocks (sources of carbon) must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants, i.e., CO, H2, and alkanes. This conversion is called gasification {{and the product}} is called <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> ("syngas"). <b>Synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> obtained from coal gasification tends to have a H2:CO ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2. This ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction. Coal-based Fischer–Tropsch plants produce varying amounts of CO2, depending upon the energy source of the gasification process. However, most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the Fischer–Tropsch process.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} synthesis-gas {{compositions}} can be used. For cobalt-based catalysts the optimal H2:CO ratio is around 1.8–2.1. Iron-based catalysts can tolerate lower ratios, due to intrinsic Water Gas Shift Reaction {{activity of the}} Iron catalyst. This reactivity can be important for <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> derived from coal or biomass, which tend to have relatively low H2:CO ratios (<nbsp&1).|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion capture – This {{involves}} gasification of a feedstock (such as coal) to form <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas,</b> {{which may}} be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered, This technology is usually associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle process configurations.|$|E
25|$|Heat removal {{is done by}} {{internal}} cooling coils. The <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> is bubbled through the waxy products and finely-divided catalyst which is suspended in the liquid medium. This also provides agitation {{of the contents of}} the reactor. The catalyst particle size reduces diffusional heat and mass transfer limitations. A lower temperature in the reactor leads to a more viscous product and a higher temperature (>nbsp&570nbsp&K) gives an undesirable product spectrum. Also, separation of the product from the catalyst is a problem.|$|E
40|$|Fossil fuels such as {{petroleum}} {{and coal}} will be exhaustible energy {{resources in the}} near future. From {{the point of view}} of the depletion of fossil resources, the development of renewable resources is required for a future sustainable society. Therefore, in recent years, renewable biomass, which is ubiquitous throughout the world, has attracted attention. Many studies on the application of waste woody biomass have been focused on non-edible biomass. Pyrolysis and gasification technologies have been known as the effective energy conversion technologies of biomass because of the various gases production such as <b>synthesis</b> fuel <b>gases</b> and chemical basic compounds. In the pyrolysis process, gases, condensable hydrocarbons so-called “tar ” and solid carbon contents namely “char ” will be produced. During the subsequent gasification process, char will usually react with the gasifying agents at a high temperature of above 900 °C to produce the <b>synthesis</b> <b>gases.</b> However, there are many problems caused from generated tar during the pyrolysis process such as clogging of the pipin...|$|R

25|$|Gasification is {{a process}} that {{converts}} organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (>700°C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas)</b> or producer gas and is itself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the resultant gas {{is considered to be a}} source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{carbamate}} {{solutions are}} notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel—especially in the hottest {{parts of the}} plant such as the stripper. Traditionally corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuously injecting {{a small amount of}} oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas,</b> it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.|$|E
25|$|Combined cycle {{plants are}} usually powered by natural gas, {{although}} fuel oil, <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> or other fuels can be used.

Integrated solar combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look ISCC section). Next generation nuclear power plants {{are also on the}} drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.|$|E

25|$|Cobalt-based {{catalysts}} {{are highly}} active, although iron {{may be more}} suitable for certain applications. Cobalt catalysts are more active for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass. <b>Synthesis</b> <b>gases</b> derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water–gas shift reaction. Unlike the other metals used for this process (Co, Ni, Ru), which remain in the metallic state during synthesis, iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases, including various oxides and carbides during the reaction. Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles.|$|R
25|$|Metal dusting is {{a catastrophic}} form of {{corrosion}} {{that occurs when}} susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities, such as <b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> and other high-CO environments. The corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder. The suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer {{on the surface of}} the metal, usually from carbon monoxide (CO) in the vapor phase. This graphite layer is then thought to form metastable M3C species (where M is the metal), which migrate away from the metal surface. However, in some regimes no M3C species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of gasification is that using the syngas (<b>synthesis</b> <b>gas</b> H2/CO) is potentially {{more efficient than}} direct combustion of the original fuel {{because it can be}} combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as biodegradable waste. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.|$|E

40|$|Kiln burners for {{industrial}} tile production are usually fuelled by methane gas. However, the interest towards {{the use of}} coal or <b>synthesis</b> <b>gases</b> is rapidly increasing, mainly due {{to the opening of}} important markets in developing countries. The widely variable chemical composition of these fuels demands the gas burner to be adapted on case-by-case basis, since the firing parameters are strictly fixed, to guarantee the required temperature distribution within the kiln.
