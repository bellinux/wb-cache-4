2500|$|Polymerization {{is likely}} to take place through either ionic and/or radical {{processes}} which are initiated by plasma formed from the glow discharge. The classic view presented by Yasuda [...] based upon thermal initiation of parylene polymerization [...] is that there are many propagating species present at any given time as shown in Figure 3. This figure shows two different pathways by which the polymerization may take place. The first pathway is a monofunctionalization process, bears resemblance to a standard free radical polymerization mechanism (M•)- although with the caveat that the reactive species may be ionic and not necessarily radical. The second pathway refers to a difunctional mechanism, which by example may contain a cationic and a radical propagating center on the same monomer (•M•). A consequence is that 'polymer' can grow in multiple directions by multiple pathways off one species, such as a surface or other monomer. This possibility let Yasuda to term the mechanism as a very rapid <b>step-growth</b> polymerization. In the diagram, Mx refers to the original monomer molecule or any of many dissociation products such as chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen. The M• species refers to those that are activated and capable of participating in reactions to form new covalent bonds. The •M• species refers to an activated difunctional monomer species. The subscripts i, j, and k show the sizes of the different species involved. Even though radicals represent the activated species, any ion or radical could be used in the polymerization. As can be seen here, plasma polymerization is a very complex process, with many parameters effecting everything from rate to chain length.|$|E

50|$|<b>Step-growth</b> {{polymers}} {{are defined}} as polymers formed by the stepwise reaction between functional groups of monomers, usually containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. Most <b>step-growth</b> polymers are also classified as condensation polymers, but not all <b>step-growth</b> polymers (like polyurethanes formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) release condensates; in this case, we talk about addition polymers. <b>Step-growth</b> polymers increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high conversion (i.e., >95%).|$|E

50|$|Most natural {{polymers}} {{being employed}} at {{early stage of}} human society are of condensation type. The synthesis of first truly synthetic polymeric material, Bakelite, was announced by Leo Baekeland in 1907, through a typical <b>step-growth</b> polymerization fashion of phenol and formaldehyde. The pioneer of synthetic polymer science, Wallace H. Carothers, developed a new means of making polyesters through <b>step-growth</b> polymerization in 1930s as a research group leader at DuPont. It was the first reaction designed and carried out with the specific purpose of creating high molecular weight polymer molecules, {{as well as the}} first polymerization reaction whose results had been predicted beforehand by scientific theory. Carothers developed a series of mathematic equations to describe the behavior of <b>step-growth</b> polymerization systems which are still known as the Carothers equations today. Collaborating with Paul J. Flory, who is a physical chemist, they developed theories that describe more mathematical aspects of <b>step-growth</b> polymerization including kinetics, stoichiometry, and molecular weight distribution etc. Carothers is also well known for his invention of Nylon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Step-growth</b> {{polymerization}} {{refers to}} a type of polymerization mechanism in which bi-functional or multifunctional monomers react to form first dimers, then trimers, longer oligomers and eventually long chain polymers. Many naturally occurring and some synthetic polymers are produced by <b>step-growth</b> polymerization, e.g. polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, etc. Due {{to the nature of}} the polymerization mechanism, a high extent of reaction is required to achieve high molecular weight. The easiest way to visualize the mechanism of a <b>step-growth</b> polymerization is a group of people reaching out to hold their hands to form a human chain—each person has two hands (= reactive sites). There also is the possibility to have more than two reactive sites on a monomer: In this case branched polymers are produced.|$|E
