50|$|The Austrian curtain or Austrian drape, {{also called}} a puff curtain, has {{multiple}} vertical and usually nylon lines distributed evenly across {{the length of}} the fabric (often a thin <b>satin,</b> <b>charmeuse,</b> or chiffon material that bunches up well). Each of these lines runs through a pulley {{at the top of the}} curtain and then over to a head block. From there, they each lead and down to a mechanical winch necessary to raise the curtain which is typically much too heavy for one person to raise. As the winch turns and curtain rises, it is collected in a series of swags accentuated by horizontal pleats called festoons sown into the curtain from top to bottom. In this sense, it has both vertical and horizontal fullness. Austrian curtains reached their height of popularity in the mid twentieth century. They are visually considered very aesthetic, require little fly space overhead, and are relatively simple to operate as long as the winch can bear the load. However, they are very complex to rig and are usually the most expensive kind of curtain to construct.|$|E
40|$|Evening {{dress of}} rose/pale pink/pale mauve crepe-back <b>satin</b> <b>charmeuse.</b> Inspired by Chinese Cheongsam-style garments, the dress is full-length, slim fitted, with slight {{standing}} collar fastened with hidden hook & loop. Sleeveless, the dress has front opening from throat to slightly below right shoulder, secured with three large rhinestone set circular brass(?) buttons. Very slightly raised waist with triangular "flap", open and hanging down from center front to right hip. From just below hip to center front at hem is secondary opening, with 7 buttons matching bodice. Hem slightly scalloped at front overlap corners, and at right side. Left side underarm zipper. Combined designer's/retailer's label inside bodice: "Neiman-Marcus dallas / Maurice Rentner" With tie belt of same fabric, 3 / 4 " wide...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{principle}} that a body to be obtained by sewing the material to provide resistance and the like in the stitching assembly, the experimental study of which developed resistance is compared with the resistance materials to effectively assembled by the assembly line. The experimental values resistance for assemblies were obtained in the testing for resistance to sliding stitch ASTM D 434 using Tinius Olsen HK 5 T test type machine. The assembly strength was determined for warp knitted fabric and <b>satin</b> <b>charmeuse,</b> made of poly-filamentary wires and mono-filament polyester and polyamide. Resistance assembling {{is one of the major}} determinants of the quality of the stitching. It is defined as "the tensile strength or friction. " Tenacity stitching seam rupture is the force recorded at its weakest point. Seam abrasion resistance is the number of cycles required friction mesh destruction of seam. It can be said that the strength of the used assembly, the seam 301 is achieved by, in most of the cases, lower resistance knitted studied. In these cases, the primary findings presented, it is clear that the assembly is not appropriate in terms of reliability and maintainability of the product. Such a situation requires a first step to change the type (class) of stitch used. Another way to remedy the deficiencies could be using a sewing thread with a lower finesse or strength in grain, especially in the upper loop of wire used in the study-specific. ...|$|E
5000|$|A slip {{dress is}} a woman's dress that closely resembles an underslip or petticoat. It is {{traditionally}} {{cut on the}} bias, with spaghetti straps. Slip dresses first became widely worn {{in the last decade}} of the 20th century, as part of the underwear-as-outerwear trend, when they were made from layered chiffon, polyester <b>satins</b> and <b>charmeuse,</b> and often trimmed with lace. The slip dress looked like an undergarment, but was intended to be seen, and through the use of lace and sheer elements, offer glimpses of the body beneath.|$|R
5000|$|Charmeuse (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four {{or more of the}} backing (weft) threads. These float threads give the front of the fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a dull finish. It can be made of silk or a synthetic lookalike such as polyester. Silk charmeuse is more expensive and delicate but is softer and a better insulator. [...] Polyester charmeuse is cheaper and can often withstand machine washing, but it does not breathe as well as silk. Charmeuse differs from plain <b>satin</b> in that <b>charmeuse</b> has a different ratio of float (face) threads.|$|R
