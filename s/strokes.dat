40|$|Background: <b>Stroke</b> unit care offers {{significant}} {{benefits in}} survival and dependency {{when compared to}} general medical ward. Most <b>stroke</b> units are either acute or rehabilitation, but comprehensive (combined acute and rehabilitation) model (comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit) is less common. Aim: To examine different levels of evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit compared to other organized inpatient <b>stroke</b> care and share local experience of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units. Methods: Cochrane Library and Medline (1980 to December 2010) review of English language articles comparing <b>stroke</b> units to alternative forms of <b>stroke</b> care delivery, different types of <b>stroke</b> unit models, and differences in processes of care within different <b>stroke</b> unit models. Different levels of comparative evidence of comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other models of <b>stroke</b> units are collected. Results: There are no randomized controlled trials directly comparing comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units to other <b>stroke</b> unit models (either acute or rehabilitation). Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units are associated with reduced length of stay and greatest reduction in combined death and dependency in a meta-analysis study {{when compared to other}} <b>stroke</b> unit models. Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units also have better length of stay and functional outcome when compared to acute or rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> unit models in a cross-sectional study, and better length of stay in a ‘before-and-after’ comparative study. Components of <b>stroke</b> unit care that improve outcome are multifactorial and most probably include early mobilization. A comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit model has been successfully implemented in metropolitan and rural hospital settings. Conclusions: Comprehensive <b>stroke</b> units are associated with reductions in length of stay and combined death and dependency and improved functional outcomes compared to other <b>stroke</b> unit models. A comprehensive <b>stroke</b> unit model is worth considering as the preferred model of <b>stroke</b> unit care in the planning and delivery of metropolitan and rural <b>stroke</b> services...|$|R

Sixteen, experienced female outrigger canoeists completed three 1000 m outrigger ergometer time trials, one trial each using a self-selected, a Hawaiian (65 strokes·min- 1) <b>stroke</b> rate. <b>Stroke</b> rate, <b>stroke</b> length, <b>stroke</b> time, proportion {{of time spent in}} propulsion and recovery, torso flexion angle and 'twist' were measured and compared with repeated measures ANOVAs. <b>Stroke</b> rate, <b>stroke</b> length and <b>stroke</b> time were significantly different across all interventions (p < 0. 05) despite no difference in the percentage of time spent in the propulsive and recovery phases of the <b>stroke.</b> <b>Stroke</b> length and <b>stroke</b> time were negatively correlated to <b>stroke</b> rate for all interventions (r = - 0. 79 and - 0. 99, respectively). Female outrigger canoeists maintain consistent <b>stroke</b> kinematics throughout a 1000 m time trial, most likely as a learned skill to maximize crew paddling synchrony when paddling on-water.

Data from the Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive {{have been used}} to test hypotheses and inform trial design. We sought to expand Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into a broader <b>stroke</b> resource with new opportunities for research and international collaboration. Methods: Using procedures initially developed for an acute <b>stroke</b> trial archive, we invited trialists to lodge data on rehabilitation, secondary prevention, intracerebral haemorrhage, imaging, and observational <b>stroke</b> studies. Results: We have extended Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive into six subsections: Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Acute (n[*]=[*] 28 [*] 190 patients’ data), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab (n[*]=[*] 10 [*] 194), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-intracerebral haemorrhage (n[*]=[*] 1829), Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Imaging (n[*]=[*] 1300), and Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus (n[*]=[*] 6573). Enrollment continues, with commitments for the contribution of six further trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Prevention, 13 trials to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Rehab, and one registry to Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive-Plus. Data on age, type of <b>stroke,</b> medical history, outcomes by modified Rankin scale and Barthel Index (BI), mortality, and adverse events are available for analyses. The Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive network encourages the development of young investigators and provides opportunities for international peer review and collaboration. Conclusions: Application of the original Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive concepts beyond acute <b>stroke</b> trials can extend the value of clinical research at low cost, without threatening commercial or intellectual property interests. This delivers valuable research output to inform the efficiency of future <b>stroke</b> research. We invite <b>stroke</b> researchers to participate actively in Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive and encourage the extension of Virtual International <b>Stroke</b> Trials Archive principles to other disease areas. </br...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Sub-Saharan Africa {{is thought}} to be {{undergoing}} a health (or epidemiological) and demographic transition, moving from a pattern of disease dominated by infection, perinatal illness and other diseases of poverty, to one dominated by noncommunicable disease, in particular vascular disease. If such a transition is occurring, then the burden of vascular disease including <b>stroke</b> will increase. <b>Stroke</b> is a heterogeneous condition and {{it is likely that the}} nature of <b>stroke</b> (pathological types, subtypes, and causes) will change during this transition. However, little is known about the burden and nature of <b>stroke</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa, as it is now. This information is essential to inform health services to appropriately plan and deliver health care for the future, to develop strategies for <b>stroke</b> prevention, and to test the theory of the health and demographic transition. My overall aim was to assess and compare the burden and nature of <b>stroke</b> in rural and urban South Africa, and to establish whether there is any evidence of a health transition. Specifically I aimed to: • review what is known about <b>stroke</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa; • establish the prevalence and nature of prevalent <b>stroke</b> in rural South Africa; • compare the nature of hospital-based <b>stroke</b> in urban and rural <b>stroke</b> patients; • compare the nature of urban hospital-based <b>stroke</b> in different population groups; and • validate two <b>stroke</b> scores in the urban <b>stroke</b> register to enable us to diagnose pathological <b>stroke</b> type in rural <b>stroke</b> patients who do not have access to brain imaging. Methods: The following methods were used to achieve these aims: • I systematically searched the literature for, and critically reviewed, studies of <b>stroke</b> from Sub-Saharan Africa (literature review). • The rural Agincourt Health and Population Unit demographic surveillance site was screened for <b>stroke</b> using two questions during the annual census. Anyone who screened positive for <b>stroke</b> was examined to decide whether they had had a <b>stroke</b> (<b>stroke</b> prevalence study). • The Tintswalo Hospital <b>Stroke</b> Register was established to ascertain and assess rural <b>stroke</b> patients over 20 months (rural hospital-based <b>stroke),</b> and • The Johannesburg Hospital <b>Stroke</b> Register similarly established to assess urban <b>stroke</b> patients over 23 months (urban hospital-based <b>stroke).</b> • The accuracy of the Siriraj and Guy’s Hospital <b>stroke</b> scores was compared to the CT brain scan “gold-standard” in the Johannesburg Hospital <b>Stroke</b> Register. Results: Using these approaches I found that: • Very little is currently known about the burden and nature of <b>stroke</b> in Sub- Saharan Africa. • The prevalence of rural <b>stroke</b> was about half that found in high-income countries, and double that found in Tanzania. However, disabling <b>stroke</b> was at least as prevalent as it is in high-income countries. • Both rural and urban black South Africans are probably in early phases of the health transition, and this is impacting on the nature of <b>stroke,</b> particularly the cause of cardioembolic <b>stroke.</b> • Neither the Siriraj nor Guy’s Hospital <b>stroke</b> score are sufficiently accurate for use in epidemiological studies or clinical management of <b>stroke</b> in Sub- Saharan Africa. Conclusion: There is already a heavy burden of <b>stroke</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is some evidence of a health transition in the black population. However, it is not possible to accurately assess the burden and nature of <b>stroke</b> without communitybased incidence studies using early brain imaging to distinguish ischaemic <b>stroke</b> from cerebral haemorrhage. Until we have these studies, we will never know the precise burden and nature of <b>stroke,</b> the effect of the health transition, or the optimal approach to preventing a <b>stroke</b> epidemic in our population...|$|R
