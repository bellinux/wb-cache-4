40|$|In {{many places}} the {{expansion}} of urban areas has brought recreationists into close proximity to nature conservation areas, sometimes leading to conflict where recreation and sensitive environmental or natural values are incompatible. An important first step in managing these conflicts is to assess the degree {{and nature of the}} problem. We describe the application, and methodological considerations, {{associated with the use of}} an innovative, low-cost, practical technique to monitor human intrusions into a wetland reserve which has been designated as ‘off-limits’ to the general public. The use of seven frequently monitored <b>sand</b> <b>pads</b> over 13 weeks enabled us to determine that intrusions occurred in every week (3 – 14 per <b>sand</b> <b>pad),</b> deep inside the reserve during most weeks, and also identified the key access points. Most intrusions occurred during holiday periods and were by walkers or cyclists. We also conducted a series of simple experiments to examine the utility of <b>sand</b> <b>pads.</b> Our <b>sand</b> <b>pads</b> maintained their shape well and held footprints for over 1 month, they were rarely avoided by people and provided reliable indices of the level of human activity. Sand hardness varied with rainfall, and hardened sand was frequent (53. 8 % of 26 days) and potentially prevented detection of people. We conclude that the <b>sand</b> <b>pad</b> technique is an effective and efficient tool to measure recreational use of off-limits areas and other conservation and recreation areas, provided human traffic is not too intense, and that checks are made reasonably frequently. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary <b>sanding</b> backing <b>pads</b> {{and a range of}} replacement <b>sanding</b> <b>pads</b> from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} of Bulgarian Bags {{is made out}} of leather or heavy-duty canvas.The leather bags are handmade in Bulgaria and mostly constructed of goat skin. Because goat skin is finer in thickness and the follicles are shallow in the skin, there is less compromise in the strength of the hide when compared to other leathers. The interior is filled with individually wrapped and weighed <b>sand</b> packets and <b>padded</b> with wool to form a smooth rounded contour. Once filled, the main seam is closed using a heavy gauge soft nylon.|$|R
5000|$|Another unusual attachment, {{called the}} Handi-Butler {{introduced}} with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft {{at the front}} to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, {{and was replaced by}} the Turbo Sander with the Legend model. The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of <b>sand</b> paper, scrubbing <b>pads,</b> and a soft, vinyl pad {{to be used as a}} massage unit that is still currently available.|$|R

40|$|Ireland is {{currently}} undergoing the largest extension to the National road network in recent years. For this reason, {{the number of}} crossing structures for wildlife on the Irish National road network has increased markedly within the last few years. In Ireland, the structures are targeted at protected species whose habitat is directly disturbed by road construction. In general, the target species are otters (Lutra lutra) and badgers (Meles meles). However, structures {{have been put in}} place for red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris); i. e., rope ladders linking trees on opposite sides of a motorway and the first structures for pine martens (Martes martes) and bats will be put in place in the coming year. Bat boxes and bird boxes have also been fitted on the tunnel ceilings of oversized arched culverts with mammal ledges. Underpasses and overpasses (potential green bridges) have been constructed where farms have been bisected by new road schemes. These structures allow for the safe passage of domestic cattle over the road carriageway, but may also be utilized by wildlife, for example, red deer (Cervus elaphus) and other smaller wildlife species. Non-target native species which can utilise these structures are: red deer (Cervus elaphus), the indigenous Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus), stoat (Mustela erminea hibernica), fox (Vulpes vulpes), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and field or wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Non-native species which could potentially utilize such structures include: Sika deer (Cervus nippon), fallow deer (Cervus dama), brown hare (Lepus europaeus), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), house mouse (Mus (musculus) domesticus), bank vole (Clethrionomys Glareolus), feral ferret (Mustela furo), American mink (Mustela vison), and domestic cats and dogs, amongst other introduced species. This is the first study to examine the effectiveness of crossing structures in Ireland. An initial pilot study monitoring the use of crossing structures on the Watergrasshill By-Pass, County Cork, Ireland, revealed encouraging results as the following species were found to utilize oversized arched culverts with mammal ledges: otter, fox, rabbit, pygmy shrew and wood mouse. Tracking tools utilized include: ink <b>pads,</b> <b>sand</b> beds, and infrared cameras. The initial pilot study was expanded to monitor crossing structures on a national scale in order to examine: (A) how effective are the culverts at providing passage for the target species? and (B) to what extent are cow under- and overpasses being utilised by wildlife? More specifically, the study is also currently examining: (1) with what frequency are the various passages being utilized?; (2) what non-target species utilize these passages?; (3) does the design of the fauna pipe (dimensions) affect utilization of the passage? e. g., are shorter pipes or longer pipes or small diameter (600 mm) or large diameter pipes (900 mm) more frequently used?; (4) does the presence of hedgerow planting enhance use of passage structures? (5) what kind of pipes do smaller species have a preference for? It is intended that {{the results of the study}} will provide valuable information which could improve the layout, design, and maintenance of future crossing structures to be put in place on national road schemes in Ireland, and indeed, in other countries...|$|R
