5000|$|Shortly after World War II, when {{synthetic}} insecticides became widely available, entomologists in California {{developed the}} concept of [...] "supervised insect control". Around the same time, entomologists in the US Cotton Belt were advocating a similar approach. Under this scheme, insect control was [...] "supervised" [...] by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. This was viewed {{as an alternative to}} calendar-based programs. <b>Supervised</b> <b>control</b> was based on knowledge of the ecology and analysis of projected trends in pest and natural-enemy populations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Supervised</b> <b>control</b> formed {{much of the}} {{conceptual}} basis for the [...] "integrated control" [...] that University of California entomologists articulated in the 1950s. Integrated control sought to identify the best mix of chemical and biological controls for a given insect pest. Chemical insecticides were {{to be used in}} the manner least disruptive to biological control. The term [...] "integrated" [...] was thus synonymous with [...] "compatible." [...] Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.|$|E

40|$|Supervisory {{control theory}} is well developed, but {{its use in}} {{industrial}} applications can be limited {{by a set of}} problems arising when supervisors have to be implemented on common control machines. As a matter of fact, the asynchronous and undetermined nature of supervisors makes their implementation on synchronous devices like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and PCs a complicated task. In this paper, an overview on the existing techniques about this topic is given first. Then, the <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> approach is used to implement supervisors and the <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> architecture consisting of a controller and a supervisor is completed by a dispatcher to obtain a closed-loop, determined behavior. The main problems occurring in implementing <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> on synchronous devices are presented and discussed. Finally, a method is proposed to translate automata, Petri Net or colored Petri Net supervisors in structured text language, one of the IEC 61131 - 3 standard languages, by preserving their structure and the closed-loop behavior as expected from the theory...|$|E

This paper describes the targets of renewable energy policy in the Czech Republic. However, when operating bioenergetic devices we can be tackled by problems of a hidden increase in harmful emissions This increase is caused by gradual loss of the proper function of the control variable sensor. As will be shown, if the control variable sensor produces biased data, {{then there is a}} danger that undesirable harmful emissions, above all emissions of CO and NOx, will increase and will remain unrecognized. This paper will show how a <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> can improve the ecological operation of a device.

Different component features (the control program, the supervision interface, the physical device) and the human tasks are modeled using timed automata. These timed automata are then checked by model checking (UPPAAL) with a set of safety and usability properties written in CTL.

Locating electrical zones can be useful to get some kind of information such as the amount of load that exists in each zone, energy losses, the identification of electrical resources, faulted zones, and so on. In this work, two kind of topological analyzers are presented, one of them uses DFS (Depth-First-Search) and the other, BFS (Breath-First-Search) in order to detect and create electrical zones for components and loads that are feeded by distribution transformers. The algorithms presented were proved using the case IEEE 37 bus test case modified to be able to notice the functionality of these programs.

The key to the simplicity {{is to have a}} probability of successful packet transmission that is independent of the number of transmitting terminals. In considering waiting time, we calculate the mean and other moments of the waiting time of a terminal when it enters the system to find (n - 1) other terminals already there competing for the channel. Under this control, the average time is proportional to n. The control requires exact knowledge of the number of terminals contending for the channel, and hence is not implementable, except as an approximation...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the development and}} experimental validation of a geometric path following control strategy with demand supervision applied to an over-actuated robotic vehicle, the ROboMObil. The proposed method enables the ROboMObil to automatically follow paths while the driver is free to control the velocity along the path. Beside the longitudinal degree of freedom, two lateral degrees of freedom can be controlled relative to the path. If this demand interface were provided without supervision, the driver may potentially overwrite the path following control in a manner such that the vehicle limits are violated and the vehicle becomes unstable. To avoid such critical situations a demand supervisor is introduced into the path following framework. The work concludes by a simulative demonstration of the <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> system and an experimental validation of the presented approach implemented in the ROboMObil...|$|E

The man-machine interface system for a space servicer, namely the operator control station, includes several subsystems with a hierarchical architecture. Those subsystems include a reasoning and planning subsystem (also known as the artificial intelligence planner), a run-time control subsystem, a manipulator control and mechanization subsystem, and a sensing and perception subsystem. Indicative of these potentials, certain generic tasks, suggestive of space assembly, maintenance and repair, were performed in a testbed environment. Through performance in several modes: direct teleoperation, shared control, traded control, and robotic operation, the benefits of the individual technology contributions to the operation were quantized and recommendations for use in telerobotic systems were established...|$|E
40|$|Many {{of today}} utility {{interconnected}} wind farms use induction generator (IG) {{to convert the}} captured wind mechanical power into electricity. Induction generator has some advantages over the synchronous generator (SG). The main advantages are its robustness and its capability to be synchronized directly to the grid. The main disadvantage, however, is its dependency on the grid for supplying its own reactive power ‘VAr’. Whether fixed or adjustable VAr systems are connected across its terminal, IG must operate at unity power factor at the rated loading while the wind power varies. With <b>supervised</b> <b>control</b> and appropriate coordination, VAr {{can be used to}} the benefits of both the wind farm developer and the hosting utility.
