Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each <b>show</b> <b>they</b> do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E

5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the <b>show</b> <b>they</b> tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E

Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the <b>show</b> <b>they</b> repeatedly date and break up, even while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Dave Kelly, who {{had been}} a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who {{continued}} to tour and record rhythm and blues into the new millennium. Roots music, including rhythm and blues, began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Annual blues festivals were established, including The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival, held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989, which hosts both US and British R acts. In 1994 Jools Holland, former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later..., reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and, as well as supporting him on the <b>show,</b> <b>they</b> embarked on a series of tours. After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings, which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, touring and producing a series of R based albums. By 2000 the fanzine Blues Matters! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine.|$|E

Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the <b>show,</b> <b>they</b> meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to <b>show</b> <b>they</b> had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
