50|$|The loader sat to the gunner's right, and fed in belts of cloth, {{into which}} the rounds had been placed. The weapon would draw in the belt from right to left, pull the next round out of the belt and into the chamber, fire it, then send the fired brass {{cartridge}} down {{and out of the}} receiver while the cloth belt would continue out the left side. During sustained fire, the barrel would heat up which heated the water in the jacket until hot enough for the water to evaporate or boil thereby cooling the barrel releasing the heat through steam. It took the Mk I 600 rounds of continuous fire to boil the water in the jacket, evaporating at a rate of 1.5 pints (0.852 L) per 1,000 rounds. The steam would reach the top of the jacket and enter a <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> which led to a port that was situated under the jacket near the muzzle. A hose was connected to this, which released the steam into a metal water can allowing it to be vented away {{from the rest of the}} gun hiding the steam cloud and the gun's position. This also allowed any condensate to be reclaimed from the steam. Before the can got too full, it would be emptied back into the jacket to replenish the water level which would have fallen as the water evaporated and boiled away. If the water jacket needed to be emptied, a plug under the jacket could be unscrewed to drain the entire jacket.|$|E

40|$|An {{existing}} {{furnace oil}} fired boiler {{is used to}} supply process steam to an instant tea manufacturing factory. The instant tea is manufactured the Broken Mixed Fannings (BMF) through extraction and other required processes. The average steam consumption of the plant is 6000 kg/h at 10 barg pressure. During the process, tea waste is generated at a nominal rate of 50, 000 kg/day, about 2000 kg/h at around 70 % MC content on wet basis. At the moment this waste tea is either dumped in the surrounding area by spending money or sent to landfilling purposes, which create environmental issues.    The tea waste coming out at 70 % MC wet basis, is looked at to press through continuous belt press to reduce the moisture content to about 55 % on wet basis. The water removed from this pressing process is sent to effluent treatment plant at the factory. The output from the belt press is sent to a steam operated  The average generation of tea waste from the instant tea manufacturing process process is about 2000 kg/h, after pressing in the belt press an output rate of about 1, 400 kg/h at 55 % MC. This amount of tea waste at 55 % MC is sent to a rotary <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> dryer and the MC is reduced from 55 % to 30 % and the output rate from the <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> dryer is about 857 kg/h. The amount of steam consumed by the rotary <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> dryer at 6 barg pressure is 760 kg/h. Then the tea waste from the rotary tube dryer is mixed with firewood of 30 % MC and fed to the boiler to generate process steam, out of which 857 kg/h steam at 6 barg pressure is {{sent back to the}} rotary steam dryer. From tea waste alone, a steam amount of 2, 472 kg/h can be supplied after giving steam to the rotary steam dryer. The balance steam amount of 3, 528 kg/h for the process requirement is supplied by burning additional firewood at 30 % MC content. The tea waste fuel and firewood in combination have an overall moisture content of 30 % on wet basis. The boiler is rated at 10, 000 kg/h F & A 100 deg C with an actual generating capacity of about 9000 kg/h at 10 barg operating pressure at 70 deg C feed water temperature.

40|$|Abstract. Steam {{generator}} in {{a nuclear}} power plant is huge heat exchanger that transfers heat from reactor to make steam to drive turbine-generator. Failure of the <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> can result in the release of fission products to the secondary side. Therefore, accurate integrity assessment of the cracked <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> is of great importance for maintaining the safety of the nuclear power plant. This paper provides limit loads for circumferential through-wall cracks in <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> under combined internal pressure and bending loads. Such limit loads are developed on the basis of three dimensional finite element analyses assuming elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. As for the crack location, both the top of the tubesheet and U-bend regions are considered. The analysis results can be directly applied to the practical integrity assessment of cracked <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes,</b> because the comparison between experimental data and FE results shows a very good agreement...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaporator}} {{is used on}} {{liquid waste}} from processing facilities to reduce {{the volume of the}} waste through heating the waste and allowing some of the water to be separated from the waste through boiling. This separation process allows for more efficient processing and storage of liquid waste. Commonly, the liquid waste consists of an aqueous solution of chemicals that over time could induce corrosion, and in turn weaken the tubes in the <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> bundle of the waste evaporator that are used to heat the waste. This chemically induced corrosion could escalate into a possible tube leakage and/or the severance of a tube(s) in the tube bundle. In this paper, analyses of a waste evaporator system for the processing of liquid waste containing corrosive chemicals are presented to assess the system response to this accident scenario. This accident scenario is evaluated since its consequences can propagate to a release of hazardous material to the outside environment. It is therefore important to ensure that the evaporator system component structural integrity is not compromised, i. e. the design pressure and temperature of the system is not exceeded during the accident transient. The computer code used for the accident simulation is RELAP 5 -MOD 31. The accident scenario analyzed includes a double-ended guillotine break of a tube in the tube bundle of the evaporator. A mitigated scenario is presented to evaluate the excursion of the peak pressure and temperature in the various components of the evaporator system to assess whether the protective actions and controls available are adequate to ensure that the structural integrity of the evaporator system is maintained and that no atmospheric release occurs...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} solutions {{of scientific}} and practical issues for increasing energy efficiency of peat drying process in tube steam driers. Thoroughness of the solution consists in developing a method of drying peat regimes. That method should allow to dry peat to the required quality by the lowest consumption of energy. To achieve this, the analysis of drying peat factors was carried out and set of factors that have influence to the technical and economic parameters of the process was defined. In order to develop mathematical dependencies of changes of the target or output functions due {{to changes in the}} input variables, the active experiments were conducted. It was found that some features could were affected by noise during the investigation of peat drying process in <b>steam</b> <b>tube</b> dryer. The problem of features selection was resolved by using Group of Adaptive Model Evolution method. The procedure of selection models obtained from different optimization methods by solving feature?s selection criteria was developed. The values of control parameters were found by using simplex method. These parameters satisfy the criteria for energy efficiency. The number of experiments on the peat plant was limited, so there were only few data sets for getting accurate models that calculate outputs by using neural network. That is why in order to increase data set it is necessary to create a synthetic data. It was used the Monte Carlo method for generating new data set. Then there were found the structure and characteristic of neural network that solve the task of searching optimal control parameters of peat drying process. It was used a classification algorithm for classifying the data into a number of optimal operational regimes by using the experimental data, possibly extended with synthetic data. Classification functions obtained using discriminant analysis, can be classified with sufficient accuracy to the required sample class. After classifying and recognizing industrial regimes an algorithm for operating the peat drying process was developed. ??????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????????????????? ?????????? ????? ????? ?? ???? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ?? ?????????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????????????????. ??? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????????????? ????????? ???? ???????? ?????, ???????? ???????? ???????, ??????????? ???????? ?? ??????????????????? ?????????? ?????????????????????? ???????? ????? ????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????????

A significant number of <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> are defective and are removed from service or repaired each year. This wide spread damage has been caused by many diverse degradation mechanisms, some of which are difficult to detect and predict. In addition, spontaneous tube ruptures have occurred at the rate of about one every 2 years over the last 20 years, and incipient tube ruptures (tube failures usually identified with leak detection monitors just before rupture) have been occurring at the rate of about one per year. These ruptures have caused complex plant transients which have not always been easy for the reactor operators to control. Our analysis shows that if more than 15 tubes rupture during a main steam line break, the system response could lead to core melting. Although spontaneous and induced <b>steam</b> generator <b>tube</b> ruptures are small contributors to the total core damage frequency calculated in probabilistic risk assessments, they are risk significant because the radionuclides are likely to bypass the reactor containment building.

NEI 97 - 06 and {{the related}} Generic License Change Package {{describe}} a <b>steam</b> generator <b>tube</b> management program that is flexible enough to accommodate evolving technical knowledge and could provide an enforceable regulatory framework. 2. We concur with the staff’s conclusion {{that there is a}} need for additional technical justification to support the industry’s proposal to extend the inspection intervals for Alloy 600 TT and 690 TT tubing beyond that currently permitted by regulations. BACKGROUND In the early 1990 s, the regulations required licensees to repair <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> having flaws deeper than 40 percent through-wall. Since the nondestructive examination (NDE) methods were unable to characterize the dimensions of a crack with sufficient accuracy and reproducibility, licensees repaired tubes with identified cracks. In 1995, the staff issued Generic Letter 95 - 05, which, in certain specific situations, allowed <b>steam</b> generator <b>tubes</b> with cracks to remain in service, in part, on the basis of data from voltage-based NDE methodologies. 2 Since that time, the staff and NEI have worked to develop a regulatory framework to ensur...|$|R
