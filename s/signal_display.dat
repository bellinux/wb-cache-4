50|$|The {{persistence}} of a CRT display is a desired effect on goniometers because the <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> is very dynamic, {{and the overall}} shape or envelope of the signal {{is the object of}} interest.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the safety and effectiveness of selected protected/permissive left-turn (PPLT) <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> through driver comprehension evaluations. Driver evaluations were conducted using full-scale, fixed-based, fully-interactive driving simulators located at the University of Massachusetts and the Texas Transportation Institute. PPLT displays were also evaluated in a static environment to provide comparison data. In an effort to evaluate driver’s comprehension of the various PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> in use, several traditional study methods have been employed. Commonly, pen and paper comprehension tests are used in which the driver simply marks what he/she believes to be the correct answer. The critique of this methodology has focused on the belief that the study responses provided might not be consistent with the decision made in the actual driving environment. To add more realism to the experiment, computer technology has been employed by providing static photos of actual driving environments and superimposing PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays</b> within. Although this technology is believed to be a major step forward in experimentation, the static nature and lack of dynamic cues may still lead drivers through a different decision process. This paper describes the use of a full-scale dynamic driving simulator as a tool for evaluating driver comprehension of PPLT <b>signal</b> <b>displays.</b> Drivers traversed through a series of signalized intersections created as part of...|$|R
50|$|Each {{block signal}} is {{identified}} by an identification number; as a train {{travels to the}} next station, the ID numbers count down.

The <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> depends on the presence of a train in advance of the signal and the display of the next signal.|$|E

5000|$|Long Island Rail Road Automatic Speed Control: The LIRR was a PRR {{subsidiary}} {{and it is}} {{no surprise}} that they would adopt a similar system. The LIRR used standard PRR cab signals until bought by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968, when it was modified slightly into ASC systems used to this day. ASC employs two additional codes, 270 and 420 ppm and replaces the in-cab <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> with an in-cab speed display. The additional codes are used to display speeds of 50/60 and 60/70 mph, which are used to slow trains for curves, higher speed turnouts and short signal blocks.|$|E
50|$|Cab {{signals are}} {{presented}} to the locomotive {{by means of a}} cab <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> unit. The earliest CDUs consisted of miniature signals of the type visible along the track, back lit by light bulbs. These could be found in both color light and position light varieties depending on the railroad's native signaling system. Modern CDUs on passenger trains are often integrated with the speedometer, as cab signals now serve a speed control function. On trains equipped with automatic train control functionality failure to properly acknowledge a restrictive cab signal change results in a 'penalty brake application', as does failure to observe the cab signal speed limit.|$|E
50|$|The {{sweep of}} the beam across the display was {{initially}} set to 1/10th the basic frequency of the local oscillator, so approximately five complete signal chains would {{be seen on the}} display. Once the operator was happy with the display, a switch was thrown to increase the beam speed 10 times. This reduced the amount of the <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> on the display to one complete 2 ms A...D cycle. A fine control could then be used to slightly speed or slow the beam so the cycle exactly filled the screen with the D signal on the right. The time for ten cycles of this 150 kHz oscillation, 66.66 μs was called a Gee unit and corresponded to a range difference of 12.4 mi.|$|E

5000|$|Amtrak {{uses the}} Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) for its Acela Express {{high-speed}} rail {{service on the}} NEC. ACSES was an overlay to the existing PRR-type CSS and uses the same SES transponder technology to enforce both permanent and temporary speed restrictions at curves and other geographic features. The on-board cab signal unit processes both the pulse code [...] "signal speed" [...] and the ACSES [...] "civil speed", then enforces the lower of the two. ACSES also provides for a positive stop at absolute signals which could be released by a code provided by the dispatcher transmitted from the stopped locomotive via a data radio. Later this was amended to a simpler [...] "stop release" [...] button on the cab <b>signal</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ricky Lynn Gates, a Penn Central and Conrail {{engineer}} since 1973, {{was operating}} {{a trio of}} Conrail GE B36-7 locomotives light (without freight cars) from Conrail's Bayview Yard just east of Baltimore bound for Enola Yard near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Gates was later determined to have violated several signal and operating rules, including a failure to properly test his cab signals as required before departure from Bayview. It was later discovered that someone had disabled the cab signal alerter whistle on lead unit #5044 with duct tape, muting it almost completely. Also, one of the light bulbs in the PRR-style cab <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> had been removed. Investigators believed these conditions probably existed prior to departure from Bayview {{and that they would}} have been revealed by a properly performed departure test.|$|E
5000|$|Drivers need to {{be aware}} of which signals are automatic. In current British {{practice}} for example, automatic signals have a white rectangular plate with a black horizontal line across it. In US practice a permissive signal typically is indicated by the presence of a number plate. In the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, as well as New Zealand, a permissive signal has the lower set of lights offset (usually to the right) from the upper lights; in Victoria and New Zealand, an absolute signal displaying a red or white [...] "A" [...] light is also treated as a permissive signal. Some types of <b>signal</b> <b>display</b> separate permissive and absolute stop aspects. In Germany, the rules which apply to the respective signal are indicated by a vertical plate on the signal's post (Mastschild).|$|E
