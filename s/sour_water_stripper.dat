40|$|The Natref Oil Refinery in Sasolburg, South Africa, {{experienced}} refractory {{problems in}} the combustion chamber of the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) since start-up (Figure 1). Even though the SRU was at all times operated within the temperature range of 1250 - 1750 °C (as measured on the original thermocouples and the pyrometer), they experienced refractory failures, {{which can only be}} accounted for by temperatures in excess of 1850 °C. It was concluded that the available temperature indication was not an accurate reflection of the actual temperature in the combustion chamber. Three new sets of temperature measurement were installed in order to better understand the temperature profile in the combustion chamber (each set consists of two thermocouples and one pyrometer). Furthermore, An ASPEN-based simulation was used to set up a neural network to predict the combustion chamber temperature based on three input variables, namely the oxygen enrichment level, the ratio of <b>sour</b> <b>water</b> <b>stripper</b> offgas to acid gas, as well as the amount of acid gas bypassed to the second chamber of the reaction furnace. The reaction furnace was found to be operated at an average temperature of 1400 °C during normal operation. This temperature is substantially higher than the normal recommended 1250 °C for Claus combustion chambers. The neural network was connected to the Natref DCS and successfully proved that during the start-up of the SRU in 2006 a temperature in excess of 2000 °C was reached inside the combustion chamber, explaining the refractory failure and subsequent shutdown of the unit. In order to establish which temperature measurement should be used for control purposes during normal operation, the 9 temperature measurements over the length of the combustion chamber were compared to the neural network temperatures. All the other thermocouples (T 1 - T 6) were found to underpredict the ASPEN simulated temperature. Furthermore, the response of these thermocouples was much slower than that of the pyrometers. With the exception of the burner box pyrometer, P 1, all the pyrometers also underpredicted the ASPEN simulated temperature. The response of the pyrometers was, however, much faster and showed the strongest linear correlation with regards to the adiabatic flame temperature. The reason for the underprediction can be ascribed to heat losses in the combustion chamber. The middle pyrometer, P 2, gave the smallest deviation between measured and predicted temperature values of only 28 °C on average and should be used as the main control point with regards to temperature.

The possible application of partial nitritation SHARON (Single reactor for High activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite) coupled with autotrophic ANAMMOX (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation) or heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite processes would represent a technical- and cost-effective technology: partial nitritation has been studied and commonly applied at full scale to treat anaerobic digester supernatant and landfill leachates, while only few studies focusing on the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic substances {{have been carried out}} so far. In this study, a SHARON reactor was used to treat synthetic and real ammonium rich refinery wastewater (<b>sour</b> <b>water)</b> : since availability of inorganic carbon (IC) determines the amount of NH 4 +-N being converted into NO 2 [...] N by partial nitritation, different influent IC/N (as HCO 3 -/NH 4 +-N) molar ratios were tested and SHARON feasibility as the preliminary treatment in a double stage SHARON-ANAMMOX or SHARON-Denitrification via nitrite process was assessed. In order to retain only ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the system, the reactor was run at controlled temperature and operated as a chemostat (no biomass recirculation) at low hydraulic and solids retention time. A synthetic medium containing NH 4 +-N (2, 000 mg/L) was initially fed to promote biomass acclimation, then real <b>sour</b> <b>water</b> containing also organic substrate, cyanides, sulphides and phenols was supplied.

The catalyst samples have been characterized using temperature programmed sulfurization (TPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and laser Raman and BET surface area measurements. The results have shown that adding TiO 2 to the catalyst makes the active components, e. g., Mo and Co, easier to be sulfurized with higher sulfur capacity in the catalyst itself. This may be the main reason why the TiO 2 modified CoMo catalyst to be active even at low H 2 S gas stream. The results from industrial operation showed that adding TiO 2 to the shift catalyst increases the catalyst activity and stability, presents the higher shift activity in {{a broader range of}} H 2 S content, depresses the aggregating of the molybdenum oxide, and reduces carbon deposition. In addition, the TiO 2 additive in the catalyst also helps to maintain the physical properties of the shift catalysts.

40|$|Two novel {{regenerated}} {{solvent extraction}} processes are examined. The first process {{has the potential}} to reduce the energy costs inherent in the recovery of low-volatility carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solutions. The second process has the potential for reducing the energy costs required for separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases (e. g. CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S) from industrial <b>sour</b> <b>waters.</b> The recovery of carboxylic acids from dilute aqueous solution can be achieved by extraction with tertiary amines. An approach for regeneration and product recovery from such extracts is to back-extract the carboxylic acid with a water-soluble, volatile tertiary amine, such as trimethylamine. The resulting trimethylammonium carboxylate solution can be concentrated and thermally decomposed, yielding the product acid and the volatile amine for recycle. Experimental work was performed with lactic acid, succinic acid, and fumaric acid. Equilibrium data show near-stoichiometric recovery of the carboxylic acids from an organic solution of Alamine 336 into aqueous solutions of trimethylamine. For fumaric and succinic acids, partial evaporation of the aqueous back extract decomposes the carboxylate and yields the acid product in crystalline form. The decomposition of aqueous solutions of trimethylammonium lactates was not carried out to completion, due to the high water solubility of lactic acid and the tendency of the acid to self-associate. The separate recovery of ammonia and acid gases from <b>sour</b> <b>waters</b> can be achieved by combining steam-stripping of the acid gases with simultaneous removal of ammonia by extraction with a liquid cation exchanger. The use of di- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid as the liquid cation exchanger is explored in this work.

Solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (Seaman’s Schnapps 40 % alcoholic drink,) and “omi ekan-ogi ” (<b>Sour</b> <b>water</b> from 3 days fermented milled maize). Leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. Another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. All extracts were lyophilized. These extracts were tested against some Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Citrobacter spp); Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (Candida albicans). Agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods {{were used to determine}} the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. All the organisms except Candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. The squeezed-leaf juice of Kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with MIC of 8 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against Shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain Staphylococcus aureus while its MBC i...|$|R
