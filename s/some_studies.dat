30|$|In recent years, fixed-point {{theory has}} been {{examined}} for various contractive conditions. For example, contractive conditions of integral type were adapted into <b>some</b> <b>studied</b> fixed-point results. So more general fixed-point theorems were obtained.|$|R

5|$|Chromium deficiency, {{involving}} {{a lack of}} Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that the biologically active form of chromium (III) in an oligopeptide called low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr), which might {{play a role in}} the insulin signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. <b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E

5|$|Even though plasma {{concentration}} of APOA5 is very low, <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> {{have focused on}} the analysis of the potential association of this biochemical parameter with cardiovascular disease (CVD).

5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} {{are expected to be}} far more liquid and flexible {{than they were in the}} past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone.

5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In <b>some</b> <b>studies,</b> use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML.

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>studies</b> have {{suggested}} that the clade Megaraptora, usually considered to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids.
