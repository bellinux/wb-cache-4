40|$|Z. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps FCMs {{is a new}} {{approach}} in modelling the behaviour and operation of complex systems. FCMs are proposed {{to be used in}} the modelling of control systems and particularly in the modelling of the upper part or <b>supervisor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hierarchical control system. The description and the formulation of FCM are examined, moreover a process control problem is presented and its model and control is investigated using FCMs. Then the implementation of FCM in the modelling <b>of</b> the <b>supervisor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> control system is discussed and it becomes apparent how efficient FCMs are in expressing qualitative information and knowledge about the process structure. Finally, some interesting points for further research are presented and discussed. q 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{variability}} in the chlorophyll-specific absorption <b>of</b> marine phytoplankton, <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ), is essential for primary production modelling, calculation of underwater light field characteristics, and development of algorithms for remote sensing of chlorophyll concentrations. Previous field and laboratory studies have demonstrated significant apparent {{variability in}} <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) for natural samples and algal cultures. However, {{the potential impact of}} measurement uncertainties on derived values <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) has received insufficient study. This study presents <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> measurement uncertainties for a data set collected in the Ligurian Sea in Spring and assesses the impact on estimates <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ). It is found that <b>a</b> large proportion <b>of</b> apparent variability in this set <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) can be attributed to measurement errors. Application of the same analysis to the global NOMAD data set suggests that <b>a</b> significant fraction <b>of</b> variability in <b>a</b> <b>ph</b> * Chl (λ) may also be due to measurement errors...|$|R
