For the purpose of the parametric study, five box girder bridge models with constant span length and varying curvature. In order to validate the finite element modelling method, an example of box girder bridge is selected from literature to conduct a validation study. The example box girder is modelled and analysed in SAP 2000 and the responses are found to be fairly matching with the results reported in literature. For the purpose of the parametric study, the five box girder bridges are modelled in SAP 2000. The span length, cross-section and material property remains unchanged. The only parameter that changes is the radius of curvature. The cross section of the superstructure of the box girder bridge consists of <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>box.</b> The curvature of the bridges varies only in horizontal direction. All the models are subjected to self weight and moving load of IRC class A tracked vehicle. A static analysis for dead load and moving load, and a modal analysis are performed. The longitudinal stress at top and bottom of cross sections, bending moment, torsion, deflection and fundamental frequency are recorded. The responses of a box girder bridge curved in plan are compared with that of a straight bridge. The ratio of responses is expressed in terms of a parameter.

Torsional-distortional equations of equilibrium for the analysis of the <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> mono symmetric <b>box</b> girder structure were obtained by substituting the Vlasov’s coefficients into the generalized differential equations of equilibrium. A single span simply supported mono symmetric box girder structure was considered in the analysis. The derived equations are fourth order coupled ordinary differential equations of equilibrium which were integrated by method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence. The coupling of the equations show that there is strong interaction between torsional strain mode and distortional strain mode such that torsional analysis of a mono symmetric box girder structure can not be carried out independent of distortional analysis without introducing errors in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|A metro {{system is}} a railway {{transport}} system in an urban area with a high capacity, frequency and the grade separation from other traffic. An elevated metro system is more preferred type of metro system due to ease of construction and also it makes urban areas more accessible without any construction difficulty. An elevated metro system has two major elements pier and box girder. The present study focuses on two major elements, pier and box girder, of an elevated metro structural system. Conventionally the pier of a metro bridge is designed using a force based approach. During a seismic loading, the behaviour of a single pier elevated bridge relies mostly on the ductility and the displacement capacity. It is important to check the ductility of such single piers. Force based methods do not explicitly check the displacement capacity during the design. The codes are now moving towards a performance-based (displacement-based) design approach, which consider the design as per the target performances at the design stage. Performance of a pier designed by a Direct Displacement Based Design is {{compared with that of}} a force-based designed one. The design of the pier is done by both force based seismic design method and direct displacement based seismic design method {{in the first part of}} the study.

This unique bridge system uses post-tensioning to connect many smaller concrete bridge segments into very efficient long span bridges. However, because of the slender components, localized transverse bending becomes more critical when compared to more conventional bridge types. Bridge owners are finding that ratings for standard loads and permit trucks are often controlled by the transverse behavior of the girders near concentrated wheel loads. The popular analysis methods used today range from two dimensional frame models to three dimensional finite element models of the entire bridge. Currently, engineers must make sound engineering judgments on limited available information, while balancing safety and economy.

Multiple <b>cell</b> reinforced <b>box</b> culverts are ideal bridge structure if the discharge in a drain crossing the road is large and if the bearing capacity of the soil is low the single box culvert becomes uneconomical because of the higher thickness of the slab and walls. In such cases, more than one box can be constructed side by side monolithically. In conventional method thickness of box culvert is assumed and later on check for thickness is taken. But this may leads to uneconomical design therefore an attempt is made to evaluate optimum thicknesses for economical design.

40|$|Aeroelasticity is the {{relationship}} between the elasticity of an aircraft structure and its aerodynamics. This relationship can cause instabilities such as flutter in a wing. Engineers have long studied aeroelasticity to ensure such instabilities do not become a problem within normal operating conditions. In recent decades structural tailoring has been used to take advantage of aeroelasticity. It is possible to tailor an aircraft structure to respond favorably to multiple different flight regimes such as takeoff, landing, cruise, 2 -g pull up, etc. Structures can be designed so that these responses provide an aerodynamic advantage. This research investigates the ability to design and analyze tailored structures made from filamentary composites. Specifically the accuracy of tailored composite analysis must be verified if this design technique is to become feasible. To pursue this idea, a validation experiment has been performed on a small-scale filamentary composite wing box. The box is tailored such that its cover panels induce a global bend-twist coupling under an applied load. Two types of analysis were chosen for the experiment. The first is a closed form analysis based on a theoretical model of a <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> tailored <b>box</b> beam and the second is a finite element analysis. The predicted results are compared with the measured data to validate the analyses. The comparison of results show that the finite element analysis is capable of predicting displacements and strains to within 10 % on the small-scale structure. The closed form code is consistently able to predict the wing box bending to 25 % of the measured value. This error is expected due to simplifying assumptions in the closed form analysis. Differences between the closed form code representation and the wing box specimen caused large errors in the twist prediction. The closed form analysis prediction of twist has not been validated from this test...|$|R

In this thesis, combining the shape function of spline finite strip with the eigenfunction expansions at a crack tip, three types of crack strips, namely anti-plane shear crack strip, plane crack strip and bending crack strip, have been developed, in which cracks are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of strips and the stress intensity factors can be computed directly. Based on plane crack strips and bending crack strips, the flat shell crack strip is developed for the fracture analysis of box girder bridges. Several case studies have demonstrated the satisfactory convergence of the proposed method. The fracture analysis {{of different types of}} bridges have been successfully conducted using these crack strips. In Chapter 3, the basic model of the crack strip is farmed. Substructure technique and extra knots are employed to enhance the efficiency and the convergence of this model. Two Gaussian quadratures for improper integrals are introduced to calculate the singular integral in the crack strip. The efficiencies of these two methods are compared through case studies. On the basis of anti-plane eigenfunction expansion derived by Tilley (1978), plane eigenfunction expansion by Williams (1957) and bending eigenfunction expansion by Williams (1961) in the area around the crack tip, anti-plane shear crack strip, plane crack strip and bending crack strip are developed in Chapter 4 to 6, respectively. The convergence of the proposed models is generally good as shown by case studies. In Chapter 7, these crack strip models are applied to the fracture analysis of bridge structures. Based on the plane crack strip and the bending crack strip, flat shell crack strip is formed for the fracture analysis of box girder bridges. The fracture analysis of different types of bridges, such as slab bridge, continuous slab bridge, <b>single</b> - <b>cell</b> <b>box</b> girder bridge and continuous bridge with top-open box girder, are successfully conducted using these crack strips. The leading diagonal terms are replaced by large numbers to deal with those restraints in the continuous bridges. The present method, i. e., combining the spline finite strip method with the analytical solution for the area around crack tip, provides a new and efficient approach for fracture analysis of structures, especially for the fracture analysis of bridge structures...|$|R
