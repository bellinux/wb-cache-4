25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study participants were given pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E
500|$|After {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, Shaw {{increasingly}} propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw's dramas provided [...] "a pleasant means" [...] of proselytising his socialism, adding that [...] "Mr Shaw's views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays". After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911, Shaw's writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of Common <b>Sense</b> <b>About</b> the War in 1914, was to prepare a sequel, More Common <b>Sense</b> <b>About</b> the War. In this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.|$|E

So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a <b>sense,</b> <b>about</b> it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life".

500|$|Browder {{considered}} Mitchell {{to be more}} restrained {{than his}} former Farscape character John Crichton, who had higher emotional stakes and was [...] "literally going insane {{through the process of}} the series. Mitchell's focus was on his job, and on the fun of his job. But Crichton's focus was on survival, and on the creation of a family." [...] Crichton was also the center of the Farscape narrative, whereas the SG-1 characters serve as nearly equal parts in an ensemble show. Browder did not view Mitchell as a substitute for Richard Dean Anderson's role of Colonel Jack O'Neill, the undisputed SG-1 team leader from seasons 1 through 7. While O'Neill's approach was [...] "normally couched in sarcastic terms" [...] in later years, Mitchell is [...] "more optimistic and has a wry <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> him that's not so much sarcastic".|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that he had long prepared himself for {{a career as a}} football manager. He pointed out that he had absorbed all the coaching systems with any useful qualifications and had full confidence in his ability and in himself to be a leader. For him, he had done the hard work and it was simply a question of waiting for an opportunity to present itself. Shankly summed up the essential criteria for success in football management when he said: [...] "I could speak common <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> the game and I could spot a player". In spotting a player, he always applied a basic formula which was that, first and foremost, the player must have both ability and courage. Other attributes were physical fitness and willingness to work, especially to struggle against the odds.|$|E

In Greek, the root rhe translates to [...] "current or flow", and basi means [...] "bottom or foundation": thus the rheobase is the minimum current that will produce an action potential or muscle contraction.|$|E

2500|$|According to quantum mechanics, {{electromagnetic}} waves {{can also be}} viewed as streams of particles called photons. [...] When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their spin. [...] A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> its direction of travel. Circularly polarized {{electromagnetic waves}} are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand. [...] Linearly polarized waves consist of equal numbers of right and left hand spinning photons, with their phase synchronized so they superpose to give oscillation in a plane.|$|E

In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago.

2500|$|Chakraverti's public {{declaration}} {{that she was}} a [...] witch came at a time, when India still considered the word [...] "witch", taboo. Author Kumkum Bhandari said that [...] "Ipsita was a pioneer. Remember, call someone a 'witch' and you could be in for slander. Legally. But she was easily accepted. Partly because of her packaging and presentation—she is elegant, articulate and poised. People listen when she speaks. [...] Life and magic course through and around her. Being a witch is about ripping away layers of social conditioning, gender limitations and protective shields. It is, in a <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> moving towards being the complete and total woman. There is intensity, conviction and passion in the way Ipsita talks about witchcraft, or Wicca—the Craft of the Wise—and its relevance throughout history." [...] Chakraverti also observes that [...] "If I had come from a different rung of society, or was illiterate, the reaction wouldn't be the same. I have observed that it is always the person they will accept, and then the word Wicca. Witches are not born, they are made. Or perhaps they sculpt themselves." [...] According to her, every strong woman can be considered a witch. [...] "A witch is the total woman. Strong daring women who have dared to live their own life, whatever it is. Jacqueline Kennedy, Indira Gandhi, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Namita Gokhale, Kiran Bedi—all of them could count as witches." [...] Chakraverti has argued that Wicca is the first feminist movement in history and the oldest women-oriented branch of learning.|$|E
2500|$|The Union of Utrecht had {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} conscience, {{but this did}} not imply freedom of worship. Except for the Dutch Reformed Church, public worship by other denominations was usually restricted with more or less severity, and membership of the privileged church {{was supposed to be}} a prerequisite for holding public office (though this rule was often honored in the breach, even as far as Catholic office holders in the Generality Lands were concerned). This policy of supremacy of the Public Church was, however, never enforced consistently, either in the different parts of the country, or over time. In general, a policy of de facto toleration predominated, even when legal prohibitions were in force. This went against the grain of the Calvinist diehards, who constantly insisted on official suppression of competing faiths, going back to the Contra-Remonstrant controversy of 1618. Their Remonstrant opponents had come to defend religious toleration after their own suppression, and though Remonstrant regents had been ousted at the time, this political point of view remained in favor with the Holland regents, unlike their colleagues in most other provinces. The debate continued to flare up from time to time. The flap over the Holland public prayers was just one of many instances. What makes it interesting is that such debates were usually not over doctrinal matters, but in a <b>sense</b> <b>about</b> [...] "public order." [...] Also, they tended quickly to widen to debates over unsettled constitutional matters, like the provincial-supremacy claim of the Holland regents.|$|E
