40|$|Modern {{airborne}} SAR sensor systems provide geometric {{resolution in}} the order well below half a meter. By SAR interferometry from pairs of such images DEM of the same grid size can be obtained. In data of this kind many features of urban objects become visible, which were {{beyond the scope of}} radar remote sensing only a few years ago. However, because of the side-looking SAR sensor principle, layover and occlusion issues inevitably arise in undulated terrain or urban areas. Therefore, SAR data are difficult to interpret even for <b>senior</b> human <b>interpreters.</b> Furthermore, the quality of the InSAR DEM may vary significantly depending on the local topography. In order to support interpretation SAR data are often analyzed using additional complementary information provided by maps or other remote sensing imagery. In this paper a fusion of high-resolution InSAR data and one aerial image is discussed for the example of a scene containing bridges that are core elements of infrastructure. The aims are improvement of the 3 D visualization of the scene and the extraction of the main parameters of the bridges' geometry...|$|R

After its first trip in 2008, >500 volunteers participated in NPLD-GHI from the United States, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, and China by 2016. These individuals include physician anesthesiologists, obstetricians (including maternal-fetal medicine specialists), neonatologists, midwives, labor and delivery nurses, <b>senior</b> anesthesiology residents/fellows, <b>interpreters,</b> and other volunteers. More than 200 lectures have been given as part of NPLD-GHI's educational program. Participants of NPLD-GHI co-hosted weekend conferences have increased from <100 in 2008 to just under 3000 in 2016 (6 conference sites). In recent years, NPLD-GHI members have participated in up to 15 obstetric and obstetric anesthesia conferences annually. Approximately 300 attendees participate each month in each Modern L&D Virtual Lecture Hall.The 55 participating hospitals cover care for a parturient population of approximately 500,000 annually. The Obstetric Anesthesia Infrastructure Development (OAID) project was initiated at 31 hospitals in 25 cities from 2008 to 2016. The annual number of hospital sites visited increased from 1 in 2008 to 6 in 2016. Since 2014, 6 additional hospitals each year {{have participated in the}} Obstetric Anesthesia Support (OAS) project to meet the local increased demands.

R. -Canada Joint Seminar, August 21 - 23, 1990, Duluth, MinnesotaThe {{geologic}} {{histories of}} the Canadian and Baltic Shields in North America and Europe, respectively, are broadly similar, and the topic was discussed during a conference and field trip involving North American and Russian participants {{in the late summer}} of 1990. During a two-day meeting prior to the field trip, twelve North American and eleven Soviet geologists presented papers, and participants discussed a variety of problems and ideas in Precambrian stratigraphy, sedimentology, tectonics, magmatism, industrial minerals, and metallogeny. Special emphasis was placed on problems of correlation. All papers were simultaneously interpreted by <b>Senior</b> Translator and <b>Interpreter</b> Grigori Sokolov of the Institute of Geology, Karelian Branch, U. S. S. R. Academy of Sciences, who accompanied the Russian delegation. His ability contributed greatly to the meeting's success. In addition to the speakers, thirty-eight geologists attended the conference: four Canadians, two Finns, and thirty-two Americans, including eight graduate students. As a result of the seminar and field trip, exciting and promising opportunities for continued cooperation were identified. Specific proposed activities include meetings, field excursions, short courses, joint publications, individual research-oriented exchanges, and joint projects. Involvement of young geologists was especially encouraged to promote long-term cooperative relationships. Opportunities also were identified for cooperation with other international projects, such as existing bilateral programs and the International Geological Correlation Program. It was mutually agreed that in 1991 - 1992, the Institute of Geology, Karelian Research Center, and the Kola Research Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences will host conferences and field trips on Proterozoic and Archean geology and metallogeny in the eastern Baltic shield. In 1991, the field program will emphasize Proterozoic geology, and in 1992, Archean geology. Other joint activities in the future will depend on the outcome of the 1991 and 1992 meetings. It was the intent of the organizers to bring this joint activity to the attention of officials involved in relevant international programs. Toward that end this proceedings volume has been published by the Minnesota Geological Survey. The body of this report consists of two parts; the first is a series of short papers that provide an overview of the Precambrian geology in the Great Lakes Region; the second part consists of a similar overview of {{the eastern part of the}} Baltic Shield.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} study devised and tested {{a series of}} psychometric tests to facilitate selection of simultaneous and consecutive interpreter-trainee candidates. Twelve tests, based either on text materials, linguistic subskills or speed-stress, were correlated with judges' ratings of the final interpretation examination. Students who passed the exam had higher mean scores on all tests than those who failed. Test scores were positively inter-correlated between completion-detection tests and simultaneous interpretation ratings and between recall tests and consecutive examination ratings. Text-based tests were more predictive than subskills or speed-stress tests. The relationship between test type and interpreting is discussed together with possible reasons underlying differential performance on tests of the same kind. Problems in the recruitment and training of conference interpreters have been the frequent subject of debate {{by members of the}} profession (Keiser 1978; Longley 1978; Namy 1978). Although there have been some publications on psychological and other theoretical aspects of the interpreter's skills (Barik 1973; Gerver 1976; Seleskovitch 1976; Karmiloff-Smith 1978; Moser 1978; Chernov 1979; Lambert 1983), there has been no systematic research on student selection and training in this field. What qualities and skills are required for success as an interpreter or as a trainee in the field? Although no previous empirical research has been carried out on this subject, there does appear to be some consensus among interpreters and teachers of interpreting as to the skills and qualities sought in new members of the profession. A survey of articles written by members of the profession, as well as transcripts of interviews with working interpreters, suggested some agreement of the following as being essential for success as a trainee or in the profession. 1. Profound knowledge of active and passive languages and cultures. 2. Ability to grasp rapidly and convey the essential meaning of what is being said. 3. Ability to project information with confidence, coupled with a good voice. 4. Wide general knowledge and interests, and a willingness to acquire new information. 5. Ability to work {{as a member of a}} team. The specific aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate objective tests to assess the second item mentioned above, that is the candidate's ability to grasp rapidly and to convey the meaning of spoken discourse. It was expected that the tests would contribute to improving selection procedures, hence the number of students passing the final examination, as well as the course itself. The present study arose from the decision of Patricia Longley, one of the co-authors and former director of the Interpretation Programme at the Polytechnic of Central London, to initiate the establishment of objective criteria for the selection of students for the postgraduate course in conference interpreting techniques at the School of Languages in London. The course, founded by Patricia Longley in 1963, and now headed by Jennifer MacKintosh, is an intensive six-month course in simultaneous and consecutive interpretation. Over 200 applications are received each year from candidates throughout the world, about half of whom are invited to London for interviews and informal tests, lasting a day. Only 25 to 30 candidates are selected for the course. The informal tests consist of written translation tests in addition to tests of both aural and oral language skills in the candidates' other languages. During the tests, candidates are first asked to repeat texts in the source language (shadowing) before progressing to interpretation of texts from their passive languages into their active language. These texts progress from simple sentences to more complex, albeit non-technical, longer passages. Unusual and unexpected phrases are inserted into the more difficult passages for interpretation in order to assess candidates' skills in coping with the unexpected and with passages which cannot be translated word-for-word. The interviews are designed to assess candidates' general background knowledge and interests, motivation, presentation of self, and general suitability for the profession. Whether or not there is a current market for the candidate's particular language combination is also taken into account at the time of selection. The intensive, six-month course involves training in both simultaneous and consecutive interpretation, and in the note-taking skills essential to the latter form of interpreting, in conference practices, and in a variety of subjects likely to be encountered in conference settings. The final examinations are oral in both forms of interpretation in the candidate's principal working languages, and are conducted by a board of external examiners who are themselves <b>senior</b> practising <b>interpreters</b> in major international organizations such as the U. N., Council of Europe, I. L. O., and the W. H. O. A secondary aim of the study was to explore alternative types of tests. Since the task of the interpreter is to transform spoken textual information from one language into another, either immediately (for simultaneous interpretation) or after some delay (for consecutive interpretation), the first type of test - termed text-based - assumed the processing of connected discourse to be a crucial feature of the interpreter's task. The approach was based on recent work in the area of text processing (Kintsch 1974; MacKintosh 1985). Text-based tests required either the recall of the information presented or the completion of individual target words in the text. The second type of test - termed subskill-based - assumed language subskills such as synonym generation, sentence re-expression and vocabulary selection to be an adequate reflection of the interpreter's task. The approach was based on the development of a set of factor referenced cognitive tests of verbal ability (Eckstrom et al. 1976). In addition, both simultaneous and consecutive interpretation are performed under conditions of speed-stress, since the interpreter is paced by the speaker over whom he has little or no control. Hence, the third type of test - termed stress-based-assumed speed stress to be a general performance factor not particular to, but exemplified by, interpreting. The approach was based on the development of a speed test requiring the solution of problems involving letter series performed under a time constraint (Furneaux 1956). It was expected that the present research would throw some light on whether text-based, subskill-based or speed stress-based tests reflected the crucial features of the interpreter's task for the purpose of testing trainee candidates' abilities...|$|R
