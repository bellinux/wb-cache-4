50|$|One study interviewed 18,572 respondents, aged 18 and over, about 15 phobic {{symptoms}}. These symptoms {{would yield}} diagnoses based on criteria for agoraphobia, social phobia, and <b>simple</b> <b>phobia.</b> Women {{had significantly higher}} prevalence rates of agoraphobia and simple phobia; however, {{there were no differences}} found between men and women in social phobia. The most common phobias for both women and men involved spiders, bugs, mice, snakes, and heights. The biggest {{differences between men and women}} in these disorders were found on the agoraphobic symptoms of “going out of the house alone” and “being alone”, and on two simple phobic symptoms, involving the fear of “any harmless or dangerous animal” and “storms,” with relatively more women having both phobias. There were no differences in the age of onset, reporting a fear on the phobic level, telling a doctor about symptoms, or the recall of past symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Play {{has been}} {{recognized}} as important {{since the time of}} Plato (429-347 B.C.) who reportedly observed, “you can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.” In the eighteenth century Rousseau (1712-1778), in his book ‘Emile’ wrote about the importance of observing play as a vehicle to learn about and understand children. Friedrich Fröbel, in his book The Education of Man (1903), emphasized the importance of symbolism in play. He observed, “play is the highest development in childhood, for it alone is the free expression of what is in the child’s soul…. children’s play is not mere sport. It is full of meaning and import.” (Fröbel, 1903, p. 22) The first documented case, describing the therapeutic use of play, was in 1909 when Sigmund Freud published his work with “Little Hans.” Little Hans was a five-year-old child who was suffering from a <b>simple</b> <b>phobia.</b> Freud saw him once briefly and recommended that his father take note of Hans’ play to provide insights that might assist the child. The case of “Little Hans” was the first case in which a child’s difficulty was related to emotional factors.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>simple</b> <b>phobia</b> is a {{residual}} category in DSM-III, clinical experience suggests {{at least four}} subtypes of this group.

Significant sex differences were observed; all animal and insect phobics and seven of eight choking-vomit phobics were female, while the other two groups showed approximately equal numbers of males and females. Mean age of onset was significantly older for situational phobics than animal-insect or blood-injury phobics; choking-vomit probands were intermediate. Frequency of situational phobias differed significantly among relatives of the four proband groups, with highest frequency being found among situational probands. Thus, these clinical and epidemiological variables support the separation of <b>simple</b> <b>phobia</b> into at least these four diagnostic groups...|$|E

50|$|The {{inclusion}} of “blood-injury phobia” within {{the category of}} specific or <b>simple</b> <b>phobias</b> in classificatory systems reflects a perception that fear has a primary role in the disorder.

Kendler, Neale, Kessler, Heath, and Eaves (1992) have argued from data comparing monozygotic with dizygotic twins that the genetic factor common to all phobias (agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias), strongly predisposes a person to specific phobias.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the prevalence of alcohol abuse and/or dependence {{in a sample of}} patients with anxiety disorders gathered from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study. Prior research had indicated that anxiety disorders are prevalent among alcoholics and also that alcoholism is prevalent among samples of anxiety disorder patients. The sample included 2471 individuals who met a lifetime diagnosis of agoraphobia, panic disorder, agoraphobia with panic attacks, social phobia, <b>simple</b> <b>phobia,</b> or obsessive-compulsive disorder. About 12 % of these individuals met criteria for a lifetime history of alcohol abuse and/or dependence. Relative odds ratios were calculated for the risk of alcohol use disorder, correcting for the effects of site, age, race, and gender. Among those individuals with a history of both anxiety and alcoholism disorders, the highest risk of alcohol use disorder was found in the agoraphobia with panic group. Lowest risk was found among those with a single diagnosis of <b>simple</b> <b>phobia</b> or agoraphobia without panic attacks. Clinical implications of these results are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Based {{primarily}} on studies that employ Pavlovian fear conditioning, extinction of conditioned fear {{has been found}} to be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. This led to the discovery that an NMDA partial agonist, D-cycloserine, could facilitate fear extinction when given systemically or locally into the amygdala. Because many forms of cognitive behavioral therapy depend on fear extinction, this led to the successful use of D-cycloserine as an adjunct to psychotherapy in patients with so-called <b>simple</b> <b>phobias</b> (fear of heights), social phobia, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and panic disorder. Data in support of these conclusions are reviewed, along with some of the possible limitations of D-cycloserine as an adjunct to psychotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{estimate}} the disease burden due to 15 mental disorders at {{both individual and}} population level. Methods: Using a population-based survey (Nemesis, N = 7, 056) {{the number of years}} lived with disability per one million population were assessed. This was done with and without adjustment for comorbidity. Results: At individual level, major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, eating disorder and schizophrenia are the disorders most markedly associated with health-related quality of life decrement. However, at population level, the number of affected people and {{the amount of time spent}} in an adverse health state become strong drivers of population ill-health. <b>Simple</b> <b>phobia,</b> social phobia, depression, dysthymia and alcohol dependence emerged as public health priorities. Conclusions: From a clinical perspective, we tend to give priority to the disorders that exact a heavy toll on individuals. This puts the spotlight on disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, from a public health perspective, disorders such as <b>simple</b> <b>phobia,</b> social phobia and dysthymia - which are highly prevalent and tend to run a chronic course - are identified as leading causes of population ill-health, and thus, emerge as public health priorities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|Self-help materials, brief therapies, and {{treatments}} involving minimal therapist contact {{have all been}} proposed as effective and low-cost interventions for anxiety disorders.

It is therefore unclear how much therapist contact is necessary for a positive anxiety disorder treatment outcome. The present article reviews the literature on anxiety disorder treatments using self-help, self-administered, and decreased therapist-contact interventions.

40|$|Objective: Gender {{differences}} {{exist in the}} prevalence and psychiatric comorbidity of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study investigates whether familiality of MDD contributes to observed gender differences in comorbidity. Method: Familial (f-MDD) and non-familial (nf-MDD) MDD cases from a population sample were assessed for comorbid dysthymia, anxiety disorders and alcohol-related disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Logistic regression analyses were performed to {{examine the effect of}} f-MDD on gender differences in comorbidity, adjusted for confounders. Results: Women with f-MDD reported significantly more comorbid dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) than their male counterparts; women with nf-MDD reported significantly more comorbid <b>simple</b> <b>phobias</b> and agoraphobia than their male counterparts. Gender differences in comorbid panic disorder and alcohol-related disorders occurred independently of the familial load. Adjustment for age of onset, severity and recurrence of MDD did not change these results. Conclusion: Models to explain comorbidity patterns of MDD differ by gender.

40|$|Introduction: Depression {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} {{have been found}} to be highly comorbid in epidemiologic studies. Furthermore, the presence of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5 HTT) has been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, as well as personality disorders. Aims: To examine the association of the 5 HTT and the risk of prevalence and comorbidity for, Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, as well as several anxiety disorders in a sample of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey Follow-up Study. Methods: We estimated lifetime prevalence and the risk of comorbidity for Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Phobia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, <b>Simple</b> <b>Phobia,</b> Dysthymic Disorder. All subjects were evaluated by a psychiatrist using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. In addition, we assessed the impact of the carrier status into the prevalence and comorbidity estimates of the aforementioned disorders. Results: A significant association was found between an increased risk for the lifetime prevalence of Panic Disorder and the 5 -HTT “s” polymorphism (OR (95 % CI) : 3. 10 (1. 33; 7. 27). A higher risk for lifetime prevalence of Panic Disorder and the 5 -HTT “s” polymorphism was found in women carriers as compared to men(OR (95 % CI) : 3. 54 (1. 41; 8. 91)). Panic Disorder had significant comorbidities with Alcohol Dependence, Alcohol Abuse, MDD, Bipolar Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Phobia, OCD, <b>Simple</b> <b>Phobia</b> and Adjustment Disorder. These associations were higher in women as compared to men carriers. Comorbidities for <b>Simple</b> <b>Phobia</b> were highly significant in males for most anxiety disorders and MDD. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of comorbidity amongst most of the anxiety disorders in this population.

40|$|Background. Self-reported {{psychiatric}} {{status of}} Australian Vietnam war veterans was determined 20 - 25 {{years after the}} war and its relation to combat was investigated. Method. A simple random sample of Australian Army Vietnam veterans was interviewed nationally using standardized interviews and self-completion tests to assess the prevalence of lifetime and current psychiatric illness and its relationship to combat. Army records were used to extract data on the cohort for use in regression-based adjustment for non-response. Results. The conditions mainly affecting the Australian veterans were alcohol abuse or dependence, post-traumatic stress disorder, somatoform pain disorder and social and <b>simple</b> <b>phobias.</b> This profile is different from American studies of Vietnam veterans. All lifetime and 6 -month recent disorders except depressive illness, melancholia, pathological gambling and somatizatlon disorder were significantly related to combat exposure but not with posting to a combat unit. Less than half of the current one-month diagnoses were related to combat, possibly because of low power conferred by the relative rarity of these conditions. Conclusions. The results confirm a range of psychological problems in former warriors may linger 20 or more years from their war exposure and may be directly affected by exposure to war trauma...|$|R
40|$|That {{patients}} with panic disorder exhibit an attentional bias towards physical threat has been inferred from {{their responses to}} such words in modified Stroop paradigms. The present study investigated selective attention to physical cues directly. Subjects were given a mild electrical shock to one ring finger followed by a target stimulus (vibration of one index finger) applied to either the same or the other hand. An attentional bias index was calculated by subtracting mean reaction times in trials in which the neutral target and the electrical stimulus were applied to the same hand from those trials in which both stimuli were applied to different hands. Sixty-one {{patients with}} panic disorder, 45 subjects with infrequent spontaneous panic attacks, 24 patients with specific phobias, and 40 normal controls participated in the study. Consistent with our hypothesis, subjects with spontaneous panic attacks, but not normal controls, shifted their attention toward the threatening stimulus. There {{was no difference between}} panic disorder patients and infrequent panickers. Selective attention to physical threat could increase the probability that anxiety is triggered or that it escalates during panic attacks. Patients with <b>simple</b> <b>phobias</b> showed the same response pattern as panickers.

40|$|Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} caused by a hemizygous deletion of around 28 genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7 q 11. 23), characterized by a unique spectrum of behavioral impairments, including mental retardation, deficits in visuospatial constructive cognition, hypersociability, anxiety and <b>simple</b> <b>phobias.</b> Physical characteristics include dysmorphic faces, short stature, oculomotor deficits, gross and fine coordination impairments, diminished control of balance and mild extrapyramidal signs as well as gait abnormalities resembling gait hypokinesia. Genes near the distal deletion breakpoint appear to contribute most to the WBS cognitive and behavioral profile and include the GTF family of transcription factors: GTF 2 I, GTF 2 IRD 1, GTF 2 IRD 2. We have previously shown that heterozygous deletions of GTF 2 IRD 1 in humans and homozygous deletion in mice contributes to craniofacial abnormalities. Here we show an important role of this gene in motor coordination and anxiety ascertained from extensive behavioral mouse phenotyping. Gtf 2 ird 1 null mice showed lower body weight, decreased spontaneous and circadian locomotor activity, diminished motor coordination and strength, gait abnormalities, increased anxiety and an elevated endocrinological response to stress. Gtf 2 ird 1 heterozygous mice displayed lower body weight and decreased circadian activity, but only minor motor coordination and anxiety-related behavioral dysfunctions. Our study strongly supports a role for GTF 2 IRD 1 in the motoric and anxiety-related abnormalities seen in Williams-Beuren syndrome, and suggests basal ganglia and potentially cerebellar abnormalities in Gtf 2 ird 1 mice...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In a {{relatively}} small number of previous studies, childhood abuse has been found to be associated with more severe symptom course, earlier onset, greater comorbidity, and greater suicidality in those diagnosed with bipolar disorder. There have been no prior reports looking for any association between childhood abuse and cognitive style. This study aimed to examine the relationship between cognitive factors, such as response styles to depressed mood and dysfunctional attitudes, clinical features, and childhood physical and sexual abuse in this population. Methods: A total of 157 adult participants diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder I or II were assessed on clinical features of this condition and measures of childhood sexual and physical abuse. Participants also completed self-report questionnaires covering areas such as symptom measures of depression, anxiety and stress, dysfunctional attitudes, and response styles to depressed mood. Results: Seventy-four participants (37 %) reported having experienced either sexual or physical abuse. Those who reported physical or sexual abuse were significantly more likely to report self-harm or suicidal behaviors and showed higher stress scores. Specifically, those who reported sexual abuse were more likely to have <b>simple</b> <b>phobias,</b> to have attempted suicide, and to have had more hospitalizations for depression. After controlling for current mood severity, there were no significant differences on the self-report cognitive style measures for those who reported childhood sexual or physical abuse compared to those who did not report abuse. Conclusions: Cognitive styles were not found to be associated with childhood sexual or physical abuse in participants with bipolar disorder. Stress may be important to target in psychological interventions, whilst special attention should also be paid to those with a history of sexual abuse given the greater likelihood of suicide attempt. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Diagnostic {{criteria}} and nosological boundaries of juvenile dysthymic disorder (DD) are under-researched. Two {{different sets of}} diagnostic criteria are still discussed in the DSM-IV, the first giving major weight to somatic and vegetative symptoms and the second, included in the appendix, to more affective and cognitive symptoms. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe prototypical symptomatology and comorbidity of DD, according to DSM-IV criteria, in a consecutive series of referred children and adolescents, as a function of age and sex. Method: One hundred inpatients and outpatients (36 children and 64 adolescents, 57 males, 43 females, age range 7 to 18 years, mean age 13. 3 years) received a diagnosis of DD without comorbid major depressive disor-der (MDD), using historical information, the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R), and symptoms ratings according to the DSM-IV criteria. Results: Irritability, low self-esteem, fatigue or loss of energy, depressed mood, guilt, concentration difficulties, anhedonia, and hopelessness were present in more than 50 % of subjects. Differences in symptomatic profile be-tween male and female patients were not significant. Anxiety disorders were commonly comorbid with DD, mainly generalized anxiety disorder, <b>simple</b> <b>phobias,</b> and in prepuberal children, separation anxiety disorder. Externalizing disorders were reported in 35 % of the patients, with higher prevalence in male patients. Adoles-cents showed more suicidal thoughts and anhedonia than children. Conclusions: The clinical picture of early-onset DD we found, based entirely on a pure sample without current and past MDD, is not totally congruent with the diagnostic criteria according to DSM-IV. A more precise defini-tion of the clinical picture may help early diagnosis and prevention of superimposed mental disorders.
