2500|$|The [...] "wiped off the map" [...] {{translation}} {{originated from}} the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency. This translation's {{use in the}} media has been criticized. Arash Norouzi, artist and co-founder of The Mossadegh Project, said that the statement [...] "wiped off the map" [...] {{did not exist in}} the original speech and that Ahmadinejad directed his comment toward the [...] "regime occupying Jerusalem". Norouzi's translation of the Persian quote reads; [...] "the Imam said this regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time." [...] Juan Cole, historian of the Middle East and South Asia, concured, writing that Ahmadinejad's statement should be translated as, [...] "the Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods, [...] ) must [...] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad, [...] )," [...] noting that there is no Persian idiom to wipe <b>something</b> <b>off</b> the map. The key phrase here Safheh-ye ruzgar (pages of time/of history) was itself a slight variation on Ayatollah Khomeini's words, which Ahmadinejad was quoting, the Ayatollah having spoken of sahneh ruzgar (scene of time). In both cases, the allusion is to time, not to a place. No one noted the slight variation or context and the incorrect interpretation it referred to the destruction of Israel was maintained. [...] Shiraz Dossa, a professor of Political Science at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada, also described the text as a mistranslation.|$|E

Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?" [...] Doug Davidson stated that Paul harbored possible guilt in regards to Ricky's upbringing, having been raised by his grandparents. Lauralee Bell spoke about the love triangle between Paul, Christine and Isabella {{and what kind of}} twists would occur through Ricky returning.
