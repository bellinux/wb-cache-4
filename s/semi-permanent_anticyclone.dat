50|$|In {{the region}} called the Horse {{latitude}}s, between 30 and 35 degrees of latitude North or South, {{there is a}} series of <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>anticyclones</b> on the downward side of the Hadley cell of the general atmospheric circulation. The thermal contrasts over oceanic waters leads to the formation of theses centers of action as a direct convective circulation is established between the equator and higher latitudes in a very weak Coriolis force zone. The Azores/Bermuda High is found in this zone.|$|R
5|$|The north–south {{orientation}} of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52°S, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast. Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low pressure zone, meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong, since south of 40°S there is little land to block these winds. Because Patagonia is located between the <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>anticyclones</b> of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30°S, and the Subpolar Low at around 60°S, {{the movement of the}} high and low pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern.|$|R
50|$|The Mediterranean {{climate is}} characterised by dry summers and mild, rainy winters. They are {{generally}} {{located on the}} western sides of continents, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees {{north and south of}} the Equator. Mediterranean climate zones are typically associated with the five large subtropical high-pressure belts of the oceans: the Azores High, South Atlantic High, North Pacific High, South Pacific High, and Indian Ocean High. These high-pressure belts, called anticyclones, rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Anticyclones cause air in the surrounding atmosphere to diverge and descend, sinking the air in opposing directions until there are no clouds present; leaving clear skies. Climatological high-pressure anticyclones migrate by latitude according to the direct angle of the Sun, shifting northward in the summer and toward the equator in the winter. These <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>anticyclones</b> {{play a major role in}} the formation of the world's subtropical and tropical deserts as well as the rainless summers associated with the Mediterranean climate.|$|R
50|$|The North Pacific High is a <b>semi-permanent,</b> {{subtropical}} <b>anticyclone</b> {{located in}} the northeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean, located northeast of Hawaii and west of California. It is strongest during the northern hemisphere summer and shifts towards the equator during the winter, when the Aleutian Low becomes more active. It is responsible for California's typically dry summer and fall and typically wet winter and spring, as well as Hawaii's year-round trade winds.|$|R
40|$|The summer (Oct-Mar) {{rainfall}} in Central-West Argentina (CWA) shows a clear interannual variability modulated by low-frequency oscillations. This determines {{periods of}} {{wet and dry}} summers that change from a quasi- 18 -year cycle toward lower frequencies after mid- 1970 s. Therefore the period 1959 - 1998 was divided into 1959 - 1977 and 1978 - 1998 subperiods in order to analyse the relationship between dry and wet extremes and the atmospheric circulation. Extreme events were defined using the first and fourth quartile of the regional summer index for the whole period. The composite shows large spatial variability between dry and wet extremes and between the subperiods. The result with Delware University precipitation database show similar spatial features and let relate CWA anomalies {{to other parts of}} the continent. By means of compositions of extreme summers using NCEP-NCAR reanalysis I information, the anomalies of 850, 500 and 200 hPa geopotential heights and 400 hPa omega, 200 hPa divergence, 850 hPa vector wind (V) and 850 hPa specific humidity (Q) are estimated for each subperiod. For 1959 - 1977, the wet (dry) extreme are significantly related to anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomaly in mid-to-high latitudes centred at about 500 S- 600 W, observed in the whole troposphere with baroclinic conditions. The relative weakening (strengthening) of the Pacific and Atlantic southern <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>anticyclones</b> produce in mid-troposphere of leading trough (ridge) conditions. It is associated with significant upward (downward) air mass motions over CWA as shown by 400 omega. At 200 hPa, it is manifested as a significant divergence (convergence) over the area. Compositions of Q and V at 850 hPa show that anticyclonic anomalies in mid-latitudes, south of the 300 S, produce anomalous south-eastern winds from the South Atlantic toward the CWA together with positive anomalies of Q for wet extreme. Conversely, for dry extreme the cyclonic anomalies lead to south-western wind anomalies and negative Q anomalies due to air-masses lifted and dried in the Patagonian Andes. After 1977, the conditions for wet and dry extreme are not exactly opposite, and the geopotential anomalies are significant for middle-to-tropical latitudes. Q and V anomalies at 850 hPa suggest a meridional humidity transport intensified from the north during wet extremes while in turn, trades are intensified in the continent. During the dry summer the trades are weakened, the V anomalies are from the south and east over CWA and negative Q anomalies predominate. These results suggest a possible change in the teleconnection between summer rainfall and the atmospheric dynamic from middle to subtropical latitudes by mid- 1970 s [...] Pages: 1439 - 145...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{transport}} {{over the}} Pacific Basin is described during NASA's Transport and Chemical Evolution Over the Pacific Experiment (TRACE-P) that was conducted between February - April 2001. The mission included extensive chemical sampling from two aircraft based primarily in Hong Kong and Yokota Air Base, Japan. Meteorological conditions during TRACE-P changed rapidly {{due to the}} seasonal winter/spring transition and the decay of prolonged ENSO cold phase (La Nina) conditions. To document these changes, TRACE-P was divided into two halves, and mean flow patterns during each half are presented and discussed. Important circulation features are the <b>semi-permanent</b> Siberian <b>anticyclone</b> and transient middle latitude cyclones that form near eastern Asia and then move eastward over the northern Pacific. Five-day backward trajectories from the various flight tracks show that air sampled by the aircraft had been transported {{from a variety of}} locations. Some parcels remained over the tropical western North Pacific during the entire period, while other important origins were Southeast Asia, Africa, and central Asia. Patterns of satellite-derived precipitation and lightning are described. TRACE-P occurs during a neutral to weak La Nina period of relatively cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific. Compared to climatology, the TRACE-P period exhibits deep convection located west of its typical position; however, tropospheric flow patterns do not exhibit a strong La Nina signal. Circulation patterns during TRACE-P are found to be generally similar to those during NASA's PEM WEST-B mission that occurred in the same region during February - March 1994...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} major outflow {{pathways}} for North American pollution to the Atlantic in summer by conducting a 4 -year simulation with the GEOS-CHEM global chemical transport model, including a coupled ozone-aerosol simulation with 1 # # horizontal resolution for summer 2000. The outflow is driven principally by cyclones tracking eastward across North America at 45 - 55 # N, every 5 days on average during 2000. The cold fronts {{associated with these}} cyclones sweep across the northeastern United States, and the warm conveyor belts (WCBs) ahead of the fronts lift U. S. pollution to the upper troposphere on a northeastward track toward Newfoundland. Anthropogenic and fire effluents from western North America are mostly transported north and east, eventually merging with the eastern U. S. pollution outflow to the Atlantic. The WCBs typically do not reach the southeastern United States unless associated with occasional Atlantic cyclones originating along the east coast (only three in 2000). Deep convection is a more important pathway for ventilation of the southeastern and central United States. A <b>semi-permanent</b> upper-level <b>anticyclone</b> traps the convective outflow and allows it to age in the upper troposphere over the United States for several days. Rapid ozone production takes place in this outflow driven in part by anthropogenic and lightning NO x, and in part by HO x radicals produced from convectively lifted CH 2 O that originates from biogenic isoprene. This mechanism could explain ozonesonde observations of elevated ozone in the upper troposphere over the southeastern United States. Asian and European pollution influences in the North American outflow to the Atlantic {{are found to be}} dispersed into the background and do not generate distinct plumes.

5000|$|The {{region of}} Cuyo has an arid climate or a {{semi-arid}} climate {{with an average}} annual precipitation of about 100 to 500 mm that is generally unreliable from year to year. The region, which encompasses {{a wide range of}} latitudes combined with altitudes ranging from 500 m to nearly 7,000 m means that it has a diverse range of different climates. In general, most of the region has a temperate climate with higher altitude valleys having a more milder climate. At the highest altitudes (over 4,000 m), icy conditions persist year round. [...] The diurnal range is very large with very hot temperatures during the day followed by cold nights. Amongst all locations in Argentina, the region has the largest diurnal range in the country with areas in San Juan Province having a diurnal range exceeding [...] The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, while its latitude puts it in a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping this region dry. With very low humidity, abundant sunshine throughout the year, and a temperate climate, the region is suitable for wine production. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region is influenced by the subtropical, <b>semi-permanent</b> South Atlantic <b>anticyclone</b> to the east in the Atlantic, the <b>semi-permanent</b> South Pacific <b>anticyclone</b> {{to the west of the}} Andes, the development of a low pressure system ("Chaco low") over northern Argentina and westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer, when hot temperatures and high insolation lead to the development of a low pressure system ("Chaco low") situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic anticyclone to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region, favouring precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms. More than 85% of the annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which represents the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry due to these systems weakening, and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco low over northern Argentina. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. As such, most of Mendoza province and San Juan province receive the lowest annual precipitation with mean summer precipitation averaging less than 100 mm and in rare cases, no summer rainfall. Further eastwards in San Luis province, mean summer rainfall averages around 500 mm and can exceed 700 mm in some areas. Higher altitude locations receive precipitation in the form of snow during the winter months. In the Cuyo region, annual precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4-5, 6-8, and 16-22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic anticyclone are stronger, which causes more moisture towards this region while during the dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Wind data over Cape Columbine is {{investigated}} over a 38 {{year long}} time series {{to determine whether}} there are noticeable changes or variability through time. The long period dataset is collected using an Automatic Weather Station. Diurnal and seasonal to annual characterizations of wind together with occurrences of related events are established. Other linkages with synoptic to near-global (e. g., ENSO) scale circulations are investigated by examining relationships with other meteorological variables. This is achieved by complimenting long term data series with data from the new technologically advanced Automatic Weather Station (AWS). From the new AWS, several relationships and connections between different atmospheric variables were developed. These include the relationship between Air Temperature and Humidity, Wind Speed and Atmospheric Pressure, and Wind Direction and Rainfall. The AWS is able to monitor the passage of synoptic (e. g., cold fronts) and mesoscale (e. g., coastal low) weather systems. Passages of cold fronts over time could easily be detected by utilizing all the different variables as recorded by the AWS (Air Temperature, Wind Speed and Direction, Relative Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure and Rainfall). The most significant atmospheric system that passed over Cape Columbine over the 2009 / 10 summer was a deep low pressure system, where a significant amount of rainfall, atmospheric pressure depression and drop in temperature were witnessed. There were 17 upwelling events during this six months study period. Several of them were short-lived at 4 to 6 day durations, and the longest upwelling event occurred on the 24 th December 2009 and lasted until January 14 th 2010. An investigation into the variability in characteristics and behavior of wind signals at Cape Columbine was conducted. The study investigated wind behavior for the period 1957 to 1995 with data collected from a point source Automatic Weather Station. Apart from the characteristics of wind over time period, linkages with large scale circulations, frequency and duration of these wind events occurrences were studied. These were achieved by partitioning the study period into different time scales; namely, the diurnal, seasonal, inter-annual and the decadal. On the diurnal time scale, a strong variability in wind strength over the course of each day due to the land/sea breeze existed. Seasonally, the wind regime in Cape Columbine was found to be driven by the latitudinal shifting of the <b>semi-permanent</b> South Atlantic <b>Anticyclone.</b> However, there are pre-dominant southerly winds throughout the year. The long record showed the possible influence of ENSO and the Benguela Niño on interannual and decadal variations in the winds at Cape Columbine...|$|R
