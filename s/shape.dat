5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its <b>shape</b> {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final <b>shape</b> of the star after star formation is an equilibrium <b>shape,</b> {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical <b>shape.</b> The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given <b>shape,</b> and assert that it uniquely determines the <b>shape</b> and is robust against small {{variations in the}} <b>shape.</b> They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale <b>shape</b> differences.|$|E
5|$|Fort Manoel {{is built}} in the <b>shape</b> of a square, with a {{pentagonal}} bastion on each corner, giving it the <b>shape</b> of a star fort. The four bastions are called St. Helen, St. Anthony, St. John and Notre Dame Bastions.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of traffic <b>shaping</b> is application-based traffic <b>shaping.</b> In application-based traffic <b>shaping,</b> {{fingerprinting}} tools are first used to identify applications of interest, which are then subject to <b>shaping</b> policies. Some controversial cases of application-based traffic <b>shaping</b> include bandwidth throttling of peer-to-peer file sharing traffic. Many application protocols use encryption to circumvent application-based traffic <b>shaping.</b> Another type of traffic <b>shaping</b> is route-based traffic <b>shaping.</b> Route-based traffic <b>shaping</b> is conducted based on previous-hop or next-hop information.|$|R
5|$|Gravity {{tends to}} {{contract}} celestial bodies into a perfect sphere, the <b>shape</b> {{where all the}} mass {{is as close to}} the center of gravity as possible. But a rotating star is not spherical in <b>shape,</b> it has an equatorial bulge.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous <b>shape.</b> Their curvilinear <b>shape</b> is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E
5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its <b>shape</b> {{combines}} a sharp point to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the <b>shape</b> are usable, {{it is easier to}} orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E
50|$|Chairs, ladders {{and other}} <b>shapes</b> made from living trees are some {{examples}} of tree <b>shaping.</b> Some types of tree <b>shaping</b> involve horticultural practices such as weaving, grafting, training, and/or <b>shaping</b> young, living trees into desired <b>shapes.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{revealed}} that, among Egyptians, line <b>shaped</b> rugae {{were the most}} frequent followed by curve <b>shaped</b> rugae and sinous <b>shaped</b> rugae respectively. In Malaysians, these three types were the most frequent rugae patterns. Curve <b>shaped</b> rugae were the most common followed by sinous <b>shaped</b> rugae and lastly, line <b>shaped</b> rugae.|$|R
5|$|<b>Shape</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category.

5|$|The pair's latest book, The Body <b>Shape</b> Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The Body <b>Shape</b> Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which <b>shape</b> they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual <b>shape.</b> A few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E
30|$|The median {{values for}} line <b>shaped</b> rugae, curve <b>shaped</b> rugae, and sinous <b>shaped</b> rugae were 5, 2, 2 and 6, 3, 3 rugae in the Egyptian males and Egyptian females {{respectively}} {{for the three}} rugae types. Concerning Malaysians, the median values for line <b>shaped,</b> curve <b>shaped</b> and sinous <b>shaped</b> rugae were 4, 4, 3 and 3, 4, 3 in the males and females respectively.|$|R

5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is ribbed and riveted in the <b>shape</b> of sunbeams, with many triangular windows.

5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/19th and 2/20th Battalions, it was {{assigned}} to the 22nd Brigade, which formed part of the 8th Division. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over green, in a diamond <b>shape,</b> although a border of gray in an oval <b>shape</b> was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval <b>shape</b> designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E

30|$|As {{demonstrated}} in Table 1, line <b>shaped</b> rugae {{were the most}} frequent (31.47 %) in Malaysians males, followed by curve <b>shaped</b> rugae (30.46 %) and sinous <b>shaped</b> rugae (26.90 %). Malaysian females possessed the same three patterns but in different orders. These patterns were sinous <b>shaped</b> (29.93 %), curve <b>shaped</b> (29.44 %) and line <b>shaped</b> rugae (27.25 %) arranged from the highest to the lowest. The median value of line <b>shaped</b> rugae respecting line <b>shaped</b> rugae was 4 in the males and 3 rugae in the females. Complex <b>shaped</b> rugae were similarly distributed among males and females as there were (8.89 %) in the males and (9 %) in females. The median values were the same in both rugae types.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's <b>shape</b> to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its <b>shape,</b> assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current <b>shape</b> also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|More formally, a {{tessellation}} or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric <b>shape</b> {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a tessellation, the <b>shape</b> is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given <b>shape</b> tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given <b>shape</b> can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E
