5000|$|Tying a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> is done {{inside the}} body or outside the body. Learning to tie a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> {{inside the body}} is {{slightly}} more difficult and has a steeper learning curve. This is because the surgeon uses laparoscopic instruments. Tying the knot outside the body is simpler for most because the suturing is with fingers as in traditional tying. When a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> is formed outside the body it must be drawn into a laparoscopic cannula. Stronger braided suturing thread is preferred because the knot {{has a tendency to}} fray as it is slid down the cannula. At the end of the running suture line, clips can be placed across the suture tail. Barbed suture is a knotless surgical suture that has a pattern of barbs on its surface [...] These barbs lock the suture into the tissue, eliminating the tying of knots. Barbed sutures are typically used in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. There are concerns that knot tying may be related to glove puncture but a current study demonstrated that instead friction from continuous suturing only left ‘marks’ on the little finger with no glove puncture.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> is a disposable clip that is placed {{at the end of}} the suture to keep stitches secure. A hemoclip is a titanium V-shaped clip with extensions that are squeezed together during application. The clips are available in various sizes and were originally designed to compress vessels for hemostasis.|$|E
50|$|The surgeon's knot is a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> and is {{a simple}} {{modification}} to the reef knot. It adds an extra twist when tying the first throw, forming a double overhand knot. The additional turn provides more friction and can reduce loosening while {{the second half of}} the knot is tied. This knot is commonly used by surgeons in situations where it is important to maintain tension on a suture, giving it its name.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of double gloving versus single gloving {{was made with}} regard to its effects on tactile discrimination and dexterity in 17 surgeons of all grades and specialties. Surgeons were assessed by their ability to tie <b>surgical</b> <b>knots,</b> and Dellon's moving two-point discrimination test. Tests were performed single gloved, double gloved with the larger glove on the outside, and double gloved with the larger glove on the inside. Double gloving did not alter two-point discrimination {{or the ability to}} tie <b>surgical</b> <b>knots</b> in this study.

50|$|The {{effective}} tying {{of surgical}} knots {{is a critical}} skill for surgeons since if the knot does not stay intact, the consequences may be serious such as after pulmonary resection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy. Primary, the goal of <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> tying is to allow the capacity of a knot (or ligature) to be tightened and remain tight. Ligatures are locked and finished multiple overhand knots. Nevertheless, slipping sometimes happens before {{the addition of the}} final knot, particularly during an instrument tie.|$|E
30|$|In {{the group}} that had sutures used, the {{following}} technique was used: The needle was inserted deep to the subcutaneous layer of the skin and pierced the subcutaneous fascia just underneath the skin. Once removed {{from one side of}} the wound, it was then inserted subcutaneously on the opposite skin surface and removed deep to the subcutaneous plane. The suture was tied using a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> that was buried deep to the subcutaneous layer.|$|E
30|$|The graft was {{prepared}} {{as described by}} Snow et al. (Snow et al. 2012). Briefly, the tendon was cut to be 240 [*]mm long and the two ends of the tendon were whip-stitched as described previously. The tendon was measured and marked to identify three equal segments. One third of the tendon was passed through the Endobutton CL loop and the remaining two thirds was folded onto itself and the free end with whip stitch was secured to the Endobutton CL loop with a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> consisting of four square knots. Luggage tag stitch {{was placed on the}} folded end to facilitate graft holding (Fig. 1).|$|E
50|$|Surgical suture is {{a medical}} device used to hold body tissues {{together}} after an injury or surgery. Application generally involves using a needle with an attached length of thread.

40|$|Abstract — In this work, we have {{extended}} {{the concept of}} constrained motion control of robots to surgical tasks that require multiple robots. We present virtual fixtures to guide the motion of multiple robots such that spatial and temporal relationship is maintained between them. At the same time, our algorithm keeps the surgeon in the control loop. Moreover, we show that these virtual fixtures allow bimanual tasks to be completed using input for a single robot. That is, the user requires only one hand to cooperatively control multiple robots. This reduces the cognitive load on the surgeon and makes multiple-robot setup for surgery more relevant. We demonstrate this architecture by using an example of manipulating a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> to position it at a target point. Significant improvement is observed in the accuracy when bimanual virtual fixture assistance is provided. Moreover, the accuracy when using...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Due to {{demands for}} stability, {{accuracy}} and lower postoperative complication in surgery, robotic surgical assistants may assist surgeons by performing specific subtasks such as suturing and knot-tying to reduce surgeon tedium {{and duration of}} some exhausting operations. To improve the <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> quality and accelerate healing for patients in surgery, trajectory planning of suture clamping point in knot-tying manipulation using a master-slave robot is discussed based on the surgeon’s manual motion of knot-tying. First, the manual knot-tying process is described, and then according to task sequences, trajectories planning of suture clamping point in looping step based on motion synthesis of rotating joint and swinging joint and pulling step based on slip knot theory are proposed separately to form a knot. To verify the reasonability of trajectory planning, knot-tying motion is simulated by Solidworks. And finally the knot-tying experiment is implemented on the specific robotic setup. The {{results show that the}} proposed trajectory planning of knot-tying is feasible in the automation of surgical knot-tying manipulation...|$|E
5000|$|A {{simple and}} useful knotted structure, the cow hitch {{has been known}} {{since at least the}} first century when {{described}} by Greek physician Heraklas in a monograph on <b>surgical</b> <b>knots</b> and slings.

[...] The common alternate name lark's head is attributed to Tom Bowling (pseudonym) in the 1866 work The Book of Knots which is presumed to have been adapted from a French manuscript; lark's head is a literal translation of the French name for the knot, tête d'alouette.|$|R
30|$|In January 2007, a {{new concept}} in wound closure was {{introduced}} in the USA, the bidirectional barbed suture (Quill® Self-Retaining System, SRS: Angiotech Pharmaceuticals). Even though the materials are similar to the conventional suture (nylon, polypropylene and PDS), it has a revolutionary design. The Quill® SRS consists of a monofilament with tiny barbs cut into the length of the surface, self-anchoring to the tissue. This self-anchoring capacity eliminates the need for <b>surgical</b> <b>knots</b> and hysterorrhaphy becomes easier, therefore reducing surgical time and blood loss. Although Quill® SRS is more expensive, less suture is required for hysterorrhaphy compared with conventional suture, resulting in a better cost-effective alternative.|$|R

40|$|Background We {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} technical training (TT) and quiet eye training (QE) {{on the performance of}} one-handed square knot tying in surgical residents. Methods Twenty surgical residents were randomly assigned to the 2 groups and completed pretest, training, retention, and transfer tests. Participants wore a mobile eye tracker that simultaneously recorded their gaze and hand movements. Dependent variables were knot tying performance (%), QE duration (%), number of fixations, total movement time (s), and hand movement phase time (s). Results The QE training group had significantly higher performance scores, a longer QE duration, fewer fixations, faster total knot tying times, and faster movement phase times compared with the TT group. The QE group maintained performance in the transfer test, whereas the TT group significantly decreased performance from retention to transfer. Conclusions QE training significantly improved learning, retention, and transfer of <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> tying compared with a traditional technical approach. Both performance effectiveness (performance outcome) and movement efficiency (hand movement times) were improved using QE modeling, instruction, and feedback. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of competency-based versus experience- oriented training of procedural skills for health professional trainees is unclear. This study examined whether the performance level attained {{at the end}} of practice (i. e., competency criteria) or the amount of practice best predicts retention of a procedural skill. Forty two trainees learned to perform a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> using video- based instruction. There were 3 groups, each of which practiced until they reached a predefined criterion time to tie the knot (10, 15, or 20 seconds). Participants returned one week later for a timed retention test. Multiple regression analysis determined whether the number of practice trials, total practice time, or criterion reached {{at the end of}} practice was most predictive of the time taken to perform the skill during retention. Multiple regression analysis showed that the only significant predictor of performance at retention was the criterion reached at the end of practice (p 0. 05).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Suture {{strength}} and knot topology {{are two of}} the several factors impacting the strength of surgical repairs in soft tissue such as a tendon and skin. The measurement and comparison of the strength of knotted suture is complicated by the lack of consensus test methods. Several prior studies assess FiberWire and others sutures, however, they evaluate or compare only the gross structural response of specific sutures or their knots without direct investigation of the governing mechanics. Little has been reported about the constituents of the suture, the core and jacket separately, nor their impact on the knot {{strength and}} failure mechanisms.

30|$|There is also little {{consensus}} as to {{when and}} to what degree arthroscopic knot tying {{should be included in}} an orthopaedic residency program’s curriculum. Our data suggest that after an adequate educational period is attained, any level of resident is capable of tying acceptable arthroscopic <b>surgical</b> <b>knots.</b> Recent research by Hanypsiak et al. supports this claim (Hanypsiak et al. 2014). When comparing surgeons who perform greater than 200 arthroscopic shoulder cases per year with surgeons who perform less than 200 arthroscopic shoulder cases per year, the authors found no statistically significant difference in ultimate or clinical failure with arthroscopic knot tying. This suggests that the learning curve is small and even inexperienced arthroscopic surgeons, or orthopaedic surgery residents, are able to tie clinically acceptable arthroscopic knots. Therefore, we recommend that as arthroscopic procedures are becoming more ubiquitous, this education should occur early and frequently throughout residency training.|$|R
40|$|The use of sutures as {{artificial}} chordae {{is widely}} established in mitral valve reconstruction. After the correct {{length of the}} chordae is determined by saline injection, there is {{a variety of methods}} to secure that length before tying <b>surgical</b> <b>knots.</b> We investigated the amount of damage posed by applying a haemoclip or a pean clamp and by using a knot-pusher.

Using a haemoclip significantly decreased the breaking forces to 12. 9 ± 14. 6 N compared to control group (p< 0. 01). The length can be safely secured by applying a pean clamp.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{application}} of robotic systems in minimally invasive surgery. We have assembled a bi-manual telemanipulator capable of delicate operations. Each robotic arm has eight degrees of freedom which enables free manipulation via trocar kinematics. In addition minimally invasive instruments were equipped with strain gauge force sensors that can measure forces along three translational directions of the instrument’s shaft. Forces are displayed to the user by means of two haptic devices which are also used for input. An endoscopic stereo-camera provides pictures from the region of operation to the user. In order to emulate a sterescopic impression, pictures can be displayed by means of either a head mounted display, a CRT-screen equipped with shutter technology or a 3 D video projection. With this system we have assessed the quality of force feedback and we have performed typical operations known from cardiac surgery. We also have shown {{that it is possible}} to perform certain recurrent tasks (like knot tying) automatically. Within this context we have implemented two application examples. In the first example a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> is recorded and afterwards replayed with increased speed at the same position. The second example is the instantiation of a predefined knot at an arbitrary position. 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the feasibility and efficacy of a mechanical minimally invasive manipulator for endoscopic surgery. In contrast to currently available motorized master-slave manipulators, this mechanical manipulator consists of two purely mechanical, hand-controlled endoscopic arms with joints that allow seven degrees of freedom (DOF). METHODS: For the study, 30 medical students performed four different tasks in a pelvic trainer box using either two conventional endoscopic needleholders or a set of mechanical manipulators. The exercise consisted of four different tasks: repositioning of coins, rope passing, passing of a suture through rings, and tying of a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot.</b> All experiments were recorded on videotape (S-VHS), and the data were analyzed afterwards by an independent observer using a quantitative time-action analysis. RESULTS: A {{significant difference in the}} number of total actions (including failures) favoring the mechanical manipulator group was shown in most exercises. A significant difference in failures per task was shown in favor of the mechanical manipulator group as well. There was no significant difference shown in the total time per exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The tasks clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the mechanical manipulator, although some technical flaws emerged during the experiments. Considering the fact that a first prototype of the mechanical manipulator was tested, modifications are to be expected in a next model. These experiments show the potential of the mechanical manipulator, and it {{is expected to be a}} competitive and economical instrument for endoscopic surgery in the near futur...|$|E
40|$|HYPOTHESIS No. 5 FiberWire (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA) {{cerclage}} (FWC) and 1. 25 -mm {{stainless steel}} wire cerclage (SSWC) are biomechanically similar in resistance to prosthetic subsidence in shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS In this laboratory bench study, 3 different <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> configurations (4 -throw knot, cow hitch, and simple hitch) using a No. 5 FWC were evaluated and compared with a 1. 25 -mm SSWC. First, distraction tests were performed using bovine femoral cortical half shells mounted on a testing jig. Cerclage tightening, load to a 3 -mm gap opening, and load to total failure were measured. Second, uncemented humeral prosthetic stems were inserted into an experimentally split humeral medullary canal, secured by the cerclage. After 100 N of preloading, the prosthesis was advanced into the humerus at a speed of 0. 2 mm/s, and resistance during subsidence up to a penetration depth of 10 mm, as well as gap opening, was measured. RESULTS Tightening force showed higher values for SSWC (618 N) than FWC (131 - 137 N) (P <. 001). Load to total failure was comparable among the 3 different FWC knots (2, 642 - 2, 804 N), which were significantly stronger than SSWC (1, 775 N, P <. 001). At 3 mm of distraction, SSWC (1, 820 N), cow hitch (1, 803 N), and single-throw hitch (1, 709 N) performed significantly better than a 4 -throw knot (1, 289 N) (P <. 01). Subsidence testing showed no difference in force restraint or gap opening between the best FWC and SSWC. CONCLUSIONS FWCs appear, in vitro, equally suitable to steel wires to stabilize nondisplaced periprosthetic humeral fractures. To actively reduce a displaced fracture, steel wires may still be the first choice...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveDirect haptic (force or tactile) {{feedback}} is negligible in current surgical robotic systems. The relevance of haptic feedback in robot-assisted performances of surgical tasks is controversial. We studied {{the effects of}} visual force feedback, a haptic feedback surrogate, on tying <b>surgical</b> <b>knots</b> with fine sutures {{similar to those used}} in cardiovascular surgery. MethodsBy using a modified da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) equipped with force-sensing instrument tips and real-time visual force feedback overlays in the console image, 10 surgeons each tied 10 knots with and 10 knots without visual force feedback. Four surgeons had significant prior da Vinci experience, and the remaining 6 surgeons did not. Performance parameters, including suture breakage and secure knots, peak and standard deviation of applied forces, and completion times using 5 - 0 silk sutures, were recorded. Chi-square and Student t test analyses determined the differences between groups. ResultsAmong surgeon subjects with robotic experience, no differences in measured performance parameters were found between robot-assisted knot ties executed with and without visual force feedback. Among surgeons without robotic experience, however, visual force feedback was associated with lower suture breakage rates, peak applied forces, and standard deviations of applied forces. Visual force feedback did not impart differences in knot completion times or loose knots for either surgeon group. ConclusionsVisual force feedback resulted in reduced suture breakage, lower forces, and decreased force inconsistencies among novice robotic surgeons, although elapsed time and knot quality were unaffected. In contrast, visual force feedback did not affect these metrics among surgeons experienced with the da Vinci system. These results suggest that visual force feedback primarily benefits novice robot-assisted surgeons, with diminishing benefits among experienced surgeons...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: High-strength sutures allow {{tightening}} of a suture knot beyond {{the strength of}} the surgeon, possibly inflicting skin damage through the gloves. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether such effort is useful and how much tensioning on a <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> is necessary. METHODS: Three different suture materials were tested: No. 2 Vicryl™, FibreWire™, and PDS™. First, the force spontaneously applied on sutures during experimental knot tightening ("tying load") was measured in fifteen experienced surgeons. Second, with each suture material, surgical square knots were tied with increasing, standardized loads (range 0. 5 - 50  N) using a custom-made apparatus. Thereby, knot seating after tying was evaluated, and by loading the knots to failure, evaluation for failure mode and failure load was performed. RESULTS: FibreWire™ 5 -throw square knots always failed by complete slipping of all knots (resolving), independent on the tying load. A nonlinear decrease of knot slippage and increased failure load were seen with increasing tying loads for all sutures. Major differences were seen between 0. 5 and 10 N for FibreWire™ (slippage: 25  mm) and PDS™ (99. 6  mm), whereas Vicryl™ showed major differences (22. 7  mm) between 0. 5 and 2  N. Increasing the tying load from 10 to 50  N decreased the mean knot slippage from 12 (FibreWire™, ± 2. 6 SD), 9 (PDS™, ± 1. 8 SD) and 8 (Vicryl™, ± 1. 3 SD) mm to 6 (± 2. 9 SD), 3 (± 1. 5 SD) and 4  mm (± 0. 9 SD), respectively. CONCLUSION: Slippage and self-seating of the knots under load is unavoidable even with highest tying loads. Relatively minor but possibly important differences can be seen for tying loads exceeding 2  N (Vicryl™) and 10  N (PDS™ and FibreWire™) for failure load and knot slippage. But also with a tying load of 50  N, a minimal slippage of approximately 3  mm seems unavoidable for all suture types. However, it is important to state that intense tightening does not prevent knot resolution and is only necessary in clinical situations that demand very tight sutures. Numbers and proper appliance of throws are more relevant than tying strength to reach the maximum failure load...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} if surgical knotting performed via endoscopy {{is an effective}} closure method for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. METHODS: The proposed method was tested on an in vitro pig stomach model using standard endoscopy suite materials. A single use laparoscopy trocar (Versaport Plus manufactured by Tyco Healthcare) was fixed onto a plastic rectangular box in a horizontal position. A fresh pig stomach was tightly attached via its esophageal end to the trocar opening {{on the inner side}} of the box. The stomach cavity was closed at the duodenal end with Kocher forceps. A standard upper gastrointestinal endoscope fitted at its tip with a transparent plastic cap was introduced into the stomach through the outer trocar opening, so that the passage of the surgical trocar would mimic the passage of an esophagus. The stomach was subsequently inflated, followed by irrigation and washing. A neutral electrode of an electrocautery unit was placed inside the plastic box, underneath the pig stomach. The stomach&#x 2019;s outer surface was kept moist using normal saline {{in order to maintain the}} natural elasticity and to ensure good contact with the electrode. RESULTS: The submucosal space on the anterior face of the stomach was accessed using the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection. First, a site on the anterior face of the stomach was chosen, near the angle. Then, saline was injected into the submucosa with a standard endoscopic needle, so as to create a 20 mm diameter elevation. A linear 15 mm vertical incision was created at its center using a Dual Knife (KD 650 U manufactured by Olympus). This incision was used to access the submucosal space, and about 10 mm was dissected on both sides of the incision. The endoscope was then pushed through to the outside of the stomach after dilating a small puncture made by the Dual Knife in the muscularis propria, which simulated the peritoneoscopy procedure. Then, a 0. 025 &#x 201 D; guidewire (Jagwire/ 450 cm manufactured by Boston Scientific) was inserted into the puncture, followed by a dilating balloon (Quantum TT manufactured by Cook Medical) that was used to enlarge the aperture orifice. After withdrawing the scope back into the stomach, the procedure continued with guidewires being passed from the submucosal space into the gastric lumen through small orifices on the left and right sides of the mucosal opening. These orifices were made with the Dual Knife, and the guidewires were inserted via a guiding catheter (HGC- 6 manufactured by Cook Medical). As the guidewires were pulled outside of the stomach, they were replaced with a single surgical suture that had been initially attached to their tip and was now untied. Finally, one loop of this surgical suture was formed on the exterior. One loop end was fixed while the opposite suture end was pulled by biopsy forceps through the endoscope channel as the scope was inserted into the stomach. The loop was advanced until it approached and fixed the two mucosal incision margins. Three alternating loops were made in this manner to create a genuine tight <b>surgical</b> <b>knot.</b> CONCLUSION: Endoscopic knotting of the gastric wall is feasible, but an in vitro survival study is necessary to validate clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} some recent {{technological}} developments in human surgery are evaluated for their potential use in veterinary medicine by introducing them as surgical innovations for canine gonadectomy. Barbed sutures achieve wound apposition without <b>surgical</b> <b>knot</b> tying and thus avoid knot-associated negative consequences (lengthy placement, impaired wound healing around bulky knots, {{and the effect}} of unsightly knots on cosmetics). A study in 9 dogs found that celiotomy closure was easily achieved, no intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, and ultrasonographic characteristics during wound healing were comparable to conventional sutures. Ovariectomy is technically less complicated, less time consuming, and is associated with decreased morbidity (smaller incision, less intraoperative trauma, decreased discomfort) compared with ovariohysterectomy. For the incidence of long-term urogenital problems, including endometritis/pyometra and urinary incontinence, no differences between techniques were observed. This makes ovariectomy the preferred method for elective gonadectomy. Neuromuscular blocking agents induce abdominal muscle wall relaxation and might lead to a larger intra-abdominal working space and improved surgical efficiency. However, the duration of ovarian pedicle transection in 40 dogs was not significantly changed (5. 7 ± 2. 3 versus 5. 9 ± 1. 9 minutes), arterial blood pressure decreased 5 %, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications did not differ. There was no advantage to add NMB to the anesthetic protocol. Newly developed energy-based hemostatic surgical devices were evaluated during laparoscopic ovariectomy. When a bipolar electrocoagulation grasping forceps was compared with monopolar electrocoagulation on 103 dogs, it decreased laparoscopic ovariectomy time (41 versus 53 minutes), decreased intraoperative hemorrhage (8 versus 13 % dogs), and facilitated exteriorization of the ovaries. Obesity (56 versus 42 minutes) and intraoperative mesovarial bleeding (56 versus 46 minutes) increased surgical time. Dog age, estrus, and pseudopregnancy did not influence surgical time. When a vessel sealing device was compared to the bipolar electrocoagulation grasping forceps in 40 dogs, the surgical time was reduced (3. 5 ± 2. 7 versus 8. 1 ± 4. 2 minutes), with less bleeding (0 versus 10 %), and with less thermal coagulation damage based on histological scoring. Surgical times were influenced by surgeon experience, and ovarian pedicle fat scores. When the vessel sealing device was compared to a bipolar electrocoagulation cutting forceps in 21 dogs, excision of the ovaries was faster (2. 5 ± 1. 2 versus 4. 8 ± 1. 8 minutes), bleeding occurred less (0 versus 29 %), and thermal coagulation damage was less (93. 4 ± 85. 8 versus 130. 9 ± 101. 2 µm). Surgical times increased in obese animals. A vessel sealing device for open ovariectomy was compared with conventional suture ligation in 20 dogs, and resulted in reduced surgical times (2. 22 ± 0. 58 versus 4. 10 ± 1. 13 min). Limited reuse of the disposable instrument was possible, untill eventually the electrode failed. Ovarian remnant tissue in 32 dogs was removed laparoscopically. Surgical time was 107 ± 33 minutes, with a convalescence duration of 1. 5 ± 0. 7 days. No major complications occurred. Minor hemorrhage (12 %) and the presence of adhesions (79 %) increased surgical times. After a median follow-up period of 22. 5 months absence of clinical signs and hormonal assays testing confirmed 100 % treatment efficacy...|$|E

The most successful surgical simulation is in the fields of laparoscopic and endovascular surgery. These two-dimensional scenarios, as in the aviation industry, lend themselves to simulation. Open simulators have been met with more resistance than their laparoscopic counterparts because of the difficulties in simulating the three-dimensional field. Engaging in persistent practice is what makes the expert and all trainees should aspire to this. Without knowing, all surgical trainees have engaged in deliberate practice when first learning to tie <b>surgical</b> <b>knots.</b> This deliberate practice should be used in all aspects of vascular surgical practice, and it is no longer acceptable to perform procedures such as arterial anastomoses for the first time on patients. Simulators exist for all aspects of vascular surgical training and vary in complexity and price. Some of these simulators are suitable for use at home or in a skills laboratory whereas others are more suitable for use in a specialized skills center. Training on these simulators can be offered at a local level or at a regional level in the skills center. Where surgical procedures are not commonly performed or expertise is required for a new innovation, it is more appropriate to have national or internationally based workshops under the auspices of surgical boards or societies. Simulation of crisis management, well known in aviation, has also been applied to vascular surgical practice and can offer benefit to senior trainees even when their performance on a noncrisis simulator has reached a plateau. This article identifies the areas where simulation in open vascular surgery can benefit the trainee...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the third most common cancer in women {{worldwide}} and the fourth leading cause of cancer death. In Western countries, it is the 10 th {{most common cause of}} cancer death. Cervical cancer often affects young women (1 year) morbidity. There was a steep learning curve for the surgical time, and the adverse events, even though usually mild, decreased with time. There was a relatively high incidence of vaginal dehiscence (6 %). The robot has aided the introduction of laparoscopic RH at our center and is a feasible option for the patients. Study II: Do <b>surgical</b> <b>knots</b> tied with the robot have equal tensile strength as knots tied by hand? Four knot formations were tied by four surgeons in the robot and compared with the hand-tied knot recommended by the manufacturer of the thread. One out of four surgeons tied the knots in the robot with equal strength to the hand- tied knots. Strand-to-strand knots performed better than loop-to-strand knot and should therefore be recommended. Study III: Is it possible to perform laparoscopic transabdominal radical trachelectomy aided by the robot with consistent surgical precision? Two quality parameters (cervical length and placement of cerclage) were compared in 12 women operated with the robot with 10 women operated vaginally. The two groups had the same remaining cervical length, but the placement of the cerclage was more precise and consistent in the robot group. Study IV: Is it possible to perform robot-assisted RH with the same hospital cost as with laparotomy? Fifty-one patients operated with open RH were compared with 180 patients operated with robot assistance. The robot was more expensive in the beginning, but after 90 operations (3 years), {{there was no difference in}} hospital cost. Study V: Is it oncologically safe to operate women with early cervical cancer with the robot? The oncological outcome for 170 women operated with the robot was compared with FIGO results. This comparison does not raise concerns about oncological outcome following robot-assisted RH for cervical cancer...|$|R
5000|$|Margolles left SEMEFO in {{the late}} 1990s. Since then her {{independent}} art practice continues to explore themes of death, violence and exclusion, specifically using forensic material and human remains. She uses materials retrieved from the morgue where she has her studio, such as the water used to wash corpses, which she uses {{as the foundation for}} her work;"The water comes from Mexico City’s morgue. It’s water used to wash the bodies of murder victims." [...] Teresea Margolles, 2006In 2012 she was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands and the 5th Artes Mundi prize for international contemporary art.
