50|$|BSM {{provides}} a critical framework {{to make sure}} that the work of customer-facing and internal teams within an organization is defined and transparent to their customers, who can then influence the functionality and quality of the services they receive.BSM complements business process management (BPM) by helping an organization deliver more effective services across business processes. Together, BSM and BPM form the basis for all-encompassing, full-stack process-optimization platforms. BSM adds a <b>service-centered</b> <b>view</b> across business processes and facilitates economies of scale for services that contribute to multiple processes.|$|E
30|$|In {{the context}} of current service economy era, service is an {{essential}} weapon for creating customer value. Vargo and Lusch [1] proposed the “service-dominant (S-D) logic” perspective to transcend traditional “goods-dominant (G-D) logic.” S-D logic emphasizes the interactive and networked nature of value co-creation with customers. This orientation is clearly presented in related foundational premises (FPs) of S-D logic [2]. For example, FP 6 states “The customer is always a co-creator of value”, which implies value co-creation is interactional. In addition, FP 8 indicates “A <b>service-centered</b> <b>view</b> is inherently customer-orientated and relational,” because service values are determined by customers’ perceptions in the value co-creation activities. Last, FP 2 denotes “Indirect exchange masks the fundamental basis of exchange”, which emphasizes service provided through complex combinations of goods, money, and institutions; therefore, it has network in nature. Particularly, under the S-D logic and the rapid developments of information and communications technologies (ICTs), virtual customer environments (VCEs) have been widely adopted as mechanisms for enhancing customers’ value co-creation activities.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} integrated {{marketing communication}} (IMC) and brand identity as critical components ot the firm's brand equity strategy. Specifically, the authors provide a brand equity strategy schematic that details (1) {{the role of}} IMC in creating and maintaining brand equity, and (2) the role of brand identity in informing, guiding, and helping to develop, nurture, and implement the firm's overall IMC strategy. The authors also present a conceptual framework with testable research propositions toward IMC theory development. Finally, a discussion of implications for academics and practitioners is provided, and opportunities for future qualitative and quantitative research are suggested. Forpracritioners, integrated marketing communication (IMC) has (I) become widely accepted, (2) has pervaded various lev-els within the firm, and (3) has {{become an integral part}} of brand strategy that requires extensive brand development ac-tivities within the firm betore beginning any external brand communications efforts. Regarding academics, Vargo and Lusch (2004) argued in a recent paper that marketing is evolv-ing toward a dynamic and evolutionary process—one that is based on a <b>service-centered</b> <b>view.</b> In keeping with this evolu...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{products}} in many industries recently experienced servicification. This phe-nomenon, {{that has already}} been described by Vargo and Lusch in 2004, describes changes in society and markets that foster a shift towards a <b>service-centered</b> <b>view.</b> In this vein, the focus of trade is on services while the importance of goods decreases. The emergence of advanced Web technologies leverages the provisioning and consumption of services over the Internet. Additionally, the presence of the Internet and the availabil-ity of Web-related technologies has influenced the offering and provisioning of services. The existence of platforms like Google’s AppExchange or Amazon’s Web Services man-ifest this trend. The legal framework for service outsourcing and thus, service provi-sioning and consumption is stipulated in service level agreements (SLAs). SLAs deter-mine the objectives for service quality through service level objectives (SLOs), contain a price for service provisioning and a penalty in case of SLA violation. This way, SLAs set incentives for providers to adhere to SLAs. The provisioning of services underlies an inherent risk of service failure caused for instance by power outages, hardware mal...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the evolution of buyer-supplier relationships from adversarial toward relational, or service-centered, emphasis for large-scale organizations. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses the historical method to review historical changes through synthesized qualitative (i. e. field notes and industry interviews) and quantitative (i. e. company reports, Compustat queries, trade reports, and survey) research. Findings – Technology and information sharing in B 2 B relationships engender integrated value chains. Within these value chains, <b>service-centered</b> <b>view</b> of B 2 C relationships have been adopted in B 2 B relationships, resulting in changes in supplier roles {{and how they are}} measured. Research limitations/implications – By focusing on large scale buyer-supplier relationships within supply chains (e. g. Wal-Mart, Royal Phillips, ElecSound, China Minmetals, The People’s Republic of China), which may affect the generalizability to small-business applications, this paper provides some guidance on which customer levels (in a value chain) an organization should focus. The evolution of buyer-supplier relationships towards more cooperative relationships results in changing roles such as co-managed inventory, where suppliers are authorized to write themselves orders. Practical implications – This paper is a very useful source of information for practitioners and educators about recent trends in large-scale buyer-supplier relationships, including slotting allowances, co-managed inventory practices, and selling teams. It also provides a buyer-seller trust matrix {{that can be used for}} teaching or developing relational strategy in organizations and classrooms. Originality/value – This paper provides description of changes in sales force roles and measures, including the roles of responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Information and {{communications}} technology industry is in transition from industrial society towards service society, {{and there is}} an abstract asset called knowledge taking over the business. However, knowledge has no intrinsic value as an object of exchange. Value of knowledge only occurs if it is used, shared, or combined as new data. Companies need to find the best ways to share knowledge to the right people, who can utilize the given knowledge in a way it generates value. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand how value generation is best facilitated in IoT-service process. The focus is on successful value co-creation from service logic based value generation process. This study forms a process flow for IoT-service process by adapting value-adding elements, value-reducing elements, aspects of interactions and challenges, which together create a comprehensive view of successful cooperation activities that best facilitate value co-creation. Theoretical background of this study is based on value as a concept, value co-creation, and <b>service-centered</b> <b>view.</b> There are also two different service-centered value generation logics presented and evaluated by discussing their similarities and differences. As IoT is rather new phenomenon in the research literature, especially concerning the processes of IoT-services, this study aims for a comprehensive view of the topic. Qualitative method is chosen for its ability to provide new insights or understanding about individual and social complexity. Empirical data is collected through four semi-structured theme interviews that were conducted for people in different industries, who had had some level of cooperation with IoT-service provider in the past. This study results a comprehensive view of IoT-service process, which concerns the process spheres, value-adding elements, value-reducing elements, interaction areas and challenge categories. In addition, study establishes the essential role of human communication in technology-driven process. Results of the study also provide an IoT-service process flow, which demonstrates key spheres of IoT-service process while dividing process into customer-, joint-, and customer spheres. Theoretical contribution of this study emphasizes previous findings in service logic research by providing support for the arguments regarding the unsuitability of SDL used in analytical level for its inadequacy to define roles of value creators, as well as logic’s way to leave precise value emergence undefined. Managerial contribution of this study emphasizes the significance of human communication as a basis of business. The other important finding from managerial perspective is the relevance of multilateral cooperation within actors in IoT-network. This study focuses on understanding phenomenon of IoT-service process in general level, leaving room for further research around same topic...|$|E
