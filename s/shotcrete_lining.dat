The tunnel was temporarily {{open in the}} winter of 2009-10 when the Lowari Pass was closed. In the summer of 2011 construction briefly began again, but soon ceased. By October 2011 SAMBU JV had removed all of their construction equipment. The National Highway Authority cited as cause various disputes about proper payments not being made to the SAMBU construction company. By Fall 2012 work had restarted, but winter public access was restricted the following winter to three days every week (2012-2013), and to three days every two weeks the next winter (2013-2014). The tunnel remained uncompleted, most of the interior of the tunnel lacks its <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining,</b> retaining walls or a metalled road. The tunnel is also not yet properly ventilated. The situation was not improved by the winter of 2014-2015.|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between perpendicularly crossing tunnels in the Sydney region are investigated using a full three-dimensional (3 D) {{finite element analysis}} coupled with elasto-plastic material models. Special {{attention is paid to}} the effect of subsequent tunnelling on the support system, i. e. the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> and rock bolts, of the existing tunnel. The results of the analysis show that in a region such as Sydney, with relatively high horizontal stresses, installation of the new tunnel causes the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> of the existing tunnel to be in tension in the side facing towards the tunnel opening and in compression at the crown and invert. The pre-stressed rock bolts are usually tensioned more in the sections closest to the tunnel opening. For this particular study, if a new tunnel is driven perpendicularly beneath an existing tunnel, significant increases are induced in the bending moments in the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> at the lateral sides of the existing tunnel and in the axial forces at its crown and invert. The increase in side bending moments causes further tensile cracking but the crown and invert stresses remain within the thresholds for both compressive failure and tensile cracking for <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> of typical concrete quality. Moreover, the driving of the new tunnel causes the tensile forces in the existing side rock bolts to increase and those in the existing crown rock bolts to decrease. In contrast, if the new tunnel is driven perpendicularly above the existing tunnel, compressive failure of the existing <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> is induced at the crown of the deeper tunnel for concrete of typical capacity and a significant tensile force increase of the existing rock bolts around the crown. It is concluded that in order to ensure the stability of the existing tunnel, local thickening is needed at the sides of the existing <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> if the shallow tunnel is installed first and local thickening is needed at the crown if the deep tunnel is installed first...|$|E
40|$|Safety and {{stability}} {{are the key}} issues in underground excavations. Making tunnels water tight {{plays an important role}} in this regards. Water leakage problems in unlined or <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> water tunnels are not new issues. In many occasions severe water inflow as well as leakage problems have been faced that not only reduced stability of the rock mass surrounding the tunnel, but also valuable water has been lost from it, causing safety risk as well as huge economic loss to the projects. In the Himalaya, due to active tectonics in this region, the rock masses are highly fractured, folded, sheared and deeply weathered. Tunneling through numerous zones of weakness, fractures and faults is thus a matter of reality. Moreover, the majority of these zones are in general highly conductive, representating potential sources of ground water aquifer as well as possible sources of water leakage from the completed unlined or <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> water tunnels. Thus, the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with water leakage is extremely high. Water leakage control in the tunnels plays a vital role not only in improving the rock mass quality, but also in increasing the safety as well as saving economic loss caused by large leakages. The real challenge is however accurate prediction and quantification of possible water leakage prior to tunnel excavation, so that cost consequences are incorporated well in advance. The main focus of this paper will be to discuss a new approach of uncertainty and risk analysis that leads to better understanding concerning quantification of possible water leakage from unlined or <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> tunnels. For this, factual data of the headrace tunnel of Khimti I Hydropower Project in Nepal Himalaya, where effective use of injection grouting was applied to control the leakage, has been exploited...|$|R

In this project, {{approximately}} 4. 2 Km long headrace tunnel with 138 m long vertical shaft has been designed and being constructed. Rock types along the headrace tunnel alignment are migmatitic gneisses, quartzite, schists, banded gneisses, and weak or shear zones. In this case study whole tunnel alignment is divided into headrace tunnel and <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> high pressure tunnel. Major part of this thesis is to proposed the pressure tunnel and analyze it against stability and hydraulic fracturing. And {{another part of the}} thesis is to design and analyze surge shaft. <b>Shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> pressure tunnel is proposed from the construction audit two at chainage 1 + 850 m. Surge shaft is proposed at chainage 2 + 064 m. Along the proposed high pressure tunnel and surge shaft location quartzite is the dominant rock type. In this thesis two different method have been used for the analysis of Hydraulic fracturing. Analytical evaluation has been done with Norwegian rule of thumb. All together 10 section have been selected and analysis has been performed. All sections have factor of safety more than two which suggest tunnel is safe from hydraulic fracturing. Numerical modelling of four selected section has been performed with the help of Phase 2 program. Results of the phase 2 also shows that pressure tunnel is safe against hydraulic fracturing. Stability analysis of the pressure tunnel and surge shaft has been carried out using Numerical modelling.

40|$|Optimization of rock {{support is}} a key for the {{successful}} use of underground space for hydropower development in the Himalaya. Therefore, finding innovative, optimum and economic solution {{will be the only}} way to guarantee on such optimization. A main issue is to find out the extent of hydraulic fracturing and access the water leakage possibility during the operation of such tunnels. The leaked water not only causes economic loss but also may severely affect the stability of tunnel, valley side slopes and the environment. The use of fully concrete/steel lined pressure tunnels against hydraulic fracturing in the rock mass is of costly solution. Hence, it is advantageous to explore possibilities of minimizing the length of the concrete or steel lining in high pressure tunnels and shafts. A proper assessment of hydraulic fracturing of the rock mass plays an important role in this endeavor. This paper evaluates whether or not hydraulic fracturing (splitting) will occur at the 4750 m long shotcrete-lined high pressure headrace tunnel of 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (UTKHEP). The Upper Tamakoshi HEP is a high head project (gross head 822 m) and the proposed <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> high pressure headrace tunnel will experience maximum hydrostatic pressure head of 40 bar (400 m water column) at normal plant operation. To check the possibility of hydraulic fracturing, both deterministic and two dimensional numerical modeling techniques have been used.

It is found that the zone of influence extends about 2. 5 tunnel diameters (2. 5 D) from the intersection. During driving of the new tunnel, the existing support system in the zone of influence is affected according to the progression of the new tunnel face to/from the existing tunnel and the effects are not significant when the new tunnel face is located 4. 5 D from the intersection. The approach of the new tunnel face towards the existing tunnel causes the existing <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> on the approach side of the existing tunnel to undergo tensile cracking, while neither further compressive failures nor further tensile cracking is observed when the new tunnel is driven away from the existing tunnel.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{computation}} {{of stress}} and strain conditions for tunnel profile excavation is performed by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). It is a numerical method performed in geotechnics for resolving of the stress and strain distribution in a rock massif where the change of stress condition occurs during some operations.

A study has been done to assess the cost optimisation by taking into account the reduction in cost of lining and increase in cost due to increased cost of excavation and rock support. Hydraulic equivalent section has been used in cost optimisation calculations Stability analysis of the underground power house complex of Etalin hydroelectric project consisting of three caverns housing powerhouse, transformer and surge chamber is done and rock support designed. The power house has three caverns located at a depth of 400 m aligned parallel at a spacing of 50 m. The size of powerhouse cavern is 352 m (L) x 23. 5 m (W) x 59. 73 m (H). The total size of transformer cavern is 349. 6 m (L) x 16. 5 m (W) x 24. 3 m (H).

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} to focus on the two head race tunnels within the Melado HPP, Chile. The {{upstream}} tunnel is called Castillo 7800 m long and the downstream tunnel is called Vallical 8800 m long. The feasibility study of this project was carried in 2010. The resulting report from this study was used as a basis for this thesis. Along with all the background information obtained from the feasibility studies, there are some other sources gotten from field investigation tests carried out {{after the end of the}} feasibility report. Based on all the information collected, a new rock mass classification was carried out, identifying all the geological stretches for both tunnels. This classification was undertaken according to the RMR system (Bieniawski, 1973) and the Q-system (NGI, 1974). The support required for both tunnels was estimated mainly based on empirical rock support methods. Numerical model by means of software Phase 2 as well as ground behavior analysis were carried out to provide a better understanding of actual problems expected during excavation that are not always cover by the empirical methods. Once there was a clear understating of the rock masses involved in both tunnels along with their corresponding rock support, some analysis related to the tunnels were performed to improve the economical benefit of the whole project. The first economic analysis undertaken was the optimum cross section for Drill & Blast excavation method. A detail analysis that systematizes the cost and advance rate involved in the round cycle of the Drill & Blast excavation method and rock support was used. A thorough analysis of energy losses was also carried out as well, making a distinction between unlined, <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lined</b> and reinforced <b>shotcrete</b> ribs tunnel stretches. The existing cross section of 6. 9 m horse shoe shape tunnel turned out to be very small. The new optimum cross section for Castillo tunnel was 8. 7 m diameter and 9 m diameter for Vallical tunnel. The second economic analysis was a tunnel alignment change in order to improve some blast design parameters in stretches where their tunnel axis orientation was close to predominant joint set. In any of the two tunnel stretches analyzed turned out to be economically convenient to extend the tunnel for this purpose, even though the safety factor for the crew was not included. Also, the convenience of extra adits was carried out. In fact, the layout of the feasibility report included one extra adit for each tunnel in order to have an earlier tunnel completion. The findings suggest that these adits are not economically convenient as long as the project s electromechanical equipments take 34 months from their manufacturing to their assembly on project cavern...|$|R

40|$|Underground mining rock {{support for}} ground control, while {{necessary}} for {{safe and effective}} modern mining, is timeconsuming and expensive. The most common types of rock support in use today are the combination of rock bolts and mesh screens and various forms of shotcrete. More recently, innovative spray-on polymer linings {{have been developed for}} use as an alternative type of rock support. Initial research indicates that bolt and screen support is relatively inexpensive but is not as productive as either shotcrete or polymer linings and is not readily automated. Shotcrete is significantly more productive than using screen and bolts, but is considerably more expensive and requires substantially more material handling. Spray-on liners tend to have high material costs associated with them, but they result in significantly increased productivity and reduced material handling efforts compared to the other support systems. This paper compares the economic and productivity factors associated with bolt and screen, <b>shotcrete</b> and polymer <b>lining</b> underground rock support methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{influence}} of fire on the stability of tunnels. During {{the last few years}} a number of fires have taken place in tunnels. For example, the fires in the Channel and the Tauern tunnels took several human lives and caused significant damage to the tunnel structures. This thesis is a review of research on the influence of fire on the rock and rock reinforcement performed during the last 40 years. High temperature results in changes of the thermal, mechanical and physical properties of rock and rock reinforcement (<b>shotcrete,</b> bolts, concrete <b>lining).</b> During a fire damage to rock and concrete structures occur due to spalling. Failure and collapse of tunnels have occurred as a result of high temperatures. Spalling in concrete can be avoided by adding steel or polypropylene fibres. Some tests studied in this thesis investigate their influence on the fire resistance of concrete. Some methods for to estimating the decrease of the strength of concrete due to fire are presented. It is necessary to perform a more detailed investigation of the fire resistance of different types of rock, because rocks with low fire resistance should be additionally supported or protected. The influence of grouting on the fire resistance of rock should also be more investigated. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Shotcrete is {{a special}} type of {{concrete}} which was invented {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century and is nowadays an important support element for tunnels constructed with the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM). Immediately after tunnel excavation shotcrete is sprayed onto the tunnel walls at high pressure in order to provide temporary support. Unfortunately, in the past very little attention has been given to the development of sophisticated material laws for shotcrete, since its design and application was mainly based on experience. However, current design practice, such as that applied in the design of the new Crossrail tunnels, requires sophisticated modelling of shotcrete behaviour in numerical analysis of tunnel-soil interaction. Such models are not readily found in the literature, as they have been developed mainly for structural, rather than geotechnical applications. In this thesis, a constitutive model for the time-dependent behaviour of shotcrete has been developed within the framework of elasto-plasticity. Two independent yield surfaces control the behaviour of shotcrete in multiaxial loading conditions for both compression and tension. The model formulation is based on strain hardening/softening plasticity, where the expansion and contraction of the yield surfaces are governed by normalised plastic strains. Cracking of the shotcrete is considered within the smeared crack concept. Furthermore, the proposed material law includes the time-dependency of stiffness and strength behaviour. The reducing deformability of the shotcrete during cement hydration has been taken into account. The model has been extended to account for creep, shrinkage and hydration temperature induced deformations at early shotcrete ages. After a robust implementation into the Imperial College Finite Element Program (ICFEP), model calibration and validation have been performed for shotcrete experiments taken from the literature. The developed constitutive model has then been applied to the analysis of a typical tunnel construction in London Clay, modelling the early age material properties of the <b>shotcrete</b> tunnel <b>lining</b> in detail for various excavation schemes. Finally, it has been shown that the proposed constitutive model is capable of reproducing the complex behaviour of young shotcrete at early ages and can be applied successfully to boundary value problems in geotechnical engineering.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of the interaction between}} a new tunnel and existing structures is an important issue in urban areas. In this study, the effect of tunnelling on the existing Support system (i. e. shoterete lining and rock bolts) of an adjacent tunnel is firstly investigated using ABAQUS and TUNNEL 3 D through full three-dimensional (313) finite element calculations coupled with elasto-plastic material models, which takes into account the tunnelling procedure, the interaction between the shoterete lining and rock mass, the interaction between the rock bolts and rock mass, and the elasto-plastic behaviour of the rock mass, the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> and the rock bolts. Then, {{on the basis of the}} calculated results, it is Concluded that the driving of the new tunnel significantly affects the existing support system when the advancing tunnel face passes the existing support system and is minor when the face is far from it. Moreover, the support system in the side of the existing tunnel closest to the new tunnel is more significantly affected than that on the side opposite to the new tunnel. It is also found that in a region such as Sydney with relatively high horizontal regional stresses, the driving of the new tunnel will not cause considerable adverse effects on the existing Support system, if the new tunnel is driven horizontally parallel to the existing tunnel with a sufficient separation, since both the tensile stress in the existing <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> in the lateral sides of the preceding tunnel and the compressive stress at the crown decrease although noticeable tensile stress increments are observed on some parts of the existing rock bolts. Finally, it is pointed out that the effects of tunnelling on the existing Support system strongly depend on the position between the original and new tunnels. In terms of the stress increments on the existing Support system, especially the maximum tensile stress increments on the existing shoterete lining, the driving of the new tunnel causes increasingly adverse effects on the existing support system in a sequence of: (i) horizontally parallel tunnels with a separation of 30 m; (ii) horizontally parallel tunnels with a separation of 20 m; (iii) staggered tunnels with a separation of 30 m; (iv) vertically alignment tunnels; and (v) staggered tunnels with a separation of 20 in in the cases investigated in this Study.

40|$|The present work {{is divided}} in an introduction, four {{substantive}} chapters and conclusions. The first substantive chapter represents concrete in general – its history, basic components, {{as well as}} mechanical and other physical characteristics. Fibre reinforced concrete is presented next, followed by {{a brief history of}} adding fibres to materials and a description of concrete {{depending on the type of}} fibres used. Shotcrete and its dry and wet process of application is described at the end of the chapter. Second chapter focuses on the measurements of ultimate uniaxial compressive strenght of young steel fibre reinforced shotcrete, based on the test method recomended by RILEM. Test program consisted of three mixtures with different fibre content. Tests were performed on specimens after a period of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours. Specimens aged 1, 2, 3, 7 and 28 days were only tested for the ultimate compression strength. The data obtained this way leads to the fourth substantive chapter. The main principles of the NATM method are presented in chapter three together with the Dekani tunnel, as an example of successful application of steel fibre reinforced shotcrete. The last chapter contains parametric study, carried out to see how different contents of steel fibres in the mixture influence on tunnel excavation speed (at a constant thickness of <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining).</b> Study was based on data gathered during the construction of a new tunnel Ljubno tube on the highway section Peračica – Podtabor (Ljubljana – Jesenice). This tunnel was built according to the principles of the new Austrian tunneling method (NATM). Conclusions are presented at the end...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} geomechanical {{physical model}} is first constructed {{according to the}} similar simulation theory for a roadway excavated in inclined rock mass strata. The similar simulation model is then loaded in the laboratory using a self-designed YDM-E physical model testing device to observe the stress distribution and associated failure process of the roadway. For the roadway excavated in the rockmass strata with an inclined angle of 25 °, {{it is found that}} cracks are initiated firstly in the rockmass located in the right-upper corner of the roadway and then propagate and coalesce resulting in that the rock located in the right-upper corner of the roadway detaches from the roof and falls into the roadway causing the collapse of the roadway. An unsymmetrical supporting scheme is then proposed to use cablebolts to supplement the regular support system of <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> and rockbolts for the roadway excavated in the inclined rock mass strata, which ensures the stability of the roadway while saving the supporting costs. In the proposed unsymmetrical supporting scheme, additional cablebolts are installed in the direction where the failures and rock falls easily occur during the tunnelling of the roadway in the inclined rockmass strata. The proposed unsymmetrical supporting scheme is finally tested in a roadway excavated in the inclined rockmass strata of a coal mine. According to the continuous monitoring results in three months, it is found that the convergence between the roof and the floor of the roadway and that between the lateral walls become stable in about two months after the tunnelling of the roadway, and the separation of rock mass strata in both the rockbolt-reinforced zone and the cablebolt-reinforced zone is small, which indicates that the proposed unsymmetrical support scheme can ensure the stability of the roadway excavated in the inclined rockmass strata while keeping the supporting costs economical...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} the ground deformation and stress distribution around highway tunnels at various stages of excavation and for several support conditions using finite element modelling techniques. When ground is excavated and material removed the subsequent redistribution of stress in the remaining surrounding material needs to be treated by one of three methods. These are the gravity difference method, the stress reversal technique and the relaxation approach. The first two methods were chosen for the simulation of excavation in this study. The tunnel data are {{in the form of the}} dimensions of the tunnel, heights of the rock layers, details of the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> and tunnel support systems. A pre-processing program was written to transform this information into a finite element mesh in a format suitable for use by PAFEC-FE software. This enables different tunnel models and meshes to be produced with minimum error and time. The lack of adequate post-processing facilities available in PAFEC-FE dictated that computer programs needed to be written in order to reformat the textual output files and process the mesh stress and displacement outputs for graphical display using UNIRAS. In this way repeated use could be made of PAFEC-FE without time-consuming and error-prone manual retrieval of data. The tunnels were modelled at various stages of excavation and with such support provided at those stages as to allow the computed displacements to be compared with measurements made on highway tunnels in Turkey. The stresses generated in the tunnel supports and surrounding ground were also calculated to enable the possibility of damage or failure of the support structure or ground to be assessed and the selection of an optimal support system. Insertion of a support system into the model has a marginal effect on the development of rock strength around an excavation boundary...|$|E
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} concrete and shotcrete {{have often been}} used in tunnel linings and in other applications such as industrial floors and pavements. The mixing of fibres into concrete or shotcrete can cause the material to resist the opening of cracks during failure. The design of these materials {{is not the same}} as for normally {{reinforced concrete}}, and there is not much in the way of rational design methods currently available. In relation to tunnel lining design, the phenomenon of rock mass squeeze out, or the use of rock bolts to anchor the rock base can lead to point loads on a fibre reinforced <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining.</b> Therefore, this thesis investigates and develops the use of beam and panel tests which can be related a point load capacity to tunnel lining behaviour. The round determinate supported panel developed by Bernard (1999), is used in this manner for the evaluation of post-cracking behaviour in fibre reinforced concrete and shotcrete. Constitutive modeling of the behaviour of these panel specimens was carried out to assist in the interpretation of test results in the context of tunnel lining design. Yield line theory was then used to analyse the post-cracking behaviour of the fibre reinforced concrete and shotcrete panels to evaluate failure criteria. The cracks in round panels are always located at different positions in each panel test randomly. A probabilistic distribution function of crack position has therefore been determined using standard goodness of fit tests. The distribution function was then modelled using a Monte Carlo method to assess the effect of crack position on post-crack behaviour using yield line analysis. Experimental and numerical analyses have also been carried out to extend the experimental data and to assess the effect of thickness on the post-cracking behaviour of fibre reinforced shotcrete beams and panels. The test data from centrally loaded beam and round determinate supported panel tests was used to calibrate the numerical models. The principal outcomes of the research were successful modelling of post-crack behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete and shotcrete using yield line theory and prediction of cracking loads...|$|E
40|$|At LKAB’s {{underground}} {{mines in}} Malmberget and Kiruna in northern Sweden shotcrete and rock bolts {{are the main}} rock support elements. A safe working environment for the miners and high accessibility to the mine are important issues. To address these issues and to improve {{the use of the}} support, LKAB initiated a doctoral thesis study on the interaction between its rock support system and the rock. The objectives of this thesis were: to identify important parameters involved in the interaction between shotcrete and rock and if necessary investigate important quantities of these parameters, to improve the understanding of the interaction of shotcrete and rock. To achieve the first objective a number of laboratory and field tests were carried out. The second objective was achived by numerical analyses. The main conclusions are: The analyses showed that the rock strength and the unevenness of the surface had a large impact on the number of failures at the interface and in the lining. Furthermore, the behaviour of the lining was sensitive to small amplitudes of the surface roughness. A high bond strength was favourable according to the analyses. The results from the field tests showed the importance of the bond at the interface. If bond failure occurs the ability to distribute and control the crack width ceases. Failure mapping in the mine showed that that a thin shotcrete layer (< 20 mm) did not perform well. It is therefore, important that the designed thickness is achieved when shotcreting. The extent of the excavated damage zone had a minor effect on the behaviour of the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> if the surface was uneven. For an even surface, the influence of the extent of the EDZ on shotcrete was obvious but not serious. The rock support is generally designed for static loading conditions. In many cases, however, the openings are also subjected to dynamic loads. By field tests, vibration measurements and analyses the influence from blasting induced stress waves on the performance of shotcrete was investigated. The main conclusions are: Failure mapping showed that the fibre reinforced shotcrete has the ability to give stable conditions close to the drawpoint. The non-linear analyses showed fair agreement with the failure mapping. The single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model, though it is relatively simple, can be used to predict the response of an arbitrarily shaped rock wedge supported by shotcrete.

40|$|The use of New Austrian Tunnelling Method {{has become}} more popular in recent years. The {{construction}} has been observed to cause significant influence on the stress regime and ground deformations around the tunnel. However, current understandings {{on the construction of}} the NATM twin tunnel are still limited. The aims of the current research are to investigate the construction of the NATM tunnel in soft ground and to study factors that govern the ground responses associated with the construction. The study is done by performing a series of three-dimensional (3 D) numerical analyses. Computed results are compared with field measurements, empirical solutions as well as two-dimensional (2 D) numerical analyses results. Different construction sequences have significant effects on the stress re-distribution of the ground, resulting in different magnitude of ground deformations, magnitudes and distributions of lining thrusts. In all the construction sequences analysed in this research, stress paths show that substantial yielding of soil happens at the invert due to high lateral stress at the invert, which caused the collapse of the Heathrow Express Tunnel. Moreover, the length of the unsupported span (LU) is an important parameter in tunnelling in a way that significantly different ground surface settlements and lining thrusts are resulted. The behaviour of the single tunnel construction is investigated three-dimensionally and compared with the results of 2 D analyses. Results show that ground surface settlement profiles can be estimated reasonably well using the method of nodal force reduction. In additions, the amount of nodal force reduction required for matching 3 D analysis results is related to LU and the initial Ko conditions. Nevertheless, the distribution of lining thrust resulting from 2 D and 3 D analyses are very different. Construction of two parallel tunnels has been modelled three-dimensionally. Load redistribution mechanism of parallel tunnels depends on the lagged distance of the tunnel (LT). For small LT (LT = 0), the loadings associated with twin tunnel construction are shared by the ground in the vicinity of both tunnels and the <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining.</b> Stress paths show that the longer the LT, the more is the load attracted to the leading tunnel, resulting in different proportions of load sharing. Due to different load redistribution mechanisms, the bending moment in lining varies with LT. For the leading tunnel, the bending moment in the lining increases with LT, especially at the invert regions. On the other hand, it is seen that the maximum bending moment of the lagging tunnel decreases with LT. Furthermore, the resulting maximum ground settlement and the offset of the settlement trough varies with the LT. The maximum ground surface settlement shows a slightly decreasing trend because increasing amount of loading associated with the excavation of a neighbor parallel tunnel is transferred to the nearby lining of the leading tunnel with larger LT. As a result, {{at the end of the}} construction, the ground settlement trough is shifted towards the lagging tunnel. The offset increases with the lagged distance of the tunnel. Moreover, simple superposition of the single tunnel solutions is an inappropriate way to estimate the solution of the twin tunnel settlement profile, which underestimates the results from a twin tunnel analyses. On the contrary, LT does not seem to have significant effect on the excess pore water pressure at equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{demand of}} {{electricity}} in Nepal can be fulfilled by hydropower generation. The huge potentiality of hydropower generation in Nepal is mainly due to abundant water resources and available geographical head due to steep Rivers. In medium and large hydropower projects, {{huge amount of}} water discharge has to be handled form intake to power station and ultimately back to river again. Also, because of steep topography, the construction of pipe and canal {{on the surface of}} terrain could be very difficult and expensive for larger discharges. Hence, underground construction such as tunnels or shafts could only be the feasible options of water conveyance system for large discharges and in case of steep terrains. But, at the same time, there are higher risks and uncertainties associated with the underground works like tunnels and shafts or caverns. The main risks and uncertainties associated with the underground works are stress induced instability, water leakage, mud flows and finally the cost overrun during construction. When there is overstressing of rock mass that means rock stresses exceed the strength of rock mass, there will be stress induced instability in the tunnel. If the rock mass is very weak, schistose and deformable, squeezing phenomenon will occur with the development of plastic zone around the tunnel which causes excessive deformation of tunnel. In the Himalayan region, due to the high degree of schistocity, fracturing and shearing, weak rocks such as mudstone, shale, slate, phyllite, schist, highly schistose gneiss and the rock mass of the tectonic fault zones are not capable to withstand the high stresses. Basically, squeezing has been common phenomenon in the tunnels in these weak and deformable rock masses. In this thesis, Chameliya Hydroelectric Project (CHEP), located in far western region of Nepal, has been taken as the case study. In this project, huge squeezing problem occurred in about 800 m stretch of headrace tunnel from chainage 3 + 100 m to 3 + 900 m. The most affected section is about 550 m in between these chainages. At several locations in squeezing section, the tunnel wall closure (deformation) has been recorded well over 1. 0 m in an average and the maximum above 2. 0 m where the original tunnel diameter is 5. 2 m. Hence, the thesis basically deals with squeezing analysis of the case using different approaches. Rock types along the headrace tunnel alignment are dolomite, slate, talcosic phyllite and dolomite intercalated with phyllite. Mostly, talcosic phylite has been found in the squeezed section. The rock mass quality in the squeezed section is extremely poor to exceptionally poor. The main objectives of this thesis are the assessment of squeezing phenomenon, evaluation of stability of the tunnel and support pressure estimation. In this thesis, four main methods have been used to evaluate the squeezing phenomenon viz.; empirical methods such as Singh et al (1992) and Q-system (Grimstad and Barton, 1993), semi-analytical method such as Hoek and Marinos (2000), analytical method such as Convergence Confinement Method (Carranza-Torres and Fairhurst, 2000) and numerical program Phase 2. Initially, seventeen tunnel sections at different chainages have been taken into consideration. The squeezing prediction criteria, such as Singh et al (1992), Q-system and Hoek and Marinos (2000) approach, show that there is severe squeezing in last ten sections. Hence more detail squeezing analysis has been done for these ten sections using Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method, and support pressure has also been estimated using these two approaches and Barton et al. (1974) approach. Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method analysis show that there is significant amount of tunnel deformation to cause squeezing problems. The main factors that control the squeezing phenomenon are the rock mass parameters and rock stresses. Therefore, quality of squeezing analysis largely depends upon the correct estimation of these input parameters. The main components of rock stresses are gravity and tectonic stresses. The rock stresses in the project area were not measured, so Phase 2 program has been used to estimate the tectonic stress value from measured deformation. The tectonic stress value {{has been found to be}} equal to 3. 5 MPa in this area, but stress measurement will be necessary to verify this value. Uniaxial unconfined strength of intact rock in four tunnel sections has been back calculated from measured deformations using Phase 2 program and found to be in the range of 10 to 15 Mpa in the squeezed section. Later, the deformation has been calculated using Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method for improved intact rock strength and compared with Phase 2 result. All analyses show that there is significant deformation to cause squeezing problem. In CHEP, tunnel cross section has reduced considerably in several stretches of tunnel. Due to the excessive deformation, temporary supports were provided at several locations, steel ribs and lattice girders are buckled at several locations and <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> is also cracked. All these have to be removed before application of final lining. Finally, two different possible solutions have been studied using Phase 2 program to address the existing problems in squeezed section of the headrace tunnel. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{strive for}} a time-efficient {{construction}} process naturally put {{focus on the}} possibility of reducing the time of waiting between stages of construction, thereby minimizing the construction cost. If recently placed concrete, cast or sprayed, is exposed to impact vibrations at an early age while {{still in the process of}} hardening, damage that threatens the function of the hard concrete may occur. A waiting time when the concrete remains undisturbed, or a safe distance to the vibration source, is therefore needed. However, there is little, or no, fully proven knowledge of the length of this distance or time and there are no established guidelines for practical use. Therefore, conservative vibration limits are used for young and hardening concrete exposed to vibrations from e. g. blasting. As a first step in the dynamic analysis of a structure, the dynamic loads should always be identified and characterized. Here it is concluded that impact-type loads are the most dangerous of possible dynamic loads on young and hardening concrete. Shotcrete (sprayed concrete) on hard rock exposed to blasting and cast laboratory specimens subjected to direct mechanical impact loads have been investigated using finite element models based on the same analysis principles. Stress wave propagation is described in the same way whether it is through hard rock towards a <b>shotcrete</b> <b>lining</b> or through an element of young concrete. However, the failure modes differ for the two cases where shotcrete usually is damaged through loss of bond, partly or over larger sections that may result in shotcrete downfall. Cracking in shotcrete due to vibrations only is unusual and has not been observed during previous in situ tests. The study of shotcrete is included to demonstrate the need of specialized guidelines for cases other than for mass concrete, i. e. structural elements or concrete volumes with large dimensions in all directions. Within this project, work on evaluating and proposing analytical models are made in several steps, first with a focus on describing the behaviour of shotcrete on hard rock. It is demonstrated that wave propagation through rock towards shotcrete can be described using two-dimensional elastic finite element models in a dynamic analysis. The models must include the material properties of the rock and the accuracy of these parameters will greatly affect the results. It is possible to follow the propagation of stress waves through the rock mass, from the centre of blasting to the reflection at the shotcrete-rock interface. It is acceptable to use elastic material formulations until the strains are outside the elastic range, which thus indicates imminent material failure. The higher complexity of this type of model, compared with mechanical models using mass and spring elements, makes it possible to analyse more sophisticated geometries. Comparisons are made between numerical results and measurements from experiments in mining tunnels with ejected rock mass and shotcrete bond failure, and with measurements made during blasting for tunnel construction where rock and shotcrete remained intact. The calculated results are in good correspondence with the in situ observations and measurements, and with previous numerical modelling results. Examples of preliminary recommendations for practical use are given and it is demonstrated how the developed models and suggested analytical technique can be used for further detailed investigations. The modelling concept has also been used for analysis of impact loaded beams and concrete prisms modelled with 3 D solid elements. As a first analysis step, an elastic material model was used to validate laboratory experiments with hammer-loaded concrete beams. The laboratory beam remained un-cracked during the experiments, and thus it was possible to achieve a good agreement using a linear elastic material model for fully hardened concrete. The model was further developed to enable modelling of cracked specimens. For verification of the numerical results, earlier laboratory experiments with hammer impacted smaller prisms of young concrete were chosen. A comparison between results showed that the laboratory tests can be reproduced numerically and those free vibration modes and natural frequencies of the test prisms contributed to the strain concentrations that gave cracking at high loads. Furthermore, it was investigated how a test prism modified with notches at the middle section would behave during laboratory testing. Calculated results showed that all cracking would be concentrated to one crack with a width equal to the sum of the multiple cracks that develop in un-notched prisms. In laboratory testing, the modified prism will provide a more reliable indication of when the critical load level is reached. This project has been interdisciplinary, combining structural dynamics, finite element modelling, concrete material technology, construction technology and rock support technology. It is a continuation from previous investigations of the effect on young shotcrete from blasting vibrations but this perspective has been widened to also include young, cast concrete. The outcome is a recommendation for how dynamic analysis of young concrete, cast and sprayed, can be carried out with an accurate description of the effect from impact-type loads. The type of numerical models presented and evaluated will provide an important tool for the work towards guidelines for practical use in civil engineering and concrete construction work. Some recommendations on safe distances and concrete ages are given, for newly cast concrete elements or mass concrete and for newly sprayed shotcrete on hard rock. QC 20150529 </p...|$|E
