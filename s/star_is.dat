5|$|A neutron <b>star</b> <b>is</b> {{a highly}} dense remnant {{of a star}} that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron <b>star</b> <b>is</b> {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the <b>star</b> <b>is</b> located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars.

5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the <b>star</b> <b>is</b> likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the <b>star</b> <b>is</b> between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that most visible <b>stars</b> <b>are</b> binary: they have a nearby {{companion}} star, and these two stars orbit around each other.

5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable <b>star</b> <b>is</b> {{in a state of}} hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the <b>star</b> <b>is</b> cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant <b>star</b> <b>is</b> at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} of a <b>star</b> <b>is</b> {{the amount}} of light {{and other forms of}} radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a <b>star</b> <b>is</b> determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an {{equatorial}} bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this <b>star</b> <b>is</b> 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the <b>star</b> <b>is</b> 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous.

Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E

5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a <b>star</b> <b>is</b> located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole <b>star</b> <b>is</b> Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
