5|$|The Buccaneers broke their two-game {{losing streak}} as Ricky Bell set a club record with 167 rushing yards, while Doug Williams threw for two touchdowns and rushed for a third. The total of 228 rushing yards was 7 yards <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team record {{set in the}} {{previous}} game against the Packers, and left the Buccaneers as the only team with two rushers on pace to break the 1,000-yard mark. Packers quarterback David Whitehurst threw for a career-best 261 yards, although the Packers never entered the end zone. Jeris White intercepted a potential touchdown pass that slipped out of James Lofton's hands. The win left the Buccaneers at midseason having already achieved their highest win total ever.|$|E

The city of Houston's official 2010 census count was 600 <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> required number; however, as the city was expected to grow beyond 2.1 million shortly thereafter, the two additional districts were added for, and the positions filled during, the August 2011 elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Maryland {{started with the}} wind to their backs. Bill Walker kicked a punt that pinned Oklahoma on their own one-foot line. Oklahoma quarterback Gene Calame rushed twice to gain some {{breathing}} room before the Sooners punted it away. Maryland took over on the Oklahoma 37-yard line. Quarterback Charlie Boxold completed a nine-yard pass to Dick Nolan. Halfback Chet Hanulak then connected with Nolan again. That {{was followed by a}} first down by fullback Ralph Felton on the Oklahoma four-yard line. Hanulak rushed to pick up twoyards. Nolan then ran to the left but was stopped by Oklahoma back Larry Grigg for no gain. Hanulak rushed again to pick up one more yard. Felton rushed from the one-yard line, but was stopped sixinches <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end zone, and Maryland turned over on downs. Maryland again drove inside the Oklahoma 10-yard line. Wilkinson sent in the alternate line-up and Oklahoma again stopped Maryland short. The Sooners fumbled at their own 20-yard line, but the Terrapins again failed to capitalize.|$|E

Later in the game, he also stripped and recovered a fumble by Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin a yard <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endzone. In Week 15, he suffered a strained left hamstring at Houston and was therefore placed on injured reserve on December 23.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Devils' {{training}} camp, Morrison {{was signed}} by the team to a multi-year contract on September 9, 1997. He {{was seen as an}} unlikely candidate to secure a roster spot with the Devils; ahead of Morrison on the depth chart were numerous centres, including Doug Gilmour, Bobby Holík and Petr Sýkora. As such, he played the majority of the 1997–98 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Devils' minor league affiliate, the Albany River Rats. He scored 35 goals and 84 points over 72 games in the AHL, ranking first in team scoring and eighth in the League overall. He finished second among League rookies in scoring, eight points behind Daniel Brière of the Springfield Falcons, and was named to the AHL All-Rookie Team. His AHL season included a five-goal game against the Hartford Wolfpack on April 1, 1998; two of his goals came short handed into an empty net, as part of a 5–2 Albany win. The feat was one goal <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AHL's single-game record.|$|E
5|$|Ryan held a closed-door {{meeting with}} the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he {{explained}} that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed an overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.|$|E

5|$|With 174yards, Da'Rel Scott set the Maryland {{record for}} rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, despite playing just {{one and a half}} {{quarters}} due to his curfew suspension. The previous record was 165yards, set by Lu Gambino in Maryland's first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also broke the 1,000 yards-per-season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Scott said earlier in the year that reaching the 1,000-yard benchmark was a personal goal he set for the 2008 season. Between Scott and Davin Meggett, Maryland also came the closest it ever has to having both a 1,000- and 500-yard rusher in the same season. Meggett fell just 43yards <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 500-yard mark.|$|E
5|$|During their record-setting {{streak of}} sixteen {{consecutive}} losing seasons, the Phillies posted their franchise record for losses {{in a season}} in 1941 with 111, falling <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern (post-dead-ball era) Major League record of 120 losses in a season. During the 2007 season, the franchise also became the first professional sports team in American history to reach 10,000 losses. The Phillies have thrice surpassed the century mark for wins in a season: in 1976 with 101 wins, when they made their first playoff appearance in twenty-six seasons; again the next season when they matched that mark; and in 2011, when they set the franchise single-season record for wins with 102 victories and clinched a playoff position at the earliest point in team history. Philadelphia finished the 2010 season {{with a record of}} 97–65, marking {{the first time that the}} team completed a season with Major League Baseball’s best record; they duplicated this accomplishment in 2011 as the majors' only 100-win team. Since 2011, the Phillies have declined again and in 2015 they suffered the worst record in MLB and the franchise’s worst since an equally-poor record in 1969, with their worst before than from 1961.|$|E
5|$|During the Predators' {{training}} camp in September 2005, Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre-season games. Recovering {{in time for the}} season-opener, he debuted with the Predators on October 5, 2005, at home against the San Jose Sharks. Early in the game, Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when he touched the puck. Trailing 2–1 in the third period, he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game, en route to a 3–2 win. The following game, Kariya participated in his first NHL shootout (the tie-breaker was newly implemented by the League for the 2005–06 season) after the Predators remained tied with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2–2 following overtime. The last of three shooters for the Predators, Kariya was the lone player to score in the shootout, leading Nashville to a 3–2 win. The two wins helped Nashville go undefeated in their first eight games, two wins <b>shy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League's record for consecutive victories to start a season. On April 18, 2006, {{the last day of the}} regular season, Kariya scored a hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings in a 6–3 win, helping the Predators secure the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In his first season with Nashville, Kariya set team records with 31 goals, 54 assists and 85 points. His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore's team record set in 2002–03, while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning's mark set in 1998–99. With five shootout goals over seven attempts, Kariya ranked fourth in the NHL in shootout scoring percentage at 71.4% (among players who had taken at least five attempts). On a team basis, the Predators set franchise records with 49 wins and 106 points, ranking fourth in the West. Matching up against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Kariya opened the post-season with four assists in Game 1 to lead Nashville to a 4–3 win. After taking Game 1, the Predators went on to lose the next four contests and were eliminated from the playoffs. The team was markedly weakened for the playoffs with starting goaltender Tomáš Vokoun unavailable due to injury and Kariya's linemate Steve Sullivan playing hurt. Kariya had two goals and seven points over the series.|$|E
