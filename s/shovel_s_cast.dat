40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that third-order measurements are not correlated to lingual incisor features seen on radiographs. Material and Methods: The lateral headfilms of 38 untreated, norm-occlusion subjects without incisor abrasions or restorations were used for third-order measurements of upper and lower central incisors and assessment of the inclination of four sites suitable for lingual bracket placement {{with reference to the}} occlusal plane perpendicular. Lingual sections were determined by the tangents at the incisal fossa (S 1), at the transition plateau between incisal fossa and the cingulum (S 2), by a constructed line reaching from the incisal tip to the cingulum (S 3), and by a tangent at the cingulum convexity (S 4). Third-order angles were also assessed on corresponding dental casts using an incisor inclination gauge. Regression analysis was performed using the third-order measurements of both methods as the dependent variables and the inclination of the lingual enamel sections (S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4) as the independent variables. Results: The null hypothesis was rejected. For the most common bracket application sites located on the lingual <b>shovel</b> (<b>S</b> 1 and S 2), third-order inclination changes of 0. 4 - 0. 7 degrees are expected for each degree of change in the inclination of the lingual surface. The impact of bracket placement errors on third-order angulation is similar between sections S 1 and S 2 and the cingulum convexity (S 4). Section S 3 proved to be least affected by interindividual variation. Conclusion: The third-order measurements are correlated to lingual incisor features. Accordingly, third-order changes resulting from variation in lingual bracket placement can be individually predicted from radiographic assessments...|$|R

Examination of both cases confirms first, the importance of the mass nature of unemployment in fomenting initial protest action of the unemployed in the early 1920 s and early 1930 s; second, the critical role of external agents in developing and consolidating organizations of the unemployed; and third, that the allegedly deradicalizing effects of organization on the behaviour and objectives of poor people’s movements are exaggerated.

40|$|Abstract It is {{essential}} for democracy that political parties should act within their promulgated policy frameworks, which are formally represented in election programmes. If political parties deviate from this principle, the election would lose its meaning, jeopardising democracy. In this respect, planning in Groningen in the 1970 s, which realised progressive plans like the traffic circulation plan, was democratic, although it was criticised for lacking public participation. However, planning in the 1980 <b>s</b> <b>casts</b> serious doubt on its democratic nature. Various large-scale projects were promoted, and they caused harsh criticism even within the government party, Labour Party. This paper focuses on four projects, that is, the PTT (office development), Brink (residential towers), Casino and Museum, {{all of which were}} planned in or next to the inner city of Groningen in the 1980 s. This paper will examine these projects in terms of the policy frameworks of the Labour Party, which were created in the 1970 s. These projects brought about drastic change of historical landscape, and were clearly contrary to the party frameworks or those measures that were introduced to guarantee the frameworks, such as the local land use plan. As a result, they gave rise to not only strong opposition among citizens, but also criticism of party members who still cherished those party frameworks. ...|$|R
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} {{is the key}} variable when tackling seasonal to decadal climate forecasts. Dynamical models are unable to properly reproduce tropical climate variability, introducing biases that prevent a skillful predictability. Statistical methodologies emerge {{as an alternative to}} improve the predictability and reduce these biases. In addition, recent studies have put forward the non-stationary behavior of the teleconnections between tropical oceans, showing how the same tropical mode has different impacts depending on the considered sequence of decades. To improve the predictability and investigate possible teleconnections, the sea {{surface temperature}} based statistical seasonal foreCAST model (<b>S</b> 4 <b>CAST)</b> introduces the novelty of considering the non-stationary links between the predictor and predictand fields.

After elaboration, it was made a heat treatment and then a maintaining on a low temperature (- 70 °C). Cryogenic treatment is methodology of ultra-low temperature processing of materials to enhance their properties to the desired levels. Material subjected to deep cryogenic temperature develops a more uniform, redefined microstructure with greater density. Austenite, the softer molecules in the microstructure is transformed to harder martensite. The experimental tests at low temperature (- 70 °C), were done in a specific cryogenic installation attached to an impact strength resistance tester. This installation used carbon dioxide solid like a cooling agent and ethylic alcohol as a cryogenic liquids.

40|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{is one of}} {{the traditional}} uses of public lands recognized under various federal laws and has occurred on those lands well before the existence of those laws. The federal government is the largest landowner in the 11 western states with about 42 % of the total land base, which varies from 22 % in Washington to 86 % in Nevada. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U. S. Forest Service (USFS) manage most of the federal lands where grazing occurs. Local communities have been established and evolved throughout the rural parts of the western United States with varying degrees of dependency on a ranching industry that has incorporated public land forage as an important part of seasonal forage supply. The questions we address here are who the public land ranchers are, what might be their motivations for owning the ranch, and how that information can be used in policy formulation and analysis. Approximately 85 % of federal land is grazed by domestic livestock (CAST 1996). The two management agencies administer about 29, 925 grazing permits across the West with 21, 018 unique permittees (Gentner and Tanaka 2002).
