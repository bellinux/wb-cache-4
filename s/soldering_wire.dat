40|$|Intaglio and woodblock printDimensions: 15 ½ x 11 ¼ in. (39. 37 x 28. 58 cm) Markings: (in pencil {{at bottom}} of print) 8 / 35 Spring Field Artist's signature: (in pencil at bottom of print) Tokio MiyashitaFrom 1946 through 1948, Tokio Miyashita studied woodcut {{printing}} techniques with Hiratsuka Unichi; {{a year later}} he studied metal plate printing processes with Komai Tetsuro and Sekino Junichiro. His early works are representational, focusing on the neighborhood in Tokyo where he was raised. In the early 1960 ’s he began to experiment, combining printing processes with knowledge and materials he gained from his father, who was a metal dealer. He developed his signature rough black line by <b>soldering</b> <b>wire</b> to zinc etching plates. As he progressed as an artist his compositions became increasingly planar, impressing the viewer with a feeling of looking through or into another world. He was represented in numerous biennales internationally such as Tokyo 1960 - 68, Ljubljana 1965 and 1968, and Sao Paulo 1967. His prints can be found in museums such as the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the British Museum, London. This print exemplifies the beginning of Miyashita’s experimentation in combining printmaking processes. By this point in his career he had moved from representational to abstract work and began to develop the dark soldered wire line that would become his trademark. Here we see the rough mark separating colors, textures, and objects within an imagined space, combining intaglio and woodcut processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of superconducting millimeter and submillimeter-wave circuits often requires RF ground connections. These are usually made by <b>soldering,</b> <b>wire</b> bonding, conductive adhesive or conductive wire gaskets. The difficulty of assembly increases with frequency as chip {{dimensions and tolerances}} shrink. The assembly issues, and also the throughput requirements of large radio astronomy projects such as ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array), suggest the need of a beam lead technology for these circuits. Beam lead processes are already established for silicon and gallium arsenide wafers. However, niobium circuits on quartz substrates present unique difficulties. SIS junctions introduce additional thermal and chemical constraints to process development. For quartz, wet etches are isotropic and dry etches with high etch rates require large ion energies. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} develop a conventional process in which gold pads on the substrate surface are formed into beam leads by a backside etch. Instead we have developed a topside process in which, after the mixer circuits are completed, dicing cuts are made at the finished chip dimensions but only partly through the wafer. The dicing cuts are then filled with a sacrificial material in a non-CMP process, and planarized. Gold plated pads are then defined, overhanging the planarized cuts. The sacrificial material is then removed from these cuts, leaving the gold beam leads. The wafer is then backside lapped into the cuts to the desired thickness, separating the individual chips. We discuss the new planarization scheme developed for this beam lead process and compare a variety of sacrificial materials. Index terms- beam leads, Nb, SIS, quartz, epox...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Regarding the {{numerous}} problems of solderers in electronic industries {{because of their}} exposure to Acids, bases and fumes of soldering,a study was carried out on 107 solderers and administrative personels of a factory producing electronic appliances in Tehran to inspect the long term effects of soldering on lung functions Inspection. Methods: At first, 47 solderers and 66 controls (totally 107 persons) were selected randomly. All the solderers were working in the manual soldering section and used the <b>soldering</b> <b>wire</b> made of an alloy (composed of plumbum, Stannum and special oil of soldering called flux). The persons controls worked in the administrative sections of the same factory and for the same hours as the solderers, {{but they did not}} have any soldering experience. After they filled the standard respiratory questionnaire, spirometry was done at least 3 times on each of them under the same conditions and according to the ACT criteria (No smokers included in the study) Results:The spirometry parameters of the two groups were compared. There was {{a significant difference in the}} average FEF 25 : 75 % (P= 0. 03). Also,there was a significant difference in the average FEV 1 /FVC P= 0. 026 and PEFR (P= 0. 04) between two groups. After controling the altering age factor. ameaningful relation between the years of work in soldering section and decrease in the spirometry parameters related to FED 25 - 75 % and FEV 1 /FVC was seem. Also. the frequency of the signs of nasal and eyes initation in the solderer group was more than the other group (p= 0. 007) Cough and Asthma related to ork had no meaningful difference in the two groups. Conclsion :It seem that in the above study, soldering is a factor decreasing the spirometry parameters with a blocking pattern, especilly in smal airways. This study was done in the direction of the former studies done in other countries and emphasizes on the need for necessary preventive action in this profession, uch as effective local ventilation and use of alternative substances...|$|E

40|$|The {{designs of}} three compact {{dual-band}} monopole antennas for wireless-local-area-network (WLAN) applications are presented. In these designs, an L-or U-shaped monopole element with microstrip-fed {{is used to}} generate a high-frequency band at around 5. 5 GHz to cover the high WLAN bands at 5. 2 / 5. 8 GHz for the IEEE 802. 11 a standard. An E-shaped element, loop element or meander-microstrip ground stub element with coupled-fed through the monopole element is used to generate a low-frequency band at around 2. 4 GHz to cover the low WLAN band for the IEEE 802. 11 b/g standards. With such arrangements, the three antenna shave very compact radiators of only 11. 3 × 8 mm 2, 12. 6 × 9 mm 2 and 11. 8 × 9. 4 mm 2. To investigate the performances for practical uses, these antennas are also designed on a mobile-phone printed-circuit board and studied using computer simulation and measurement. Dual-band antennas with reconfigurable Dual-band antennas with reconfigurable lower band, higher band and dual-band are designed in this thesis. The dual-band antenna consists of two radiating branches generating the frequency bands at around 2. 4 GHz and 3. 5 GHz for the WiMAX system. Varactors are placed on the corresponding branches for continuously tuning of the operating bands for different WiMAX standards. For frequency tuning of the lower band or higher band, simple and novel DC biasing circuits without requiring any <b>soldering</b> <b>wire</b> are proposed to bias the varactor on a radiating element. While for simultaneous frequency tuning of the two individual bands, simple and novel DC biasing circuits requiring two soldering wires are proposed to bias the varactors on the radiating elements. Both simulation and measurement {{results show that the}} DC biasing circuits designed have very little affects on the antennas performances. The design of a monopole ultra-wide band (UWB) antenna with a reconfigurable notch band is presented. The antenna employs a vertical-ellipse radiator to achieve an UWB. A compact defected-ground structure (DGS) is used to create a notch band for the antenna. To frequency tune the notch band, a varactor is placed on the DGS to control the resonance frequency. The tuning performance, in terms of reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, efficiency and gain, of the antennais studied using simulation and measurement. Results show that the notch band can be tuned continuously from 5. 2 to 6. 32 GHz for the WLAN bands. In the measurement of a monopole antenna with a small ground plane, the feeding cable used to connect the antenna to the measurement equipment Satimo Starlab system causes discrepancies between the simulated and measured radiation patterns, efficiencies and peak gains at lower frequencies. In the designs of antennas in this thesis, the cable effects are studied by modeling the feeding cable using the EM simulation tool CST. Results show that, by using the cable model, the simulated and measured results agree very well. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
