5|$|The Burger King v. Hoots {{trademark}} {{dispute and}} its resulting decision {{went beyond the}} original case, it established a major legal precedent in the United States {{in regards to the}} Lanham Act. The ruling states that while the senior user of the state <b>service</b> <b>mark</b> or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks, federal statute overrides the earlier, state <b>service</b> <b>mark</b> and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of the federally registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user.|$|E
5|$|When Burger King {{expanded}} into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name Whopper in its local advertising and stores {{due to a}} prior state registered <b>service</b> <b>mark</b> owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger. The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates, who became the CEO of Whopper Burger {{after the death of}} her husband in 1983, retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Hoots {{decision}} would again affect Burger King {{as it moved}} into the state of Texas. When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product, the Whopper, in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state registered <b>service</b> <b>mark</b> owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger.

25|$|The Racing Stripe, officially {{known as}} the <b>Service</b> <b>Mark,</b> was {{designed}} in 1964 by the industrial design office of Raymond Loewy Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image. Loewy had designed the colors for the Air Force One fleet for Jackie Kennedy. President Kennedy {{was so impressed with}} his work, he suggested that the entire Federal Government needed his make-over and suggested that he start with the Coast Guard. First used and placed into official usage as of April 6, 1967, it consists of a narrow blue stripe, a narrow white stripe between, and a broad CG red bar with the Coast Guard shield centered. The stripes are canted at a 64 degree angle, coincidentally the year the Racing Stripe was designed.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable {{instance}} of a continuing concurrent use registration is that of Holiday Inn. Although the national chain owns numerous trademark registrations, there is one registration for an unrelated [...] "Holiday Inn" [...] which is [...] "restricted to the area comprising the town of Myrtle Beach, S.C.". The Myrtle Beach hotel had used that name since the 1940s, and initiated a concurrent use proceeding in 1970. While this proceeding was pending, the national chain commenced an action in the United States District Court. The concurrent use proceeding was suspended during the pendency of the federal litigation, {{which resulted in a}} judgment in 1973 authorizing the Myrtle Beach hotel to use a distinctive, noninfringing Holiday Inn <b>service</b> <b>mark</b> within the Town of Myrtle Beach. The concurrent use proceeding resumed, and in 1976, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals awarded the Myrtle Beach hotel a federal trademark registration.|$|E

Michelle Obama {{had returned to}} the White House on the morning of November 15, going to sleep shortly after arriving. An usher went to check on her later that day and began talking about the shooting, assuming she already knew about the incident. According to Leonnig, the first lady was [...] "furious", wondering why the director of the Secret <b>Service,</b> <b>Mark</b> J. Sullivan, who had accompanied her on her flight back to Washington, had not told her about it. Leonnig also stated that Sullivan was subsequently summoned to a meeting with the first lady, during which she [...] raised her voice so loudly she could be heard through the closed door. Sullivan disputes this report, though he declined to give any details regarding the conversation. A detailed inspection of the White House for evidence or damage and interviews with key witnesses began later that afternoon. Leonnig also stated that president Obama was angered over the flawed response and the failure to notify the first lady. According to one presidential aide, [...] "the shit really hit the fan" [...] when Obama returned from his travels five days later.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States {{protection}} of coats of arms {{is for the}} most part limited to specific units of the armed forces, with a few exceptions. George Washington, [...] in personal correspondence, expressed opposition to establishment of a national heraldic authority, though he made use of his own ancestral arms. Personal coats of arms may be freely assumed but the right to these blazons is not protected in any way. It is possible that a coat of arms could be successfully protected as a trademark or <b>service</b> <b>mark,</b> but, in general, such protection is reserved for commercial use as a mark connected with a good or service, and not as a heraldic coat of arms. For example, the University of Texas at Austin has registered its emblem and coat of arms for use in its capacity as an institution of higher education. Moreover, such protection presumes a specific graphic design or work of art, while blazon is a description which may be widely interpreted artistically. [...] A specific coat of arms could be protected by copyright as a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work. [...] The usual requirements of originality and artistic creativity would need to be met; neither notice nor registration is required but may be advisable.|$|E
