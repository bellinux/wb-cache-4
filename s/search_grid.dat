According to Ahmed (2006), {{search and rescue}} is an operation conducted by personnel of the emergency organizations who is trained and have the skills in search and rescue to find the person(s) in distress or difficult area such as in mountains, deserts, forest or at sea [1].

However, no previous study {{has focused on the}} effects of the code <b>search</b> <b>grid</b> size on the code phase measurement accuracy of open-loop tracking. Traditional open-loop tracking methods are performed by the batch correlators with fixed correlation space. The code <b>search</b> <b>grid</b> size, which is the correlation space, is a constant empirical value and the code phase measuring accuracy will be largely degraded due to the improper grid size, especially when the signal carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N 0) varies. In this study, the Adaptive Correlation Space Adjusted Open-Loop Tracking Approach (ACSA-OLTA) is proposed to improve the code phase measurement dependent pseudo range accuracy. In ACSA-OLTA, the correlation space is adjusted according to the signal C/N 0. The novel Equivalent Weighted Pseudo Range Error (EWPRE) is raised to obtain the optimal code <b>search</b> <b>grid</b> sizes for different C/N 0. The code phase measuring errors of different measurement calculation methods are analyzed for the first time. The measurement calculation strategy of ACSA-OLTA is derived from the analysis to further improve the accuracy but reduce the correlator consumption.
