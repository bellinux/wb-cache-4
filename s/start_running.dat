5|$|On 6 May, it was {{reported}} that The Jacobite season was likely to start late due to the suspension. The trains, which run on the West Highland Line in Scotland, were due to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> on 11 May {{for the start of the}} 2015 season. Following the lifting of the ban on 8 May, it was announced that The Jacobite trains would run as scheduled from 11 May.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E

5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do incomplete passing plays. Suggs gained nine yards on a run up the middle, then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after an incomplete pass by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw an incomplete pass, and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may <b>start</b> <b>running</b> express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E

25|$|A seventh corridor, and {{the third}} for Manhattan, the M60 125th Street–Triborough Bridge–Astoria Boulevard bus route to LaGuardia Airport, was {{converted}} to SBS on May 25, 2014; local service was replaced by other routes running alongside {{the route of the}} M60 (the M100, M101, Bx15, and Q19). An eighth Select Bus Service route was planned in the 2014–2017 Financial Plan. The eighth Select Bus Service corridor (ninth route overall), and the fourth in Manhattan, was for the M86 running on 86th Street, which was originally scheduled to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> on June 28, 2015, but pushed back to July 13, 2015; it does not include a major change in stops.|$|E

25|$|Since corporatisation of KTMB, a {{programme}} of modernisation {{has been}} underway. In 1989, it embarked on the double-tracking and electrification of trunk line between Rawang and Seremban and the branch lines between Batu Junction and Sentul, and between Kuala Lumpur and Port Klang which allowed the KTM Komuter service to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> in 1995. The next major project was the Rawang-Ipoh double tracking and electrification project, {{which started in}} 2000, but the project has been repeatedly delayed by contractual disputes and {{is not expected to}} be ready before 2007. When complete, KTM expects to introduce frequent intercity service (16 trains/day) running at speeds of up to 160km/hour. In 2002, the Malaysian government proposed the ambitious project of electrifying and double-tracking the entire western line and awarded contracts in 2003. The project was however put on hold by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi until March 2007 when Deputy Prime Minister Mohd Najib Abdul Razak announced the project's revival. In April 2007, the government announced that contracts for certain portions of the project had been awarded. In 2007, work also started to electrify and double-track the stretch of track between Sentul and Batu Caves.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, Brunell led the Jaguars 73 yards in nine plays, {{featuring}} a 41-yard completion to Smith, {{and finished the}} drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Smith 4:28 into the game. After the ensuing kickoff, Jacksonville cornerback Aaron Beasley intercepted Marino's first pass {{of the game and}} returned it five yards to the Dolphins 41-yard line, setting a 45-yard field goal from Mike Hollis. Following a three-and-out for Miami, Tom Hutton's 57-yard punt pinned the Jaguars back at their own 9-yard line. But two plays later, Taylor took off down the right sideline for an NFL playoff record 90-yard touchdown run. Then on Miami's next possession, defensive end Tony Brackens forced a fumble from Marino and dove on the ball. With most players on both teams thinking he was down by contact, Brackens got up and started celebrating while the Dolphins offense walked off the field, but his teammate Bryce Paup realized that no one had touched Brackens and the play was still ongoing. He ran up to Brackens, shoved him in the back, and told him to <b>start</b> <b>running,</b> and Brackens ended up returning the ball 16 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|After Jesse Owens {{returned}} from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers {{that had been made}} to employ him had been nothing more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins, who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse. As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkins’ son, Robinson had told Owens that he should <b>start</b> <b>running</b> demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds when no one else was offering him employment or helping him financially. Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.|$|E

500|$|Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com {{ranked the}} episode [...] 5 on her [...] "Top 10 Episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants" [...] list. She said [...] "While Rock Bottom {{is mostly a}} goofy episode, it's {{also one of the}} scarier episodes of SpongeBob." [...] She also said the episode has [...] "the ideal balance of cuteness and sheer terror – like SpongeBob running from a mysterious character, saying, 'Well, that place will be there tomorrow. I guess I'd better keep walking. Running. Better <b>start</b> <b>running.</b> Running. Sprinting! Yes, I just gotta keep sprinting!' (Before he hits a wall; 'Sitting, sitting, bleeding.')"

500|$|Another {{piece of}} work which {{attempted}} to justify the retreat maneuver and to present it as a highly strategic calculation was Berthier's Relation de la bataille de Marengo, published in 1804. Berthier suggests that time had {{to be given to}} Desaix and Boudet's division to occupy their positions: [...] "The enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat, while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion." [...] However, it is known that Desaix's arrival, while definitely expected, was not certain before the retreat. The bulletin explains that Desaix's forces were waiting in reserve with artillery pieces, which in reality was false, because they arrived late in the battle. Several participants to the fighting reveal the precarious condition of the army throughout the day, including Marmont in his Memoirs, Captain Coignet: [...] "We were retreating in good order but all ready to <b>start</b> <b>running</b> at the earliest sign of danger", Captain Gervais: [...] "In this battle, we were many times {{on the verge of being}} defeated. The enemy cavalry, on a terrain favourable to this arm, charged us repeatedly. We were often obliged to concentrate and even to retreat", and General Thévenet: [...] "There is no doubt that a part of the French army was repelled up to the Scrivia".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{released}} on December 13, 2013 through the iTunes Store, {{in addition to a}} clip for every other track on the parent album. On November 24, 2014 the clip was also uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. A behind-the-scenes video was also released online on December 2, 2014, featuring commentary by director Åkerlund. The concept behind the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] revolves around Beyoncé leading a revolution. The video begins with quick shots of a desolate parking lot. Beyoncé then appears with a balaclava which she uses to cover her face up to the eyes. She is seen walking slowly towards the camera, as other people start joining her with flags and bats in their hands. Later in the video, she takes the mask off and the people surrounding her set [...] various objects on fire using Molotov cocktails, write graffiti on walls, and break a car. Beyoncé is later seen holding a man with a mask who is laying on the ground. The end of the video sees the protesting group facing a line of SWAT policemen. They <b>start</b> <b>running</b> towards them and as the video comes to its end Beyoncé holds hands with the person next to her which is the same man she hugged {{on the ground in the}} previous scene. For the look in the video, she donned a cropped T-shirt, pants designed by Åkerlund, a green scarf by Michael Schmidt, shoes by Rodarte and rings by Lynn Ban.|$|E
