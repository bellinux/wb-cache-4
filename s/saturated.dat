5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes <b>saturated</b> (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming <b>saturated.</b> Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become <b>saturated.</b>|$|E

These adders {{have only a}} single carrypropagate adder on the critical delay path, yet produce the same results that would be obtained if the additions were performed serially with saturation after each operation. When used with parallel <b>saturating</b> multipliers or multiplyaccumulate units, these adders signi cantly improve the performance of GSM speech coders. They can also easily be modi ed to perform either <b>saturating</b> or wraparound multioperand addition, based on an input control signal. Since parallel <b>saturating</b> multioperand adders have more area and less delay than serial <b>saturating</b> multioperand adders, they are suitable for high-performance digital signal processing systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Fixed-point <b>saturating</b> {{arithmetic}} {{is widely}} used in media and digital signal processing applications. A number of processor architectures provide instructions that implement <b>saturating</b> operations. However, standard high-level languages, such as ANSI C, provide no direct support for <b>saturating</b> arithmetic. Applications written in standard languages have to implement <b>saturating</b> operations in terms of basic two’s complement operations. In order to provide fast execution of such programs {{it is important to}} have an optimizing compiler automatically detect and convert appropriate code fragments to hardware instructions. We present a set of techniques for automatic recognition of <b>saturating</b> arithmetic operations. We show that in most cases the recognition problem is simply one of Boolean circuit equivalence. Given the expense of solving circuit equivalence, we develop a set of practical approximations based on abstract interpretation. Experiments show that our techniques, while reliably recognizing <b>saturating</b> arithmetic, have small compile-time overhead. We also demonstrate that our approach is not limited to <b>saturating</b> arithmetic, but is directly applicable to recognizing other idioms, such as add-with-carry and absolute value...|$|R

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of whole, <b>saturate,</b> and aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures from flare pit and crude oil sources were evaluated using Lumbricus terrestris. Body burden {{analysis was used}} to analyze the intrinsic {{toxicity of}} the six hydrocarbon mixtures. The major fractions of the whole mixtures, the <b>saturate,</b> and aromatic fractions had different intrinsic toxicities; the aromatics were more toxic than the <b>saturates.</b> The toxicity of the <b>saturate</b> and aromatic fractions also differed between the mixtures. The flare <b>saturate</b> mixture was more toxic than the crude <b>saturate</b> mixture, while the crude aromatic mixture was more toxic than the flare aromatic mixture. The most dramatic difference in toxicity of the two sources was between the flare whole and crude whole mixtures. The crude whole mixture was very toxic; the toxicity of this mixture reflected the toxicity of the crude aromatic fraction. However, the flare whole mixture was not toxic, {{due to a lack of}} partitioning from the whole mixture into the lipid membrane of the exposed worms. This lack of partitioning appears to be related to the relatively high concentrations of asphaltenes and polar compounds in the flare pit whole mixture...|$|R
