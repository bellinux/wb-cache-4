5000|$|Forward <b>sensing</b> <b>control</b> uses {{collision}} avoidance sensors to avoid collisions with other AGV in the area. These sensors include: sonic, which work like radar; optical, which uses an infrared sensor; and bumper, physical contact sensor. Most AGVs {{are equipped with}} a bumper sensor of some sort as a fail safe. Sonic sensors send a “chirp” or high frequency signal out and then wait for a reply from {{the outline of the}} reply the AGV can determine if an object is ahead of it and take the necessary actions to avoid collision. [...] The optical uses an infrared transmitter/receiver and sends an infrared signal which then gets reflected back; working on a similar concept as the sonic sensor. The problems with these are they can only protect the AGV from so many sides. They are relatively hard to install and work with as well.|$|E

We hypothesized that childhood school desegregation adversely affected the <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> of in later life, {{and that this}} reduced <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> accounts in part for reduced physical performance. Methods In-home follow-up assessments were completed in 2010 with 582 of the 58 – 74 [*]year old men and women participating in the on-going African American Health cohort. We used these data {{to examine the relationship}} between (a) retrospective self-reports of attending segregated schools during one’s 1 st -to- 12 th grade education and one’s current <b>sense</b> of <b>control,</b> as well as (b) the {{association between}} current <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> and physical performance. Multiple linear regression analysis with propensity score re-weighting was used. Results Attending segregated schools for at least half of one’s 1 st -to- 12 th grade education was significantly associated with higher scores on the <b>sense</b> of <b>control.</b> Adjusting for all covariates and potential confounders, those receiving half or more of their 1 st -to- 12 th grade education in segregated schools had <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> scores that were. 886 points higher (p [*]≤[*]. 01; standardized effect size[*]=[*]. 22). <b>Sense</b> of <b>control</b> scores were independently (all p [*] Conclusions Childhood school desegregation was adversely associated with the <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> of African Americans in later life, and this reduced <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> appears, in part, to account for their poorer physical performance. The etiologic mechanism through which childhood school segregation at the time that this cohort experienced it improved the <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> in later life, which subsequently led to better physical performance, has not been identified. We suspect, however, that the pathway involves greater exposure to racial solidarity, same-race students as peer role models and same-race teachers and principals as authority role models, the reduced likelihood of exposure to race-based discrimination or antagonism during their formative early lives, and greater exposure to encouragement and support for academic and life success. </p...|$|R

Three studies demonstrate that the motive for a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> can increase the desire for a romantic partner who is likely to provide a <b>sense</b> of <b>control.</b> When the sociopolitical system is threatened, men are more interested in warm, caring, submissive women consistent with ‘benevolent’ sexist ideals of femininity (Study 1). Women, on the other hand, are less interested in men consistent with the masculine stereotype as assertive, independent, and achievement-oriented to the extent that a relationship with these men can diminish their <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> (Study 2). Threatening beliefs in personal control produced the same effect on women’s romantic interest in stereotypically masculine men, which supports the observed effects of system threat as due to motive for a <b>sense</b> of <b>control.</b> But when women perceive these men as benevolent, external sources of control, they remain interested in these men when threatened (Study 3).

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) algorithm for load protection based on output <b>sensing</b> <b>control.</b> All MPPTs are based on input sensing and there is a drawback in applications which load protection is essential. This drawback can be addressed by applying two more sensors at the output. However having two sensors at input side as well as two more at output will increase the size and cost of the controller. To address this drawback without the need {{to increase the number of}} sensors, a novel control system and tracking algorithm based on the output <b>sensing</b> <b>control</b> and P&O algorithm is proposed. The main difference of the proposed control system with existing systems is, moving the control sensors from input side to output side of controller and consequently, apart from providing MPPT algorithm, controller is also able to do load protection at the same time. To demonstrate how the system operates in normal MPPT mode as well as how it operates for the load protection, the system is tested with different resistive loads and the simulation results indicate the feasibility and improved functionality of the system.

40|$|A {{robust and}} {{consistent}} {{relationship has been}} shown between socioeconomic status and health, {{and it has been}} suggested that psychosocial factors partially explain this relationship because they can operate at all levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and they can explain the findings concerning relative SES. The present research examined the proposal that control beliefs is one psychosocial factor which may explain the relationship between SES and health. Because of the complexity of the control field, care was taken to choose a suitable approach to control. Skinner's conceptualisation, which was chosen, has three key aspects. One aspect is the differentiation between capacity beliefs and strategy beliefs. A second is that the approach argues that it is the combination of these two beliefs which produces a <b>sense</b> of <b>control.</b> The third aspect is the proposal that a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> can be gained through any 'means' when it is believed that the person has access to the 'means' of <b>control.</b> Multidimensional <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> was the term given to describe this conceptualisation. A Multidimensional <b>Sense</b> of <b>Control</b> Scale (MSOCS) was developed for the present study because no suitable measure was available. 'Means' of control were selected for inclusion in the MSOCS, items were written for these 'means' and a content analysis was performed. Exploratory factor analyses revealed sets of items which loaded highly on the appropriate factor with very few cross-loadings. Using an independent sample, the factor structure for five 'means' (ability, family, friends, luck, and money) was tested using confirmatory factor analysis. The hypothesised model fitted significantly better than competing models. The subscales showed reasonable internal reliability, convergent validity analyses revealed expected relationships and the subscales were also shown to have reasonable consistency over a six week period. As a whole, these analyses indicated that, while improvements could be made to the measure, it was of sufficient quality to be used in the present study. The present study considered hypotheses concerning the role of <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> (from the five distinct 'means' and overall) in the relationship between SES (education, household income and community deprivation) and health (self-reported). The sample of 580 was drawn from the New Zealand Electoral Role and completed a mail questionnaire. Analyses were performed using multiple regression. All three indicators of SES were associated with health at the bivariate level, while only household income was independently associated once age was controlled and all three indicators were considered together. All indicators of SES were associated with an overall <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> at the bivariate level. However, only level of educational attainment and level of household income were associated once age was controlled and all three indicators were considered together. Indicators of SES were positively associated with a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through 'ability', 'family', 'luck', and 'money'. However the relationship between SES and <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> was not as simple as anticipated with different indicators of SES being associated with a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through different 'means'. Level of educational attainment was independently associated with a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through 'ability' and 'luck' while level of household income was independently associated with a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through 'family' and 'money'. The direction of all relationships were in the hypothesised direction and some were in the opposite direction from that found using different measures of control beliefs, which is consistent with what was expected based on the multidimensional <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> approach. A greater overall <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> was positively associated with health while only a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through 'luck' and 'money' were independently associated with health once age was controlled. Mediational analyses showed that both an overall <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> and a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> through 'money' partially mediated the relationship between level of household income and health. This supported the suggestion by some authors that psychosocial factors will help explain the relationship between SES and health. This thesis has made a number of important contributions to understanding in these areas. It has confirmed that capacity beliefs and strategy beliefs are different and so should be measured separately. It has also shown that beliefs about different 'means' of control differ and so these also should be measured separately. The hypothesis testing analyses showed that different indicators of SES are related to a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> from different 'means'. These analyses also showed that an overall <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> and a <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> from 'money' mediated the relationship between household income and health. These issues are discussed in regard to the need for further research in these areas...|$|R

Methods The authors analyzed data from 2, 592 U. S. households in the 1995 survey of the Aging, Status, and the <b>Sense</b> of <b>Control</b> study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether <b>sense</b> of personal <b>control</b> and social support were associated with DM and whether gender, race, and Hispanic ethnicity modified these associations. Results After adjusting for age, obesity, and socioeconomic position, a one point increase in <b>sense</b> of <b>control</b> (i. e., a stronger <b>sense</b> of <b>control)</b> was associated a significant reduction in risk of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 47, 0. 95).
