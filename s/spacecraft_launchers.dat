40|$|The Department of Defense (DoD) Space Test Program (STP) has {{developed}} a new capability to deploy small satellites from the NASA Space Shuttle or other manned reusable space systems. For STS 116, launched in December 2006, STP developed and flew two new types of small satellite deployment systems; the Space Shuttle Picosat Launcher (SSPL) and the Canister for All Payload Ejection (CAPE). Both SSPL and CAPE are designed {{to take advantage of}} very small volumes available in the Shuttle’s payload bay to launch into LEO small satellite experiments, in two different form factors. Because STP is the organization responsible for providing launch services for all of DoD’s R 2 ̆ 6 D space experiments and has used the Shuttle extensively in the past for its experiments, a concerted effort began seeking means to continue use of the Shuttle despite these new limitations. STP recognized that, although the Shuttle’s payload capacity was extremely limited because of its primary use for ISS assembly and logistics, virtually every flight has some available mass and volume for small deployable payloads. To make use of this limited resource, the launchers had to be compact, require little electrical power and crew time and use only standard Shuttle interfaces, and of course, be safe for manned vehicle flight. Additionally, because of advances in micro-electronics, space experiments require less and less volume and mass. STP evaluated potential capabilities and decided that two types of launchers would be most useful. The first type would be able to deploy small satellites with a cylindrical volume of 22 by 52 inches (a Nano or Microsat class), the second type would be a Picosat class with a volume of 5 by 5 by 10 inches. This paper will present the development history and first flight results of both the SSPL and CAPE capabilities on Space Shuttle mission 116 in December of 2006. These new standard <b>spacecraft</b> <b>launchers,</b> uniquely suited to take advantage of virtually any available space on reusable manned space missions, promise to provide expanded launch opportunities for small satellites...|$|E
30|$|MAQRO {{benefits}} from {{recent developments in}} space technology. In particular, MAQRO relies on technological heritage from LPF [38], the scientific instrument of LPF, which is called LISA Technology Package (LTP) [39], and on technologies from other missions like Gaia [40], Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) [41, 42], Microscope [43, 44], the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) follow-on mission [45, 46] and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) [47]. The <b>spacecraft,</b> <b>launcher,</b> ground segment and orbit (Sun-Earth Lagrange Point  1 (L 1)/Sun-Earth Lagrange Point  2 (L 2)) are identical to LPF.|$|R

Based on the advantages of wire-driven parallel mechanism, a 6 -DOF low-gravity environment simulation device with eight wires is designed in this paper. Firstly, the configuration and dimensional design of this wire-driven parallel mechanism are carried out. To operate and control the wire-driven parallel mechanism, a force distribution algorithm is introduced and the workspace is analyzed. Then, an evaluation index named quality index is established in order to study {{the performance of the}} wire-driven parallel manipulator in its workspace and reasonable tension is obtained after analyzing the influence on quality index caused by different wire tension...|$|R

50|$|With the {{retirement}} of the Shuttle in 2011 and its planned replacement Orion <b>spacecraft</b> and <b>launcher</b> {{in the design and}} test phase, NASA converted LC-39B from Shuttle operations to support Orion launches. The Ares I-X suborbital mission utilized MLP-1, to support the stacking and launch operations. The cancelled Ares I-Y would have used the same MLP.|$|R
50|$|For the mission, CNES is {{responsible}} for supplying the superspectral camera and the science mission center.

50|$|For manned spaceflight ESA crewmembers {{have been}} transported {{on either the}} Space Shuttle or various {{versions}} of the Russian manned launcher. The Russian launcher is designated as an ISS lifeboat, so crews needed to train on if they stayed for along periods. This is why there is two of these three man craft docked to enable an ISS crew of six, or three when there is one docked. The Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, which creates a human space-flight gap for the U.S. until one of three new manned systems being developed come online as early as 2018. The three new <b>spacecraft</b> and <b>launchers</b> are SLS+Orion and two human-rated launch systems from the Commercial Crew Development program.|$|R
30|$|Since this {{original}} proposal, {{significant progress}} was made in terms of technology development and in refining {{the details of the}} scientific instrument (also see Section  9). A detailed technological study was performed under contract with ESA [2], and several studies were performed with respect to the thermal design of the instrument [3, 4]. In a series of experiments, various groups demonstrated feed-back cooling [5, 6] and side-band cooling of optically trapped particles [7 – 9]. A study on loading mechanisms of nano- and microparticles for quantum experiments in space was performed under contract with ESA [10], and experiments reported progress on loading, manipulating and keeping particles in optical traps even at high vacuum [11 – 13]. Optomechanical cooling close to the quantum ground state has been demonstrated for a variety of architectures [14 – 16] and seems to be within reach for optically trapped particles [9]. A collaboration of the University of Vienna, the University of Bremen and Airbus Defence & Space, successfully implemented a high-finesse, adhesively bonded optical cavity using space-proof glue and ultra-low-expansion (ULE) material [17]. The same technology is currently in use to implement a high-finesse test cavity with the same specifications as needed for MAQRO. Based on recent theoretical studies [18], the design of MAQRO was adapted for preparing macroscopic superpositions with state-of-the-art non-linear-optics and laser technology [19] also benefiting from recent advances in the single-mode transmission of deep ultra violet (UV) light [20]. In this way, a central drawback of the initial MAQRO proposal (the need for low power, extremely short-wavelength light) could be resolved. Moreover, LISA Pathfinder (LPF) was successfully launched in December 2015  - a technology demonstrator for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, which served as model for the proposed <b>spacecraft,</b> <b>launcher</b> and orbit of MAQRO. By now, the MAQRO consortium, founded in 2013, consists of 32 groups from 9 countries around the world demonstrating the growing support within the scientific community.|$|R
25|$|The Near Earth Commissioning phase {{extended}} from {{the separation of the}} <b>spacecraft</b> from the <b>launcher</b> upper stage until the completion of the initial check out of the orbiter and payload. It included the solar array deployment, the initial attitude acquisition, the declamping of the Beagle-2 spin-up mechanism, the injection error correction manoeuvre and the first commissioning of the spacecraft and payload (final commissioning of payload took place after Mars Orbit Insertion). The payload was checked out one instrument at a time. This phase lasted about one month.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{artificial}} objects in orbit {{continues to increase}} and, with it, a key threat to space sustainability. In response, space agencies have identified a set of mitigation guidelines aimed at enabling space users to reduce the generation of space debris by, for example, limiting the orbital lifetime of their <b>spacecraft</b> and <b>launcher</b> stages {{after the end of}} their mission. Planned, large constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), though addressing the lack of basic internet coverage in some world regions, may disrupt the sustainability of the space environment enabled by these mitigation practices. We analyse the response of the space object population to the introduction of a large constellation conforming to the post-mission disposal guideline with differing levels of success and with different disposal orbit options. The results show that a high success rate of post-mission disposal by constellation satellites is a key driver for space sustainability...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{a method to}} cope with tradeoffs in Design-to-Budget projects. It focuses only on mission operations and does not consider aspects related to <b>spacecraft</b> design, <b>launcher</b> or insurance. The possible tradeoffs depend upon different criteria (e. g. system availability, operational risk), whose relative importance is in turn imposed by the mission characteristics (e. g. recurring satellite routine operations, human spaceflight, LEOP). A methodology, issued from the optimization field, is first defined in order to evaluate {{the impact of these}} tradeoffs on the considered criteria. The methodology allows taking the mission characteristics into account and the allocated budget is modeled as a constraint of the problem. A list of cost reduction measures is then produced, supported by GSOC experience or the existing literature, together with an assessment of their impact on the criteria. Finally the methodology is applied in relation with a budget level to find out which cost reduction measures would satisfy the budget constraint and which criteria would be impacted. I...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this investigation is to gain insight into the conservatism and robustness of spacecraft dimensioning {{on the basis of}} known or assumed uncertainties of <b>launcher,</b> <b>spacecraft</b> and mechanical environment and to make this specific experience available to the spacecraft designer community. An additional objective is to gain experience with respect to the relative importance of uncertainties modeled by random variables - as well as means and ways to interpret the analysis output for practical engineering purposes. Considering the problem of assessment of the adequacy of the spacecraft design with respect to uncertainties, it is clear that possible sources of scatter a#ecting the design can be located in the <b>spacecraft,</b> in the <b>launcher</b> and external loads. Within this study a large-scale finite element model representative of a real satellite is used in conjunction with the Ariane 5 finite element model and dynamic load cases. In particular, these load cases include a frequency response analysis for harmonic excitation of the satellite only, while for the coupled system a transient analysis at lift-o# and a frequency response analysis simulating the end-of-booster-pressure oscillations are considered. The ESA's satellite INTEGRAL is used as a typical satellite structure. The deterministic linear MSC-NASTRAN FE model is used to compute various structural responses. This FE model contains a large number of input parameters, material properties and also geometric data, which are all a#ected by scatter. These uncertain input parameters are modeled by a stochastic approach as random variables. Consequently, the response is then also considered as random. The Monte Carlo simulation tool NASTRAN-RV has been employed to perform the required Monte Carlo simulation. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Various Earth-Moon {{transfer}} trajectories {{are designed}} and analyzed {{to prepare the}} future Korea's Lunar missions. Minimum fuel trajectory solutions are obtained for the departure year of 2017, 2020, 2022, and every required mission phases are analyzed from Earth departure to the final lunar mission orbit. N-body equations of motion are formulated which include the gravitational effect of the Sun, Earth and Moon. In addition, accelerations due to geopotential harmonics, Lunar J 2 and solar radiation pressures are considered. Impulsive high thrust is assumed as the main thrusting method of <b>spacecraft</b> with <b>launcher</b> capability of KSLV- 2 which is planned to be developed. For the method of injecting a spacecraft into a trans Lunar trajectory, both direct shooting from circular parking orbit and shooting from the multiple elliptical intermediate orbits are adapted, and their design results are compared and analyzed. In addition, spacecraft's visibility from Deajeon ground station are constrained {{to see how they}} affect the magnitude of TLI (Trans Lunar Injection) maneuver. The results presented in this paper includes launch opportunities, required optimal maneuver characteristics for each mission phase as well as the trajectory characteristics and numerous related parameters. It is confirmed that the final mass of Korean lunar explorer strongly depends onto the initial parking orbit's altitude and launcher's capability, rather than mission start time...|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 the US Air Force {{started a}} study effort that {{explored}} {{a variety of}} manned <b>spacecraft</b> and associated <b>launchers.</b> As the proposals were studied, they broke them down into one of three classes, based {{on the level of}} reusability. On the simpler end of the development scale were the [...] "Class I" [...] vehicles that placed a spaceplane on top of an existing or modified ICBM-based launcher. [...] "Class II" [...] vehicles added partial reusability for some of the launcher components, while the [...] "Class III" [...] vehicles were fully reusable. The USAF had already started work on a Class I design in their X-20 Dyna Soar program, which had been cancelled in December 1963, but were interested in the Lockheed Star Clipper Class II design as a possible future development. Nothing ever came of the study effort, as the USAF wound down their interest in manned space programs.|$|R
40|$|The X-ray sky in {{high time}} {{resolution}} holds {{the key to}} a number of observables related to fundamental physics, inaccessible to other types of investigations, such as imaging, spectroscopy and polarimetry. Strong gravity effects, the measurement of the mass of black holes and neutron stars, the equation of state of ultradense matter are among the objectives of such observations. The prospects for future, non-focused X-ray timing experiments after the exciting age of RXTE/PCA are very uncertain, mostly due to the technological limitations that need to be faced to realize experiments with effective areas in the range of several square meters, meeting the scientific requirements. We are developing large-area monolithic Silicon drift detectors offering high time and energy resolution at room temperature, with modest resources and operation complexity (e. g., read-out) per unit area. Based on the properties of the detector and read-out electronics we measured in laboratory, we built a concept for a realistic unprecedented large mission devoted to X-ray timing in the energy range 2 - 30 keV.

40|$|The GRACE mission, {{which is}} {{scheduled}} for launch {{at the end of}} 2001, will be among the first missions ever to exercise close formation flying for improved science data collection. The joint US-German project aims at the exploration of temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field and the investigation of the Earth's atmosphere. Key payload elements comprise a GPS receiver, a high-p ecision accelerometer and a star sensor onboard each spacecraft as well as a K-band inter-satellite ranging system. Both spacecraft will fly at a 300 - 50 altitude with a relative along-track separation of about 220 ± 50 km (or 30 ± 6 secs) to build up a gradiometer that is particularly sensitive to high-order harmonic components in the Earth's gravity field. From an operational point of view, the build- p and control of the formation GRACE poses various new requirements, which have been studied at the mission control ce ter (GSOC) : the safe injection of the two <b>spacecraft</b> from the <b>launcher,</b> the control of the semi-major axe of both spacecrafts to maintain the inter-satellite separation within tolerable margins and the accurate maintenance of the line-of-sight pointing of the K-band radar. ...|$|R

40|$|The Small Mars System is a {{proposed}} mission to Mars. Funded by the European Space Agency, {{the project has}} successfully completed Phase 0. The contractor is ALI S. c. a. r. l., and the study team includes the University of Naples “Federico II”, the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte and the Space Studies Institute of Catalonia. The objectives of the mission are both technological and scientific, and will be achieved by delivering a small Mars lander carrying a dust particle analyser and an aerial drone. The former shall perform in situ measurements of the size distribution and abundance of dust particles suspended in the Martian atmosphere, whereas the latter shall demonstrate low-altitude flight in the rarefied planetary environment. The mission-enabling technology is an innovative umbrella-like heat shield, known as IRENE, developed and patented by ALI. The mission is also a technological demonstration of the shield in the upper atmosphere of Mars. The core characteristics of SMS are the low cost (120 M€) and the small size (320 kg of wet mass at launch, 110 kg at landing), features which stand out with respect to previous Mars landers.

40|$|Preliminary European {{studies on}} the {{feasibility}} of statistical, Monte Carlo method based, spacecraftlauncher coupled loads analyses were performed in the early nineties. In the frame of a more recent study probabilistic analysis tools have been extended, {{which can be used}} to complement the deterministic analysis approach. The method is again based on Monte Carlo Simulations. Uncertain input variables of the analysis are described by their probability density functions, and the captured results are evaluated to derive distributions, mean values, standard deviations and exceedance probabilities. In the study presented in this paper, a large-scale finite element model representative of a real satellite is used in conjunction with the Ariane 5 finite element model to run stochastic coupled dynamic analyses for a selected set of dynamic load cases. Dedicated preand post-processors are combined with the finite element analysis code MSC. Nastran for this purpose (2).

The objective of our project is to provide a framework that facilitates DSM Pre-Phase A investigations and optimizes DSM designs with respect to a-priori Science goals. In this first version of our Trade-space Analysis Tool for Constellations (TAT-C), we are investigating questions such as: How many spacecraft {{should be included in the}} constellation? Which design has the best costrisk value? The main goals of TAT-C are to: Handle multiple spacecraft sharing a mission objective, from SmallSats up through flagships, Explore the variables trade space for pre-defined science, cost and risk goals, and pre-defined metrics Optimize cost and performance across multiple instruments and platforms vs. one at a time. This paper describes the overall architecture of TAT-C including: a User Interface (UI) interacting with multiple users - scientists, missions designers or program managers; an Executive Driver gathering requirements from UI, then formulating Trade-space Search Requests for the Trade-space Search Iterator first with inputs from the Knowledge Base, then, in collaboration with the Orbit Coverage, Reduction Metrics, and Cost Risk modules, generating multiple potential architectures and their associated characteristics. TAT-C leverages the use of the Goddard Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) to compute coverage and ancillary data, streamlining the computations by modeling orbits in a way that balances accuracy and performance. TAT-C current version includes uniform Walker constellations as well as Ad-Hoc constellations, and its cost model represents an aggregate model consisting of Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) from widely accepted models.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{research}} is to identify and develop a design methodology for System-of-System (a set of elements and sub-elements able to interact and cooperate in order to complete a mission), based on models, methods and tools, to support the decision makers during the space exploration scenarios design and evaluation activity {{in line with the}} concurrent design philosophy. Considering all combinations of system parameters (such as crew size, orbits, <b>launchers,</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> ground and space infrastructures), a large number of mission concept options are possible, even though not all of them are optimal or even feasible. The design methodology is particularly useful in the first phases of the design process (Phase 0 and A) to choose rationally and objectively the best mission concepts that ensure the higher probability of mission success in compliance with the high level requirements deriving from the "user needs". The first phases of the project are particularly critical for the success of the entire mission because the results of this activity are the starting point of the more costly detailed design phases. Thus, any criticality in the baseline design will involve inevitably into undesirable and costly radical system redesigns during the advanced design phases. For this reason, it is important to develop reliable mathematical models that allow prediction of the system performances notwithstanding the poorly defined environment of very high complexity. In conjunction with the development of the design methodology for system-of-systems and in support of it, a software tool has been developed. The tool has been developed into Matlab environment and provides users with a useful graphical interface. The tool integrates the model of the mission concept, the models of the space elements at system and subsystem level, the cost-effectiveness model or value, the sensitivity and multi-objective optimization analysis. The tool supports users to find a system design solution in compliance with requirements and constraints, such as mass budgets and costs, and provides them with information about cost-effectiveness of the mission. The developed methodology has been applied for the design of several space elements (Man Tended Free Flyer, Cargo Logistic Vehicle, Rover Locomotion System) and several mission scenarios (Moon surface infrastructure support, Cis-Lunar infrastructure delivering, Cis-Lunar infrastructure logistic support), in order to assess advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method. The results of the design activity have been discussed and accepted by the European Space Agency (ESA) and have also been compared and presented to the scientific community. Finally, in a particular case, the study of the locomotion system of a lunar rover, the results of the methodology have been verified through the production and testing of the same syste...|$|R
