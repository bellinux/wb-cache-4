40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the potential curative {{role of the}} intraoperative use of a dye, the Patent Blue V, {{for the treatment of}} refractory lymphoceles by mapping the lymphatic leakage and selectively ligating the opened lymphatics. Inguinal lymphocele is a well-known complication after inguinofemoral lymph node dissection for penile cancer, and a variety of curative approaches have been reported. METHODS: From 1995 to 2007, 40 patients had undergone partial or total penectomy for squamous cell cancer. <b>Superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection with saphenous vein sparing or deep lymph node dissection was performed in 15 patients.

40|$|The {{mammary gland}} {{is a common}} site of {{neoplasm}} in the female cat. Malignant tumors metastasize especially through the lymphatic system. However, the anatomical knowledge of this system is not sufficient well known. The aim of this experiment was to investigate a reasonable imaging model {{for the study of}} the lymph drainage of the mammary glands in the cat and to develop evidence for the surgical excision of these glands in case of malignant tumors. For this purpose 73 clinically normal, lactating cats were used. The cats divided into two groups as follows. In the first group was studied the lymph drainage of the mammary glands in 50 cats. The number of lymphatic vessels which emerged from each mammary gland, their course and the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> where they drained was studied by indirect lymphography with radiography. To facilitate the visualization of the lymphatic vessels and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of each gland, it was injected inside the mammary parenchyma, an oily contrast media which is selectively taken up from the lymphatics. In the second group, 23 cats were used and lymph drainage was studied by indirect lymphography with computed tomography. To facilitate the visualization of the lymphatic vessels and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of each gland, it was injected inside the mammary parenchyma, a water soluble contrast media which is readily taken up from the lymphatics. The following day, mammary gland’s drainage was studied by indirect lymphography with radiography as it was studied in the first group.. During the experiments the cats were under general anesthesia. The main conclusions drawn after this study were the following. 1. The first mammary gland drains more commonly with one or rarely with two or three lymphatic vessels to the accessory axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> 2. The second mammary gland drains with one or rarely two lymphatic vessels to the accessory axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> 3. The third mammary gland drains mainly either to the accessory axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> or to the accessory <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In a small percentage (10 %) of the cats it was demonstrated simultaneous drainage to those <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Rarely <b>lymph</b> drains directly to the internal ileac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> 4. The forth mammary gland drains mainly with one lymphatic vessel to the accessory <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Rarely drains directly to the internal ileac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> 5. In no instance lymphatic connection between mammary glands could be demonstrated. Moreover there were not demonstrated lymphatic vessels of the mammary glands that cross the midline. 6. In many cats it was revealed that lymphatic vessels from the accessory axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain to the proprious axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and lymphatic vessels from the accessory <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain to the <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In many cats, lymphatic vessels from accessory <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain to the <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and then to the internal ileac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> or directly lymphatic vessels from accessory <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain towards the superficial <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> 7.

To select appropriate contrast media for MDCT lymphatic imaging in a cadaver, we tested four kinds of contrast media by injecting them into fresh swine kidneys. After the suitable contrast medium was selected, 10 lower extremities from 5 fresh cadavers were studied. After injection of the contrast medium, each lower extremity was scanned with high-spatial-resolution MDCT. The zinc oxide mixture was found to be the most appropriate contrast formula for MDCT imaging of cadaver lymphatics in terms of CT value and no extravasation. The high-resolution MDCT imaging revealed two different superficial lymphatic pathways in the legs.

40|$|Background: Vascularized <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{transfer}} (VLNT) {{has shown}} promise {{as a treatment}} for breast cancer–related lymphedema, a common and debilitating condition among breast cancer survivors. In VLNT, the most popular <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> flap donor site is the inguinal region; however, concerns about the possibility of iatrogenic lymphedema hamper the widespread adoption of VLNT. A better understanding of the anatomy of the lymphatic system in the inguinal region is essential to preserving lymph drainage in the leg and avoiding iatrogenic lymphedema. Methods: Five human cadaver hind-quarter specimens were used for this study. First, the specimens were scanned with indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography to map the lymphatic vessels. A dual injection technique using different radiocontrast media was then applied to delineate arteries and lymphatic vessels on radiographs. Finally, radiological analysis and meticulous dissection were used to investigate relationships between the arteries and lymphatic vessels. Results: By chasing the lymphatic vessels retrogradely from their corresponding <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> we were able to divide the <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> into three subgroups: the abdominal, medial thigh, and lateral thigh nodes.

40|$|Abstract <b>Superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> from 72 {{wild boars}} {{examined}} {{in a previous}} immunohistochemical (IHC) study on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) were selected for a PCV 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Four of these <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were PCV 2 -IHC strongly positive with PMWS histological lesions (outcome 1), 6 weak to mild PCV 2 -IHC positive without PMWS histological lesions (outcome 2) and 62 PCV 2 -IHC negative. Considering IHC {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis, the aims of the study were to evaluate the suitability of the PCV 2 -DNA extraction from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and the sensitivity and specificity of PCR under two IHC interpretations criteria: (A) the sample was considered positive if the result was outcome 1; (B) the sample was considered positive if the result was outcome 1 or 2. Under (A) criteria, sensitivity and specificity of PCR were 100 % and 89. 7 %, respectively; the Cohen's Kappa coefficient was 0. 49. Under (B) criteria, sensitivity and specificity of PCR were 80. 0 % and 95. 2 %, respectively; the Cohen's Kappa coefficient was 0. 72. The high Cohen's Kappa coefficient under the (B) interpretative criteria indicates good agreement between the two methods. In conclusion, 1) DNA extracted from FFPE specimens of wild boar is suitable for PCR and further represents a screening test for PCV 2 /PCVD (PCV 2 Diseases) investigations in wild boar as well; 2) routine histological sampling can also be useful for PCV 2 virological studies in wild boar. </p...|$|R

40|$|The common iliac arteries (a. iliaca communis dextra et a. iliaca communis sinistra) are the {{terminal}} {{branches of the}} abdominal aorta. The paired external iliac artery (a. iliaca externa dextra et a. iliaca externa sinistra) is a stronger branch of the paired common iliac artery. Before they leave the abdominal cavity and continue as the femoral arteries (a. femoralis dextra et a. femoralis sinistra) each external iliac artery forms the following branches: 1. The internal pudendal artery (a. pudenda interna) which, with its branches, supplies the tensor fasciae latae and quadriceps muscles (a. circumflexa femoris lateralis), cranial region of the urinary bladder, cranial end of the uterine horn in females, the deferent duct and tail of the epididymis in males (a. umbilicalis) the rectum, the external anal sphincter and perineum (a. rectalis caudalis) with blood. 2. The obturator artery (a. obturatoria), which supplies both of the obturator muscles, {{as well as the}} proximal end of the adductor muscle. 3. The pudendoepigastric trunk (truncus pudendoepigastricus) is a short vessel, which with its branches (a. pudenda externa, a. epigastrica caudalis et a. urethrogenitalis) supplies the caudal end of the rectus abdominis muscle, tip of the penis, preputium, <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> scrotum in males and inguinal mamma in females, transversus and internus abdominis muscles, neck of the urinary bladder, urethra, vagina and vulva in females and accessory glands in males. 4. Paired internal iliac arteries (a. iliaca interna dextra et a. iliaca interna sinistra) are thinner branches than the external iliac arteries. The internal iliac artery with its branches supplies the cranial and caudal parts of the gluteal muscles (a. glutea cranialis et a. glutea caudalis), as well as the muscles of the lateral side of the tail (a. caudalis lateralis).

40|$|The main work {{involved}} the PMWS (Post-weaning multisystemic Wasting Syndrome), caused by PCV- 2 (Porcine Circovirus type 2) that involved post-weaned pigs. Merial Italy has funded a study {{activity in which}} groups of 3 - 5 animals were sampled for lungs, tracheo-bronchial and <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> ileum and tonsils. The protocol applied can be identified as a more diagnostic potential on the individual than on the group. PNP. Another investigation has been conducted to study proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP), a form of interstitial pneumonia in weaning and post-weaning pigs characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, coagulative necrosis and granular debris within alveolar spaces. Many studies suggest porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) as the main causes of the disease, but Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) and swine influenza virus (SIV) are also considered. An immunohistochemical study was carried out to evaluate the role of these viruses in PNP lesions in Italy. PNP results primarily associated with PRRSV, even if co-infection is characterized by more severe histological features. Reproductive pathology. A major risk factor for PCV 2 infection is a viraemic episode taking place in pregnant sows with low antibody titer which is transmitted by specific PCV 2 products of conception. PCV 2 can infect the fetus even by vehicles through infected semen or ova, or {{as a result of}} infection of the genital tract. An investigation was carried out to identify the presence and localization of PCV 2 in the genital tracts of sows experimentally infected with PCV 2 and in their fetuses. The results obtained suggest that: conventional sows can be infected by intrauterine exposition; low antibody titres increase the probability of infection; PCV 2 infection close to insemination time reduces the pregnancy rate; placental lesions may represent an additional cause of fetal suffering...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Mammary gland tumours {{occupy a}} {{significant}} {{place in the}} pathology of this species. Female dogs that are not spayed after their first heat cycle have a higher predisposition of developing mammary tumours. Most tumours metastasize at distance via the lymphatic system. In these conditions, the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of the mammary glands must be assessed prior to surgical treatment. Aims: Considering the insufficient usage of non-invasive investigative methods of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{the aim of this}} study is to describe the sonographic anatomy of the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> that drain the mammary gland tumours in female dog. Materials and Methods: Twelve dog females presenting tumours of the cranial and caudal abdominal mammary glands (A 1 and A 2), inguinal mammary gland (I) and cranial thoracic mammary gland (T 1) were examined (group I). In addition, a control group composed of eight dog females was used (group II). The axillary and <b>superficial</b> <b>inguinal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were evaluated using an algorithm composed of gray-scale ultrasound, Doppler technique, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and real time elastography. Surgical excision of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was performed and samples for histopathological examination were taken. Results: The following ultrasonographic findings revealed on gray-scale examination were suspected for the metastatic infiltration: hypoechoic pattern, round shape, hillus absence and heterogenicity. Doppler technique showed an aberrant and mixed vascularisation of the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> while the CEUS revealed incomplete enhancement of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> parenchyma. On real time elastography, the presence of blue areas in more than 50 % from the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> parenchyma led us to conclude that the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stiffness was caused by metastatic infiltration. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of the metastatic infiltration in 97 % of the examined <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Conclusion: The algorithm composed of gray-scale ultrasound, Doppler technique, CEUS and real time elastography proved to be efficient in diagnosing the metastatic infiltration of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of mammary gland. Further studies are needed to validate the proposed algorithm...|$|R
