40|$|AbstractThe {{watercourse}} section <b>surveying</b> {{has become}} more and more important in engineering reconnaissance nowadays, and based on ever urgent social demand for watercourse section <b>surveying,</b> the paper analyzed the subject of how to improve the watercourse section <b>surveying</b> and plotting efficiency. Through studying the opposite side <b>surveying</b> procedure inside the total station and the section <b>surveying</b> and graph plotting method in CASS, an integration of field and office working pattern for section <b>surveying</b> was summarized.
