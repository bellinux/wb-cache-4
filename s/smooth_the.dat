5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is <b>smooth.</b> <b>The</b> incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is <b>smooth.</b> <b>The</b> molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop can be {{distinguished}} from its close relative the Pacific pink scallop (Chlamys rubida) by the valves being less rounded and by the small curved spines on the ribs which give it a rough texture whereas the Pacific pink feels <b>smooth.</b> <b>The</b> glossy white interior of the spiny scallop's shell often has a purplish blotch near the umbone, not present in the Pacific pink.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter. Their surface is {{generally}} reticular, sharp, warty or spiky and very rarely <b>smooth.</b> <b>The</b> typical colour of the spore mass becomes {{visible through the}} structure, since the spores themselves are not pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the spores produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of spores are important characteristics for identifying species.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the <b>smooth,</b> <b>the</b> palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E

5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is <b>smooth,</b> <b>the</b> depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} <b>smooth,</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E

5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is <b>smooth,</b> <b>the</b> lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{economic}} and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For {{the first time in}} Dutch history, the constitution that was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a while the Republic was governed democratically, although the coup d'état of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power, after another change in constitution. Nevertheless, the memory of this brief experiment with democracy helped <b>smooth</b> <b>the</b> transition to a more democratic government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king). A type of ministerial government was introduced {{for the first time in}} Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.|$|E
