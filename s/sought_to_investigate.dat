Advices and warnings were received by regional television and radio stations up to 15minutes late following issuance. Winifred's sudden and unexpected turn was little-anticipated by BoM meteorologists, with employees unable to verify the cyclone's centre from the Cairns radar until only about 9:30a.m. on 1February, with radar error of up to [...] observed. However, a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was immediately issued shortly thereafter, reaching media outlets near noon that day. Media outlets went suggested {{the creation of a new}} Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Townsville as a result, but the suggestion was dismissed, with a centre already established in Brisbane. A spokesman for the SES stated that no warning was given by the BoM at 9a.m., with the storm's alarming approach; the Service had initially been anticipating the storm's recurvature out to sea, only to receive a flash warning hours later.

Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, we contribute to closing this research gap by exploring how post-entry embeddedness impacted innovation and survival among de-novo and de-alio entrants into the Japanese microbrewery industry. Our findings indicate that post-entry embeddedness has contrasting effects, reducing overly non-conformist strategies among de-novo entrants, but enhancing non-conformity among de-alio entrants. These results indicate how institutions can serve as enablers of innovation, rather than constraints, through their dissemination of standards, norms and industry practices...|$|R

He {{was convinced that the}} conspiracy to cover up the scandal went further up the government than assumed. Labouchère made his suspicions known in Parliament on 28 February 1890. He denied that [...] "a gentleman of very high position"—presumably Prince Albert Victor—was in any way involved with the scandal, but accused the government of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He suggested that the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and other officials colluded to hamper the investigation, allowing Somerset and Hammond to escape, delaying the trials and failing to prosecute the case with vigour. Labouchère's accusations were rebutted by the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster, who was also the prosecutor in the Newton case. Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Parke and was defending Newton, sat on the Liberal benches with Labouchère but refused to be drawn into the debate. After an often passionate debate over seven hours, during which Labouchère was expelled from Parliament after saying [...] "I do not believe Lord Salisbury" [...] and refusing to withdraw his remark, the motion was defeated by a wide margin, 206–66. In a subsequent speech to the House of Lords, Salisbury bore witness against himself by suggesting his memory of his handling of the affair was defective.|$|E

This criticism has become more vocal since the killing of British agent Denis Donaldson as a result of [...] "Stormontgate". Republicans are also critical because Ingram's claims about the British Government involving themselves in the activities of Loyalist paramilitaries i.e., Collusion, have been quite common for many years, and something which the republican movement has <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>investigated.</b> The suspicion is that Ingram may be engaged in black propaganda, (sometimes called [...] "Dirty Tricks"), self-promotion, or some other form of conspiracy aimed at damaging Sinn Féin and the wider republican movement.|$|R
