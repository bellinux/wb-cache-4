25|$|The {{height of}} the famine was reached in 1317, as the wet weather continued. Finally, in that summer, the weather {{returned}} to its normal patterns.

Historians debate the toll, but it is estimated that 10–25% of the population of many cities and towns died. While the Black Death (1338–1375) would kill more people, it often swept through an area in a matter of months, but the Great Famine lingered for years, prolonging the suffering of the populace.|$|E

This study examined the size, composition and species richness of the soil seed banks in grazed and ungrazed sites. Forty seven species of botanical composition of the <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> were identified, 29 species of them were common to both sites. Seedling number in grazed site was higher than in ungrazed site in the soil <b>stocks.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of desirable grasses and legume species were higher in the grazed site.

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1315 unusually heavy rain began in much of Europe. Throughout the spring and summer, it {{continued}} to rain and the temperature remained cool. These conditions caused widespread crop failures. The straw and hay for the animals could not be cured {{and there was no}} fodder for livestock. The price of food began to rise, doubling in England between spring and midsummer. Salt, the only way to cure and preserve meat, was difficult to obtain because it could not be extracted through evaporation in the wet weather; it peaked in price in the period 1310–20, reaching double the price from the decade before. In {{the spring of}} 1316 it continued to rain on a European population deprived of energy and reserves to sustain itself. All segments of society from nobles to peasants were affected, but especially the peasants who were {{the overwhelming majority of the}} population and who had no reserve food supplies. The height of the famine was reached in 1317 as the wet weather continued. Finally, in the summer the weather returned to its normal patterns. By now, however, people were so weakened by diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis, and so much of the <b>seed</b> <b>stock</b> had been eaten, that it was not until 1325 that the food supply returned to relatively normal conditions and the population began to increase again.|$|E

40|$|This study assesses {{variation}} in the abundance and viability of sediment Microcystis vegetative <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> in Western Lake Erie across both seasons and years. Previous research suggests that lake sediment <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> can serve as inocula for reoccurring harmful algal blooms (HABs). However, there are few studies aimed at understanding the distribution, abundance, and viability of sediment <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> in Western Lake Erie and specifically how these variables are potentially related to past and subsequent bloom formation. We conducted a two-year study of vegetative <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> in the Western Lake Erie basin, the region where annual algal blooms generally develop. Sediment was collected from 16 sites within Western Lake Erie covering an area of 375 km 2 with water column depths ranging from 3 - 9 meters. Sample collection occurred in November 2014, April 2015, November 2015, and April 2016. The total and potentially-toxic portions of Microcystis were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A series of laboratory experiments using lake sediment samples were conducted to assess the viability of Microcystis vegetative <b>seed</b> <b>stocks.</b> The abundance and viability of Microcystis vegetative <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> varied both spatially and temporally. Across all sampling periods, the abundance of total Microcystis in the sediment ranged from 6. 6 x 104 to 1. 7 x 109 cell equivalents g- 1, and potentially-toxic Microcystis ranged from 1. 4 x 103 to 4. 7 x 106 cell equivalents g- 1. The abundance of total Microcystis diminished significantly across winter with densities in the spring nearly 10 times less than the previous fall. No correlation was found between abundance at specific sites and sediment composition, depth, or distance offshore. Further, total sediment Microcystis abundance was not relatively larger in November 2015, even though 2015 yielded {{one of the largest}} blooms on record. However, a higher percentage of the sediment population in November 2015 was potentially-toxic across all sites, which may have been the result of the large nutrient loads and higher than normal in-lake nutrient concentrations. Culture experiments using sediment inocula and WC-Si growth media were used to examine potential viability of the sedimented cells. The sites with the greatest abundance of total and potentially-toxic Microcystis cells did not necessarily yield the most recruitment and growth over time, suggesting that abundance alone does not explain potential viability of sediment <b>seed</b> <b>stocks.</b> However, on average, the total abundance of cells in the grow-out flasks was more than twice the estimated amount present in the inocula, indicating that substantial growth occurred following recruitment from the sediment into the overlying water. Additional research will be needed to understand what specific factors influences the total contribution of Microcystis sediment <b>seed</b> <b>stocks</b> to recurrent annual blooms. However, numerical analysis suggests that sediment recruitment may {{have a significant impact on}} subsequent blooms, particularly when recruitment is paired with subsequent continual growth...|$|R
