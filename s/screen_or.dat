5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a split <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> online via Xbox Live. In this mode, the player has to compete one-on-one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range. Lives are unlimited in multiplayer {{and the winner is}} determined by the highest score. A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide {{communication}} to those {{not able to}} use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> put the game on auto play. In this respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E

25|$|Projection is {{not limited}} to {{perspective}} projections, such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a <b>screen,</b> <b>or</b> the rectilinear image produced by a pinhole camera on a flat film plate. Rather, any mathematical function transforming coordinates from the curved surface to the plane is a projection. Few projections in actual use are perspective.|$|E
25|$|Reset: In {{applications}} and games (both retail and downloadable), the Reset button is available. This performs a soft reset {{of that particular}} application, for example returning a game to its title <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> the loading screen of a Wii Menu channel, the same as {{what would happen if}} the player were to press the console's physical reset button.|$|E

25|$|To form a {{color with}} RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be {{superimposed}} (for example by emission {{from a black}} <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> by reflection from a white screen).

25|$|Hitchcock {{shot for}} periods lasting up to 10 minutes (the {{length of a}} film camera magazine), {{continuously}} panning from actor to actor, though most shots in the film wound up being shorter. Every other segment ends by panning against or tracking into an object—a man's jacket blocking the entire <b>screen,</b> <b>or</b> {{the back of a}} piece of furniture, for example. In this way, Hitchcock effectively masked half the cuts in the film.|$|E
25|$|Game Paks are {{far more}} durable than compact discs, the latter of which must be {{carefully}} used and stored in protective cases. It also prevents accidental scratches and subsequent read errors. While Game Paks are more resistant than CDs to physical damage, they are sometimes less resistant to long-term environmental damage, particularly oxidation (although this can be simply cleaned off) or wear of their electrical contacts causing a blank or frozen <b>screen,</b> <b>or</b> static electricity.|$|E
25|$|A LEED {{detector}} usually contains {{three or}} four hemispherical concentric grids and a phosphor <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> other position-sensitive detector. The grids are used for screening out the inelastically scattered electrons. Most new LEED systems use a reverse view scheme, which has a minimized electron gun, and the pattern is viewed from behind through a transmission screen and a viewport. Recently, a new digitized position sensitive detector called a delay-line detector with better dynamic range and resolution has been developed.|$|E

25|$|A {{video game}} is an {{electronic}} game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback {{on a video}} device such as a TV <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Urinals in {{high-capacity}} washrooms {{are usually}} arranged {{in one or}} more rows directly opposite the door, so that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Urinals in the street may be arranged in a circle, with all users facing the center, with partitions high enough that they cannot wet each other, and usually high enough that they cannot see over. In a street urinal with an outside <b>screen</b> <b>or</b> wall, the users may stand back to back.|$|E
25|$|Wu had her {{youngest}} son Li Dan made emperor, as Emperor Ruizong. She was the ruler, however, both in substance and appearance as well.

Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, appeared at no imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters. In 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with her named as the ruler (huangdi).|$|E
