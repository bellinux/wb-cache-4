2500|$|Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin: [...] "remarkable theorem") {{states that}} Gaussian {{curvature}} of a surface {{can be determined}} from the measurements of length on the surface itself.

Equivalently, the determinant of the <b>second</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>form</b> of a surface in R3 can be so expressed. The [...] "remarkable", and surprising, feature of this theorem is that although the definition of the Gaussian {{curvature of a surface}} S in R3 certainly depends on {{the way in which the}} surface is located in space, the end result, the Gaussian curvature itself, is determined by the intrinsic metric of the surface without any further reference to the ambient space: it is an intrinsic invariant.

40|$|Doubt is cast on {{the much}} quoted results of Yakupov that the torsion vector in {{embedding}} class two vacuum space-times is necessarily a gradient vector and that class 2 vacua of Petrov type III do not exist. The first result {{is equivalent to}} the fact that the two <b>second</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>forms</b> associated with the embedding necessarily commute and has been assumed in most later investigations of class 2 vacuum space-times. Yakupov stated the result without proof, but hinted that it followed purely algebraically from his identity: RijklC kl = 0 where Cij is the commutator of the two <b>second</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>forms</b> of the embedding. From Yakupov’s identity, it is shown that the only class two vacua with non-zero commutator Cij must necessarily be of Petrov type III or N. Several examples are presented of non-commuting <b>second</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>forms</b> that satisfy Yakupovs identity and the vacuum condition following from the Gauss equation; both Petrov type N and type III examples occur. Thus it appears unlikely that his results could follow purely algebraically. The results obtained so far do not constitute definite counter-examples to Yakupov’s results as the non-commuting examples could turn out to be incompatible with the Codazzi and Ricci embedding equations. This question is currently being investigated. 1...|$|R
