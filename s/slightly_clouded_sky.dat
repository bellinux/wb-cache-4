60|$|She {{smiled in}} her vivid way--only twice or thrice did I see her smile thus {{and then it}} was like a flash of summer {{lightning}} illumining a <b>clouded</b> <b>sky,</b> since for the most part her face was grave and even sombre.|$|R
6000|$|From a wood-hung height, an outpost lone, [...] Crowned with a woodman's fort, The {{sentinel}} {{looks on}} {{a land of}} dole, [...] Like Paran, all amort.

50|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to late 1970s, Von Bruenchenhein {{turned away from}} {{painting}} and dedicated his time to sculpture. Nevertheless, in the late 1970s, {{he returned to the}} medium. This time, however, his paintings were informed by the decade he spent constructing architectural bone sculptures. His later paintings offer up vast open scenes of architectural towers and <b>clouded</b> <b>skies.</b>|$|R
60|$|The night {{closed in}} black; the <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> gave forth no starlight; the wind rose and moaned through the cedars. One {{by one the}} rustlers rolled in their {{blankets}} and all dropped into slumber while the camp-fire slowly burned down. The night hours wore on to the soft wail of the breeze and the wild notes of far-off trailing coyotes.|$|R
6000|$|As shines {{the moon}} in <b>clouded</b> <b>skies,</b> [...] She in her poor attire was seen: [...] One praised her ancles, one her eyes, [...] One her dark hair and lovesome mien: [...] So sweet a face, such angel grace, [...] In all that land had never been: [...] Cophetua sware a royal oath: [...] "This beggar maid shall be my queen!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2003 — participants: 900,000 — temp: 37 °C — motto: Let the Sun ShineVery {{hot weather}} with partly <b>clouded</b> <b>sky.</b> Attendance <b>slightly</b> {{down to an}} {{estimated}} 900,000. However, this contrasts to far more drastic declines in the Berlin event. The direction of the route was reversed in this year {{in order to reduce}} noise levels on certain streets, and to provide better exits for the trucks.|$|R
60|$|Rilla gave over {{crying in}} sheer disgust at the {{futility}} of tears {{and went to sleep}} in Mary Vance's bed in the calm of despair. Outside, the dawn came greyly in on wings of storm; Captain Josiah, true to his word, ran up the Union Jack at the Four Winds Light and it streamed on the fierce wind against the <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> like a gallant unquenchable beacon.|$|R
60|$|Friday, {{the tenth}} of January, dawned cold, dark, dreary, and all day a dull <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> promised rain or snow. From a bride's {{point of view}} {{it was not a}} propitious day for a wedding. A half hour before five o'clock a stream of {{carriages}} began to flow toward St. Marks and promptly at five the door of the church shut upon a large and fashionable assembly.|$|R
6000|$|De Lacy's brow was <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded,</b> for seldom had he {{met with}} {{anything}} approaching to contradiction of his pleasure. [...] "I pray you to reflect, Lady Eveline," [...] he said, [...] "that your aunt's house is probably defenceless, or at least very imperfectly guarded.--Would it not be your pleasure that I should continue my dutiful attendance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hey, what do {{you think}} of it?' he cried with sudden animation. 'Wasn't he true to himself, wasn't he? His saved life was over for want of ground under his feet, for want of sights for his eyes, for want of voices in his ears. Annihilation--hey! And all the time it was only a <b>clouded</b> <b>sky,</b> a sea that did not break, the air that did not stir. Only a night; only a silence.|$|R
50|$|Interested in {{at least}} {{surveying}} {{the site of the}} hotel, Emmons arrived in Pasadena during a downpour and sat under an oak tree listening to his son expound over the beauty of the Southern California area. But the rain poured down leaving Walter hopeless in convincing Emmons. When the sun finally did break through the <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> it was a sight the old man had never experienced in his life and he agreed to finance the rest of Walter’s construction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} novel {{algorithm}} for detection of sky areas in outdoor color images. In contrast to sky detectors in literature that detect only blue, cloudless sky {{we intend to}} detect all sorts of sky, i. e. blue, clouded and partially <b>clouded</b> <b>sky.</b> Our approach {{is based on the}} analysis of color, position, and shape properties of color homogeneous spatially connected regions detected by the CSC. An evaluation on a set of images acquired under different weather conditions proves the quality of the proposed system. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{coloured}} filters {{in varying degrees}} of intensity are available. Kodak's amber filters, for example, vary from palest yellow ("81C") to deepest amber ("85B"). A photographer chooses which filter to use based {{on the quality of}} the ambient light. Colour temperature meters can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter. <b>Clouded</b> <b>sky,</b> for example, requires a paler amber than clear blue sky. If a filter is unavailable, flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast.|$|R
40|$|Upper storey of a {{traditional}} Bosnian house against a lightly <b>clouded</b> <b>sky.</b> The roofline divides the picture into an upper half taken by the sky, and a lower half dominated by the house's white wall and three upper windows. Two of these sash windows are open, and from each, two young bareheaded girls lean out and smile into the camera. Analogue photographic process, negative-positive (Agfa Isopan 17 DIN). Original preserved as a negative and a positive on silver bromine paper, stored as a negative, print and digital record...|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the nave}} has a gallery on three sides, {{with a pair}} of fluted Ionic columns {{supporting}} the gallery at the west end. On the ceiling is a painting done by Basil Champneys in 1897 of cherubs breaking through a <b>clouded</b> <b>sky,</b> with texts on a ribbon. The coats of arms of four of the City Livery Companies (the Skinners, Grocers, Fishmongers and Drapers) appear on a frieze. The chancel has three bays. There is a tall pulpit on four Ionic columns, and an octagonal font of grey marble.|$|R
50|$|Adults are brown, the {{forewings}} {{for nearly}} one-third of the surface from the base obliquely brown and containing three black basal dots. The exterior surface is partly and <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded</b> with cinereous {{and there is a}} black transverse streak beyond the middle, composed of one spot and of three hinder points. There is a cinereous spot near the hinder side of the black spot and a little more exterior. The fringe is cinereous. The hindwings are brownish cinereous, whitish towards the base.|$|R
60|$|By morning Grace was as {{nervous and}} anxious as her patient, who had {{momentarily}} {{the advantage of}} her in having fallen asleep. She went stealthily out, and walked {{the length of the}} piazza, bathing her eyes with the sight of the sea, cool and dim under a <b>clouded</b> <b>sky.</b> At the corner next the kitchen she encountered Barlow, who, having kindled the fire for the cook, had spent s moment of leisure in killing some chickens at the barn; he appeared with a cluster of his victims in his hand, but at sight of Grace he considerately put them behind him.|$|R
60|$|Cold and cheerless, {{the wind}} beating on our faces, the white seas roaring by, we {{struggled}} through the day. Night came, {{but neither of}} us slept. Day came, and still the wind beat on our faces and the white seas roared past. By the second night Maud was falling asleep from exhaustion. I covered her with oilskins and a tarpaulin. She was comparatively dry, but she was numb with the cold. I feared greatly that she might die in the night; but day broke, cold and cheerless, with the same <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> and beating wind and roaring seas.|$|R
50|$|There {{are both}} inside and outside baths {{available}} at Ryujima Onsen. The inside bath is a soothing stone bubble bath, while outside the bath is made from Japanese cypress. There is nice private garden which the baths look out upon. The hot spring water itself is <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded</b> and thick which is said to be good for relieving nerve and muscle pain, stiff shoulders, paralysis, and fatigue. We can relax by taking a bath while viewing the mountains and listening to the murmur of the Azusagawa River.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{humidity}} {{is always}} high {{throughout the year}} except in the winter months being slightly less humid. In the cold season, the sky is obscured on many mornings due to lifted fog which clears with the advance of the day generally, moderately clouded {{in the period of}} March to May, heavily clouded to overcast in the monsoon season and clear or <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded</b> during the post monsoon season. Winds are generally light strong katabatic winds down the valleys are experienced as local effect produced by the nature of terrain.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are semihyaline white, {{with a dark}} reddish-brown {{base and}} crossed by two fine metallic blue lines, {{as well as a}} broad reddish-brown band, darker near the anal angle, crossing the wing beyond the cell from the costal to the inner margin, the outer margin <b>slightly</b> <b>clouded</b> with brown. The hindwings are semihyaline white, crossed about the middle from the costal to the inner margin by a fine brown line, the apex, anal angle and inner margin are clouded with reddish brown. The marginal line is white.|$|R
60|$|The <b>sky</b> <b>clouded</b> over, {{and some}} heavy drops of rain began to fall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} measures 36 x 48.125 in. It {{depicts a}} moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Needles, off the Isle of Wight. It juxtaposes {{the fragility of}} human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark <b>clouded</b> <b>sky,</b> the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold {{light of the moon}} at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern. [...] Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, Moonlight at Sea (The Needles), c.1818, as an example of marine art for his Liber Studiorum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who speaks?" [...] {{answered}} the minister. Gathering himself quickly up, he stood more erect, {{like a man}} taken by surprise in a mood {{to which he was}} reluctant to have witnesses. Throwing his eyes anxiously {{in the direction of the}} voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the <b>clouded</b> <b>sky</b> and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow. It may be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts.|$|R
