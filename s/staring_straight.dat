On April 10, 2014, Del Rey posted the track's single art on Twitter with the lyric, [...] "Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'...", as its caption. The same caption was used in a promotional billboard which was put up in Los Angeles the same day. The heavily yellow artwork, which makes use of an Instagram filter camera lens, features Del Rey donning soft makeup while standing on a Californian coastline afront crashing waves. [...] She has a forlorn facial expression in the cover, and is depicted with a subtle frown with her eyes <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> into the camera. Del Rey sports a beach-inspired look with a wave-like hair style, denim jacket and white shirt. Some critics speculated that the artwork hinted that the sound of [...] "West Coast" [...] would continue in the laid-back style of Born to Die.

2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> back at me." ...|$|E

50|$|In their seminal 1995 paper {{published}} in Perception, von Grünau and Anston demonstrated that <b>staring</b> eyes (<b>straight</b> gaze with iris and pupil in center position in eye socket) are detected faster than eyes gazing {{to the right}} or left (averted gaze with iris and pupil in right-most or left-most position in eye socket). Eye targets with a straight gaze when presented {{in an array of}} averted gaze nontargets are detected faster with fewer errors than an averted gaze targets presented in an array of straight gaze targets. This search asymmetry in which straight gaze targets are given preference in array of averted gaze distractors is found for both realistically drawn and schematic eye stimuli but not for other arrayed objects. Search asymmetry is not seen with geometric stimuli, for instance 1 x 3 rows of black and white squares, that vary in the position of the distinguishing feature or stimuli consisting of only one schematic eye.|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} seen a lion--his mother had gone to great pains to prevent it. But he had devoured countless {{pictures}} of them, and now he was ravenous to feast his eyes upon the king of beasts in the flesh. As he trailed Akut he kept an eye cocked over one shoulder, rearward, in the hope that Numa might rise from his kill and reveal himself. Thus it happened that he dropped some little way behind Akut, and the next he knew he was recalled suddenly to a contemplation of other matters than the hidden Numa by a shrill scream of warning from the Ape. Turning his eyes quickly in the direction of his companion, the boy saw that, standing in the path directly before him, which sent tremors of excitement racing along every nerve of his body. With body half-merging from a clump of bushes in which she must have lain hidden stood a sleek and beautiful lioness. Her yellow-green eyes were round and <b>staring,</b> boring <b>straight</b> into the eyes of the boy. Not ten paces separated them. Twenty paces behind the lioness stood the great ape, bellowing instructions to the boy and hurling taunts at the lioness in an evident effort to attract her attention from the lad while he gained the shelter of a near-by tree.|$|R
6000|$|During {{all this}} day, {{and for many}} days following, they {{continued}} to enjoy fine weather and to make rapid progress. Sometimes the ice was pretty thick, and once or twice they narrowly escaped being nipped by collapsing masses, which caused them to jump out, hastily throw the baggage on the ice, and haul the canoes out of the water. On these occasions the men proved themselves to be sterling fellows, {{nearly all of them}} being cool, prompt, and collected in the moment of danger. No doubt there were exceptions. La Roche, when any sudden crisis of danger arose, usually threw himself blindly {{over the side of the}} canoe on to the ice with the lightness and agility of a harlequin. He recked not whether he came down on his head or his feet, and more than once nearly broke his neck in consequence of his precipitancy. But La Roche was no coward, and the instant the first burst of excitement was over he rushed to render effective assistance. Bryan, too, although not so mercurial as La Roche, was apt to lose self-command for about five minutes when any sudden danger assailed him, so that he frequently sat still, <b>staring</b> wildly <b>straight</b> before him, while the others were actively unloading the canoes; and once, when the danger was more critical than usual, having sat till the canoe was empty, and paid no attention to a prompt, gruff order to jump ashore, he had been seized by the strong arms of Gaspard and tossed out of the canoe like a puppy dog. On these occasions he invariably endeavoured to make up for his fault by displaying, on recovery, the most outrageous and daring amount of unnecessary recklessness,--uttering, at the same time, an amazing number of strange expressions, among which [...] "Tare an' ages!" [...] "Och! murder!" [...] and several others less lucid in signification, predominated. Chimo was always first ashore, and instantly wheeled round to greet Eda, who was also always second, thanks to the strong and prompt arm of Francois, who sat just in front, and by tacit agreement took her under his special charge. As for Mrs Stanley, the arm that was rightfully her own, and had been her shield in many a scene of danger, proved ever ready and able to succour the [...] "first volunteer" [...] to Ungava.|$|R

40|$|The nineteenth-century {{settlement}} of the Great Plains coincided {{with a number of}} technological developments, including improved railroad equipment, the steel plow, and the agricultural combine. Photography was among these technical developments, ensuring that the process of settlement would be both celebrated and recorded. The history of Junction City, Kansas, is bound up with such technological developments. Located near the junction of the Republican and Smoky Hill Rivers, it grew close by the site of Fort Riley in north central Kansas and became a railroad town and county seat by the 1870 s. By 1890 the community was prosperous and its economy diversified. Enter photographer J. J. Pennell. One of the region 2 ̆ 7 s many local photographers who established thriving businesses to record family, civic, and commercial life, Pennell operated in Junction City for nearly three decades. More artistic than many photographers, he left a fascinating record of a community both typical and unique. Following an informative introduction by John Pultz, curator of photography at the University of Kansas Spencer Art without a thought to what this has done to Native societies over time. Given this state of affairs (about which the book is silent), why is it that there are still anthropologists who insist on fashioning or inventing new theories primarily aimed at trying to explain why Native people have such difficulties adapting to the modern world? I think part of the answer to this very old question is clear and simple and <b>staring</b> us <b>straight</b> in the face-and it is called colonialist genocide. If I were asked to write a prescription for social and psychological disaster among Native peoples, something that would surely bring about a near total collapse of their ancient societies, it would go something like this: Initially, I would put them on reservations and take away their art. In this way I would sever them from their mythology, philosophy, history, religion, land, and language in one stroke since all of these are fundamentally integrated or embodied in their social systems through their land and art. Art is the primary means by which they effectuate what is equivalent to Western society 2 ̆ 7 s libraries, churches, courthouses, theaters, and schools. I would then legislate laws, enforceable at the point of a gun, of course, which would allow me to replace their accumulated wealth of oral, historical, and spiritual knowledge and traditions with my own special brand of social philosophy, economics, and religions, all based upon a social system relying heavily upon avarice as its most basic social tenet and coupled with the identification of those Native peoples as 2 ̆ 2 primitives and savages. 2 ̆ 2 That law would then be enforceable for at least seventy years in such places as government run boarding schools. I would then insist upon using unprovable abstract scientific theories to describe the different versions of reality these ancient peoples harbor towards themselves. Furthermore, I would require everybody to use the same vernacular established by these parochial theorists whenever the subject of the Native American came up, in whatever context...|$|R
60|$|This is the palpable and ponderable, the admirably appreciable, residuum--as {{to which}} if I be asked {{just how it}} is that I pluck the flower of amiability from the bramble of an individualism so bristling with accents, I am afraid I can only say that the accents would seem by the mercy of chance to fall {{together}} in the very sense that permits us to detach the rose with the fewest scratches. The rose of active good nature, irreducible, incurable, or in other words all irreflective, that is the variety which the individualistic tradition happens, up and down these islands, to wear upon its ample breast--even it may be with considerable effect of monotony. There it is, for what it is, and the very simplest summary of one's poor bedside practice is perhaps to confess that one has most of all kept one's nose buried in it. There hangs about the poor practitioner by that fact, I profess, an aroma not doubtless at all mixed or in the least mystical, but so unpervertedly wholesome that what can I pronounce it with any sort of conscience but sweet? That is the rough, unless I rather say the smooth, report of it; which covers of course, I hasten to add, a constant shift of impression within the happy limits. Did I not, by way of introduction to these awaiters of acknowledgment, find myself first of all, early in the autumn, in presence of the first aligned rows of lacerated Belgians?--the eloquence of whose mere mute expression of their state, and thereby of their cause, remains to me a vision unforgettable for ever, and this even though I may not here stretch my scale to make them, Flemings of Flanders though they were, fit into my remarks with the English of the English and the Scotch of the Scotch. If other witnesses might indeed here fit in they would decidedly come nearest, for there were aspects under which one might almost have taken them simply for Britons comparatively starved of sport and, to make up for that, on straighter and homelier terms with their other senses and appetites. But their effect, thanks to their being so seated in everything that their ripe and rounded temperament had done for them, was to make their English entertainers, and their successors in the long wards especially, seem ever so much more complicated--besides making of what had happened to themselves, for that matter, an enormity of outrage beyond all thought and pity. Their fate had cut into their spirit to a peculiar degree through their flesh, as if they had had an unusual thickness of this, so to speak--which up to that time had protected while it now but the more exposed and, collectively, entrapped them; so that the ravaged and plundered domesticity that one felt in them, which was mainly what they had to oppose, made the terms of their exile and their suffering an extension of the possible and the dreadful. But all that vision is a chapter by itself--the essence of which is perhaps that it has been the privilege of this placid and sturdy people to show the world a new shade and measure of the tragic and the horrific. The first wash of the great Flemish tide ebbed at any rate from the hospitals--creating moreover the vast needs that were to be so unprecedentedly met, and the native procession which has prompted these remarks set steadily in. I have played too uncertain a light, I am well aware, not arresting it at half the possible points, yet with one aspect of the case <b>staring</b> out so <b>straight</b> as to form the vivid moral that asks to be drawn. The deepest impression from the sore human stuff with which such observation deals is that of its being strong and sound in an extraordinary degree for the conditions producing it. These conditions represent, one feels at the best, the crude and the waste, the ignored and neglected state; and under the sense of the small care and scant provision that have attended such hearty and happy growths, struggling into life and air with no furtherance to speak of, the question comes pressingly home of what a better economy might, or verily mightn't, result in. If this abundance all slighted and unencouraged can still comfort us, what wouldn't it do for us tended and fostered and cultivated? That is my moral, for I believe in Culture--speaking strictly now of the honest and of our own congruous kind.|$|R
