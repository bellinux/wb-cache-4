40|$|Introduction: Correct {{restoration}} of the joint line is generally considered as crucial when performing total knee arthroplasty. During revision knee arthroplasty however, elevation of the joint line occurs frequently. The general belief is that this negatively affects clinical outcome, but reasons are still not well understood. Materials and Methods: In this cadaveric in vitro study the biomechanical consequences of joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> were investigated using a previously validated cadaver model simulating active deep knee squats and passive flexion-extension cycles. Knee specimens were sequentially tested after total knee arthroplasty with joint line restoration and after 4 mm joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation.</b> Results: Results show that no significantly negative effects of 4 mm joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> were observed on tibio-femoral kinematics, collateral ligaments lengths, tibio-femoral contact pressures or quadriceps forces after TKA. Discussion and Conclusion: Our study suggests that joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> by 4 mm in revision total knee arthroplasty does not cause significant kinematic and kinetic differences during passive flexion/extension movement and squatting in the tibio-femoral joint, nor does it affect the elongation patterns of collateral ligaments. Therefore, clinical problems after joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> are probably situated in the patello-femoral joint or caused by joint <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> of more than 4 mm. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} derive the snow <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> using NOAA-AVHRR {{satellite}} data {{in combination with}} a digital elevation model is presented. The AVHRR sensor enables the frequent Observation of snow cover with a sufficiently high temporal resolution. The definition of the snow line {{and the impact of}} geocoding errors, as well as errors due to misclassification, are discussed. A comparison of the NOAA-AVHRR data with data from the higher resolution IRS-WiFS indicates that even at a spatial resolution of 1. 1 km, a quantitative analysis of the snow <b>line</b> <b>elevation</b> is possible. The influence of different winter conditions in Switzerland on the elevation of the snow line is reflected in satellite data from 1990, 1996 and 1999. The results of the investigation were, firstly the presentation of the spatial pattern of the average snow <b>line</b> <b>elevation,</b> secondly the derivation of snow line signatures for three regions.
