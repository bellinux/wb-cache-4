40|$|Introduction:Bone {{metastasis}} is {{a serious}} complication in patients with lung cancer, occurring in up to 40 % of patients. Tumor cell–mediated osteolysis occurs ultimately through induction of RANK ligand (RANKL) within the bone stroma although this hypothesis has not been tested extensively {{in the setting of}} non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). By using two novel NSCLC bone metastasis mouse models, we examined the effects of RANKL inhibition on osteolysis and tumor progression. Methods:We treated mice bearing skeletal NSCLC tumors with osteoprotegerin-Fc (OPG-Fc) to assess whether osteoclast inhibition through RANKL inhibition would affect bone metastases at early or late stages of bone colonization. Progression of <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> was determined by radiography, longitudinal bioluminescent imaging, and histological analyses. Results:OPG-Fc reduced development and progression of radiographically evident osteolytic lesions and also significantly reduced <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> progression in both NSCLC bone metastasis models. In the H 1299 human NSCLC bone metastasis model, OPG-Fc plus docetaxel in combination resulted in significantly greater inhibition of <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> growth compared with either single agent alone. The observed ability of RANKL inhibition to reduce NSCLC osteolytic bone destruction or <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden was associated with decreases in tumor-associated osteoclasts. Conclusions:These results demonstrate that RANKL is required for the development of tumor-induced osteolytic bone destruction caused by NSCLC cells in vivo. RANKL inhibition also reduced <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden, presumably through the indirect mechanism of blocking tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis and resultant production of growth factors and calcium from the bone microenvironment. RANKL inhibition also provided an additive benefit to docetaxel treatment by augmenting the reduction of tumor burden...|$|E
40|$|Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone {{resorption}} {{and have}} demonstrated clinical utility {{in the treatment}} of patients with osteolytic bone metastases. They also exhibit direct antitumor activity in vitro and can reduce <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden and inhibit the formation of bone metastases in vivo. However, whether such effects are caused by a direct action of bisphosphonates on tumor cells or indirectly through inhibition of bone resorption remains unclear. To address this question, we used here a structural analog of the bisphosphonate risedronate, NE- 58051, which has a bone mineral affinity similar to that of risedronate, but a 3000 -fold lower bone antiresorptive activity. In vitro, risedronate and NE- 58051 inhibited proliferation of breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. In vivo, risedronate and NE- 58051 did not inhibit the growth of subcutaneous B 02 breast tumor xenografts or the formation of B 16 F 10 melanoma lung metastasis. In contrast to NE- 58051, risedronate did inhibit B 02 breast cancer bone metastasis formation by reducing both bone destruction and <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden, indicating that the antitumor effect of bisphosphonates is achieved mainly through inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption...|$|E

We herein report {{a case of a}} 41 -year-old man who presented with chest pain and had a chest computed tomography (CT) scan suggestive of a primary <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> originating from the ribs (chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma), with no history of asbestos exposure.

40|$|Sclerostin (SOST) is an {{extracellular}} Wnt signaling antagonist which negatively regulates bone mass. Despite this, {{the expression}} {{and function of}} SOST in <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> remain poorly described. Here, we first describe the immunohistochemical staining pattern of SOST across benign and malignant <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> with bone or cartilage matrix (n= 68 primary tumors). Next, relative SOST expression was compared to markers of Wnt signaling activity and osteogenic differentiation across human osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines (n= 7 cell lines examined). Results showed immunohistochemical detection of SOST in most bone-forming tumors (90. 2 %; 46 / 51) and all cartilage-forming tumors (100 %; 17 / 17). Among OSs, variable intensity and distribution of SOST expression were observed, which highly correlated with the presence and degree of neoplastic bone. Patchy SOST expression was observed in cartilage-forming tumors, which did not distinguish between benign and malignant tumors or correlate with regional morphologic characteristics. Finally, SOST expression varied widely between OS cell lines, with more than 97 -fold variation. Among OS cell lines, SOST expression positively correlated with the marker of osteogenic differentiation alkaline phosphatase and did not correlate well with markers of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. In summary, SOST is frequently expressed in skeletal bone- and cartilage-forming tumors. The strong spatial correlation with bone formation and the in vitro expression patterns {{are in line with}} the known functions of SOST in nonneoplastic bone, as a feedback inhibitor on osteogenic differentiation. With anti-SOST as a potential therapy for osteoporosis in the near future, its basic biologic and phenotypic consequences in <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> should not be overlooked...|$|R

40|$|Osteoclasts mediate bone {{destruction}} {{in breast cancer}} skeletal metastases. Cathepsin K is a proteinase that is secreted by osteoclasts and degrades bone. Here, immohistochemistry revealed that cathepsin K was expressed not only by osteoclasts but also by breast cancer cells that metastasize to bone. Following intratibial injection with cathepsin K-expressing human BT 474 breast cancer cells, tumor-bearing mice treated with a clinical dosing regimen of cathepsin K inhibitor (CKI; 50 mg/kg, twice daily) had osteolytic lesions that were 79 % smaller than those of tumor-bearing mice treated with the vehicle. The effect of CKI was also studied in a mouse model in which the i. v. inoculation of human B 02 breast cancer cells expressing cathepsin K leads to bone metastasis formation. Drug administration was started before (preventive protocol) or after (treatment protocol) the occurrence of osteolytic lesions. In treatment protocols, CKI (50 mg/kg, twice daily) or a single clinical dose of 100 mu g/kg zoledronic acid (osteoclast inhibitor) reduced the progression of osteolytic lesions by 59 % to 66 %. CKI therapy also reduced <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden by 62 % compared with vehicle, whereas zoledronic acid did not decrease the tumor burden. The efficacy of CKI at inhibiting <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden was similar in the treatment and preventive protocols. By contrast, CKI did not block the growth of s. c. B 02 tumor xenografts in animals. Thus, CKI may render the bone a less favorable microenvironment for tumor growth by inhibiting bone resorption. These findings raise the possibility that cathepsin K could be a therapeutic target {{for the treatment of}} bone metastases. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{platelets}} {{have been}} known {{for more than a}} century as important partners for successful metastatic dissemination of solid tumors. Cancer cell-induced platelet activation is a key event responsible for prometastatic activity of platelets. Blocking platelet aggregation inhibits the progression of skeletal metastases through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The establishment and progression of bone metastases are strongly influenced by the bone remodeling process. Growth factors and cytokines released upon platelet activation may contribute to both <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> growth and osteolytic lesions. Megakaryocytes are platelet precursors located in the bone marrow that control bone mass through direct stimulation of osteoblast functions and indirect inhibition of osteoclast activities. Considering growing evidence for their role in the metastatic cascade, platelets and/or megakaryocytes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to help limit bone metastases...|$|E

However, with its enrollment criteria, the study was controlled for the standardized time point analysis at pre-treatment and at 12 -week treatment follow-up {{for each of the}} respective covariates. A reasonable large number of patients were included from the two separate hospitals to avoid site selection biases. The data presented here, using an upgraded and analytically validated platform, confirms the original clinical findings of the manual BSI studies. More importantly, the study is part of the continual effort to clinically validate automated BSI as an imaging biomarker to quantify the change in total <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden that is clinically relevant.

Incidence of skeletal metastases and death from prostate cancer greatly increases with age and obesity, conditions which increase marrow adiposity. Bone marrow adipocytes are metabolically active components of bone metastatic niche that modulate the function of neighboring cells; yet the mechanisms of their involvement in tumor behavior in bone have not been explored.

40|$|CXCR 4 regulates hematopoietic and {{tumor cell}} homing to bone, but its role during {{osteoclast}} (OC) development is unknown. We investigated {{the role of}} CXCR 4 in osteoclastogenesis and in a model of bone metastasis. Compared with controls, mice reconstituted with CXCR 4 null hematopoietic cells exhibited elevated markers of bone resorption, increased OC perimeter along bone, and increased bone loss. CXCR 4 −/− OCs demonstrated accelerated differentiation and enhanced bone resorption in vitro. Furthermore, tumor growth specifically in bone was significantly increased in mice reconstituted with CXCR 4 −/− hematopoietic cells. Finally, enhancement of bone tumor growth {{in the absence of}} CXCR 4 was abrogated with the OC inhibitor, zoledronic acid. These data demonstrate that disruption of CXCR 4 enhances osteoclastogenesis and suggest that inhibition of CXCR 4 may enhance established <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden by increasing OC activity...|$|E
40|$|Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone {{resorption}} {{and have}} demonstrated clinical utility in the palliative treatment {{of patients with}} bone metastases (1). There is now exten-sive in vivo preclinical evidence that bisphosphonates can reduce <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden and inhibit the formation of bone metastases in animal models (2). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these observations. For example, bisphosphonates may ren-der the bone a less favorable microenvironment for tumor cell colo-nization by reducing osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which, in turn, would deprive tumor cells of bone-derived growth factors released from the bone matrix (3, 4). In addition, bisphosphonates appear to have direct antitumor effects (2). Bisphosphonates {{have been shown to}} inhibit tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and prolifera-tion, and they induce apoptosis of a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro (2).

40|$|Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is an {{aggressive}} <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> characterized by localized bone resorption. MicroRNA- 16 - 5 p (miR- 16 - 5 p) {{has been reported}} to be downregulated in lesions of patients with GCT, but little is known about its role in GCT. To explore the underlying function of miR- 16 - 5 p in GCT, we first detected its expression in patients with GCT. The results showed that osteoclast formation increased, whereas miR- 16 - 5 p expression considerably decreased with the severity of bone destruction. Furthermore, we found that miR- 16 - 5 p expression considerably decreased with the progression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand- (RANKL-) induced osteoclastogenesis. Functionally, miR- 16 - 5 p mimics significantly reduced RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. However, treatment with an inhibitor of miR- 16 - 5 p significantly promoted osteoclastogenesis. These findings reveal that miR- 16 - 5 p inhibits osteoclastogenesis and that it may represent a therapeutic target for giant cell tumor of bone...|$|E

An automated method can be validated analytically and clinically and is not dependent on the knowledge and experience of the interpreting reader. BSI calculation using EXINIboneBSI is an objective fully automated approach to quantify <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden in bone scans. The aim of our research is to develop an automated PET/CT index using methods similar to those used for BSI calculations. Methods of these types require training databases of scans to mimic interpretation by experts. In this study, such a training database was not available and we therefore studied an automated PET 15 index, which was based on a SUV threshold of 15. This SUV threshold has been used in a recent publication by Lin et al. to exclude hotspots with low statistical likelihood of being metastases [19]. A disadvantage with this automated PET 15 index was that it reflected on average only 1 / 3 of the tumor burden as defined in the visual interpretation were thresholds ranged between SUV 6 – 9. We will therefore continue to develop an automated method that more closely reflects the results of visual interpretation.|$|E

40|$|Giant cell tumor of bone {{sometimes}} is an aggressive benign <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor.</b> Historically, curettage and bone grafting {{have a high}} recurrence with satisfactory function whereas wide resection has a reduced recurrence rate with compromise of limb function. Thus, maintaining joint function and achieving adequately wide resection introduces contradictory surgical goals. We developed a method for achieving both goals for giant cell tumors located in only one lateral plateau of the proximal tibia. We reconstructed 13 knees preserving the meniscus and reconstructing the tibial plateau with an iliac plate autograft after resection of a giant cell tumor involving one tibial plateau. Four patients had primary tumors and nine had recurrences after curettage. The minimum followup was 5  years (mean, 9. 1  years; range, 5 – 12. 75  years).

Bisphosphonate drugs are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The feasibility of combining the action of a bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) with low intensity ultrasound was tested in this study. Mechanical effects (1. 24 MHz) were created using pulsed ultrasound (200 µs) at 400 mW/cm 2 (SATA) repeated every 1 ms. Thermal effects (2. 85 MHz) were produced using 7 acoustic watts in continuous mode. Fifty-eight mice bearing bone metastases were included and randomized into 8 groups. A single dose of zoledronic acid was combined with a single or daily application of ultrasound (repeated for 15 days). Each ultrasound treatment lasted 30 minutes. These treatment strategies were compared with vehicle, ultrasound alone and zoledronic acid alone. Ultrasound alone did not have any inhibitory effect on bone destruction when compared to vehicle-treated animals. As expected, zoledronic acid alone reduced bone destruction compared to vehicle.

Zoledronic acid was given as daily, weekly, or single doses at a cumulative dose of 98 - 100 μg/kg body weight, equivalent to the 4 -mg intravenous dose given to patients. Clodronate was given as a daily dose (530 μg/kg/day), equivalent to the daily 1600 -mg oral clinical dose given to patients. Bone destruction was measured by radiography, x-ray absorptiometry or tomography, and histomorphometry (as the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume). <b>Skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> burden was measured by histomorphometry (as the ratio of tumor burden to soft tissue volume [TB/STV]) and luciferase activity. All statistical tests were two-sided.

40|$|Acting {{through its}} cognate {{receptor}}, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL) {{is an essential}} mediator of osteoclast function and survival. Preclinical data have now firmly established that blockade of tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis by RANKL inhibition will not only protect against bone destruction but will also inhibit the progression of established bone metastases and delay the formation of de novo bone metastases in cancer models. In patients with bone metastases, skeletal complications are driven by increased osteoclastic activity and may result in pathological fractures, spinal cord compression {{and the need for}} radiotherapy to the bone or orthopedic surgery (collectively known as skeletal-related events (SREs)). Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, has been demonstrated to prevent or delay SREs in patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to bone. In addition to its central role in tumor-induced osteolysis, bone destruction and <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> progression, there is emerging evidence for direct pro-metastatic effects of RANKL, independent of osteoclasts. For example, RANKL also stimulates metastasis via activity on RANK-expressing cancer cells, resulting in increased invasion and migration. Pharmacological inhibition of RANKL may also reduce bone and lung metastasis through blockade of the direct action of RANKL on metastatic cells.

Dlk 1 is paternally expressed and belongs to a group of imprinted genes associated with rhabdomyosarcomas but not with other primitive childhood tumors to date. Here, we investigate the possible roles of Dlk 1 in <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>tumor</b> formation. We analyzed tumors of different mesenchymal origin for expression of Dlk 1 and various myogenic markers and found that Dlk 1 was present consistently in myogenic tumors. The coincident observation of Dlk 1 with a highly proliferative state in myogenic tumors led us to subsequently investigate the involvement of Dlk 1 in the control of the adult myogenic programme. We performed an injury study in Dlk 1 transgenic mice, ectopically expressing ovine Dlk 1 (membrane bound C 2 variant) under control of the myosin light chain promotor, and detected an early, enhanced formation of myotubes in Dlk 1 transgenic mice. We then stably transfected the mouse myoblast cell line, C 2 C 12, with full-length Dlk 1 (soluble A variant) and detected an inhibition of myotube formation, which could be reversed by adding Dlk 1 antibody to the culture supernatant. These results suggest that Dlk 1 is involved in controlling the myogenic programme and that the various splice forms may exert different effects. Interestingly, both in the Dlk 1 transgenic mice and the DLK 1 -C 2 C 12 cells, we detected reduced myostatin expression, suggesting that the effect of Dlk 1 on the myogenic programme might involve the myostatin signaling pathway. In support of a relationship between Dlk 1 and myostatin we detected reciprocal expression of these two transcripts during different cell cycle stages of human myoblasts. Together our results suggest that Dlk 1 is a candidate marker for <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>tumors</b> and might be involved directly in <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>tumor</b> formation through a modulatory effect on the myogenic programme...|$|R

Reconstruction of the elbow and forearm in malignant tumors is challenging as it involves a complex interplay between multiple joints which need to be stabilized for the optimal functional outcome. We describe a new technique for {{the reconstruction of the}} elbow after resection of a proximal ulna tumor with articular radio-ulnar synostosis with the creation of a single bone forearm. We attempted to achieve a mobile elbow and stable wrist joint with the radio-ulnar union at the proximal articular surface of the ulna resulting in a single bone forearm. The procedure involves an oblique osteotomy preserving the olecranon process (after taking adequate margins based on oncological principles) and its articular cartilage along with the attachment of the triceps tendon. Then the radial head was partially denuded of its cartilage using a burr, leaving cartilage only on the volar side, and then fused to the remnant olecranon. Osteosynthesis was done using compression screw and tension band wiring. The advantages of this procedure are that the mobility at wrist and elbow are retained, it requires minimal hardware and allows for primary closure of the wound...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose was to {{evaluate}} the incidence of complication in lower limb reconstructions with modular prostheses comparing cemented versus uncemented stems in two different orthopedic tumor Centers. Methods: retrospective analysis of implant survival, complications and functional results assessed according to MSTS system of the Rizzoli and Moffitt series of modular megaprosthesis in lower limb. From 2002 and 2007, 238 modular prostheses of same design with a rotating hinge knee, were implanted in the lower limb as primary reconstruction in these two Centers. In 130 cases the prosthesis was implanted with cemented stems and in 108 cases with uncemented stems. Sites included: 120 distal femur, 61 proximal femur, 46 proximal tibia, 10 total femur and in 1 case both distal femur and proximal tibia. Histologic diagnoses included: 89 osteosarcoma, 13 Ewing sarcoma, 21 chondrosarcoma, 19 sarcoma, 55 metastasis, 17 TGC, 7 MFH, 11 other diagnoses and 6 non oncologic cases. Major prostheses-related complications were analysed and functional results according to Muscolo <b>Skeletal</b> <b>Tumor</b> Society system, at a mean follow up of 2. 03 yrs. Also a statistical evaluation with Kaplan Meier curves, a comparative statistical analysis with Wilcoxon test and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed. Results: Outcome in 223 evaluated oncologic pts, showed: 121 pts continuously disease free, 26 NED after treatment of relapse, 54 AWD, 16 DWD. Margins were wide in 94. 3...|$|E
40|$|Background: Allograft-prosthetic {{composite}} {{reconstruction of}} the proximal part of the tibia is one option following resection of a <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor.</b> Previous studies with use of this technique have found a high prevalence of complications, including fracture, infection, extensor mechanism insufficiency, and loosening. To address some of these problems, we adopted certain measures, including muscle flap coverage, meticulous tendon reconstruction, rigid implant fixation, and careful rehabilitation. The goal {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the functional outcome and complications in patients undergoing allograft-prosthetic composite {{reconstruction of the}} proximal part of the tibia. Methods: Twelve patients who underwent allograft-prosthetic composite reconstruction of the proximal part of the tibia after tumor resection were retrospectively evaluated at a median follow-up of forty-nine months. Clinical records and radiographs were reviewed to evaluate patient outcome, healing at the allograft-host junction, function, construct survival, and complications. Results: Nine patients had no extensor lag, and three patients had 5 to 15 of extensor lag. The mean amount of knee flexion was 103 (range, 60 to 120). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 24. 3 (81 %) of a maximum of 30. Complete bone union occurred in nine patients, and partial union occurred in three patients. At the time of writing, no secondary bone-grafting procedures had been required to achieve union, and no revision or removal of the reconstruction had been performed. Rotational or free flaps provided satisfactory wound coverage in all patients...|$|E
40|$|The role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) {{in cancer}} is poorly understood. Here we provide {{evidence}} for a role of LPA in the progression of breast cancer bone metastases. LPA receptors LPA 1, LPA 2, and LPA 3 were expressed in human primary breast tumors {{and a series of}} human breast cancer cell lines. The inducible overexpression of LPA 1 in MDA-BO 2 breast cancer cells specifically sensitized these cells to the mitogenic action of LPA in vitro. In vivo, LPA 1 overexpression in MDA-BO 2 cells enhanced the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts and promoted bone metastasis formation in mice by increasing both <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumor</b> growth and bone destruction. This suggested that endogenous LPA was produced in the tumor microenvironment. However, MDA-BO 2 cells or transfectants did not produce LPA. Instead, they induced the release of LPA from activated platelets which, in turn, promoted tumor cell proliferation and the LPA 1 -dependent secretion of IL- 6 and IL- 8, 2 potent bone resorption stimulators. Moreover, platelet-derived LPA deprivation in mice, achieved by treatment with the platelet antagonist Integrilin, inhibited the progression of bone metastases caused by parental and LPA 1 -overexpressing MDA-BO 2 cells and reduced the progression of osteolytic lesions in mice bearing CHO-β 3 wt ovarian cancer cells. Overall, our data suggest that, at the bone metastatic site, tumor cells stimulate the production of LPA from activated platelets, which enhances both tumor growth and cytokine-mediated bone destruction...|$|E
40|$|Early and {{accurate}} detection of bone tumors and their staging are important since {{some of them}} are highly malignant. Intraoperative pathological consultation in bone tumors and tumor-like conditions is quite complex; however, it allows improvement in prognosis and limb salvage. Present study was conducted on 52 patients who underwent surgical procedure after clinical and radiological diagnosis of bone tumors/tumor-like conditions. Fresh unfixed tissue was quickly inspected grossly, followed by preparation of imprint smears and frozen section which were evaluated by two pathologists separately and compared subsequently with reports of paraffin-embedded sections. Clinical reasons for intraoperative consultation were to make diagnosis in 65. 4 % of cases and to determine resection margin status in 21. 1 % while in 13. 5 % of cases, it was for both indications. Diagnostic yield of imprint smears was 87. 8 % (13 malignant, 22 benign, and 1 tumor-like) and of frozen section was 90. 2 % (16 malignant, 19 benign, and 2 nonneoplastic) while paraffin sections could diagnose specific tumors in 95. 1 % (18 malignant, 18 benign, and 3 nonneoplastic). Although frozen section had better sensitivity (88. 2 %), it had less specificity (94. 7 %) as compared to imprint smears (76. 5 % and 100 %, resp.). Imprint cytology and frozen section together provide a quick, safe, and reliable intraoperative provisional tissue diagnosis in <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> and tumor-like conditions...|$|R
40|$|The CEA 79 {{antibody}} {{has been}} used in bone marrow scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> and the evaluation of the bone marrow status of patients with various hematological disorders. The specific localization of radio-labeled CEA 79 antibody in bone marrow depends on its reactivity with NCA- 95 (nonspecific cross-reacting antigen- 95) present on the surface and in the cytosol of human granulocytes and myelopoietic cells. To make a CEA 79 scFv molecule that would be less immunogenic and more penetrating than the intact mouse immunoglobulin, we constructed a pRSET Sfi I/Not I expression vector. The scFv gene was then excised from a pCANTAB 5 E phage display vector by digestion with Sfi I and Not I and inserted into the pRSET Sfi I/Not I expression vector. Upon transformation of a BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS strain of E, coli, CEA 79 scFv became expressed in inclusion bodies requiring a renaturation process for solubilization, The final yield of CEA 79 scFv was 5 mg per a liter of culture. The refolded CEA 79 scFv exhibited an affinity (K-d = 2. 1 x 10 (- 9) M) equivalent to that of the original CEA 79;antibody (K-d = 3. 3 x 10 (- 9) M) and the same immunoreactivity to CEA and NCA- 95 in Western blots and in immunohistochemical staining experiments. close 8...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Extraskeletal {{osteosarcoma}} is a {{very rare}} tumor in humans and animals including rats. This paper describes a case of extraskeletal osteosarcoma observed in the glandular stomach of an aged female Fischer 344 rat. Grossly, a whitish solid mass was observed at the greater curvature of the glandular stomach. Histologically, the tumor consisted of both atypical polygonal and pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells, with pleomorphic nuclei, and it contained variable amounts of osteoids and small clumps of mature bone tissue. In addition, mitotic figures were frequently observed. Neither invasion of the muscle layer or vessels in the stomach nor metastasis to distant organs was detected. There were no <b>skeletal</b> <b>tumors</b> in the body. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for osteocalcin, osteonectin, vimentin and S- 100 protein. Judging from these results, the present tumor was diagnosed as extraskeletal osteosarcoma. This is the first report of spontaneous extraskeletal osteosarcoma arising from the stomach in a rat.
