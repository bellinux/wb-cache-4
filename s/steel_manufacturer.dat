5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (1852–1952), {{also known}} as TCI and the Tennessee Company, was a major American <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer</b> with {{interests}} in coal and iron ore mining and railroad operations. Originally based entirely within Tennessee, it relocated most of its business to Alabama {{in the late nineteenth}} century. With a sizable real estate portfolio, the company owned several Birmingham satellite towns, including Ensley, Fairfield, Docena, Edgewater and Bayview.|$|E
5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer</b> SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E

Canadian <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> in particular, were cited for dumping more than 120,000 tons of steel a year to the United States during the late 1980s. While the Canadian market share amounted to about 5 percent at the time, a majority of the Canadian imports were being dumped in the Northeastern United States, which was Lehigh Structural Steel's prime market.|$|R

25|$|A massive {{boost in}} March 2007 was {{the signing of}} a one-year deal with Asian <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Delong Holdings ltd.

The name and symbol of Delong featured prominently on the back of Glory's shirts during the 2007–08 season, with Western QBE already emblazoned on the front in tandem with Delong as Glory's title sponsor. Delong opted out of the second year and the space on the back of the uniform was instead replaced by Tony Sage's fashion magazine Kurv in 2008.|$|E
25|$|AB Scania-Vabis was {{established}} in 1911 {{as the result of}} a merger between Södertälje-based Vabis and Malmö-based Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania. Vabis (Vagnfabriks Aktiebolaget i Södertelge) {{was established}} as a railway car manufacturer in 1891, while Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania was established as a bicycle manufacturer in 1900. Both companies had tried their luck at building automobiles, trucks and engines, but with varied success. In 1910, Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania had succeeded in constructing reliable vehicles, while Vabis was at the brink of closing down. An offer from Per Alfred Nordeman, managing director of Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania, to <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Surahammars Bruk, owner of Vabis, led to an agreement in November 1910, and in 1911 the merger was a reality.|$|E

25|$|The University of Sheffield was {{originally}} {{formed by the}} merger of three colleges. The Sheffield School of Medicine was founded in 1828, followed in 1879 by the opening of Firth College, which developed out of the Cambridge University Extension Movement scheme, by Mark Firth, a <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> to teach arts and science subjects. Firth College then helped to fund {{the opening of the}} Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach applied science, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The Sheffield Technical School was founded because of local concern about the need for technical training, particularly steelmaking in Sheffield, and the school moved to St George's Square in 1886. The three institutions merged in 1897 to form the University College of Sheffield by Royal Charter. Sheffield was the only large city in England without a University. Steelworkers, coal miners, factory workers and the people of Sheffield donated over £50,000 in 1904 to help found the University of Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March, it was {{announced}} that former Perth Glory players Anthony Danze and Billy Celeski had rejoined the club, along with new signings Dino Djulbic and AIS graduate Jimmy Downey. It was also announced that Naum Sekulovski had agreed to a new one-year deal with the Glory. On 21 March, Perth Glory announced the signing of former Perth SC and Young Socceroos Goalkeeper Tando Velaphi. This was followed on 27 March with the signing of Nikita Rukavytsya, also from Perth SC. Nikolai Topor-Stanley joined the club after Sydney FC's Asian Champions League campaign finished. On 19 May, Perth Glory announced that Milton Keynes Dons F.C. winger Nick Rizzo had signed a two-year deal with the club. On 24 May, the signing of little-known Croatian striker Mate Dragičević {{was announced}}. Dutch veteran Michael Mols was expected to sign as a Glory player for the 2007–08 season but rejected the offer to sign for Feyenoord. Hayden Foxe and Mitchell Prentice were later added to the squad, and the signing of striker James Robinson was also completed. Probably the biggest coup for the Glory for the 2007–08 season was the signing of a one-year sponsorship deal with Singapore listed <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Delong Holdings, worth A$750,000, one of the biggest in the A-League, who featured {{on the back of the}} Glory jersey. On the front of the Glory jersey, long-serving major sponsor Western QBE signed a one-year deal worth A$500,000, with an option of two years after that.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of U.S. Steel in 1901 supplanted Lackawanna Steel as the country's largest <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> A {{number of the}} so-called [...] "independent" [...] steel companies considered merger {{over the next two}} decades as a response to U.S. Steel's formation. In late 1915, Lackawanna Steel nearly consummated a merger with the Cambria Steel Company, Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel. But despite the agreement of the steel companies, federal regulators, and others, the banks carrying the debt for these companies refused to approve the merger and the plan was dropped. The company's financial status varied considerably in the late 1910s. [...] The stock set new highs and the company doubled its profits in 1917 and the first half of 1918, but in late 1918 and throughout 1919 the company fell on hard financial times.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his term}} on the Board, Truesdale {{provided}} the critical vote in General Knit of California, Inc., 239 NLRB 619 (1978). The United Steelworkers of America had won an election, 134 to 104, at a specialized <b>steel</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> General Knit, Inc. [...] The company asked the Board {{to overturn the}} election because the union had distributed a leaflet on election day questioning whether the company had made a profit. [...] In 1977, the Board had held in Shopping Kart Food Market, 228 NLRB 1311 (1977) that elections should only be set aside only when egregious misstatements of fact occurred during election campaigning. Walther voted with other Republican-appointed Board members to uphold the election, arguing that the Board's duty to quickly certify elections {{was more important than}} its duty to assure fair elections. The General Knit decision overturned Shopping Kart Food Market and restored the Board's old rule as handed down in Hollywood Ceramics. Truesdale provided the critical third vote in the case.|$|E
