500|$|Lobatus gigas is gonochoristic, {{which means}} each {{individual}} snail is either distinctly male or distinctly female. Females are usually larger than males in natural populations, with both sexes existing in similar proportion. After internal fertilization, the females lay eggs in gelatinous strings, {{which can be}} as long as [...] These are layered on patches of bare sand or seagrass. The <b>sticky</b> <b>surface</b> of these long egg strings allows them to coil and agglutinate, mixing with the surrounding sand to form compact egg masses, the shape of which {{is defined by the}} anterior portion of the outer lip of the female's shell while they are layered. Each one of the egg masses may have been fertilized by multiple males. The number of eggs per egg mass varies greatly depending on environmental conditions such as food availability and temperature. Commonly, females produce 8–9 egg masses per season, each containing 180,000–460,000 eggs, but numbers can be as high as 750,000 eggs. L.gigas females may spawn multiple times during the reproductive season, which lasts from March to October, with activity peaks occurring from July to September.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a <b>sticky</b> <b>surface</b> that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is <b>sticky</b> <b>surface</b> mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E

5000|$|A {{release liner}} is a paper or plastic-based film sheet (usually applied during the {{manufacturing}} process) {{used to prevent}} a <b>sticky</b> <b>surface</b> from prematurely adhering. It is coated on one or both sides with a release agent, which provides a release effect against any type of a sticky material such as an adhesive or a mastic. Release liners are available in different colors, with or without printing under the low surface energy coating or on the backside of the liner. Release is separation of the liner from a sticky material; liner is the carrier for the release agent.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} processing and properties of PNCs using a polyfurfural alcohol (PFA) matrix. The precursor for PFA, furfuryl alcohol (FA) is sourced from feedstocks rich in hemicellulose, such as corn cobs, oat hulls and wood. To exploit FA as a polymerizable solvent, cellulose whiskers (CW) and montmorillonite clay (MMT) {{were used as}} the nanoparticle phase. Results from PNC processing show that CW and MMT can be dispersed in the PFA matrix by means of insitu polymerization, {{without the use of}} surfactants or dilution in solvents. Both CW and MMT nanoparticles catalyze the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA). Moreover, the insitu intercalative polymerization of FA in the interlayer galleries of MMT leads to the complete exfoliation of the MMT in the PFA matrix. CW and MMT both function as effective matrix modifiers, increasing the thermal stability of PFA nanocomposites compared to pure PFA polymer. The increased thermal stability is seen as significant increases in the onset of degradation and in residual weight at high temperature. This research also explored the surface functionalization of Cu, Ni and Pt substrates by self-assembly of a range of difunctional linker molecules. Characterization by XPS and PM-IRRAS indicate that diisocyanides and dicarboxylic acids both form chemically "sticky" surfaces after self-assembly on Cu and Ni. <b>Sticky</b> <b>surfaces</b> may provide a means of increasing nanoparticle dispersion in metal nanocluster filled PNCs, by increasing their interaction with the matrix polymer. Another potential application for <b>sticky</b> <b>surfaces</b> on Cu is in the ongoing miniaturization of circuit boards. The functionalization of Cu bond pad substrates with linker molecules may provide an alternate means of bonding components to their bond pads, with higher placement accuracy compared to solder bumps.

METHODS Host-seeking female Anopheles gambiae activity was studied using a human-baited 'sticky-net' (a bed net without insecticide, coated with non-setting adhesive) to trap mosquitoes. The numbers and distribution of mosquitoes captured on each surface of the bed net were recorded and analysed using non-parametric statistical methods and random effects regression analysis. To confirm sticky-net reliability, the experiment was repeated using a pitched sticky-net (tilted sides converging at apex, i. e., neither horizontal nor vertical).

40|$|Materials are {{autonomously}} self-healing when repair is triggered not {{by external}} intervention (heat, light [...] .) {{but by the}} damage itself.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a method to locally control the {{wettability}} behavior of PDMS surfaces by excimer laser ablation. In the ablation process, a micrometer scale roughness is formed in the irradiated regions while a nanometer scale roughness is formed by the redeposits surrounding the irradiated regions. The increase in surface roughness results in a change of the wettability behavior of the PDMS surface. By using a hexagonal pattern and tuning the patterning pitch, two dierent wetting behaviors were realized. A pitch smaller than 300 µm resulted in a superhydrophobic surface with an advancing contact angle of ¿_adv= 165 and a receding contact angle of ¿_rec= 160. A pitch between 300 - 500 µm resulted in a <b>sticky</b> superhydrophobic <b>surface</b> with ¿_adv= 120 - 150 and ¿_rec= 80. The contact angle hysteresis for the latter was larger than for untreated PDMS resulting in very <b>sticky</b> <b>surfaces</b> with high sliding angles. This gives the method great versatility since the two wetting behaviors are very dierent. By combining both behaviors, local surface features like pinning sites, non-wetting sites, barriers and guides can all be fabricated by a single method. As an application demonstrator of the method, we show that drops can be caught and released depending on size and tilting angle by creating slippery <b>surfaces</b> with <b>sticky</b> barriers. Additionally, the method is ideal for rapid prototyping as it consist of only a single step. It is a direct write method requiring no lithographic mask.
