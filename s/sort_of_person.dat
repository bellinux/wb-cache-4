500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues.

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story.

500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who people would get deeply involved with.

When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|Wu was {{in general}} loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but {{continued}} to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay {{at a meeting of}} the China Writers Association entitled [...] "Against Those Who Wield the Scissors—a Plea for an End to Censorship". It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed [...] "acrimonious". After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was [...] "the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who should be in the Party." [...] In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting.|$|E
500|$|After the Magical Mystery Tour recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney {{to shoot}} [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] promotional film, {{although}} McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed.

500|$|In chapter 16 of {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, a kenning given for Loki is [...] "relative of Sleipnir." [...] In chapter 17, a story is {{provided}} in which Odin rides Sleipnir into the land of Jötunheimr and arrives at the residence of the jötunn Hrungnir. Hrungnir asks [...] "what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> this was" [...] wearing a golden helmet, [...] "riding sky and sea," [...] and says that the stranger [...] "has a marvellously good horse." [...] Odin wagers his head that no horse as good {{could be found in}} all of Jötunheimr. Hrungnir admitted that it was a fine horse, yet states that he owns a much longer-paced horse; Gullfaxi. Incensed, Hrungnir leaps atop Gullfaxi, intending to attack Odin for Odin's boasting. Odin gallops hard ahead of Hrungnir, and, in his, fury, Hrungnir finds himself having rushed into the gates of Asgard. In chapter 58, Sleipnir is mentioned among a list of horses in Þorgrímsþula: [...] "Hrafn and Sleipnir, splendid horses [...] ". In addition, Sleipnir occurs twice in kennings for [...] "ship" [...] (once appearing in chapter 25 in a work by the skald Refr, and [...] "sea-Sleipnir" [...] appearing in chapter 49 in Húsdrápa, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason).|$|E

Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally Physical Education (PE) {{and sports}} in {{secondary}} schools in the United Kingdom have aimed towards moral goals. Not all of these goals have been well thought through. Where these goals have been systematically developed, they have followed a narrow and prescriptive conception of moral education that mainly focuses on adherence to predetermined rules and principles. From Aristotle we have a less reductive view of moral education - virtue ethics - which revolves around the development of good character as constituted by the "morally" good person. Drawing on group interviews with exceptional teachers and the writings of virtue ethicists, I develop a sketch of a character education programme {{that is based on}} talk and reflection (Pincoffs, 1986), and that cultivates the joyful disposition through direct engagement in sporting activities. Outlining what such a character education in PE and sports might look like, I start by exan-ýining what already exists in terms of "moral practices" within sports themselves (MacIntyre, 1985). Sports traditions aim at developing certain <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> By talking about and reflecting upon what might constitute a good sportsperson with colleagues, teachers can begin to identify for themselves the <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> they want to see playing sports. Part of playing and teaching sports well is learning to discern between the value of different activities and the company <b>of</b> different <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> By nurturing and developing certain <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> dispositions over others, teachers can help pupils shape their own involvement and ethical outlook in PE and sports. Through the cultivation of a joyful disposition teachers can help pupils to develop good character and live flourishing lives. This emphasis on joyfulness also brings into sharper focus what has been previously missing in PE and sports policy documents, namely the significance of an emotional engagement in PE and sports when it comes to educating for good character...|$|R
