40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{awareness}} is established by vehicles exchanging their status frequently. In situations where {{a high number}} of vehicles access the communication channel with high frequency, communication and cooperative awareness suffer from increased packet loss. So far, forwarding of beacons focuses on extending the range of V 2 V communication which is not necessarily needed in most scenarios. In this paper, we motivate selective beacon forwarding to improve the reliability of cooperative awareness in high load situations. We define a metric to measure the quality of cooperative awareness and compare different <b>static</b> <b>beacon</b> rates by a simulation study. Especially in high load situations, we evaluate selective forwarding of beacons to overcome the awareness degradation due to interference, leading to packet loss even at short distances. We show that our approach causes only slight overhead in terms of additional messages and that the age of forwarded information is less than half the beacon interval. I...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{validation}} of estimation and planning algorithms for underwater vehicle cooperative localization. While attitude and depth are easily instrumented with bounded-error, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have no internal sensor that directly observes XY position. The global positioning system (GPS) and other radio-based navigation techniques are not available because of the strong attenuation of electromagnetic signals in seawater. The navigation algorithms presented herein fuse local body-frame rate and attitude measurements with range observations between vehicles within a decentralized architecture. The acoustic communication channel is both unreliable and low bandwidth, precluding many state-of-the-art terrestrial cooperative navigation algorithms. We exploit the underlying structure of a post-process centralized estimator in order to derive two real-time decentralized estimation frameworks. First, the origin state method enables a client vehicle to exactly reproduce the corresponding centralized estimate within a server-to-client vehicle network. Second, a graph-based navigation framework produces an approximate reconstruction of the centralized estimate onboard each vehicle. Finally, we present a method to plan a locally optimal server path to localize a client vehicle along a desired nominal trajectory. The planning algorithm introduces a probabilistic channel model into prior Gaussian belief space planning frameworks. In summary, cooperative localization reduces XY position error growth within underwater vehicle networks. Moreover, these methods remove the reliance on <b>static</b> <b>beacon</b> networks, which do not scale to large vehicle networks and limit the range of operations. Each proposed localization algorithm was validated in full-scale AUV field trials. The planning framework was evaluated through numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{contributor to}} the total energy consumed on many battery-powered mobile devices is the wireless network interface card (NIC). Therefore, minimizing the energy consumption of the NIC can result in significant battery life improvement for a mobile device. One way of achieving this is to transition the NIC to a lower-power sleep mode when possible For example, the IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN standard power-saving mode (PSM) makes access points buffer data destined for a client and uses a periodic beacon to inform the mobile client about any buffered data. This allows the NIC to enter sleep mode between beacons. In this paper, we show that 802. 11 PSM performs poorly {{due to the fact}} that an access point is unable to adapt to the requirements of each client. Therefore, we propose a novel power saving algorithm, PSM-Dynamic, where the access point uses different beacon periods for different clients. During HTTP downloads, each client carefully chooses a good beacon period for itself, based on the RTT of its current connections, and informs the access point of this beacon period. This technique enables download times for Web pages that are comparable to those without any power-saving and provides energy savings comparable to the standard 802. 11 PSM. We show, using real-world easements and results from emulation-based experiments, that it is feasible for both clients and access points to efficiently support such per-client beacon periods, instead of having a common, <b>static</b> <b>beacon</b> for all clients. The solution is simple enough that it can be implemented with just small enhancements to the existing 802. 11 specification. ...|$|E
40|$|As an {{important}} issue in wireless sensor networks, localization is widely used to acquire node’s location in many aspects such as some routing mechanisms, target tracking, load balancing, topology control and so on. Traditional localization schemes need to pre-deploy {{a certain amount of}} <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> in the network and the percentage of <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> will directly affect the final localization result. In contrast, localization by use of mobile beacons is inherently more accurate and cost-effective. This study proposes a new ranging-free localization scheme with dual mobile beacons for wireless sensor networks. By deploying two fixed spacing mobile beacons moving in line with constant speed but different communication reach range, the localization can be realized through a single interaction with the unknown node. Since there is only few messages exchanged between unknown node and mobile beacons, this scheme is easy to control the node energy consumption. Furthermore, free from the channel noise interference is another key feature of this scheme due to the ranging-free technology. The simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme has good localization accuracy when mobile beacons themselves are localized with small error and beacon message transmit interval is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, We {{mathematically model}} the In-Range {{localization}} scheme {{in the presence}} of a Mobile Beacon. In the In-Range localization scheme, a sensor with unknown location is localized to a disc centered at the position of the beacon, if the sensor under consideration can successfully decode a transmission from the beacon. In our approach a Mobile Beacon guided by a mobility model is used to generate the virtual beacons, there by eliminating the need to deploy <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> that are required in the classical In-Range localization scheme. For analysis, we consider a Mobile Beacon guided by the Random Way Point (RWP) mobility model with In-Range localization scheme. The main contribution of this paper consists of mathematical models for the In-Range localization parameters {{in the presence of}} a Mobile Beacon guided by the RWP mobility model...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, {{sensors that}} map the {{positions}} of objects in unknown environments are installed on dynamic platforms. As measurements are relative to the observer's sensors, scene mapping requires accurate knowledge of the observer state. However, in practice, observer reports are subject to positioning errors. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) addresses the joint estimation problem of observer localization and scene mapping. State-of-the-art approaches typically use visual or optical sensors and therefore rely on <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> in the environment to anchor the observer estimate. However, many applications involving sensors that are not conventionally used for SLAM are affected by highly dynamic scenes, such that the static world assumption is invalid. This paper proposes a novel approach for dynamic scenes, called GEneralized Motion (GEM) -SLAM. Based on Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filters, the proposed approach probabilistically anchors the observer state by fusing observer information inferred from the scene with reports of the observer motion. This paper derives the general, theoretical framework for GEM-SLAM and shows that it generalizes existing PHD-based SLAM algorithms. Simulations for a model-specific realization using range-bearing sensors and multiple moving objects highlight that GEM-SLAM achieves significant improvements over three benchmark algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Providing ad-hoc {{solutions}} for positioning and tracking of emergency response teams {{is an important}} and safety-critical challenge. Although solutions based on inertial sensing systems are promising, {{they are subject to}} drift. We address the problem of positional drift by having the responders themselves deploy beacons, specifically ultrasound beacons, as they progress into an unknown environment. Our research focuses on a sensor network approach that does not require any pre-deployment of infrastructure. This paper targets two important aspects within the context of providing positioning service for emergency responders namely on how to locate the deployed <b>static</b> <b>beacons,</b> and on how to track the responders by using a combination of ultrasound and inertial measurements. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) characterisation of the errors encountered in an inertial-based pedestrian dead reckoning solution and ultrasound range measurements in a mobile setting, (ii) an algorithm for ultrasound beacon localisation (using multidimensional scaling), (iii) formulation of a Kalman filtering based algorithm for tracking the responder using a combination of ultrasound range and inertial measurements, and (iv) the presented algorithms are evaluated using data collected from real deployments and are compared against an ultra-wideband (UWB) precision location system. Our approach of preventing the drift in inertial estimates by combining with ultrasound measurements are promising and offers a viable solution to providing positioning and tracking support to emergency responders.

50|$|Although {{scenario}} planning {{has gained}} much adherence in industry, its subjective and heuristic nature leaves many academics uncomfortable. How {{do we know}} {{if we have the}} right scenarios? And how do we go from scenarios to decisions? These concerns are legitimate and scenario planning would gain in academic standing if more research were conducted on its comparative performance and underlying theoretical premises. A collection of chapters by noted scenario planners failed to contain a single reference to an academic source, though this may be because academics have not caught up or do not have the resources to either do or teach scenario planning. In general, there are few academically validated analyses of scenario planning (for a notable exception, see Paul J. H. Schoemaker). The technique was born from practice and its appeal is based more on experience than scientific evidence. Furthermore, significant misconceptions remain about its intent and claims. Above all, scenario planning is a tool for collective learning, reframing perceptions and preserving uncertainty when the latter is pervasive. Too many decision makers want to bet on one future scenario, falling prey to the seductive temptation of trying to predict the future rather than to entertain multiple futures. Another trap is to take the scenarios too literally as though they were <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> that map out a fixed future. In actuality, their aim is to bound the future but in a flexible way that permits learning and adjustment as the future unfolds.|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} GPS {{underwater}} makes navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) a difficult challenge. Without an external reference {{in the form}} of acoustic beacons at known positions, the vehicle has to rely on proprioceptive information obtained through a compass, a Doppler Velocity Logger (DVL) or an Inertial Navigation System (INS) [1]. Independent {{of the quality of the}} sensors used, the error in the position estimate based on dead-reckoning information grows without bound. Typical navigation errors are 0. 5 % to 2 % of distance traveled for vehicles traveling within a few hundred meters of the sea floor such that their DVL has a lock on the bottom. Errors as low as 0. 1 % can be obtained with large and expensive INS systems, but for vehicles relying only on a compass and a speed estimate can be as high as 10 %. By surfacing the AUV can obtain a position update through its GPS, but this is impossible (under ice) or undesirable for many applications. The use of <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> {{in the form of}} a Long Baseline (LBL) array limits the operation area to a few km 2 and requires a substantial deployment effort before operations, especially in deep water. As underwater vehicles become more reliable and affordable the simultaneous use of several AUVs recently became a viable option and multi-vehicle deployments will become standard in the upcoming years. This will not only make entirely new types of missions which rely on cooperation possible, but will also allow each individual member of the group to benefit from navigation information obtained from other members. For optimal cooperative localization a few dedicated Communication and Navigation Aid-AUVs (CNAs), which maintain an accurate estimate of their position through sophisticated DVL and INS sensors, can enable a much larger group of vehicles with less sophisticated navigation suites to maintain an accurate position, as describe...|$|R
40|$|Water Distribution Systems (WDS) are {{critical}} infrastructures of national importance that supply water of desired {{quality and quantity}} to consumers. They are prone to damages and attacks such as leaks, breaks, and chemical contamination. Monitoring of WDS for prompt response to such events is of paramount importance. WDS monitoring has been typically performed using static sensors that are strategically placed. These solutions are costly and imprecise. Recently mobile sensors for WDS monitoring has attracted research interest to overcome the shortcomings of static sensors. However, most existing solutions are unrealistic, or disrupt the normal functioning of a WDS. They {{are also designed to}} be deployed on-demand, i. e., when the utility manager receives complaints or suspects the presence of a threat. We propose {{to solve the problem of}} WDS monitoring through a Cyber-Physical system (CPS) approach. We envision a Cyber-Physical Water Distribution System (CPWDS) with mobile sensors that are deployed in the CPWDS and move with the flow of water in pipes; mobile sensors communicate with <b>static</b> <b>beacons</b> placed outside the pipes and report sensed data; the flows in the pipes are controlled to ensure that the sensors continuously cover the main pipes of the WDS. We propose algorithms to efficiently monitor the WDS with limited number of devices, protocols to efficiently communicate among the devices, and mechanisms to control the flows in the WDS such that consumer demands are met while sensors continuously move around. We evaluate our algorithms, protocols, and design of communication, computation and control components of the CPWDS through a simulator developed specifically to model the movement of sensors through the pipes of the WDS. Our simulations indicate that investing on improving the sensing range of mobile sensors reduces the cost of monitoring significantly. Additionally, the placement of beacons, and the communication range impact the accuracy of localization and estimation of sensor locations. Our flow control system is observed to converge and improve the coverage over time...|$|R

40|$|An {{estimation}} {{approach is}} presented for an autonomous tethered kite {{system for the}} purpose of airborne wind energy generation. Accurate estimation of the kite state is critical to the performance of automatic flight controllers. We propose an estimation scheme which fuses measurements from range sensing, based on ultra-wideband radios, and inertial readings from an inertial measurement unit. Ranges are measured between a transceiver fixed to the moving kite body and a number of <b>static</b> range <b>beacons</b> scattered on the ground. Estimates are computed using the multiplicative extended Kalman filtering scheme with a sensor-driven kinematic process model using a quaternion representation of the kite attitude. Furthermore, we assume only approximate prior knowledge of the range beacon locations and consider the problem of estimating the kite state and localizing the range beacons simultaneously. We present results of the estimator tested within a simulation environment of an airborne wind energy system and compare performance to an existing estimation scheme based on tether-angles and tether-length measurements...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{simultaneously}} reconstructing a polygonal room and a trajectory of a device equipped with a (nearly) collocated omnidirectional source and receiver. The device measures arrival times of echoes of pulses emitted by the source and {{picked up by the}} receiver. No prior knowledge about the device's trajectory is required. Most existing approaches addressing this problem assume multiple sources or receivers, or they assume that some of these are <b>static,</b> serving as <b>beacons.</b> Unlike earlier approaches, we take into account the measurement noise and various constraints on the geometry by formulating the solution as a minimizer of a cost function similar to stress in multidimensional scaling. We study uniqueness of the reconstruction from first-order echoes, and we show that in addition to the usual invariance to rigid motions, new ambiguities arise for important classes of rooms and trajectories. We support our theoretical developments with a number of numerical experiments. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers Websit...|$|R
