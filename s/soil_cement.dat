Soil {{condition}} {{is a major}} impact factor {{on the strength of}} <b>cemented</b> <b>soil.</b> In order to study the relationship between the soil conditions and the strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> in deep mixing column under the circumstance of thick soft clay in the Nansha area, the uniaxial and unconfined compressive strength tests were carried out, from which stress-strain curves of the <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> and strength-depth curves of column body were obtained under three different soil conditions. Analyzing these curves, conclusions can be made that the strength of different parts of <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> from deep mixing pile varies greatly in the Nansha area. Among the samples, the cement mixed with silty clay has the highest strength, while the lowest one is the cement mixed with mud.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityShrinkage {{cracking}} of <b>soil</b> or <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> {{can cause}} the infiltration or seepage of water into the material and lead to reflective cracking in the structure above it. Shrinkage cracking greatly limits the use of cementitious stabilization. Drying shrinkage is the major problem associated with shrinkage cracking. Although some studies on the drying shrinkage cracking of concrete have been carried out, few research efforts have focused on unsaturated <b>soil</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>soil.</b> Even fewer studies consider the shrinkage stress distribution and evolution of the stress profile during drying and/or cement hydration in shrinkage cracking modeling. Using two types of soil and two types of <b>cement</b> <b>soil,</b> this study investigates the <b>soil</b> and <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> properties {{that are related to}} drying shrinkage and shrinkage cracking. These material properties, which are considered in this study to be dependent on pore relative humidity (RH) and/or cement hydration and, therefore, are neither uniform nor constant during drying and/or cement hydration, include the humidity isotherm, diffusion coefficient, soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), tensile strength, tensile stress-strain relationship, and shrinkage potential, etc. This study examines the effects of pore RH and/or cement hydration on these material properties. Models are developed herein to predict the evolution of these material properties during drying and/or cement hydration. By measuring the humidity isotherm and diffusion coefficient and using the finite element (FE) method, the evolution of the pore RH gradient within the <b>soil</b> or <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> specimens during drying can be fully captured. A coefficient of moisture shrinkage is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap between pore RH and shrinkage potential, which is defined in this study as the maximum possible drying shrinkage of a material at a given pore RH when there is no restraint. Then, the pore RH and/or cement hydration-dependent tensile strength, tensile stress-strain relationship, and shrinkage potential within the specimens during drying and/or cement hydration can be fully understood using the models developed in this study. Finally, FE modeling case studies were conducted to verify the models and procedure proposed in this study to predict shrinkage stress and shrinkage cracking. The results were compared with results from laboratory experiments and good agreement was found. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|R

Based on {{the safety}} and {{durability}} in the <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> engineering about the pits anti-seepage, embankment impermeable walls and subgrade strengthening in the frozen regions and the retaining walls in foundation pits, the experiments on the compressibility about the <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> under freezing-thawing cycle, infiltrated and other environmental-action conditions {{have been carried out}} and the influential laws of environmental actions on the compression parameter of <b>cement</b> <b>soil</b> have been obtained.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most {{undisturbed}} natural soils {{have experienced}} {{some degree of}} post-depositional digenesis often leading to a <b>cemented</b> structure. <b>Cemented</b> <b>soils</b> display distinctly different characteristics from freshly remolded soils, including high small-strain stiffness, weakened stiffness-stress dependency, higher dilative tendency, stiffness loss after cementation breakage, proneness to strain localization, decreased liquefaction potential, and pronounced sampling effects particularly on small strain stiffness. Unsaturation often coexists with <b>cemented</b> <b>soils,</b> {{and in some cases}} the development of cementation is linked to diminishing saturation. At the microscale, the behavior exhibited by <b>cemented</b> <b>soils</b> can be analyzed in terms of simple yet robust micromechanical concepts to create a coherent physical-mechanical framework that explains deviations from the conventional understanding of soil behavior which centers on effective stress dependent stiffness. In view of <b>cemented</b> <b>soils,</b> proper site characterization must consider in situ measurements of shear wave velocity, and careful sampling techniques...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there are}} few studies of {{deformation}} and strength properties of loose <b>soils</b> strengthened by <b>cementing.</b> Based on the data of already arranged grout curtains {{it was determined that}} in <b>cemented</b> gravel-pebble <b>soil</b> there are 7 [...] . 9 % of cement, which is less than in concrete. To assess deformation and strength of such soils it is possible to use the data of tests conducted by other authors, where the effect of cement contents on sand-cement mix properties was studied. Analysis of experimental data showed that <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> may be identified with concrete only with high content of cement (more than 10 %). At cement content 7 [...] . 9 % in soil the strength deformation of <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> varies to a small extent. Its deformation becomes 2 - 3 times less. It greatly depends on compression stresses. The formulae are proposed which permit assessing the effect of compression and cement content on deformation of <b>cemented</b> <b>soil.</b> It is shown that strength of <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> is less than that even of the weakest concrete.

5000|$|A soil {{stabiliser}} is {{a construction}} vehicle with a powered metal drum that has rows of mixing blades or paddles.

Modern soil stabilisers are more powerful and often use carbide tips instead of paddles. Some are called single pass soil stabilizers because they can make <b>soil</b> <b>cement</b> in one pass where some of these machines take up to four passes.

In early autumn, rain events removed soil dust and leaf functions partly recovered, while cement dust created a crust partially remaining onto the leaves and causing more permanent stress. Leaf characteristics were differentially affected by the two dusts studied due to their different hydraulic properties.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of the <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> will be reduced when <b>cemented</b> <b>soils</b> are applied in the MgCl 2 corrosive environment to conduct seepage control in hydraulic engineering.

More engineering practices regarding the reduction in mechanical {{properties of}} <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> in the MgCl 2 environment are required. To simulate and study the corrosion process, {{a series of tests}} including photographing, unconfined compression tests, and measuring Mg 2 + and Cl − concentrations of solution were conducted on cured <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> blocks with different concentrations of MgCl 2 solutions. Results show that the surface corrosion of the sample increases while the compression strength decreases with the increase in solution concentration given the same curing time of the concrete block. Chemical analysis of the corrosive environment indicates that the volumes of new products such as CaCl 2 ∙ 6 H 2 O and Mg 2 (OH) 3 Cl ⋅ 4 H 2 O amount to seven times that of Ca(OH) 2 after reaction. The corrosion of <b>cemented</b> <b>soil</b> is a sort of crystallizing corrosion.
