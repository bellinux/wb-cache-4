5|$|Michelle met Barack Obama {{when they}} were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has {{sometimes}} <b>said</b> <b>only</b> two, although others have pointed out there were others in different departments), and she was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate. Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.|$|E
5|$|On LGBT rights, she {{supported}} {{the right to}} same-sex marriage. Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she <b>said</b> <b>only</b> that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages. In 2000, {{she was the first}} First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade. In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston <b>said</b> <b>only</b> that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Janowitz {{originally}} intended {{the part of}} Cesare {{to go to his}} friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, {{but by the time the}} film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Dr. Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, who Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz <b>said</b> <b>only</b> Krauss or Paul Wegener could have played the part. The parts of Dr. Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape, and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in Caligari were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes, and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in Caligari were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's Seeschlacht, at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style.|$|E
5|$|The Indians had a doubleheader {{against the}} White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was {{estimated}} that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park. Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day. Doby <b>said</b> <b>only</b> because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player. Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged. It was the only game Doby started {{for the remainder of the}} season. Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5–1 Indians win.|$|E

25|$|The Winter Palace was not {{the only}} palace in the {{unfinished}} city, or even the most splendid, as Peter had ordered his nobles to construct residences and to spend half the year there. This was an unpopular command; Saint Petersburg was founded upon a swamp, with little sunlight, and it was <b>said</b> <b>only</b> cabbages and turnips would grow there. It was forbidden to fell trees for fuel, so hot water was permitted just once a week. Only Peter's second wife, Empress Catherine, pretended to enjoy life in the new city.|$|E

25|$|As of March 2012, a {{poll by the}} Global Views Monthly {{indicated}} that support for Taiwanese independence has risen.

Asked whether Taiwan would eventually declare itself a new and independent nation, 49.1 percent replied yes while 38 percent responded negatively, the Global Views Monthly <b>said.</b> <b>Only</b> 22.9 percent agreed that Taiwan should eventually unify with China, while 63.5 percent disagreed.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{revisions}} of Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII, the Ite Missa est {{was replaced with}} Benedicamus Domino ("Let us bless the Lord") on days in which the Gloria was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments (i.e., Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent and Passiontide; vigils; certain votive Masses). In the 1962 Missal, Benedicamus Domino is <b>said</b> <b>only</b> when the Mass is followed by another liturgical action, such as the Eucharistic Processions on Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi.|$|E

25|$|Rémy {{described}} the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, {{under intense pressure}} to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy <b>said</b> <b>only</b> about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five {{by the time he}} was fired in December 2003.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} bodies at {{multiple}} times at Key West {{has led to}} confusion over how many bodies from the Maine are buried there. The New York Times did not report the number of dead at Key West, but <b>said</b> <b>only</b> two had been identified. In 1912, the Army Quartermaster Corps reported that there were just 19 bodies at Key West. But other published sources vary quite widely. The National Geographic Society reported 22 bodies in 2012. A number of sources cite 24 bodies. In May 1898, the Washington Post reported 24 bodies buried at Key West. It said two were identified, an African American and a Japanese mess attendant. In 1997, the Associated Press also that 24 bodies were buried at Key West, of whom seven were identified. In 2009, the Key News newspaper also reported 24 bodies at Key West, including that of Coal Passer John Ziegler. A wide range of other sources have also cited 24 bodies at Key West. Some sources say 25 bodies are buried there, others 26, and several others 27.|$|E
