40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of three ASTM saturation techniques for measuring the water absorption of concrete. The water absorption of two ordinary concretes was determined based on the cold water, boiling water and vacuum saturation techniques. The concretes were produced with water to cement (w/c) ratios of 0. 50 and 0. 60 and tested at 7 and 28 days. The vacuum saturation was more effective than the cold water and boiling water saturation methods. The vacuum saturation technique produced up to 13. 1 more water absorption than the boiling water <b>saturation</b> <b>method</b> and up to 20. 2 more water absorption than the cold water <b>saturation</b> <b>method.</b> Thus the present study suggests that the vacuum saturation technique is more efficient than both cold water and boiling water saturation methods to measure the water absorption of concrete...|$|E

40|$|A saturation-based {{approach}} is proposed to image the arterial blood flow signal with temporal resolution of 1 to 2 s and in-plane spatial resolution {{of a few}} millimeters. Using a saturation approach to suppress the undesired background stationary signal allows the blood water that enters the slice to be imaged at some specified later time. Since the blood protons that are being imaged are not restricted to the intravascular space, this technique is also sensitive to tissue perfusion signal contributions. The signal uptake characteristics of the <b>saturation</b> <b>method</b> proposed were used to study the different signal contributions {{as a function of}} the acquisition parameters. A typical perfusion acquisition (FAIR) was also used for comparison. The proposed method was demonstrated in a functional motor activation experiment and the observed signal changes were smaller than those obtained using the FAIR acquisition. The dynamics of the <b>saturation</b> <b>method</b> and FAIR temporal signal changes were investigated and time constants between 2 and 44 s were estimated. The tissue signal contribution to the saturation method's signal was small over the range of acquisition parameters that sensitized it to the arterial compartment.

40|$|Estimates of {{mesophyll}} conductance (gm), when {{calculated from}} chlorophyll fluorescence, are uncertain, {{especially when the}} photosystem II (PSII) operating efficiency is measured from the traditional single saturation pulse methodology. The multiphase flash method has recently been recommended to replace the single <b>saturation</b> pulse <b>method,</b> allowing a more reliable estimation of gm. Also, many researchers still directly use the PSII operating efficiency to derive linear electron transport rate J (that is required to estimate gm), without appropriate calibration using measurements under non-photorespiratory conditions. Here we demonstrate for tomato and rice that (i) using the multiphase flash method did not yield realistic estimates of gm if no calibration was conducted; and (ii) using the single <b>saturation</b> pulse <b>method</b> still gave reasonable estimates of gm when calibration based on the non-photorespiratory measurements was properly conducted. Therefore, conducting calibration based on data under non-photorespiratory conditions was indispensable for a reliable estimation of gm, regardless whether the multiphase flash or the single <b>saturation</b> pulse <b>method</b> was used for measuring the PSII operating efficiency. Other {{issues related to the}} procedure of using the chlorophyll fluorescence method to estimate gm were discussed...|$|R
