40|$|The inport {{tariff rate}} for walnuts in Japan is 10 %, which is {{significantly}} higher than for other nuts imported in Japan. This report examines {{the question of whether}} walnut import liberalization is benefical or harmful to Japan. The answer is walnut import liberalization benefits Japan. A sumulation model is developed which considers the competition between the US and China in the Japanese <b>shelled</b> <b>walnut,</b> shelled sweet almond, and pistachio markets. Tariff elimination of walnuts imports to Japan would heve increased U. S. exports by 4. 7 % and generate a gain of 397 million yen for Japanese users in 2002. There are virtually no nogative effects on Japanese walnut growers because {{there are only a few}} farmers specialized in walnut production and specialized farmers have their own niche markets completely separated from inports Our results also reveal that the promotion money collected from U. S. walnut growers is effective in increasing U. S. exports to Japan. Specifically, we estimate the incremental gains to U. S. walnut growers to be over three tomes higher than the incermantal promotion costs...|$|E

This paper evaluates the aqueous NOMs adsorption efficiency on <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> modified with Zinc Oxide (ZnO). Materials &amp; Methods: This study examined the feasibility of removing NOMs from aqueous solutions using <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> modified with ZnO. The effects of NOMs concentration, modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO dosage, and pH on adsorption of NOMs by modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO were evaluated. Results: The adsorption capacities of modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO in the best conditions were 37. 93 mg/g. The results also demonstrated that adsorption capacity of NOMs on modified <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> with ZnO was higher in lower pHs due to significantly high electrostatic attraction exists between the positively charged surface of the adsorbent and negatively charged NOMs. And finally adsorption capacity decreases as adsorbent dose increase. Conclusion: <b>Walnut</b> <b>shell</b> modified with ZnO can be proposed as a natural adsorbent in the removal of NOMs from aqueous solution...|$|R

50|$|Walnuts are rounded, single-seeded {{stone fruits}} of the walnut tree {{commonly}} used for the meat after fully ripening. Following full ripening, {{the removal of the}} husk reveals the wrinkly <b>walnut</b> <b>shell,</b> which is usually commercially found in two segments (three-segment shells can also form). During the ripening process, the husk will become brittle and the shell hard. The shell encloses the kernel or meat, which is usually made up of two halves separated by a partition. The seed kernels - commonly available as <b>shelled</b> <b>walnuts</b> - are enclosed in a brown seed coat which contains antioxidants. The antioxidants protect the oil-rich seed from atmospheric oxygen, thereby preventing rancidity.|$|R

The hydrogen gas yield of 6.52  mol per gram and the ratio of 27  % in total gas were observed for wheat straw as the highest hydrogen yield among experimented feedstocks. Results indicated that wheat straw, <b>walnut</b> <b>shell,</b> and almond shell had the highest hydrogen yield, respectively, and wheat straw, almond <b>shell,</b> and <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> showed the highest hydrogen gasification efficiency, respectively. It was also recognized that cellulose and hemicellulose were better gasified than lignin because of their easier hydrolysis and higher solubility in water.|$|R

Gasification of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> as the main hard nutshell produced in Kurdistan Province of Iran was investigated using a stainless steel batch micro-reactor. Effects of reaction time {{in the range of}} 10 – 30  min, feed loading in the range of 0.06 – 0.18  g, and temperature in the range of 400 – 440  °C were investigated to determine the condition for maximum hydrogen yield. Furthermore, carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HGE) were calculated according to the elemental analysis and the yields of gaseous products. Total gas yield and hydrogen yield were directly correlated with temperature. Steam reforming of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> was favored at higher temperatures. Also, <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> loading was inversely correlated with total gas and hydrogen yields while production of methane was favored by higher loading of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell.</b> Furthermore, hydrogen yield increased first, when reaction time increased from 10 to 20  min, and then decreased.

Naturally, the usage of waste materials in concrete have become an interesting research area in recent years, {{which is used to}} reduce the negative influence of concrete on the environment. Hence, this paper presents the development of a sustainable lightweight wet-mix shotcrete by replacing natural coarse gravel with a kind of byproduct, nut <b>shell</b> (<b>walnut).</b> Fibers made from dumped polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles were mixed in the composite to improve the properties of the lightweight wet-mix shotcrete.

Additionally, appropriate dosage of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> can improve the shootability of fresh concrete with low rebound rate and larger build-up thickness.

Gasification of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> in SCW media was performed under 13 different conditions to observe the effect of parameters including temperature, feed content and reaction time on the yields of main gaseous products considering the main reactions of the process. Promising results were obtained using holistic and comprehensive analysis of gaseous products and affecting parameters, for waste management sector and energy industry of Iran which has not been studied before. Ranges of variation of parameters were determined, considering the capacity of the reactor system and the obtained results from the literature. The temperature had a significant effect on the total gas and hydrogen yield so that as temperature increased, hydrogen yield increased while increasing the temperature may cause intensive energy consumption. So, the appropriate range of temperature was considered between 400 and 440  °C and the maximum hydrogen yield occurred in 440  °C. The effects of reaction time and <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> loading were investigated at this temperature. The maximum hydrogen yield of 4.63 (mmol gas/g of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell)</b> was observed at the reaction time of 20  min, <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> loading of 0.06  g and temperature of 440  °C.|$|R

In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) modified with <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> to regulate RH, toluene, limonene, dodecane and formaldehyde. The physicochemical properties, including molecular size/shape, vapour pressure, polarity and boiling point of VOCs allowed them to represent a range of pollutants.

Of particular significance was the irreversible sink effect of formaldehyde and dodecane. This was attributed to the porous surface of <b>walnut</b> <b>shell</b> increasing the specific surface area of the panel and thus its adsorption capacity.
