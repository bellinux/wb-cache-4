5|$|Although {{hurricane}} warnings {{were issued}} for {{portions of the}} country, many <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> crew members ignored these warnings. As the tropical cyclone passed south of the Baja California Peninsula, it dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) in the area. Moderate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98 inches (228 mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1ndash&3 inches (25ndash&75 mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border.|$|E
5|$|While in the Bay of Campeche, the <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> Celestino Arias was sunken {{by strong}} waves {{generated}} by Janet after it suffered engine failures. The stranded ship was heavily {{damaged by the}} hurricane's strong winds in the bay, which broke towing lines. All of the ship's crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued and brought back to Tampa, Florida. Along the coast, tides were reported to be 3–4ft (0.91–1.2m) above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were 2ft (0.61m) above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned a <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old boy on the boat drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) of beach.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, {{diesel engine}} were adapted {{for use in}} <b>shrimp</b> <b>boats.</b> Power winches were {{connected}} to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. <b>Shrimp</b> <b>boats</b> became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened <b>shrimp</b> <b>boats,</b> so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.|$|R
5|$|The storm {{produced}} {{strong winds}} throughout western Cuba. Hundreds of homes were destroyed, as were several tobacco warehouses. There {{was at least}} $20million in damage and four deaths in Cuba, three of them caused by collapsing houses in the Guane area. Several tornadoes in Florida caused significant damage. Throughout the state, 1 house was destroyed, 33 were severely damaged, and 631 suffered minor impact. Additionally, 66 trailers were destroyed and 88 were inflicted with major damage. Three deaths occurred in the state, one due to {{a heart attack and}} two from drowning in Florida Keys when their <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> sank. Because the storm weakened considerably, impact in North Carolina was generally minor. The storm also spawned at least six tornadoes in the state, which demolished trailers and unroofed homes and other buildings in several communities. Damage throughout the United States totaled $10 million.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|One <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E

Along the coast, storm surge in Louisiana generally ran [...] above normal, although a slightly higher tide was reported near Intracoastal City. Due to the storm surge, part of Louisiana Highway 82 was closed between Holly Beach and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, Interstate 10 was also flooded by storm surge. Minor flooding from the surge traveled up the Calcasieu River to Lake Charles, where water flooded a local yacht club. Low-lying areas of Intracoastal City were flooded, disrupting marine industries. A man fell overboard from a <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> in rough seas from Edouard near the mouth of the Mississippi River.|$|E
500|$|A <b>shrimp</b> <b>boat</b> and {{two other}} {{watercraft}} {{were known to be}} in difficult situations, while another sent out a distress call claiming that the boat's fuel tank had dismantled from it and its crew was anticipating an explosion. A Coast Guard aircraft searched for the shrimping boat Rosina after it had begun to dismantle while a Coast Guard buoy identified as the Blackthorn probed for the Cain Hoy, although the three on board the Rosina were later recovered. All vessels reported as missing were recovered by the Coast Guard on July25. A ship known as Hope with a crew of three was thrown ashore [...] southeast of Freeport, but the United States Coast Guard was incapable of rescuing the craft and its shipmembers. Tornadoes touched down near the then-Jefferson County Airport, Sebastian, and Kenedy, with the first associated with the precursor to Debra.|$|E

The towns of Escuinapa, El Rosario, and Mazatlán, {{as well as the}} municipalities of Angostura, Mocorito, Navolato, and Culiacán sustained flooded, resulting in modest damage. In Angostura, numerous people were trapped on the roofs of their houses.
