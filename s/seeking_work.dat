5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman <b>seeking</b> <b>work</b> in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E
5|$|More than 30,000 workers {{walked off}} {{their jobs in}} May 1919 in {{what came to be}} known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the {{activity}} of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers <b>seeking</b> <b>work.</b> After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became the New Democratic Party.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} {{unemployment}} {{in an economy}} {{is measured by the}} unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force.

No differences were identified on levels of employment commitment. For the unemployed sample, predictors of job seeking behavior and well-being were then examined.

25|$|Unemployment was {{a chronic}} problem for Yugoslavia, the {{unemployment}} rates were amongst {{the highest in}} Europe during its existence {{and they did not}} reach critical levels before the 1980s only due to the safety valve provided by sending one million guest workers yearly to advanced industrialized countries in Western Europe. The departure of Yugoslavs <b>seeking</b> <b>work</b> began in the 1950s, when individuals began slipping across the border illegally. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly, especially to West Germany. By the early 1970s 20 percent of the country's labor force or 1,1 million workers were employed abroad. This was also a source of capital and foreign currency for Yugoslavia.|$|E

25|$|The {{completion}} in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad provided {{the impetus for}} the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Newburgh by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a transshipment center for iron ore to inland areas. That same year, the Grasselli Chemical Company opened on the Cuyahoga River (near the modern intersection of Broadway Avenue and E. 30th Street) to supply chemicals to the iron industry. Although Grasselli Chemicals was located outside the Union-Miles Park neighborhood, Czech and Polish immigrants, <b>seeking</b> <b>work</b> in the plant, began settling along Broadway Avenue nearby.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} Indian {{settlers}} in Canada were Indian Army {{soldiers who had}} passed through Canada in 1897 {{on their way home}} from attending Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebration in London, England. Some are believed to have remained in British Columbia and others returned there later. A Hindu-Canadian community has existed in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, for over 100 years. Hindu-Punjabi Indians were attracted to the possibilities for farming and forestry. They were mainly male Sikhs who were <b>seeking</b> <b>work</b> opportunities. Indo-Caribbeans, descendants of the Indian indentured workers who had gone to the Caribbean since 1838, made an early appearance in Canada {{with the arrival of the}} Trinidadian medical student Kenneth Mahabir and the Demerara (now Guyana) clerk M N Santoo, both in 1908.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between {{unemployed}} (n = 118) and employed (n = 120) groups on variables of psychological well-being, general self-efficacy, and employment commitment. Consistent with expectations, and earlier research, the unemployed reported poorer well-being, {{as measured by}} the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg, 1972). The unemployed also reported lower scores on the General Self-efficacy Scale (Sherer et al., 1982). Both groups reported similar levels of employment commitment, indicating both believed having work was important. Using regression analyses, the unemployed sample was then examined to determine which variables predicted job search frequency. Variables examined in the equation were demographic variables, well-being, self-efficacy, employment commitment, intentions to <b>seek</b> <b>work,</b> confidence about obtaining work, and need for work. Predictors of well-being were also examined using the same variables. Only intention to <b>seek</b> <b>work</b> was predictive of job seeking frequency. Self-efficacy, employment commitment, and intentions to <b>seek</b> <b>work</b> predicted well-being. The results are discussed in light of current theories examining job search behaviour, and recommendations are made for practice. Full Tex...|$|R
