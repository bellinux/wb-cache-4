40|$|Starch was {{isolated}} and yields and granule size distributions were determined at different steps during industrial pasta production and subsequent high-temperature drying (88 degrees C). The first drying steps rendered the starch granules {{in general and}} the small ones in particular less extractable, possibly due to increased physical inclusion or interaction between starch and gluten components. On the basis of analytical results, starches were divided in a first group containing those withdrawn before the pasta drier and a second group of starches that have undergone partial or complete drying. The latter starches showed higher gelatinization temperatures and viscosities and lower <b>swelling</b> <b>powers</b> and solubilities during gelatinization.

This {{study investigated}} whether, for good organoleptic properties, a permanent protein network needs to be formed during pasta drying or can still be formed during cooking.

SDSEP levels in dry and cooked products varied between 31 % and 56 %, and 12 % to 21 % of total protein contents, respectively. The highest quality spaghettis had relatively higher levels of SDSEP in the dry product, low starch gelatinisation temperatures and <b>swelling</b> <b>powers,</b> and rigid particles. The lowest quality spaghettis had lower levels of SDSEP and higher gelatinisation temperatures.

Both MS and WS derivatives had lower <b>swelling</b> <b>powers</b> (SP) at 90 ◦C than their respective native starches. The UD derivatives had lower SP 1 (90 ◦C) and greater retrogradation enthalpies than did SD derivatives, consistent with their lower peak and higher setback pasting viscosities. Also, SD starches were less soluble and retained a greater degree of granular integrity than UD starches in timelapse, hot-stage light microscopy studies (50 – 95 ◦C), likely due to a greater concentration of cross-links at the granule surface. The results confirm that derivatization patterns impact the physical properties of modified starches. Thus, varying derivatization patterns can be a strategy to tailor modified starch properties. status: publishe...|$|R

MethodsPatients were treated with three intra-articular injections of either SH (n= 28) or TA (n= 28). Primary assessments were pain according to a 100 mm visual analogue scale and extensive clinical and functional parameters such as <b>swelling,</b> grip <b>power</b> and range of motion. The population was analysed using one- and two-sided Mann–Whitney (MW) estimators. ResultsMaximum pain relief occurred at 2 – 3 weeks for TA and at week 26 for SH after the first intra-articular injection. At weeks 2 – 3 TA was significantly better than SH (MW: 0. 3319 and 0. 3063; P= 0. 9827 and 0. 9929). At week 26 a slight superiority of SH could be observed (MW: 0. 53; P= 0. 3624) and non-inferiority could be proven. After 26 weeks lateral pinch power was significantly better in the SH-group (MW: 0. 6331; P= 0. 0226). In all, 88. 0 % of patients treated with SH and 79. 1 % of the TA-group described pain improvement after 26 weeks. Both agents were well tolerated. No adverse events with causal connection to the investigational products occurred. ConclusionA single course of three SH injections is effective in relieving pain and improving joint function in patients with OA of the CMC joint of the thumb. Although in comparison with triamcinolone its effects are achieved more slowly, the results indicate a superior long-lasting effect of hyaluronan at 6 months after end of treatment period...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{power quality}} is {{essential}} in the effective transmission and distribution of power to consumers. With the increase in non-linear loads it is becoming more prevalent to maintain the quality of power supplied. Voltage sagging or <b>swelling</b> and <b>power</b> factor {{are two of the}} major power quality issues. By introducing a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) into a system these power-quality issues can be significantly reduced and maintained effectively. This project developed and tested the idea of constructing a low voltage static synchronous compensator for educational use, in which students could safely experiment with the concept and tools of power quality control. The end design goal was to construct a device capable of displaying the concepts of a STATCOM by producing a low voltage Alternating Current (AC) waveform to supply the given loads. Features of this project were to include a real-time display of system parameters and a switch with the ability to change between voltage control and power factor control. The project incorporates the use of various components to achieve the desired STATCOM. Integrated into this system is an Arduino Uno microcontroller. This controller produces the triangular carrier waveform through direct digital synthesis. Additionally, it is responsible for the measurement and display of system data. The control signals produced by the comparison of the filtered Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) triangular waveform with a sinusoidal control signal are fed into an Infineon Dual Half-Bridge. Following this the output of the bridge is fed through a low pass filter to produce the required output sinusoid for the STATCOM. Through several experiments the output waveform of the STATCOM was monitored and recorded. One of the parameters monitored for the STATCOM output was the total harmonic distortion of the output waves. At low amplitude modulation values the output waveform resembles a sinusoidal output however as expected at higher values the output waveforms begin to distort and resemble a square wave. The major recommended future works are to design a control algorithms capable of performing voltage control and power factor control to display the concepts of power quality control. In addition to this a method of switching between the two control modes will require installation. The project is unfortunately not considered to be at a completed, ready to implement stage. However, sufficient work has been undertaken and completed for another willing student to finalise the project...|$|R

6000|$|Democracy of {{the modern}} type, manhood {{suffrage}} and so forth, became a conspicuous phenomenon in the world only in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. Its genesis is so intimately connected with the first expansion of the productive element in the State, through mechanism and a co-operative organization, as to point at once to a causative connection. The more closely one looks into {{the social and political}} life of the eighteenth century the more plausible becomes this view. New and potentially influential social factors had begun to appear--the organizing manufacturer, the intelligent worker, the skilled tenant, and the urban abyss, and the traditions of the old land-owning non-progressive aristocratic monarchy that prevailed in Christendom, rendered it incapable--without some destructive shock or convulsion--of any re-organization to incorporate or control these new factors. In the case of the British Empire an additional stress was created by the incapacity of the formal government to assimilate the developing civilization of the American colonies. Everywhere there were new elements, not as yet clearly analyzed or defined, arising as mechanism arose; everywhere the old traditional government and social system, defined and analyzed all too well, appeared increasingly obstructive, irrational, and feeble in its attempts to include and direct these new powers. But now comes a point to which I am inclined to attach very great importance. The new powers were as yet shapeless. It was not the conflict of a new organization with the old. It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then--it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now--to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite re-construction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years. And these <b>swelling</b> inchoate new <b>powers,</b> whose very birth condition was the crippling, modification, or destruction of the old order, were almost forced to formulate their proceedings for a time, therefore, in general affirmative propositions that were really in effect not affirmative propositions at all, but propositions of repudiation and denial. [...] "These kings and nobles and people privileged in relation to obsolescent functions cannot manage our affairs"--that was evident enough, that was the really essential question at that time, and since no other effectual substitute appeared ready made, the working doctrine of the infallible judgment of humanity in the gross, as distinguished from the quite indisputable incapacity of sample individuals, became, in spite of its inherent absurdity, a convenient and acceptable working hypothesis.|$|R

A PCR screening method was able to detect {{the presence or absence}} of each of the three GBSS genes. It also detected polymorphisms in eight diploids and nine hexaploids, all displaying the same 25 bases deletion in the D genome allele of GBSS. Two tetraploids and five hexaploids were null 4 A for GBSS. There was little difference in the amylose contents and amylose-lipid dissociation peak temperatures of the synthetic hexaploids and the lower ploidy wheats. The synthetic hexaploids showed intermediate <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> values with the durums giving the highest swelling powers. The durums also had higher B granule contents than the A. tauschii accessions, but not as high as the synthetics. However, the A. tauschii samples gave the highest gelatinisation peak temperatures. The presence of the null 4 A mutation was positively correlated with <b>swelling</b> <b>power,</b> amylose content and DSC measurements. The new smaller D genome allele of GBSS was associated with slightly higher <b>swelling</b> <b>power.</b> These results confirm the value of wheat progenitor lines as sources of new starch properties for hexaploid wheat...|$|E
40|$|Granule-bound starch synthase, {{also known}} as the waxy protein catalyses the {{synthesis}} of amylose in wheat endosperm starch. In durum wheats, the genes encoding GBSS are present at the two Wx loci on chromosome 7 A and 4 A (a segment of 7 B that has been translocated). Several null Wx-B 1 (missing GBSS protein from chromosome 4 A) durum lines were produced from crosses with null- 4 A bread wheats backcrossed to durum wheats. Semolina milled from 4 normal and 7 null- 4 A durum wheat lines grown over two seasons (1999 and 2000) in South Australia were analysed for amylose content, starch pasting properties as measured by the Rapid Viscoanalyzer (RVA), <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> and starch damage, protein content and electrophoretic protein analysis. Spaghetti was prepared with a micro-scale extruder and the cooked pasta evaluated for cooking loss, firmness, stickiness and water absorption. The null- 4 A lines had significantly lower (ca. 5 %) amylose content, higher starch peak viscosities and semolina <b>swelling</b> <b>power.</b> The pasta derived from the null- 4 A lines had lower cooking loss and in 1999 was more adhesive than the non-waxy lines. Cooking loss was correlated with amylose content, peak starch viscosity, <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> of semolina and cooked pasta adhesiveness. Semolina <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> was highly correlated with RVA peak viscosity. Waxy durum wheats appear to have an advantage over the normal types in terms of lower cooking loss, widely used as an indicator of pasta cooking quality. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Starches {{isolated}} from twenty samples of Dioscorea rotundata L. (Dioscoreaceae) comprising ten local and hybrid cultivars each, were studied using micromorphological and chemical techniques. There is a marked polymorphism of granule shapes {{in all the}} samples, while the dimensions are more clear-cut, with granules exhibiting sizes > 40 ?m accounting for 42. 2 % and 12 % in local and hybrid cultivars, respectively. Solubility and <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> are characteristic in the cultivars and follow similar increase patterns along the temperature gradient under investigation. However, the <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> was relatively higher in the hybrid, than in the local cultivars, that suggest the chemical properties of D. rotundata starches are less affected by granule micromorphology, but more by the molecular and associative forces, which are intrinsic in the particular cultivar. The intergrading nature of granule morphology makes it an unsuitable attribute for discrimination among the cultivars. Therefore, solubility and <b>swelling</b> <b>power,</b> in combination with granule dimensions, may provide a secure technique for yam cultivar diagnosis, {{to be used in}} quality control and assurances, as well as in forensics. Okun, Sasanbula, Efuru and TDr 97 / 00940 cultivars, which show lower solubility values could be important to diabetics and other health-conscious individuals while, Kokumo, Odo, Amula, Amuo, TDr 98 / 01230, TDr 95 / 18544, TDr 95 / 9177, TDr 8902565, TDr 98 / 01217 cultivars which display higher solubility and <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> may be important for dietary improvement and uses in pharmaceutical formulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} staling {{of the most}} popular wheat bread-types in Saudi Arabia (Samauli, Mafrood, Burr and Tamees) were {{followed}} during 1, 2 and 3 days storage periods in polyethylene bags at room temperature. Measurements included loss of moisture, total water soluble starch, amylograph characteristics and sensory freshness evaluation. After the day storage period, Tamees bread had a faster degree of staling followed by Burr and Mafrood in comparison to Samauli and white pan breads. Both white pan and Samauli breads remained fresh to some degree while Mafrood and Burr breads were slightly stale and Tamees was stale. After 3 days storage period, all types of bread were rated very statle except Samuli and pan which was rated only stale. <b>Swelling</b> <b>power,</b> total water soluble, soluble starch and amyloraph maximum viscosity tended to decrease as the storage period increased. Sensory freshness scores of all breads correlated positively with <b>swelling</b> <b>power,</b> total soluble and soluble starch, and correlated negatively with the storage period: while <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> and maximum viscosity of bread samples correlated negatively with the storage period...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the modification of gadung (Dioscorea hispida Dennst) flour using ginger oil as cross linking agent following dispersion methods to meet {{the standards of the}} physicochemical properties of wheat. In keeping with that purpose, will be investigated the influence of molar ratio of ginger oil with of gadung flour (1 : 2 and 1 : 3), reaction time (30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes) and temperature (30, 40 and 50 oC) on water solubility and <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> properties of the modified gadung flour. This research begins by mixing the suspension of gadung flour and ginger oil on the condition appropriate to the variable, then the product was dried and analyzed the <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> and water solubility. Ratio of Ginger oil : gadung flour (1 : 3) with a temperature at 30 oC and 60 minutes is the best condition of modification obtained from this study, where the modified gadung flour obtained has a very similar water solubility and <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> properties with American wheat flour, which were 7. 28 (g/ 100 g) and 7. 9 (g/g), respectively.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of hydroxypropylated crosslinked sago starch (HPST) were determined and compared with five types of commercial modified starches (CMST) {{in order to}} evaluate its quality for further applications. The HPST was prepared {{on a large scale}} having molar substitution (MS) and degree substitution (DS) values in the range of 0. 038 to 0. 045 and 0. 004 to 0. 005, respectively. The properties of HPST in terms of sediment volume, <b>swelling</b> <b>power,</b> solubility and paste clarity were 15. 75 %, 16. 7, 8. 62 % and 5. 18 %T 650, respectively. The MS value, phosphorus content, paste clarity, <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> and syneresis after six freeze-thaw cycles of HPST when compared to that of commercially available modified starches which are normally used or incorporated in acidic, frozen and canned foods did not differ significantly. The pasting characteristic of HPST exhibited thin to thick viscosity which was similar (P> 0. 05) to that of commercial hydroxypropylated crosslinked tapioca starch (NAT 8). The acid stability, solubility and freeze-thaw stability of both starches were also similar (P> 0. 05) but the <b>swelling</b> <b>power</b> of HPST was slightly lower (P< 0. 05) than that of NAT 8...|$|E
