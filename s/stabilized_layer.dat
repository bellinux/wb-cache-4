40|$|Up till very {{recently}} detrimental “carbonation ” of cement and lime stabilized layers in Southern Africa, which normally {{manifests itself in}} the form of a thin loose powdery layer on the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> surface, was perceived to be caused by poor and/or insufficient curing.

40|$|Cohesive soils, {{which contain}} high {{percentage}} of moisture have low values of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and shear strength. Standard Specification for Road Works published by the Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) suggests that these weak soils should be replaced with a suitable capping layer. However, instead of replacing the weak soil layer, stabilization by lime can also be carried out on cohesive soils. In this research, lime stabilization method was applied at the minimum strength of the soil to form capping layer. Cohesive soils with Plasticity Index (PI) of more than 20 % and Clay Fraction (CF) exceeding 30 % were used. Hydrated lime {{in the percentage of}} 5 % by mixture was used as the stabilizing agent. CBR test were conducted on the stabilized soil samples and the result show strength development of more than 100 % after a curing period of 28 days. This strength development in lime-stabilized soil was also observed experimentally by load testing of a road structure model which consists of lime-stabilized layer as the capping layer over a weak, clay sub-grade. Initially, observations are made on the ability of the road structure to reduce settlement of the sub-grade when load is applied. Unstabilized soil experienced over 100 % settlement when the load increased from 0. 5 kN to 1. 5 kN. a reduction in settlement from 70 % to 100 % was achieved for <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> immediately after mixing. After 28 days, the settlement is almost negligible. The soil bearing capacity of stiff layer overlaying soft layer was determined using the theory proposed by Braja (1999). The theory is confirmed by the bearing capacity model study based on <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> overlay soft soil conducted using 32 cm x 32 cm model box with 52 cm in height. A number of 26 samples were prepared with 3 different stabilized layers i. e., 40, 60 and 80 mm thick. These samples were cured for a period of 0, 7, 14 and 28 days. The bearing capacity was determined according to the theoretical analysis and from model testing. The bearing capacity increases with curing period and thickness of the capping layer. For the purpose of weight limit design, curing period of 28 days is considered. Weight limit design with the incorporation of geotechnical aspect is used to determine the maximum allowable vehicular load. This maximum allowable load is taken at a point before the ultimate bearing capacity of the sub-grade is exceeded. This approach of design provide an additional precaution against accessive vehicular load so as not to overstress the sub-grade...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 04 - 36 was to recommend laboratory procedures to measure performance related characteristics of pavement layers stabilized with cement, lime, and fly ash {{and to provide}} validated distress models to {{be incorporated into the}} Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). As part of this project, the {{objective of}} this study was to identify a procedure for determining the number of load cycles to fatigue crack initiation for cement-stabilized base course and subgrade materials using a Large-Scale Model Experiment (LSME). This procedure was intended to provide a validation for the newly calibrated MEPDG fatigue model by replicating field conditions. Additionally, a series of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were conducted to provide a Level 2 correlation between UCS and several MEPDG performance model inputs. Initial LSMEs consisted of silt-cement (4 % by weight) layers approximately 1 m x 1 m and 0. 2 -m-thick. Surface and subgrade deflections were measured and the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> monitored for fatigue cracking. Changes in the deflection characteristics were expected to manifest during or after cracking of the materials. Cracking was not observed after 325, 000 cycles at loads ranging from 11. 1 ? 31. 1 kN. A second silt-cement layer of the same geometry was tested next. To increase deflections during loading and thus increase stress/strain in the layer, a piece of extruded polystyrene (XPS) was placed beneath the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer.</b> The presence of the foam layer more than doubled the elastic deflections compared to the first experiment. Even with the increase in deflections, no cracking was observed after 140, 000 cycles at 17. 8 kN and 260, 000 cycles at 22. 2 kN. For subsequent experiments, the geometry of the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> was changed to approximately 1 m x 2 m and 0. 1 -m-thick. Recycled pavement material (RPM) was stabilized with 3 % cement by weight and supported on a 1 m x 1 m, 25 -mm-thick layer of XPS. The applied load ranged from 15. 6 ? 26. 7 kN. After about 179, 000 cycles at 26. 7 kN, a fatigue crack was observed on the RPM surface. Deflection data gave no clear indication of the exact time of crack initiation. Another layer of gravel and cement (3 % by weight) was set up in the same configuration. The applied load was set to 26. 7 kN at the beginning of the experiment. Two fatigue cracks were observed on the gravel surface in less than 5, 000 cycles. Like the RPM experiment results, the deflection data for gravel-cement appeared unchanged by the presence of these cracks. For the next gravel-cement specimen the XPS layer was removed and the applied load reduced to 20. 0 kN for more than 900, 000 cycles. The load was increased to 26. 7 kN for an additional 400, 000 cycles. A crack was observed just prior to 400, 000 cycles. Deflection results were difficult to interpret and there was an equipment malfunction during this experiment causing some uncertainty in the results. Three silt-cement layers (8 % by weight) were placed on an expanded polystyrene (EPS) support with the same geometry as the previous RPM and gravel layers. The first silt-cement layer cracked in less than 200 cycles at 6. 7 kN. For the second layer the applied load was reduced to 4. 0 kN and a crack was observed at ? 3, 000 cycles. The third layer was subjected to a load of 3. 3 kN. Small cracks (2. 5 -cm-long) were observed after 1, 500 cycles. The cracks continued to grow and connect to additional observed cracks. After 16, 000 cycles, the cracks appeared to be forming a ring around the steel load plate. As with the previous LSMEs where cracking was observed, the deflection data provided no indications of the exact time of crack initiation. Results from the final two silt-cement LSMEs were used to attempt a validation of the fatigue model incorporated into MEPDG. The unknown regression coefficients (k 1 and k 2) were first calibrated using laboratory beam fatigue tests. The tensile stress at the bottom of the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> in the LSME was determined from the finite element program MichPAVE, simulating the LSME setup. The applied stress ratio was calculated by dividing the MichPAVE calculated stress by modulus of rupture (MR) obtained from the beam tests. This stress ratio was used with the calibrated fatigue model to predict the number of cycles to cracking and compared to the observed number of cycles to cracking from the LSME. Alternatively, the observed number of cycles to cracking was used as a model input to predict the required stress ratio and compared to the stress ratios calculated from the MichPAVE analysis. Both techniques did not provide a good validation of the model calibration. Cracking during both LSMEs of silt-cement was observed prior to 20, 000 cycles and the model predicted cycles to cracking in excess of 100, 000 cycles. MichPAVE predicted stress ratios were 38 % and 24 % for the second and third silt-cement LSMEs, respectively. Fatigue model predictions of stress ratio ranged from 69 % to 123 %. Unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on gravel, sand, silt, and clay stabilized with cement, lime, and fly-ash. Nine of the possible twelve different mix combinations were tested. Lime-stabilized sand and gravel, along with clay-fly ash were omitted from testing as unlikely combinations. The combination of silt-lime required the addition of Class F fly ash to produce a stabilized mixture. The 28 -d UCS for cement stabilized mixtures ranged from 3. 6 ? 4. 5 MPa. Cement content ranged from 3 % for gravel to 12 % for clay and were based on the minimum amount to achieve 7 -d strength of 2. 1 MPa. Fly ash content of 13 % by weight was used for gravel, sand, and silt based on FHWA and MEPDG strength recommendations. Materials stabilized with fly ash were subjected to a 7 -d accelerated cure at 40 ?C. The UCS after 7 -d accelerated curing ranged from 0. 63 ? 2. 0 MPa, with gravel-fly ash having the highest strength. Clay-lime (6 % by weight) had a 7 -d accelerated UCS of 1. 03 MPa and silt-lime-fly ash (4 % lime, 12 % fly ash by weight) 1. 87 MPa. The results of the UCS study will be used in the model development phase of NCHRP Project 4 - 36. The results of this study show the deformational performance of stabilized layers are not affected by fatigue cracking in the LSME. There does not appear to be any changes in the deflection data corresponding to observed cracks. Fatigue behavior of stabilized layers is controlled by stress conditions and material defects. As a result, cracking does not always occur at the location of maximum stress but at local weak points. Also, performance of the <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> in the LSME provided a poor validation for the calibrated fatigue model coefficients based on preliminary laboratory beam fatigue data due to material variability. Therefore, the LSME will not provide usable results for fatigue model validation. Correlation of UCS to MR for gravel-cement and silt-cement proved similar to current MEPDG recommendations. Additional MR testing will be conducted to determine the correlation with UCS for incorporation into MEPDG...|$|E

40|$|Pumping of rigid {{pavements}} {{is a major}} contributor to rigid pavement failure. Fines can be removed through pore water pressure buildup in the subbase or through surface erosion of subbase and shoulder materials. A number of studies have been conducted since the 1940 s, and a number of remedies have been implemented, viz., granular, stabilized, open-graded, and lean concrete subbases. The effectiveness of these measures varied. <b>Stabilized</b> <b>layers,</b> although reducing pumping, do not eliminate pumping. Pumping in <b>stabilized</b> <b>layers</b> is caused primarily by surface erosion of these layers. The erosion of <b>stabilized</b> <b>layers</b> used in pavements and subject to service conditions in the pavement, have not been studied extensively. ^ An extensive literature review was conducted to obtain information regarding pumping, with emphasis on designs to prevent pumping, the performance of different subbase materials, and tests used to simulate pumping. Three testing procedures were selected to be used to investigate and characterize the erosion of rigid pavement subbase and shoulder materials, viz., a brush test, a jetting test, and a rotational shear technique. The latter was designed and built especially for testing of subbase materials, and is an improvement on earlier models used by other researchers. Portland cement stabilized, asphalt stabilized, lean concrete, and unstabilized materials were tested in a statistically designed program. The rotational shear device gave the most useful results for stabilized materials. However, this device {{can not be used to}} test cohesionless materials. An effort was made to correlate the laboratory erosion results with the performance of the materials in the pavement. Guidelines are provided on the required material properties to minimize pumping due to surface erosion of subbase and shoulder materials. ^ The feasibility of design and rehabilitation alternatives requires an economic analysis of the alternatives. A computer program (PEARDARP) was developed to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation and design alternatives on rigid pavement pumping and performance. The effects of different rehabilitation techniques on pavement distresses were quantified for inclusion in the program.

Specimens for unconfined compression tests were prepared at their respective optimum moistures, compacted using British standard light (BSL) compaction effort and tested at curing times of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.

Severe distresses that occurred in runway and other aircraft operational areas required that the bearing capacity of the existing pavements should be increased.

Compared to standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees at the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have many implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of the atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for example), and for their internal evolution.

40|$|Hydrotreating {{reactions}} {{may affect}} the deposition of fine particles, which can eventually lead to reactor plugging. The deposition of fine particles from gas oil was measured in an internally recirculating reactor at 3758 C under hydrogen. H 2 S from hydrodesulfurization would convert corrosion products to metal sulfides. Iron sulfide deposited rapidly in the packed bed because the mineral surface did not retain a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>layer</b> of asphaltenic material. Addition of water, to test the role of hydrodeoxygenation, doubled the deposition of clay particles by reducing the surface coating of organic material. Neither ammonia nor quinoline had any effect on particle deposition, therefore, hydro...|$|R

40|$|The need {{to apply}} in situ cold {{recycling}} techniques for flexible pavement rehabilitation arises in response to economic, environmental and operational issues. Where a pavement is in a distressed state there is always an option to recycle the existing material and obtain benefits in terms of lower construction costs, improved durability and reduction in the negative effects that construction has on the environment. The possibility offered by foam bitumen <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> to allow immediate construction of the upper layers of the pavement is often in contrast with times requested by the traditional testing techniques. In this regards the use of Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) systems offers the possibility to evaluate short term bearing capacity of cold recycled layers for quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) activities. Moreover, this allows {{a large amount of}} data to be recorded rapidly, thereby guaranteeing a more detailed investigation and the possibility to identify homogeneous sections and, in extreme cases, to re-work the layer before the pavement is completed. This paper reports the results of several experiences on validation of innovative field testing systems for recycled layers. Different curing time periods were taken into account, as far as the influence of the anisotropic factor induced by compaction: different tracks for each lane were tested at different curing periods, both for lime-cement stabilized subbase and foamed asphalt recycled layers, to obtain the development of the stiffness and a higher resolution of bearing capacity mapping. Comparison of results obtained with LWD immediately after compaction with Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) was also performed at an Italian international airport. The results obtained appear very promising for upcoming insertion of the methodologies into existing technical prescriptions and specifications...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric {{vertical}} structure was analyzed using in situ measurements of O₃, CO, CH₄, and H₂O taken {{on board the}} NASA DC- 8 aircraft during three Pacific Exploratory Missions (PEMs) : PEM-West A, September-October 1991 in the western Pacific; PEM-West B, February-March 1994 in the western Pacific; and PEM-Tropics A, September-October 1996 in the central and eastern Pacific. PEM-Tropics A added measurements from the NASA P 3 -B aircraft. We used a new mode-based method to define a background against which to find layers. Using only O₃ and H₂O, we found 472 layers in PEM-Tropics A (0. 72 layers per vertical kilometer profiled), 237 layers in PEM-West A (0. 54 layers/km), and 158 layers in PEM-West B (0. 41 layers/km). Using all constituents, we found 187 layers in PEM-Tropics A (0. 43 layers/km), 128 layers in PEM-West A (0. 29 layers/km), and 80 layers in PEM-West B (0. 21 layers/km). Stratospheric air, sometimes mixed with trapped pollution, was the dominant layer source in all three missions. The larger number of layers per kilometer in PEM-Tropics A was probably due to repeated profiling of several “superlayers” visible {{in many of the}} mission lidar and potential voracity profiles. The thickness of the superlayers was of order 1 km, and the horizontal extent was of order 1000 km. We found that layers have an important effect on the thermal structure. An example based on ozonesonde data from Tahiti is shown, where a dry, subsiding layer was stabilized by much greater radiative cooling at the base than at the top. The <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer</b> can trap pollution and force vertical plumes to spread into horizontal layers. United States.

40|$|Soils {{that can}} be {{stabilized}} are Granular, Sandy, Salty and Clayey materials. In Sri Lanka, lower quality coarse–grained and sandy materials are available which give higher elastic modulus than fine–grained material (Salty and Clayed materials). In order to control shrinkage cracks, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) at seven days should be limited. According to the findings, {{it was revealed that}} the most practical thickness of the cement stabilized base is 200 mm and the most practical UCS at seven days is 3 - 4 MPa to achieve compaction and the decided life with economical pavement thickness. When the strength is measured in terms of CBR (California Bearing Ratio) and UCS, different cement contents arise from these two measuring methods. Therefore this study was performed to identify correct strength measure. The correct strength measure is UCS only and no relationship was found between UCS and CBR. For road pavements with stabilized base, critical tensile stress or strain is located {{at the bottom of the}} <b>stabilized</b> <b>layer.</b> To control the fatigue cracking for required number of axial load repetitions, this tensile stress should be limited. Above mentioned limitations cannot be analyzed using the conventional pavement design based on Structural Number principle. Hence a Mechanistic–Empirical Method is used to analyze pavements with a stabilized base which is difficult to carryout in general practice. Therefore, through this study, pavement design charts for pavements having 200 mm thickness of a Cement Stabilized soil Base (CSB) were developed by a Mechanistic– Empirical Method for various sub grade and traffic classes. According to the developed pavement design chart, it was revealed that CSB can be used for roads with traffic less than 1. 5 x 106 standard axial load repetitions...|$|E

Benzene is only a marginal solvent for the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>layer</b> {{on the surface of}} the particles. The particles are made attractive by lowering temperature. This attraction is modeled by a square well potential, the depth of which varies with temperature. At the highest temperature studied, our experimental system behaved effectively as an assembly of hard spheres, whereas at the lowest temperature the system approaches a spinodal. Using Baxter's theory we were able to evaluate the interaction parameters and to calculate the {{structure factor}}.

30|$|Portland cement is {{comprised}} of calcium-silicates and calcium-aluminates that hydrate to form cementious products. Cement hydration is relatively fast and causes immediate strength gain in <b>stabilized</b> <b>layers</b> (Little et al. 2000). The mechanism of Portland cement reaction with soil is well documented. When Ordinary Portland cement is mixed with soil {{in the presence of}} adequate moisture, cement hydrates and produces free lime, Ca(OH), which reacts Pozzolanically with soil as long as the environment is alkaline, that is with a high pH value. It therefore follows that a soil with pH value in or towards alkaline region will react more productively in the presence of adequate moisture. Hence the need to determine the pH values of the native soils being investigated.|$|R
