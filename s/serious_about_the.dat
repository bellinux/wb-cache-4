25|$|As {{presiding}} judge, he {{was often}} seen carrying case files, insisting on reading each one in its entirety before assignment to a trial judge. Known for being <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> law and his work, but not about himself, {{he also had a}} lighter side. He once held a mock funeral service at the courthouse for Roman numerals, retiring them from use in state pleadings.|$|E
25|$|The SADC {{postponed}} {{a meeting}} of its defence committee indefinitely until Mbeki could finalise a unity deal in Zimbabwe; while confirming that he would attend the meeting, Mbeki told journalists that, if the deal fell through at the last minute, he would tell the SADC {{that he had done}} his best as mediator, and that the deal would fall through because {{one or more of the}} parties were not <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Yudhoyono was {{appointed}} to his old position of Coordinating Minister of Political and Security Affairs in Megawati's new cabinet. After the October 2002 Bali bombing, he oversaw the hunt for and arrest of those responsible, and gained a reputation both in Indonesia and abroad {{as one of the}} few Indonesian politicians <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> War on Terrorism. His speech during the one-year anniversary of the Bali bombing (in which many Australians were killed) was praised by the Australian media and public.|$|E
25|$|Despite that {{legislative}} misfire, in {{the summer}} of 2001 the city of Minneapolis became quite <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> warehouse district site for a ballpark, after selecting the Twins' preferred riverfront site to house the new Guthrie Theater. Though no deal was struck to purchase the Rapid Park land at that time, an initial valuation of $10 million was assumed by the city for a roughly 10 acre parcel. Though not a realistic amount, it did fall conveniently within the restrictions of the 1997 referendum. The Twins were not involved in these discussions, and still exhibited no public interest whatsoever in the warehouse district location.|$|E
25|$|The family {{returned}} to Sydney in 1972, {{buying a house}} in Belrose near the Northern Beaches when Michael was 12 years old. Michael attended Davidson High School, where he met Andrew Farriss and they became good friends. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss {{spent a lot of}} time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside two classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. From nearby Forest High School, bass guitarist Garry Beers and Geoff Kennelly on drums filled out the line-up. The boys transferred to Davidson High School where they became <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea of starting a proper band. Hutchence's parents separated when he was 15; in 1976 for a short time, he lived with his mother and half-sister Tina in California. Hutchence later {{returned to}} Sydney with his mother.|$|E

25|$|The book {{is about}} {{survival}} at all costs against a seemingly invincible foe. Shade's increasing lack of humanity is a constant threat to the reader and characters in the book. Ninde and Gold-Eye's growing relationship throughout the story is a touching account of love against adversity. In contrast to this, Drum and Ella are more <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation they are in. However, they are constantly supporting each other and provide comfort {{at the end of}} the novel. Ella is a strong leader, yet her respect for her teammates, especially Ninde, grows considerably during the book's events. One interesting literary device are the interludes between the chapters. They add to the book's depth, provide the readers with extra information and sometimes reveal events elsewhere. For instance, when the Sub is attacked by creatures, the interlude is part of the training session for creature attacks. All interludes are taken from Shade's computer archive.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{as the core}} group of his {{followers}} continued to expand and become more <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> spiritual discipline, Prabhupada conducted new Vaishnava initiations and named the San Francisco temple [...] "New Jagannatha Puri" [...] after introducing the worship of Jagannath deities of Krishna there. Small replicas of these deities immediately became a [...] "psychedelic hit" [...] worn by many hippies on strings around their necks.|$|E
500|$|After the announcement, Trump and Knauss {{had dinner}} with Ventura and were joined by actor Woody Harrelson. Ventura later commented that Trump's chances of success {{depended}} on his impression of the Reform Party. [...] Onlookers questioned Trump's motive in running. [...] Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman expressed doubts about the authenticity of Trump's campaign, saying [...] "It’s all marketing of his name." [...] Matt Bai of Newsweek commented [...] "Most serious-minded people think Trump's flirtation with the Reform Party's presidential nomination is just a publicity stunt." [...] Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted he would actually run. [...] Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch commented that people would likely not flock to Trump's campaign, suggesting that Trump was merchandising his brand. Trump disagreed with the critics, arguing that even though his sales had increased {{as a result of}} media coverage, he was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> campaign.

500|$|At the {{negotiations}} with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only {{due to the fact}} that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage – contracted on 1May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, but in the long run he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence. The marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville caused Warwick to lose his power and influence. He accused Elizabeth and, her mother Jacquetta, of witchcraft to try and restore the power that he had lost.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny thing about it is that the people making this shit are dead <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named {{it as one}} of his favorite episodes of the series, calling it [...] "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} commission enquiring {{into the}} attacks on Christians, originally constituted on 19 September 2009 {{for a period of}} three months, had been extended ten times, causing dismay amongst local Christians. Yeddyurappa initially stated that a judicial inquiry into the attacks was unnecessary, as he believed that the state police were competent enough to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice themselves. Jesuit priest Fr. M. K. George remarked that [...] "The government {{does not seem to be}} <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> early release of the commission report... the government is lacking the political will to act". Revd. Manohar Chandra Prasad criticised the government for [...] "soft pedaling" [...] and believed that the extension was an indication of the government's [...] "step-motherly" [...] attitude toward Christians. The official report of Justice B. K. Somasekhara, initiated by Yeddyurappa's BJP-led state government was eventually made public in January 2011, in which it stated that the attacks were suspected to have been initiated by the Bajrang Dal, denying any involvement of the state government and the police, [...] "true Hindus", or any cover-up in the attacks after collecting 2,204 exhibits and 30 materials related to the attacks, 25 spot inspections and examining attacks on 57 churches in Karnataka. The report stated, [...] "There is no basis to apprehension of Christian petitioners that politicians, BJP, mainstream Sangh Parivar and State Government directly or indirectly are involved in the attacks. No politicians or representative of any political party in the state who politicised the incidents of attack for their benefits immediately did not come before the commission with their affidavits or to give evidence or opinion in the matter." [...] The report—which cost around 30million and took over 28 months, 300 sittings, and 800 pieces of recorded evidence to be realised—concluded that the district authorities and the police had, in most cases, taken the [...] "appropriate steps regarding the Church and the people including the required protection." [...] Somasekhara concluded that the attacks were [...] "carried out by 'misguided elements' following circulation of literature insulting Hindu gods and reports of conversion activity by some Christian groups" [...] and that [...] "the Roman Catholic church and its leaders were not involved in conversion." [...] In the case of Chikkamagaluru district, Somasekhara noted that [...] "the Government may enquire and withdraw the privileges to every people who is indulging or getting converted in such illegal activities of conversions commercially." [...] The report was widely criticised by the Christian community for being [...] "biased" [...] and activists belonging to the Religious Christian Minority Wing of the JDS burnt a copy of the Somasekhara report.|$|E

The couple faces challenges at first, such as interference from their respective exes, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Blake Hayes (Peter Brown), and Ridge's mother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), initially disliking Taylor. By July 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times wrote that Taylor was [...] "hooked" [...] by Ridge but was [...] "no-nonsense". Taylor refuses to marry Ridge {{unless he was}} <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> end {{of his relationship with}} Brooke; Goudas noted that Taylor wanted [...] "insurance" [...] and deemed her [...] "upfront" [...] approach as the [...] "polar opposite" [...] to that of Brooke.

2500|$|Formerly {{a member}} of the Conservative Party, Carswell was elected as the MP for Harwich in 2005 and Clacton in 2010.

They aren't <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> change that Britain so desperately needs." [...] In 2016 Carswell admitted that he had [...] "jumped ship with the express goal of changing the image of UKIP and ensuring that it was an asset rather than a liability in the referendum campaign…to decontaminate the brand". On 25 March 2017 he left the UK Independence Party to sit as an independent MP. He did not stand at the 2017 general election.|$|E
