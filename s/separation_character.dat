40|$|In this work, we jointly {{address the}} problem of text {{detection}} and recognition in natural scene images based on convolutional recurrent neural networks. We propose a unified network that simultaneously localizes and recognizes text with a single forward pass, avoiding intermediate processes like image cropping and feature re-calculation, word <b>separation,</b> or <b>character</b> grouping. In contrast to existing approaches that consider text detection and recognition as two distinct tasks and tackle them one by one, the proposed framework settles these two tasks concurrently. The whole framework can be trained end-to-end, requiring only images, the ground-truth bounding boxes and text labels. Through end-to-end training, the learned features can be more informative, which improves the overall performance. The convolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection and recognition, which saves processing time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Motivated {{by several}} rulings in United States courts {{concerning}} expert testimony in general, and handwriting testimony in particular, we undertook {{a study to}} objectively validate the hypothesis that handwriting is individual. Handwriting samples of 1500 individuals, representative of the U. S. population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features from scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e. g., line <b>separation,</b> slant, <b>character</b> shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by forensic document examiners (FDEs), were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of handwriting and very few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer {{with a high degree}} of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court.
