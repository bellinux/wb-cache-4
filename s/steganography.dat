25|$|The Greeks of Classical {{times are}} said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale {{transposition}} cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). <b>Steganography</b> (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. More modern examples of <b>steganography</b> include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.|$|E

25|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Hooke's early life comes from an {{autobiography}} that he commenced in 1696 but never completed. Richard Waller mentions it in his introduction to The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S., printed in 1705. In the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, Hooke argues that John Dee made use of Trithemian <b>steganography,</b> to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors and John Aubrey's Brief Lives, form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of Hooke.|$|E
25|$|Different {{physical}} {{devices and}} aids {{have been used}} to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of <b>steganography.</b> With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory has}} been used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and {{nonlinear}} dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of cryptographic primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking and <b>steganography.</b> The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory. Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, net surfers come up {{with many}} more {{technical}} ways to get around with the Great Wall of China. <b>Steganography</b> is a [...] "practice of embedding useful data in what looks like something irrelevant.

2500|$|Trithemius' {{most famous}} work, Steganographia (written c.1499; {{published}} Frankfurt, 1606), {{was placed on}} the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1609 and removed in 1900. This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about magic—specifically, about using spirits to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption key to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and <b>steganography.</b> Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be solely about magic, but the [...] "magical" [...] formulae have now been shown to be covertexts for yet more cryptographic content. However, mentions of the magical work within the third book by such figures as Agrippa and John Dee still lend credence {{to the idea of a}} mystic-magical foundation concerning the third volume. Additionally, while Trithemius's steganographic methods can be established to be free of the need for angelic–astrological mediation, still left intact is an underlying theological motive for their contrivance. The preface to the Polygraphia equally establishes, the everyday practicability of cryptography was conceived by Trithemius as a [...] "secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven". Robert Hooke suggested in the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, that John Dee made use of Trithemian <b>steganography,</b> to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
2500|$|Simultaneously {{with these}} efforts, Dee {{immersed}} himself in the worlds of magic, astrology and Hermetic philosophy. He devoted much time and effort in {{the last thirty years}} or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind. However, Robert Hooke suggested in the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, that John Dee made use of Trithemian <b>steganography,</b> to conceal his communication with Elizabeth I. A student of the Renaissance Neo-Platonism of Marsilio Ficino, Dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into Hermetic magic, angel summoning and divination. Instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest: the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world, which Dee called [...] "pure verities".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Steganography</b> ( [...] , [...] ) is the {{practice}} of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

50|$|Although <b>steganography</b> {{and digital}} {{watermarking}} seem similar, they are not. In <b>steganography,</b> the hidden message should remain intact {{until it reaches}} its destination. <b>Steganography</b> {{can be used for}} digital watermarking in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, Coded Anti-Piracy) or even just to identify an image (as in the EURion constellation). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between <b>steganography</b> and digital watermarking.|$|E

However, network {{information hiding}} was already applied in the late 1980s by Girling and Wolf.Contrary to typical steganographic methods that use digital media (images, audio and video files) to hide data, network <b>steganography</b> uses communication protocols' control elements and their intrinsic functionality.
