5000|$|Banya {{temperatures}} {{often will}} exceed 93 C and special felt hats are typically worn {{to protect the}} head from this intense heat. Some clients prefer {{to sit on a}} small mat brought into the banya to protect bare skin from the dry, hot wood of the interior benches. In Russia, special felt hats are commonly sold in sets with felt mitts, along with aromatherapy extracts for inclusion into the steam water. People often hit (massage) themselves or others with bunches of dried branches and leaves from white birch, oak or eucalyptus (called [...] banny venik, банный веник, [...] "banya besom") in order to improve the circulation. The dried branches are moistened with very hot water before use. Sometimes in summer, fresh branches are used instead. Sometimes instead of drying the venik, it is frozen in the summer when it has fresh leaves and then thawed before use. In the central European Jewish baths Schmeis were used in place of birch twigs: long brushes made of rafia. After the first good sweat is induced, it is customary to cool off in the breeze outdoors or splash around in cold water or in a lake or river. In the winter, people may roll in the snow with no clothes on or dip in lakes where holes have been cut into the ice. Then the banya is re-entered and small amounts of water are splashed on the rocks. If too much water is used at once, the steam will be cool with a clammy feel. A small amount of water on sufficiently hot rocks will evaporate quickly, producing a steam consisting of small vapour particles. Waving the venik causes convective heat. The second sweat is commonly the first time venik is used, but some people wait until the third session.After each <b>sweat,</b> <b>cooling</b> off is repeated and patrons use the break to drink beer, tea, or other beverages, play games or relax in good company in an antechamber to the steam room. Commercial banyas often have only a steam room or a steam room and a dry room, depending on local custom.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the flow rate necessary to maintain a sweat cooled metal at an equilibrium temperature when subjected to a high gas temperature. The {{study was limited to}} fundamental tests on copper, bronze, and stainless steel porous metal specimens which were the only types available at this time. Water cooling was used throughout the investigation. Conclusions of a qualitative nature were obtained which show that water flow rate is a primary factor in maintaining sweat cooled metals at equilibrium temperature, and that metal thermal conductivity has but slight effect. The feasibility of the <b>sweat</b> <b>cooling</b> technique was proven by the fact that a water flow rate of less than 0. 1 cc/in. ^ 2 -sec was required to satisfactorily cool a porous metal surface subjected to a potential heat transfer of 1. 0 BTU/in. ^ 2 -sec. ...|$|E
40|$|The flow between {{parallel}} porous plates may {{be driven}} by the uniform suction/injection at the permeable walls or by {{the movement of the}} walls. Sometimes, this flow can also be induced due to the pressure gradient. In this thesis, we have examined the flow between parallel plates and cylindrical tubes due to the uniform suction/injection at the walls with oscillatory pressure gradient. The oscillatory flow inside a channel/tube has many applications in industrial and engineering processes. Understanding the physics of oscillatory or transient flows in small channels is of fundamental interest for many biological and industrial applications. For example, the quasi-periodic blood flow in the cardiovascular diseases are described by the frequency components of the pressure and flow rate pulses, and many vascular diseases are associated with disturbances of the local flow conditions in the blood vessels. Furthermore, it has applications in modeling of respiratory functions in lungs, modeling of chemical/blood dispensing in biochemistry/clinical labs etc. The oscillatory channel flow have special relevance in vibrating media with applications in oil drilling, control of blood flow during surgical operations, manufacturing and processing of foods and paper, oil exploration and paper industry. Some other applications of value are to detect the intensity of underground explosions, chemicals and material processing, isotope separation, irrigation systems, rocket propulsion, filtration mechanism, <b>sweat</b> <b>cooling,</b> cooling of electronic device, heat exchanger and many others. Most of the theoretical work undertaken in oscillatory channels and tubes is for viscous fluids. Nothing or very little has been said for non-Newtonian fluids. Motivated by these considerations, we extend the analysis of oscillatory channel and tube flows from clear Newtonian fluid to Newtonian fluid in porous medium and non-Newtonian second grade and Jeffery fluids. The flow in the channel is driven by suction at the permeable walls while time harmonic pressure waves are responsible for oscillations in the velocity field. The analytic solutions of the corresponding boundary value problems for Newtonian (porous medium) and non-Newtonian fluids are established. The combined effects of porosity of the medium and the fluid oscillations on the oscillatory axial velocity between porous channels are investigated for the case of a Newtonian fluid. Further investigations are made for a second grade fluid in a channel and a cylindrical tube. The effects of wall suction, the second grade fluid parameter on the amplitude and penetration depth of the oscillatory axial velocity are determined. The oscillatory channel flow is also discussed for Jeffery fluid and the effects of relaxation/retardation time parameters and Deborah number are examined...|$|E

50|$|The olla is {{also useful}} for keeping water cool. When an {{unglazed}} olla {{is filled with}} water, the water permeates the clay walls of the vessel, causing the olla to “sweat”. The evaporation of the <b>sweat</b> <b>cools</b> the olla and its contents. In the early 20th century, many ranches in the American Southwest used the practice of hanging an olla from a rope on the verandah in a shady, breezy spot. Several hours after the olla was hung, it was cooled enough by evaporation to keep butter and milk safely cold.|$|R

50|$|For {{molecules}} of a liquid to evaporate, {{they must be}} located near the surface, {{they have to be}} moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces. When only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is low. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling. This is why evaporating <b>sweat</b> <b>cools</b> the human body.Evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapor pressure. For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly on a windy day than on a still day. Three key parts to evaporation are heat, atmospheric pressure (determines the percent humidity), and air movement.|$|R

50|$|Pluto has {{a tenuous}} {{atmosphere}} consisting of nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO), {{which are in}} equilibrium with their ices on Pluto's surface. According to the measurements by New Horizons, the surface pressure is about 1 Pa (10 μbar), roughly one million to 100,000 times less than Earth's atmospheric pressure. It was initially thought that, as Pluto {{moves away from the}} Sun, its atmosphere should gradually freeze onto the surface; studies of New Horizons data and ground-based occultations show that Pluto's atmospheric density increases, and that it likely remains gaseous throughout Pluto's orbit. New Horizons observations showed that atmospheric escape of nitrogen to be 10,000 times less than expected. Alan Stern has contended that even a small increase in Pluto's surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in Pluto's atmospheric density; from 18 hPa to as much as 280 hPa (three times that of Mars to a quarter that of the Earth). At such densities, nitrogen could flow across the surface as liquid. Just like <b>sweat</b> <b>cools</b> the body as it evaporates from the skin, the sublimation of Pluto's atmosphere cools its surface. The presence of atmospheric gases was traced up to 1670 kilometers high; the atmosphere does not have a sharp upper boundary.|$|R

They {{also have a}} sponge-like grip on their paws and soles of their feet. Tree-kangaroos have a much larger and pendulous tail than terrestrial kangaroos, giving them enhanced balance while moving about the trees. Locomotion {{on the ground is}} by hopping, as with true kangaroos. Like terrestrial kangaroos, tree-kangaroos do not <b>sweat</b> to <b>cool</b> their bodies, rather, they lick their forearms and allow the moisture to evaporate in an adaptive form of behavioural thermoregulation.|$|R

50|$|When the air {{temperature}} is high, {{the human body}} uses the evaporation of <b>sweat</b> to <b>cool</b> down, with the cooling effect directly related to how fast the perspiration evaporates. The rate at which perspiration can evaporate {{depends on how much}} moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold. If the air is already saturated with moisture, perspiration will not evaporate. The body's thermoregulation will produce perspiration {{in an effort to keep}} the body at its normal temperature even when the rate it is producing sweat exceeds the evaporation rate, so one can become coated with sweat on humid days even without generating additional body heat (such as by exercising).|$|R
50|$|Following {{surgery for}} {{axillary}} (armpit), palmar (palm) hyperhidrosis (see focal hyperhidrosis) and blushing, the body may sweat excessively at untreated areas, most commonly {{the lower back}} and trunk, but can be spread over the total body surface {{below the level of}} the cut. The upper part of the body, above the sympathetic chain transection, the body becomes anhidriotic, where the patient is unable to <b>sweat</b> or <b>cool</b> down, which further compromises the body's thermoregulation and can lead to elevated core temperature, overheating and hyperthermia. Below the level of the sympathetic chain interruption, body temperature is significantly lower, creating a stark contrast that can be observed on thermal images. The difference in temperatures between the sympathetically under- and overactive regions can be as high as 10 Celsius.|$|R
30|$|The vital thermoregulatory {{functions}} of hair {{would require that}} hair could have been lost {{at a time and}} a place when insulation was of little importance. An equatorial African savannah is a natural candidate and has in fact been suggested by proponents of other theories on hair; i.e. the <b>sweating</b> and <b>cooling</b> theories (Amaral, 1996; Wheeler, 1996). The timing is unclear but may have coincided with a period of gradual warming. Since a large brain is subject to greater calcium ion stress and is better protected against it by the non hydroxilated form of sialic acid (Muthing et al. 1998; Martin and Freeze 2003) to which humans are disposed by a unique single mutation which occurred some 2.2 - 2.4 MYA (Varki 2007), one may perhaps see this point in time as the earliest boundary for initiation. Here too the assumed timing is attractive as it corresponds well with a host of major developments in human evolution including bipedalism (Isbell and Young 1996).|$|R
50|$|Humidity is {{the amount}} of water vapor present in the air. Water vapor is the gaseous state of water and is {{invisible}} to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of <b>sweating</b> in <b>cooling</b> the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin. This effect is calculated in a heat index table or humidex. The amount of water vapor that is needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases. As the temperature of a parcel of water becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The differences in the amount of water vapor in a parcel of air can be quite large. For example, a parcel of air that is near saturation may contain 28 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 30 °C, but only 8 grams of water per cubic meter of air at 8 °C.|$|R

40|$|Samples of fibre {{were taken}} from sheep (n = 45) and goats (n = 24) of the West African Dwarf (WAD) and {{northern}} breeds in Nigeria. Three types of coat were noted in sheep: fine woolled, double coated and predominantly hairy. Median fibre diameters were 14. 9, 75. 7 and 93. 3 µm, respectively. Goats tended to have more unimodal coats with median fibre diameters of individuals between 36. 4 and 128. 4 µm. In general, smaller bodied sheep and goats had finer and less variable coats. In neither species did coat type depend on breed. Particularly in the WAD goat, which with the WAD sheep inhabits the humid south, the observed fibre diameter distributions could suggest a reduction of primary follicles. As these follicles are associated with sweat and sebaceous glands, while secondary follicles are associated with sebaceous glands only, {{it is possible that}} the coat type may be a consequence of evolution away from the use of <b>sweating</b> to <b>cool</b> the body...|$|R

The American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discourages people from using fans in closed rooms without ventilation when the heat index is above 32 C.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Skin wetness {{perception}} {{is driven by}} inputs from cold and mechano sensitive skin afferents. We hypothesized that {{in the absence of}} skin <b>cooling,</b> <b>sweat</b> induced wetness perception can be manipulated by altering the mechanical interaction between skin, sweat and clothing. Ten males (22 ± 2 years) performed an incremental walking protocol (5 Km/h; gradient: 2 to 16 %) during two trials designed to produce the same level of physical skin wetness but to induce lower (TIGHT-FIT) and higher (LOOSE-FIT) wetness perception. In the TIGHT-FIT, a tight fitting clothing ensemble was worn to reduce the mechanical interaction between skin, sweat and clothing. In the LOOSE-FIT, a loose fitting ensemble augmented this interaction. To limit sweat evaporation and skin cooling, a vapour impermeable ensemble was also worn during the trials. Heart rate, rectal temperature, mean skin temperature, skin conductance (SC), whole body skin wetness (wbody) and wetness perception were recorded. Exercise induced sweat production and physical skin wetness increased significantly (SC: 3. 1 ± 0. 3 to 18. 8 ± 1. 3 µS, p 0. 05). However, the reduced mechanical interaction generated by the TIGHT-FIT ensemble lowered significantly wetness perception (p< 0. 01). This reduction was more pronounced when wbody ranged between 0. 4 - 0. 8 nd. We conclude that in the absence of skin <b>cooling,</b> <b>sweat</b> induced wetness perception is primarily driven by the mechanical interaction between skin, sweat and clothing. Manipulating this interaction can alter skin wetness perception, independently of the level of physical wetness...|$|R

As physical performance is impaired in both hot and cold environments, the challenge in these environments is to try, through various interventions, to maintain as closely as possible, elite performance. The thermal threats include: thermal discomfort detrimentally influ-encing concentration, dehydration, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cold-induced neuromuscular dysfunction, cold injury, drowning and hypothermia. Strategies and interventions to reduce the impact of environmental extremes on performance include: selec-tion strategies, clothing design, acclimation and acclima-tisation protocols, fluid replacement strategies, artificial <b>sweating,</b> active <b>cooling</b> and chemical or psychological perceptual adjustment.

50|$|Researchers {{believe that}} {{feelings}} of anxiety arise {{to prepare a}} person for threats. In humans, anxiety symptoms are distributed along a continuum and different symptom levels of anxiety predict outcomes. Responses consist of increased heart rate, stress hormone secretion, restlessness, vigilance, and fear of a potentially dangerous environment. Anxiety prepares the body physically, cognitively, and behaviourally to detect and deal with threats to survival. As a result, a person’s body begins to hyperventilate to allow more oxygen to enter the bloodstream, divert blood to muscles, and <b>sweat</b> to <b>cool</b> the skin. In individuals, {{the degree to which}} an anxiety response is developed is based on the probability of bad things happening in the environment and the individual’s ability to cope with them. In the case of test taking, this might be a failing exam grade that prevents the student from being accepted to a post-secondary institution. A person's beliefs about their own competencies are a form of self-knowledge, which {{plays an important role in}} analyzing situations that might be threatening. When a person has feelings of low competence about their abilities they are likely to anticipate negative outcomes such as failure, under uncertain conditions. Thus, evaluative situations including tests and exams, are perceived as more threatening by students who have low competencies.|$|R

40|$|The most {{complete}} and realistic physiological data {{are derived from}} direct measurements during human experiments; however, they present some limitations such as ethical concerns, time and cost burden. Thermophysiological models are able to predict human thermal response {{in a wide range}} of environmental conditions, but their use is limited due to lack of validation. The aim of this work was to validate the thermophysiological model by Fiala for prediction of local skin temperatures against a dedicated database containing 43 different human experiments representing a wide range of conditions. The validation was conducted based on root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) and bias. The thermophysiological model by Fiala showed a good precision when predicting core and mean skin temperature (rmsd 0. 26 and 0. 92 °C, respectively) and also local skin temperatures for most body sites (average rmsd for local skin temperatures 1. 32 °C). However, an increased deviation of the predictions was observed for the forehead skin temperature (rmsd of 1. 63 °C) and for the thigh during exercising exposures (rmsd of 1. 41 °C). Possible reasons for the observed deviations are lack of information on measurement circumstances (hair, head coverage interference) or an overestimation of the <b>sweat</b> evaporative <b>cooling</b> capacity for the head and thigh, respectively.

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades, much {{research}} has occurred into students' conceptions as well as factors influencing them and how the conceptions are formed. This study reports on students' conceptions involving energy and the human body. Initially, a number of student conceptions within the overarching area of energy and the human body were identified by developing and administering questionnaires to 610 students ranging from Year 8 through to Year 12. Students' responses to the questionnaire items resulted in previously identified conceptions {{as well as a}} number of unreported ones. The unreported notions included: carbohydrates are different to sugars; energy is needed for organs to function; fats and their role in energy storage; the eye and ear do not convert energy but transfer it to the brain; <b>sweat</b> <b>cools</b> the skin due to contact with air; objects need energy to start moving but not to move; and aspects of respiration and digestion. Conceptions such as the particulate nature of energy, energy's usefulness, conservation and transfer of energy, role of digestion and respiration, sources of energy were associated with previously identified notions which were derived from both informal and formal learning situations. But, it was not possible to distinguish which source knowledge was derived from. From these notions, a series of possible pathways for conceptual development within the area of energy and the human body were described. Further analysis of the data indicated a number of ontological changes that can occur as the student-cohort became older. These ontological changes included a decline in the notion of energy being particulate to being non-particulate and not being described, through to being involved in the chemical bonds of molecules, the role and processes of digestion, the number of energy types and energy sources and how the eye and ear function. All these conceptions changed with student age and became more scientifically acceptable in their nature as students' formal education increased. Based upon the findings of the above questionnaires, a diagnostic paper and pencil instrument set of 20 items based upon a modified two tier multiple-choice format was developed to identify student held conceptions on energy and the human body. Subsequently, an interventionist strategy was designed and implemented to help students avoid the development of misconceptions as they construct acceptable concepts related to digestion and to respiration. This strategy follows the passage of food from its ingestion through to the absorbed foods conversion into ATP for use by the body. The findings of this study are to be of use to science teachers worldwide, not only in Western Australia as the findings of this thesis are relevant to educators of students in Years 8 to 12. The findings are related to energy in general but specifically to the students' own body. These findings relate directly to an intrinsically interesting feature, the student's own body. Another outcome of these misconception findings are two instruments which are likely to be of value to educators of Years 8 to 12 students. These are a diagnostic instrument designed to identify a number of alternative conceptions learners may hold and secondly a lesson sequence dealing with digestion and respiration and the role these have in the conversion and transfer of energy in the body...|$|R
5|$|The second chapter, Metamorphosis, {{focuses on}} the {{evolutionary}} origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left the shrinking forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche {{gave rise to the}} human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle-walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which is more efficient over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago. The adaptations of H.ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow <b>sweating</b> to <b>cool</b> the body and larger brain. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin. The close descendants of H.ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H.heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.|$|R
40|$|Introduction to Skin Function The skin is a {{vital part}} of the body with many {{necessary}} functions: • The skin protects you from the environment. When your skin is intact, there is a barrier against bacteria and injury to the organs inside of the body. It prevents too much sunlight or harmful chemicals from entering the body. • The skin helps you stay warm or <b>cool.</b> Your <b>sweat</b> glands produce <b>sweat</b> and <b>cool</b> you off as the sweat evaporates from the skin. • Nerve endings in the skin send messages to the brain to give you information about pain, temperature and touch. Changes in Skin Function After Spinal Cord Injury After spinal cord impairment, the skin loses its ability to protect itself against harmful things. The nerves in parts of your skin, at and below the level of your spinal impairment, may not be able to send accurate information to the brain because of damage to the spinal cord. You may not be able to notice the difference between hot and cold. You may not feel a pin prick or know if someone has moved your leg. Unless you look, you cannot always tell where your legs, arms or fingers are. A pressure ulcer is a complication that may occur as a result of your spinal cord impairment. A pressure ulcer is an area of tissue damage caused by not relieving pressure. The area is usually over a bony prominence. In this section, you will find information on how to take care of your skin, how to prevent pressure ulcers and how to care for a pressure ulcer if one occurs.

Did you know that eachyear in the United States more people die from {{excessive}} heat than from hurricanes, light ning, tornadoes, earthquakes, and floods combined? 2 “An excessive heat event, ” or “heat wave ” occurs when the summer heat is 10 degrees higher than the average high temperature for a region. 3 For example, 95 -degree weather over several days in an area that averages 85 degrees would be an excessive heat event, or heat wave. This heat is unpleasant. It is also especially dangerous for older people. The longer high temperatures last, the more dangerous the heat becomes. Where Are Heat Waves Most Dangerous? Heat waves can be dangerous anywhere, but especially in cities. Streets and buildings take in and keep the heat.

In areas with fewer people, more trees and fewer streets and buildings help things cool down overnight. How Does the Body <b>Cool</b> Itself? <b>Sweating,</b> or perspiration helps to cool the body. However, under some conditions, perspiration just	isn’t	enough and people stay hot. This can cause	a	person’s	body temperature to rise rapidly. When this happens, the very high temperatures can damage the brain or other vital organs. High humidity, when the air is full of water, makes it harder to <b>sweat</b> and <b>cool</b> the body. Drinking alcohol or working or playing outside during the heat can also make it hard for the body to cool down. Electric fans help to move the air, but they do not cool off the bod...|$|R
40|$|The {{human body}} can {{tolerate}} deep cold and sweltering heat {{so long as}} the body’s core temperature doesn’t vary much from 98. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. Small changes in the body’s core temperature affect cellular structures and chemical reactions. Most temperature regulating systems in the human body are designed to prevent overheating. Muscle contractions are the body’s main source of heat. When a muscle contracts during work, 75 percent of the potential energy is lost as heat. During rest, the body produces about 100 kilocalories of heat per hour, but the body can produce 10 to 15 times as much heat during exercise, depending on the exercise intensity, the size of the muscles being used, and the environmental conditions (which affect how the body loses heat). • Active muscles produce most of the body’s heat. • Heat illnesses include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. • Consuming water or sports drinks does not guarantee that you won’t suffer heat illnesses. • The first step in any suspected heat illness is to have the firefighter stop working. Consuming more water or fluid will not stop the problem. REMEMBER, sweat that drips off your body can’t keep you <b>cool.</b> <b>Sweat</b> has to evaporate from your skin to cool you off...|$|R
50|$|The {{respiratory}} {{system is not}} only important for efficient gas exchange, but for thermoregulation and vocalization. Thermoregulation is important for flamingos as they generally live in warm habitats and their plush plumage increases body temperature. Heat loss is accomplished through thermal polypnea (panting), that {{is an increase in}} respiratory rate. It has been seen that the medulla, hypothalamus and mid-brain are involved in the control of panting, as well through the Hering-Breuer reflex that uses stretch receptors in the lungs, and the vagus nerve. This effect of the panting is accelerated by a process called gular fluttering; rapid flapping of membranes in the throat which is synchronized with the movements of the thorax. Both of these mechanisms promote evaporative heat loss, which allows for the bird to push out warm air and water from the body. Increases in respiratory rate would normally cause respiratory alkalosis because carbon dioxide levels are rapidly dropping in the body, but the flamingo is able to bypass this, most likely through a shunt mechanism, which allow it to still maintain a sustainable partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Since the avian integument is not equipped with <b>sweat</b> glands, cutaneous <b>cooling</b> is minimal. Because the flamingo's {{respiratory system}} is shared with multiple functions, panting must be controlled to prevent hypoxia.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{refereed}} conference paper. The regulated {{exchange of}} {{heat from the}} human body to the environment is essential in human survival. This exchange is adjusted by our physiological response mechanisms. We are able to <b>sweat</b> profusely to <b>cool</b> the body in exercise and heat exposure, {{and are able to}} fine-tune our body temperatures in moderate environments through variations in skin circulation. In slightly cool environments, we reduce blood flow to our extremities and skin and use our fat layer insulation to conserve central body temperature. We can increase our heat production by shivering and can create a small insulating air layer around our skin by pilo-erection. However, when temperature goes down further, we cannot sustain our body temperature in the long run without behavioural adjustments that include putting on clothing or using heated dwellings. In this context, clothing has allowed mankind to expand its habitat around the world and has had a positive influence on its development. Today, clothing is worn for various reasons. Apart from its functional aspects (insulation, protection), it has a strong cultural and social aspect as well. The latter are on occasion counterproductive in terms of the first. A business suit for instance is hardly functional in a tropical climate, nor is a ladies evening dress in a cold environment. Also, when the function of the clothing is not only protection against heat or cold, as e. g. is the case with chemical protective clothing, the barriers introduced in the clothing to achieve the required protection can cause a conflict between the protective function of the clothing and the thermal functioning of the body. These conflicts can lead to discomfort, but also to physical strain and in extreme cases can put the person at risk from heat or cold injury or illness...|$|R
