Newcomer MPC (Model Products Corporation) entered the arena in 1964 with their Corvette kit, {{followed}} by 1965 promotionals of the Dodge car line. Plastic model makers like Pyro Plastics Corporation and Premier Products came and went, while other kit makers focused on different vehicles. Lindberg rarely touched the promo market. Monogram focused on custom, hot rod, TV, movie, racing cars, aircraft, and ships. Revell did U.S. vehicles, but focused on European Sports and racing cars. Aurora Plastics Corporation specialized in aircraft, TV, classic Universal Monsters & figure kits. Aurora also made a large range of 1:32 scale and a several 1:25 <b>scale</b> <b>car</b> kits. Palmer Plastics sold a number of American 1:32 <b>scale</b> <b>car</b> models for 98 cents each throughout the 1960s, but these models were poorly detailed and lacked basic features such as clear windows and correct wheel covers.|$|E

5000|$|Metal {{figures for}} {{tabletop}} wargaming and role-playing gaming {{are usually not}} described by scale ratio, but by the approximate height of a human figure, in millimeters. Manufacturers gradually enlarged the standard 25 mm figures of the 1970s, at first describing them as [...] "large 25s," [...] or [...] "heroic 25s." [...] By the 1990s, they were simply called 28 mm. figures, and have largely replaced 25s as the standard size for role-playing and many military games. Accessories scaled to match 28 mm gaming figures are generally built to 1:64 scale. More accurate to 1/64 <b>scale</b> <b>car</b> models would actually be the 20mm figures, or approximately 1/72. 28mm models come {{a lot closer to}} 1/48 nowadays ...|$|E
50|$|Atlas {{specialized}} {{in the building}} of small locomotives and purpose built rail borne equipment for industrial use. The equipment it manufactured seldom ran on the rails of Class I railroads, but were often used to shuttle freight cars around inside manufacturing plants. Atlas's products ranged from small 2-ton end cab switchers up to 65-ton center cab switchers. They also built a wide variety of equipment for the steel industry including blast furnace transfer <b>cars,</b> <b>scale</b> <b>cars,</b> coke quench cars, coke quench locomotives (to 75 tons), furnace cars and self-propelled flatcars. While most equipment was built for steel and coke plants within the United States, some equipment was shipped outside the country (for example 5 <b>scale</b> <b>cars</b> to Russia).|$|R

5000|$|As {{with most}} {{successful}} racers, Yunick {{was a master}} of the [...] straddling the rules. Perhaps his most famous exploit was his #13 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle, driven by Curtis Turner. The car was so much faster than the competition during testing that they were certain that cheating was involved; some sort of aerodynamic enhancement was strongly suspected, but the car's profile seemed to be entirely stock, as the rules required. It was eventually discovered that Yunick had lowered and modified the roof and windows and raised the floor (to lower the body) of the production car, essentially producing a 7/8 <b>scale</b> <b>car.</b> Since then, NASCAR required each race car's roof, hood, and trunk to fit templates representing the production car's exact profile.|$|E
50|$|This {{track is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most unforgiving R/C tracks in the world with a very fast and narrow driving line. The track's nickname, 'The Fort', has been earned over many years of battle with drivers. The 30-year-old galvanized steel 'boards' make a loud bang exaggerating every hit, but yielding little. In the late 90s, plastic guards were added to many of the most destructive corners in an effort to tame the track. If a car is on line through the large sweeper onto the straight your car will disappear briefly because of the concrete curbs that create the island. The chicane in front of the driver stand, 'aka Dead Mans Curve', is one of the toughest spots on the track as drivers try to negotiate this tight area without lifting. The dots (plow disks) on the carousel were recently tamed in 2005, when they were covered by a plastic loop. The start-finish lap timing loop is located just before the pits, requiring drivers to make almost a whole lap before starting their qualifying run. This makes the 5-minute qualifiers a battle between power and fuel mileage. Some drivers will make a pit stop during qualifying. Before the 2005 event new asphalt was laid, due to damage by Hurricane Charley, and for the first time Mike Swauger and Michael Salven were able to complete 26 laps during qualifying. In 2008, live scoring over the internet was added, to allow people from around the world to view the races in real time. In 2009, live video coverage and audio of the race announcers was added to the site without a fee. Thanks to good weather and lots of traction compound testing during the summer, DJ Apolaro was able to set the first 24 lap qualifier in a sedan and Mike Swauger turned the first 27 lap qualifier with a 1/8 <b>scale</b> <b>car.</b> Paolo Morganti would set a new track record for the sedan at 24 laps in 5:11.71 and Mike Swauger 27 laps in 5:10.97 with a 1/8 <b>scale</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

50|$|Majorette {{became the}} main French {{manufacturer}} of Matchbox-sized miniature vehicles (roughly pegged to 3 inches long, so of varying scales). The company soon became the largest producer of any French toy car manufacturer. The company has generally focused on everyday French and European models, {{and the main}} toy competition was Matchbox of Hackney, London, but also German Siku and, conceptually, Japanese Tomica. Though French cars like Peugeot and Renault were emphasized, other licensed marques covered by Majorette include North American vehicles from General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Japanese Nissan and Toyota are also represented (Ragan 2000, p. 37).At the end of 1980, Majorette purchased revered diecast <b>scale</b> <b>car</b> and truck producer Solido (Militaires Solido website). About this same time the Portuguese company Novacar was also purchased and Majorette production commenced at that factory in Portugal. Besides their important domestic presence, through large commercial channels Majorette relies heavily on sales to foreign markets. In 1982, Majorette USA was established in Miami, Florida, but that extension was relatively short-lived as Majorette models have not been retailed in the U.S. since the late 1990s. Majorette was purchased by Smoby in 2003. In 2008, there was talk that Majorette, then called Smoby-Majorette, was to be divorced from Smoby and sold to MI29, a French investment fund which owns Bigben Interactive for €3,900,000. This venture was abandoned in 2009 when Majorette found itself insolvent again, and through a tribunal at the commercial court of Paris, a sale was granted to Simba-Dickie, who bought Smoby. Majorette and Solido today remain {{a part of the}} Simba-Dickie group, which is more commonly called Dickie Toys.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of road traffic noise masking noise from wind turbines was explored among residents living close to wind turbines in the Netherlands (n = 725) with different levels of  road traffic noise present. No general masking effect was found, except when levels of wind turbine sound were moderate (35 – 40 dB(A) Lden) and road traffic sound level exceeded that level {{with at least}} 20 dB(A). This low masking capacity {{may be due to}} the different time patterns of these noise sources, both on a small time <b>scale</b> (<b>car</b> passages/regular blade passing) and a larger time scale (diurnal and weekly patterns). Also, wind turbine sound is relatively easy audible and may be heard upwind more often than road traffic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Carolo-Cup {{competition}} {{conducted for}} the eighth time this year, is an international student competition focusing on autonomous driving scenarios implemented on 1 : 10 <b>scale</b> <b>car</b> models. Three practical sub-competitions have to be realized in this context and represent a complex, interdisciplinary challenge. Hence, students {{have to cope with}} all core topics like mechanical development, electronic design, and programming as addressed usually by robotic applications. In this paper we introduce the competition challenges in detail and evaluate the results of all 13 participating teams from the 2014 compe-tition. For this purpose, we analyze technical as well as non-technical configurations of each student group and derive best practices, lessons learned, and criteria as a precondition for a successful participation. Due to the comprehensive orientation of the Carolo-Cup, this knowledge can be applied on comparable projects and related competitions as well. I...|$|E
