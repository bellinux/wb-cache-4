50|$|High <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> {{are less}} likely to be active labor force {{participants}} and are more likely to be unemployed than their more educated counterparts. The current unemployment rate for high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> is about 56 percent greater than that for high school completers. Lifetime earnings for this group are estimated to be $260,000 less than those for high <b>school</b> graduates. Female <b>dropouts</b> are much more likely to become single mothers and consequently be more likely to have an income under the poverty threshold or live on welfare. High <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> make up 68 percent of the nation’s prison population. Nearly 37% of dropouts live in poor/near poor families. Additionally, high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> have a life expectancy that is 3-5 years shorter than high school graduates.|$|R

In the 1920s 58% of 16-year-olds and 85% of 17-year-olds in Hamtramck were no longer attending high school.

3000|$|... 29 The {{implication}} that relative wage effects are proportional to relative supply shifts suggests {{that one should}} be skeptical when evaluating the empirical evidence reported in the literature. After all, {{it is easy to}} manipulate results by defining skill groups in ways that either accentuate the relative supply shift or that mask it. This point was first illustrated in Borjas et al. (1997). Their simulations show that the wage effect of immigration in the United States is much greater when one compares high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> {{to the rest of the}} workforce than when one compares high school “equivalents” to the rest of the workforce. The difference arises because “high school equivalents” typically include both high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> and high <b>school</b> graduates. Although there has been a substantial influx of foreign-born high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts,</b> their numerical importance is obviously very different if the competing group consists only of native high <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> or if it also includes the millions of native high school graduates.|$|R

Although Huncke later came to regret his loss of family ties, in his autobiography, Guilty of Everything, he states that his lengthy jail sentences were a partial result of his lack of family support. Huncke left Chicago as a teenager after his parents divorced.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, Bedouin women have additional obstacles to accessing care. Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. In circumstances where the clinic is further away from the settlement, a male relative must accompany the woman (often forfeiting a day’s wage {{in order to do}} so). Moreover, higher <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> rates and lower employment levels among Bedouin women mean that {{they are less likely to}} speak Hebrew. If the medical practitioner does not speak Arabic, the women must often rely on their male relatives for translation, thus forfeiting any right to medical privacy. When surveyed, Bedouin women cited lack of childcare (in {{addition to}} prohibitive distances and poor infrastructure) as a top barrier to accessing health care.|$|E
25|$|In general, Negev Bedouins {{have one}} of the highest <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% of girls and 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor {{infrastructure}} (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in basic facilities, such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the government will not support infrastructure developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To test a {{socialization}} {{model of}} polydrug use among Mexican-American and white non-Hispanic <b>school</b> <b>dropouts.</b> Methods: A sample of 910 Mexican-American and white non-Hispanic <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> were surveyed re-garding {{their use of}} alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs, and socialization characteristics that have previously {{been shown to be}} predictive of adolescent substance use. A structural equation model based on peer cluster theory was evaluated for goodness of fit and for differences in model characteristics by ethnicity and gender. Results: Results partially confirmed peer cluster theory among <b>school</b> <b>dropouts</b> in that association with drug-using peers was the most powerful direct predictor of substance use. The effects of a number of other socializ-ing influences were indirect, mediated through associa-tion with drug-using peers. Some differences were present between Mexican-American and white non-His-panic subgroups. Conclusions: Results were similar to those obtained from previous tests of this model among youth who remain in school, suggesting that social influences on drug use are similar across students and <b>school</b> <b>dropouts.</b> Association with drug-using peers dominates the predic-tion of substance use among <b>school</b> <b>dropouts.</b> However, family communication of drug use sanctions helps to both limit substance use and strengthen family bonds. Prior school adjustment is likely to be an important protective factor in limiting substance use among Mexi-can-American dropouts. © Society for Adolescent Medi...|$|R
