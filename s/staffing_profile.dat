40|$|The {{present study}} looks {{at what the}} {{literature}} {{can tell us about}} examples of innovative ED staffing. Numerous medical databases, journals specific to emergency care, and key government agency sites were searched to obtain Australian and relevant international literature between 1995 and the present.

There is little literature available which looks at the entire <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> of an ED and assesses its effectiveness. The few papers that do exist conclude that senior staffing, matching peak staffing levels with peak patient demand, having appropriately skilled staff mixes and designing the staff profile based upon individual hospital needs produces the most effective outcomes. Although there are some lessons to be learnt from the success of the staffing of various teams, and the introduction of new roles in the EDs, there are still significant gaps within the literature.

Origins and Evolution of Software Models This article prompted an enlightening trip back into the fuzzy history of computer-based software cost and schedule estimat-ing methods and tools. It appears that the origins are not that remote, and the meth-ods appeared over a relatively short period of time and have evolved in spurts and starts since then. The first real contribu-tion to the estimating technology hap-pened in 1958 with the introduction of the Norden <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> [1]. This pro-file has been incorporated in many of the estimating methodologies introduced since then. A flurry of software estimating meth-ods was introduced beginning in the mid- 1970 s and throughout the next decade. The first publication of any significance was presented by Ray Wolverton [2] of TRW in 1974. Wolverton was a major contributor to the development of the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) [3].

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} costs {{associated}} with care by two community children's nursing teams (CCNT). Design: A case study incorporating questionnaire survey, analysis of routinely collected data and analysis of costs in the north-west England. Patients: Children with acute illness referred for CCNT care. Interventions: Two CCNT provided care for 273 children during acute illness {{in order to reduce the}} number and duration of hospital admissions. Main Outcome Measures: Costs of CCNT, other services and costs to families. Results: The objectives of both CCNT included shortening and avoiding hospitalisations. Most (45 (58 %) in case A and 150 (77 %) in case B) children were referred for infections. There were differences in the proportion of children who had been hospitalised (45 (57. 7 %) and 78 (40 %)), the mean number of services used before referral to CCNT (1. 6 and 2. 2) and the <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> of the CCNT. There was a statistically significant difference in the overall mean cost to the NHS of CCNT care (£ 146 and £ 238, 95 % CI for difference of means 7 to 184), associated with higher proportions of children having telephone-only contact (two (3 %) and 46 (24 %)) and children using almost twice as many other health services during care by one CCNT (means 0. 27 and 0. 51). Conclusions: Costs of CCNT care can vary widely when all health service use is taken into account. Differences in the way CCNT are integrated with the urgent care system, and the way in which CCNT care is organised, could contribute to variations in costs...|$|E
40|$|Background: Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHC) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} toward early hearing detection and intervention, hence the importance of its deliberation within the South African context. Aim: To determine the feasibility of screening in low-risk neonates, using Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs), within the Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU) three-day assessment clinic at a Community Health Centre (CHC), at various test times following birth. Method: Within a quantitative, prospective design, 272 neonates were included. Case history interviews, otoscopic examinations and Distortion Product OAEs (DPOAEs) screening were conducted at two sessions (within six hours and approximately three days after birth). Data were analysed via descriptive statistics. Results: Based on current <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> and practice, efficient and comprehensive screening is not successful within hours of birth, but is more so at the MOU three-day assessment clinic.  Significantly higher numbers of infants were screened at session 2, with significantly less false-positive results. At session 1, only 38. 1 % of the neonates were screened, as opposed to more than  100 % at session 2. Session 1 yielded an 82. 1 % rate of false positive findings, a rate that not only has important implications for the emotional well-being of the parents; but also for resource-stricken environments where expenditure has to be accounted for carefully. Conclusion: Current findings highlight the importance of studying methodologies to ensure effective reach for hearing screening within the South African context. These findings argue for UNHS initiatives to include the MOU three-day assessment {{to ensure that a}} higher number of neonates are reached and confounding variables such as vernix have been eliminated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to research the subject of "span of control" as it applies to the management of work, to assess factors impacting supervisory ratios, to assess Indian Health Service (IHS) staffing data to determine supervisory ratios, to identify relevant industry span of control supervisory ratios, and to make findings and recommendations. The purpose {{of this study was to}} assess whether or not the IHS's span of control is consistent with industry standards. The analysis required research on managerial span of control standards and ratios from variety of sources, including health care organization literature, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) documentary material, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards and manuals, and health care industry staffing data. The analysis also involved obtaining, processing, tabulating, and summarizing IHS agency-wide staffing data by occupational series, location, and function to determine span of control supervisory ratios, and similar data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) on staffing patterns. Corporate responsibilities are organized functionally, but direct health care operations are performed on a "team" basis. In the field of health care delivery, the literature does not specify recommended span of control. The statutory mandates do not speak to span of control. Rather, they support a mission, which is critical and complex. There was no data found on supervisory ratios for the private sector. The IHS staffing patterns at hospitals and health centers are consistent with the unique IHS mission. The authors recommend conducting a management review/case study to obtain a realistic view of the supervisory ratios for IHS hospitals and health centers. Case studies of the total <b>staffing</b> <b>profile,</b> (including non-IHS employees), the organizational structure, "team" responsibilities, and span of control at three IHS hospitals would be a useful starting point. Also, a roundtable conference on organization issues for health care delivery facilities may prove beneficial. This study suggests the need for an IHS health facility profile database. The database may include information on locations, organizations, FTEs, budget, program descriptions, workload measures, contracting/compacting data, CHS/fiscal intermediary data, etc., to support IHS Headquarters management and analysis needs...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the existing Australian and international literature which looks at the staffing of emergency departments models. It is recognised that in response to changing and increasing demand upon emergency departments, {{there is a need to}} consider new staffing profiles. These profiles must not only meet the changing needs of patients, but must also be safe, cost effective and satisfactory to both patients and staff. In order to determine the most appropriate staffing profiles for New South Wales emergency departments, it is necessary to determine what lessons have been learned for existing emergency department staffing profiles. This study looks at what the literature can tell us about existing examples of emergency department staffing. Summary of findings: A number of key principles have been indentified from the success of emergency departments both within Australia and internationally. This includes matching peak staffing levels to peak patient periods, utilising senior staff, having appropriate staff and skills, and tailoring emergency department staffing profiles to the unique needs of individual hospitals. These underlying principles are evident when looking at what staffing profiles have been successfully implemented. There is little literature available which looks at the entire <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> of an emergency department and assesses its effectiveness. The few papers that do exist conclude that senior staffing produces the most effective outcomes. Other studies have looked at the appropriate staff combinations of triage, fast track, minor injuries units, care coordination teams, aged care coordination teams and ALERT programs, all of which have been introduced to respond to changing demands upon the emergency department. With changing staffing profiles of emergency departments, a number of new positions and roles have been identified and their success assessed. These roles include emergency care practitioners, accident and emergency physicians, emergency physicians, emergency nurse practitioners, clinical initiatives nurses, advanced clinical nurses, stat nurse, non-medical technicians, communications clerks, emergency department support officers, and equipment coordinators. The roles which these staff provide within the emergency department have been determined by the demand of patients, and the role the hospital requires them to fill. While there are some lessons to be learnt from the success of the staffing of various teams, and the introduction of new roles in emergency departments, there are still significant gaps within the literature. There is a need for assessment of the effectiveness of various emergency department-wide staffing profiles (rather than just individual teams within an emergency department) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a mixed-methods data collection. This research comprised a study of police-media relations. It aimed to investigate the strategies and processes through which the police service in England and Wales communicates into the public sphere; it examined police interaction with media organisations and explored how people receive {{and make sense of}} mediated information about the police. The research activities involved: (a) undertaking a questionnaire survey of police force communications, media, and public relations (PR) offices; (b) site visits to police forces, including interviews with police corporate communications managers/practitioners; (c) interviewing news-media professionals; and (d) conducting group discussions with local people in different sites within one police force area. Using these methods, the study brought together the three elements of police, media and audience into one integrated study that mapped the national context of police-media relations and then examined the communications dynamics at a local level. The study made a timely and practical contribution to current knowledge of police communications in relation to the accountability and perceived effectiveness of public sector organisations. On a theoretical level, it explored the role that police-media relations play in maintaining police legitimacy during times of rapid technological and organisational change. The data collection includes qualitative summaries of the police officer interviews, news-media interviews and the focus group discussions, and a quantitative file comprising data from the police organisation questionnaires. Further information may be found on the ESRC's The police, the media and their audiences award page. Main Topics : The police interview summaries cover: police-media relations, corporate communications structure and policy, police use of the media, use of new media/communications technologies, management of public perceptions of the police, relations with the media, future direction of police force communications policies. The news-media interview summaries cover: police-media relations, crime reporting and specialism, police contacts, technological advances and the effect on news reporting, media roles, public perceptions of the police, police use of the media. The focus group discussion summaries cover: opinions of the police, media coverage of the police, trust in the media, police use of the media, television programmes on the police (both documentary and fiction) and demographic details of focus group participants. Note that the focus group information is contained within one document, with responses from all groups organised by theme.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of labour to the productivity and effectiveness of the hospitality industry there is a scarcity of research into employment relations and human resource strategies and their linkages to service quality and knowledge capital management in the luxury hotel and resort sector. The hospitality industry is a major employer in Australia and four, four-and-a-half and five-star resorts and hotels are a major employing sector within this industry. A crucial component of these organisations employment relations strategies is the employment instrument that they chose to use. Given the wider choice of employment instruments available in Australia since the mid- 1990 s {{it is important to}} understand the philosophy and arguments for and against each. A perceived lack of labour flexibility in Australian industries resulted in substantial criticism of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s centralised industrial relations system in the 1980 s. The existence of awards and the involvement of trade unions were seen as restricting workplace flexibility and resulting in uncompetitive businesses. This argument appeared particularly relevant for industries such as hotels and resorts. These organisations operate outside of standard hours, are subject to severe demand fluctuations, employ a high number of non-standard employees and compete in highly competitive international markets. The criticism of the centralised industrial relations system resulted in legislative changes at the Federal and State levels in Australia throughout the 1990 s. The introduction of formalised enterprise and individual bargaining was an important feature of the new legislation. Much of the debate has centred on the need to adopt formalised decentralised enterprise bargaining in order to achieve improved labour market flexibility and productivity. This study focuses on the four, four-and-a-half and five-star hotel and resort sector in Queensland and New South Wales. The hotels and resorts studied reflected a range of different ownership and management types. Often an independent management group, a factor that is not uncommon in the hotel and resort sector of the hospitality industry, managed a hotel or resort, or a group of them, for a franchise. In the 15 cases studied which could give a break down of their <b>staffing</b> <b>profile</b> there were 1248 male employees, or 48 percent of the total, and 1357 female employees, 52 percent of the total, excluding management. These figures are similar to the broader hospitality sector figures in Australia. A particularly important aspect of this research was to uncover whether or not managers thought the high use of casual employment that is a feature of the industry is also problematic when it comes to maintaining a high standard of perceived service quality. The research also found that a high number of part-time employees worked in the hotels and resorts studied...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary Emergency Departments (EDs) locally, {{nationally and}} internationally are {{becoming}} increasingly busy. Within this context, it can be challenging to deliver a health service that is safe, of high quality and cost-effective. Whilst various models are described within the literature that aim to measure ED ‘work’ or ‘activity’, they are often not linked to a measure of costs to provide such activity. It is important for hospital and ED managers to understand and apply this link so that optimal staffing and financial resourcing can be justifiably sought. This research is timely given that Australia has moved towards a national Activity Based Funding (ABF) model for ED activity. ABF is believed to increase transparency of care and fairness (i. e. equal work receives equal pay). ABF involves a person-, performance- or activity-based payment system, and thus a move away from historical “block payment” models that do not incentivise efficiency and quality. The aim of the Statewide Workforce and Activity-Based Funding Modelling Project in Queensland Emergency Departments (SWAMPED) is to identify and describe best practice Emergency Department (ED) workforce models within the current context of ED funding that operates under an ABF model. The study is comprised of five distinct phases. This monograph (Phase 1) comprises a systematic {{review of the literature}} that was completed in June 2013. The remaining phases include a detailed survey of Queensland hospital EDs’ resource levels, activity and operational models of care, development of new resource models, development of a user-friendly modelling interface for ED mangers, and production of a final report that identifies policy implications. The anticipated deliverable outcome of this research is the development of an ABF based Emergency Workforce Modelling Tool that will enable ED managers to profile both their workforce and operational models of care. Additionally, the tool will assist with the ability to more accurately inform adequate staffing numbers required in the future, inform planning of expected expenditures and be used for standardisation and benchmarking across similar EDs. Summary of the Findings Within the remit of this review of the literature, the main findings include: 1. 	EDs are becoming busier and more congested Rising demand, barriers to ED throughput and transitions of care all contribute to ED congestion. In addition requests by organisational managers and the community require continued broadening of the scope of services required of the ED and further increases in demand. As the population live longer with more lifestyle diseases their propensity to require ED care continues to grow. 2. 	Various models of care within EDs exist Models often vary to account for site specific characteritics to suit <b>staffing</b> <b>profile,</b> ED geographical location (e. g. metropolitan or rural site), and patient demographic profile (e. g. paediatrics, older persons, ethnicity). Existing and new models implemented within EDs often depend on the target outcome requiring change. Generally this is focussed on addressing issues at the input, throughput or output areas of the ED. Even with models targeting similar demographic or illness, the structure and process elements underpinning the model can vary, which can impact on outcomes and variance to the patient and carer experience between and within EDs. Major models of care to manage throughput inefficiencies include: A. 	Workforce Models of Care focus on the appropriate level of staffing for a given workload to provide prompt, timely and clinically effective patient care within an emergency care setting. The studies reviewed suggest that the early involvement of senior medical decision maker and/or specialised nursing roles such as Emergency Nurse Practitioners and Clinical Initiatives Nurse, primary contact or extended scope Allied Health Practitioners can facilitate patient flow and improve key indicators such as length of stay and reducing the number of those who did not wait to be seen amongst others. B. 	Operational Models of Care within EDs focus on mechanisms for streaming (e. g. fast-tracking) or otherwise grouping patient care based on acuity and complexity to assist with minimising any throughput inefficiencies. While studies support the positive impact of these models in general, it appears that they are most effective when they are adequately resourced. 3. 	Various methods of measuring ED activity exist Measuring ED activity requires careful consideration of models of care and <b>staffing</b> <b>profile.</b> Measuring activity requires the ability to account for factors including: patient census, acuity, LOS, intensity of intervention, department skill-mix plus an adjustment for non-patient care time. 4. 	Gaps in the literature Continued ED growth calls for new and innovative care delivery models that are safe, clinically effective and cost effective. New roles and stand-alone service delivery models are often evaluated in isolation without considering the global and economic impact on staffing profiles. Whilst various models of accounting for and measuring health care activity exist, costing studies and cost effectiveness studies are lacking for EDs making accurate and reliable assessments of care models difficult. There is a necessity to further understand, refine and account for measures of ED complexity that define a workload upon which resources and appropriate staffing determinations can be made into the future. There is also a need for continued monitoring and comprehensive evaluation of newly implemented workforce modelling tools. This research acknowledges those gaps and aims to: •	Undertake a comprehensive and integrated whole of department workforce profiling exercise relative to resources in the context of ABF. •	Inform workforce requirements based on traditional quantitative markers (e. g. volume and acuity) combined with qualitative elements of ED models of care; •	Develop a comprehensive and validated workforce calculation tool {{that can be used to}} better inform or at least guide workforce requirements in a more transparent manner...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Background: The {{crisis and}} study of health {{workforce}} {{has become more}} important in developed and developing countries. The relationship between human resource issues and health system effectiveness has been acknowledged. Human resources are seen {{to be one of}} the main constraints in achieving the millennium development goals. A number of changes have taken place within health services since 2003, including the promulgation of the new health Act 63 of 2003, restructuring processes in the Western Cape province and the development of a Comprehensive Service Plan (CSP) to implement Health Care 2010. Nationally and provincially nutrition is declared a priority, due to the documented beneficial impact of nutrition support on preventable diseases, disease of life-style, as well as the treatment of high priority disease groups, namely TB and HIV/AIDS. For appropriate planning of nutrition services, the Integrated Nutrition Programme (INP) in the Western Cape needed to review the status of the nutrition workforce in the province, towards developing a human resource plan to meet the nutrition service needs, in the provincial context, its service platforms and approved service implementation plan for public health sector. Objectives The study aimed to describe the current status of the nutrition workforce (<b>staffing</b> <b>profile)</b> in the Western Cape province in terms of staffing levels, personnel categories, location, placement, qualifications, skills, and personnel expenditure at all levels of the public health sector. Provincial maps were developed to indicate the density of personnel per category pictorially. Methods In this descriptive observational study, a targeted sampling approach was applied by developing master lists of the respective nutrition/dietetic/food service units and personnel within the geographical districts and hospitals at all levels of care. All nutrition personnel employed by the Western Cape Department of Health were included in the study. Quantitative data collection methods including coding sheets (per facility), self administered questionnaires and the official personnel database (Persal) of the Department of Health was used. Questionnaires were constructed according to the variability of services, settings, and job outputs. The respective personnel were grouped into 5 categories. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyse data. Comparisons in terms of urban and rural distributions were also completed. Results A response rate of 86 % was achieved (N = 647) with food service workers being the largest proportion of staff (N = 509), followed by dietitians (N = 64), managers (N = 31), auxiliary workers (N = 28) and administrative personnel (N= 15). Significant differences (p= 0. 0001 - 0. 05) were found amongst the respective personnel categories in terms of demographics, qualifications, training, experience, skills, competencies, time spent on the INP, and general human resource management areas. Training needs and areas of low skills were identified for the respective categories and key challenges and solutions in the nutrition workforce were highlighted. Conclusion The study indicates that the processes used to develop the workforce need to receive the same intensity as all other interventions. The results can be applied in providing evidence based information for the development of the Department of Health, Western Cape human resource plan and the integration of nutrition therein...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} to teaching and learning advocated in this paper is centred {{on the notion of}} ‘strategic scholarship’ (Danaher, 2004; Danaher, Harreveld, Luck & Nouwens, 2004). On the one hand, this notion eschews an ‘ivory tower’ construction of research disconnected from the lived experiences and practical concerns of individuals and groups. On the other hand, this notion resists the promotion of an anti-intellectual agenda that favours untheorised practice that fails to engage with the deeply embedded educational, political and sociocultural inequities confronting the world today. From this perspective, strategic scholarship {{can be seen as a}} crucial partner of ‘evidence-based practice’ (Centre for Evidence Based Social Services, n. d.) in assisting universities to be(come) potentially transformative ‘learning organisations’ (Farago & Skyrme, 1995). It is also a powerful counternarrative to the ‘research/teaching’ binary that causes many conscientious university teachers to believe that teaching remains less highly valued than research in universities. We illustrate this argument through a discussion of current constructions of student attrition and retention at an Australian ‘new generation’ university. Some of those constructions seek simple solutions to complex and diverse issues, such as the array of links among curriculum, pedagogy and assessment on the one hand and students’ (dis) engagements with a course or program on the other. The dilemmas attendant on developing a model of student attrition that addresses the distinctive characteristics of the university being discussed encapsulate the challenges and opportunities of promoting strategic scholarship in relation to this central concern of university teaching and learning. In particular, we explore those challenges and opportunities by means of three organising questions: •	Which forms of evidence are available to stakeholders in student attrition and retention and how are they linked with practice? •	Which concepts and research questions are helpful in understanding and engaging with student attrition and retention? •	How can the evidence and the research findings be transformed into strategic scholarship around student attrition and retention? These research questions can be expressed also in terms of strategic issues confronting contemporary universities, ‘new generation’ and otherwise: •	How do we engage our communities? •	How do we scope and clarify our areas of inquiry? •	How do we promote research, scholarship and evidence-based practice? On the basis of our responses to these questions and issues, we posit the empirical, methodological and theoretical benefits of a strategically scholarly {{approach to}} university teaching and learning.
