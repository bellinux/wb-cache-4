5000|$|A global {{catastrophic risk}} is a {{hypothetical}} future event {{with the potential}} to inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale. Some such events could destroy or cripple modern civilization. These global catastrophes include: super volcanic eruption, asteroid or comet impact, nuclear winter, abrupt climate change, <b>super</b> <b>weed,</b> super crop pathogen, super bacterium, or super crop pest. Mass human starvation is currently likely if global agricultural production is dramatically reduced for several years following any such event. Engineers, David Denkenberger and Joshua Pearce argue in Feeding Everyone No Matter What that humanity could be fed in such situations by converting natural gas and wood fiber to human edible food using known pathways. Potential pathways include growing mushrooms on wood and then eating the mushrooms directly as well as feeding the waste to ruminates and then eating them.|$|E
50|$|The authors, David Denkenberger and Joshua Pearce, claim {{alternate}} {{food sources}} could feed everyone {{even if the}} sun is blocked by catastrophes like nuclear winter, supervolcano eruption, or large asteroid/comet impact. At first this appears unlikely because malnutrition and hunger-related disease now kill 6.5 million children under five years old each year. This is because the book focuses on what is technically possible and assumes global cooperation. The solutions also address crises including abrupt climate change, <b>super</b> <b>weeds,</b> <b>super</b> crop pests (animals, e.g. insects), super bacteria (e.g. disrupts beneficial bacteria) and super crop pathogens. The solution using fossil fuel energy source is natural gas digesting bacteria.|$|R

The installation created a propositional composition of a closed system with man-made objects, nature and the by-product of biotechnology. Rogers invited viewers to watch <b>super</b> <b>weeds</b> grow from the soil under the resurfaced produce truck drive shafts where organic and inorganic compounds slowly reach chemical equilibrium through the sedimentation of time, as nature gradually re-established its ecological balance beyond our existence. As part of the installation Rogers had invited 52 California artists to represent produce currently farmed in California as works of art on a deck of oversized playing cards.|$|R
