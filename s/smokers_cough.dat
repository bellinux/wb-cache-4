This disease represents 2. 8 % of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in a registration by pneumologists in Flanders. Seventy five% of our patients were active <b>smokers.</b> <b>Cough,</b> dyspnoe and constitutional symptoms were the main presenting symptoms. There was a 37. 5 % frequency of pneumothorax during the whole disease evolution and all these patients had to be treated with chemical or surgical pleurodesis.

Chest imaging showed mass-like consolidation in 4 patients, bronchial thickening or lung atelectasis with pleural thickening in 2 patients each, and perihilar irregular mass or multiple bilateral nodules in 1 patient each. Primary or metastatic lung cancer was suspected clinically in 8 of the 10 patients. Foreign body-related endobronchial actinomycosis was diagnosed in 6 patients, 5 of whom had HH; only 1 had gastroesophageal reflux-related symptoms. Because of bronchial obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy was performed in 3 patients, lobectomy in 2, and atypical resection in 1. Antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin was given to all patients, with resolution of actinomycosis. CONCLUSION:Bronchopulmonary actinomycosis is a rare condition that mimics pulmonary malignancy on clinical and radiologic grounds.

40|$|Introduction: Lung {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in the world. The {{incidence}} of lung cancer is increasing in India and there is a need to understand the natural history of this disease. Aim of the study: To study the clinico- pathological- radiological profile of patients diagnosed with lung cancer from January 2013 to May 2015 at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Inpatient records of all patients admitted during the study period were examined and  all patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma were recruited. Demographic characteristics, clinical, radiological and pathological details of each patient were recorded. Results: Fifty four patients with lung cancer were identified. Forty three (79. 6 %) were male and 11 (20. 4 %) were female. Thirty two (59. 7 %) were smokers and 22 (40. 7 %) were non <b>smokers.</b> <b>Cough</b> and expectoration (61. 1 %) was the most common presenting symptom followed by breathlessness (59. 3 %). Mass lesion (81. 5 %) was the most common radiological presentation and adenocarcinoma (42. 6 %) was the most common histological subtype. When compared to fiber optic bronchoscopy, image guided percutaneous biopsy had a better  yield for diagnosing lung cancer (51. 9 % vs 48. 1 %). But this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 892) Conclusion: Adenocarcinoma is replacing squamous cell carcinoma as the most common type of lung cancer in India...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn high-school students, {{prevalence}} of smoking is high but few studies analyzed {{smoking in the}} student population according to nicotine content of smoked cigarettes and gender. We analyzed the responses to a questionnaire, including the modified Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ), administered to 555 students (382 males, 173 females) of a professional high school in Palermo, Italy, to assess the prevalence in both genders of: (1) smoking “light” and high nicotine (HN) cigarettes; (2) signs of nicotine dependence and (3) respiratory symptoms. Nicotine content of habitually smoked cigarettes was considered as “light” if ⩽ 0. 8 mg; as high if > 0. 8 mg. Forty-four percent of students smoked, without differences between genders. Two-thirds {{of the total sample}} reported “light” cigarette smoking (76. 7 % of females vs. 62. 0 % of males, P< 0. 05). On average, “light” cigarette smoking was associated with lower pack/year and FTQ global score compared to HN smoking. However, when FTQ global score was analyzed by taking into account pack/year, no major difference was found between “light” and HN cigarette <b>smokers.</b> <b>Cough</b> with phlegm and breathlessness were more frequently reported by smoking than non-smoking students, without differences between “light” and HN cigarette smokers. About 50 % of smoking students reported having tried to quit, while only 3. 4 % of students were ex-smokers. “Light” smoking was common in high school students, especially among females. Dependence appeared more influenced by the smoking history than by nicotine content. Respiratory symptoms were similar in “light” and HN cigarette smokers...|$|E
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{prevalence}} of respiratory symptoms or their associations with other health conditions in Russia. Between 2008 and 2010, a sample of 983 men resident in Izhevsk, Russia, took part in a cross-sectional survey. Presence of respiratory symptoms was determined from self-report of chronic productive cough and breathlessness assessed using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale. Self-reported physical and mental health were measured using the 12 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 12). Hypertension was assessed from mean blood pressure measured at the health check and/or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Other comorbidities were assessed from self-report. Logistic regression models were fitted assessing the association between respiratory symptoms and comorbidities. Linear regression models were fitted to investigate the association between respiratory symptoms and self-reported health scores. All models were adjusted for age, education and smoking status. The age-standardised prevalence of cough and breathlessness was 20. 9 % (prevalence with breathlessness MRC grade 3 or above 3. 7 %). The majority of men with respiratory symptoms (87. 3 %) were current <b>smokers.</b> <b>Cough</b> and breathlessness were associated with substantially worse self-reported physical and mental health (test for trend with severity of breathlessness p< 0. 001). Those with chronic cough and grade 3 or above breathlessness had higher odds of having hypertension (OR 3. 03; 95 % CI 1. 36 to 6. 74), diabetes (OR 10. 55; 95 % CI 2. 69 to 41. 37), angina pectoris (OR 7. 54; 95 % CI 3. 61 to 15. 73), previous myocardial infarction (OR 7. 61; 95 % CI 2. 10 to 27. 4) and previous stroke (OR 6. 61; 95 % CI 1. 75 to 23. 34) compared with those without respiratory symptoms.

Immunohistochemically, in the tumors composed exclusively of spindle and/or giant cells, thyroid transcription factor- 1 (TTF- 1) and cytokeratin 7 were positive in 55 % and 70 % of the cases, respectively, whereas surfactant protein-A was always negative. In pleomorphic carcinomas with an epithelial component, cytokeratin 7, TTF- 1, and surfactant protein-A were positive in the sarcomatoid component in 62. 7 %, 43. 1 %, and 5. 9 % of the cases, respectively, whereas they were always negative in the sarcomatous part of carcinosarcomas and blastoma. In the epithelial component of pleomorphic carcinomas, cytokeratin 7, TTF- 1, and surfactant protein-A were positive in 76. 4 %, 58. 8 %, and 39. 2 % of the cases, respectively, whereas the same antibodies did not react with the epithelial component of carcinosarcomas; {{in the case of}} blastoma, the epithelial part of the tumor was positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF- 1, whereas it was negative for surfactant protein-A.

Methods Three teams of two to three health workers visited haphazardly selected households in all major housing quarters. We asked permission to enter for a health survey. Children with cough, fever or weight loss as well as sick adults were offered free-of-charge local hospital examination and treatment. Results From 177 households with 1777 persons, 51 (2. 9 %) persons were referred. Thirty-five of them had an undiagnosed disease threatening individual health and in many cases also public health. Seven were hospitalised, including three adults with tuberculosis. Malnutrition was diagnosed in nine small children. Four patients had AIDS, seven had malaria. Average total cost for ambulant patients was 15 USD, for hospitalised patients 110 USD. In the households, almost half of the women 16 – 50 years of age had no schooling. Two per cent of women and nine per cent of men were daily <b>smokers.</b> <b>Coughing</b> children were more likely than non-coughing children to live in a household with at least one smoker (OR = 3. 58, 95 % CI 1. 72 to 7. 46), and they generally lived in more poor households (P = 0. 018). Twelve of 16 children with weight loss were referred from households with a high poverty score. Conclusions Adult smoking and poverty affect children's health.

40|$|Introduction Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) {{is still}} facing smoking {{as a complex}} problem to solve. Tobacco abuse has an {{economical}} {{as well as a}} trendy dimension, and children start smoking very early in life, often stimulated by their parents, friends or close environment and advertising. Although the relation of several lung diseases to smoking has been documented in numerous studies, there are no epidemiological data concerning the exact prevalence of smoking, and its relation to respiratory symptoms in this population in FYROM. Material and Methods In order to estimate the prevalence of smokers among adolescents, respiratory symptoms and allergic diseases in this group, we conducted a survey encompassing 1220 scholars, were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning smoking status, self-reported respiratory symptoms and history of allergic diseases. Results Prevalence of active smokers was 398 (32. 6 %) and the overall prevalence of respiratory symptoms was 552 (46. 3 %). Coughing was present in 641 (55. 5 %), wheezing in 534 (43. 7 %), and chest tightness in 410 (33. 6 %). In <b>smokers,</b> <b>coughing</b> was 289 (72. 6 %), wheezing 221 (55. 5 %), and chest tightness 213 (53. 5 %). The correlation between symptoms and smoking was 0. 174 for cough and wheezing and 0. 129 for chest tightness, at p< 0. 01, and between symptoms and non-smoking status the correlation was non-significant. The overall prevalence of allergic diseases was 252 (21. 2 %) The correlation between allergic diseases and smoking showed no statistical signification (p= 0. 236). Conclusions The results of our study show that more than one third of the adolescents in FYROM are active smokers, which has great impact on their respiratory and allergic statu...|$|R

Diseases with severe consequences for public health, like tuberculosis, AIDS and malaria should have national programs with free, decentralised examination and treatment. Access to generic drugs is important. A major educational effort is needed to improve public health...|$|R
5000|$|Masiello {{was known}} to be a chain-smoker of thin brown cigarettes. She kept this habit to the end of her life, sitting in a {{wheelchair}} giving master classes in her studio, located a block away from the Juilliard School. As a teacher she would avoid first names, addressing students formally. According to Anthony Manoly, [...] "Madame Masiello was always a stickler for pianists knowing how to [...] "flutter" [...] the pedal and sing with a beautiful limpid legato produced by a fine balance of legato playing with the fingers in addition to proper pedal usage. She also insisted that all pianists have a fine understanding of the orchestral scores of the opera you were coaching or playing for her that day. If you didn't have access to the score, she would direct you to her closet of full orchestra scores. She would say, [...] "What do you see"? After you answered what you observed in the orchestral score, she would sternly reply [...] "then PLAY IT"!!". Masiello was also a strict stylist, bandying the vast Zingarelli Italian dictionary to check open and closed vowels, and fighting for clean portamento-free singing. As Harvey E. Phillips tells of Masiello's rehearsal with Soprano Christine Weidinger, [...] " [...] 'Make sure those releases are clean', said the blond-haired Masiello, her pearl earrings shaking as she supressed a persistent <b>smoker's</b> <b>cough,</b> [...] "and no portamento, God forbid!" [...] Referring to Alberta Masiello's radio appearances, the New York Times critic John Rockwell wrote that Masiello's [...] "store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years". According to American Bass Paul Plishka, Masiello [...] "was one of the great, great people who influenced generations of singers in her lifetime. I was very upset at the New York Times obituary, which was very brief and gave the impression that she was merely an opera coach. You could have written an entire book about her work, and she deserved front page coverage. She was, a profound inspiration in my career and in so many others." ...|$|R

I don't think this script could have been developed within the walls of Disney—it had to be developed outside...I'm not going to say there weren't discussions, but the movie we ended up with is the one that was on the page." [...] — John Lee Hancock on his initial thoughts of Disney's involvement With Disney's backing, the production team was given access to 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't want to come in and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the way, I had my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious <b>smoker's</b> <b>cough</b> is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|R

40|$|A 46 -year-male <b>smoker</b> {{presented}} with <b>cough</b> and fever to a chest physician, who {{on the basis}} of chest X-ray started him on antitubercular treatment. However, further evaluation suggested that the patient was suffering from a rare disease, i. e. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of lung. Although lung involvement in cases of lymphoma is observed in as high as 40 % of cases, in autopsy series, the exact clinical incidence is not known. One of the largest lymphoma groups reported it to be around 25 %. However, primary pulmonary lymphomas have been extremely rare (0. 4 %), and whenever present they are of (Mucosa Associate Lymphoid tissue) MALT type, with occasional diffuse large cell lymphomas. The anaplastic variant is extremely uncommon. Usually the treatment results are satisfactory with more than 80 % of the cases surviving even after 3 years. Here we report the case of anaplastic primary nonHodgkin′s lymphoma of lung and review the literature...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To psychometrically {{evaluate}} a cough-specific quality-of-life questionnaire (CQLQ) in adults. DESIGN: Prospective evaluation of CQLQ using three different cohorts of adult subjects with cough. SETTING: Academic tertiary-care ambulatory medical facilities. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-four subjects complaining of chronic cough, 30 of acute <b>cough,</b> and 31 <b>smokers</b> with <b>cough.</b> INTERVENTIONS: Self-administration of the CQLQ in acute coughers, smokers, and chronic coughers {{before and after}} therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Psychometric analyses including factor analysis (FA), and assessments of reliability and validity. RESULTS: Acute and chronic cough data were subjected to FA, and the Cronbach alpha and interitem correlations were computed. FA of chronic and acute cough data (n = 184) revealed six subscales. The Cronbach alpha for the total CQLQ was 0. 92, and it was 0. 62 to 0. 86 (mean, 0. 76) for the six subscales. Interitem correlations for the total CQLQ ranged from - 0. 06 to 0. 72, {{with a mean of}} 0. 28. Test-retest reliability in 52 chronic coughers demonstrated nonsignificant changes with readministration of the questionnaire, and the intraclass correlation for total CQLQ was 0. 89, and for the subscales the range was 0. 75 to 0. 93. Analysis of variance followed by tests of contrasts among all possible pairings of chronic coughers, acute coughers, and smokers showed significant differences (p 3 ̆c or = 0. 001) among the groups. Posttreatment cure scores were significantly lower (p 3 ̆c or = 0. 001) than pretreatment scores in 24 chronic coughers. CONCLUSIONS: The 28 -item CQLQ has dimensionality that is consistent with a cough-specific quality-of-life instrument. It is a valid and reliable method by which {{to assess the impact of}} cough on the quality of life of chronic and acute coughers, and the efficacy of cough therapies in chronic coughers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is an {{important}} manifestation of lung carcinoma, particularly in a non-small cell tumor, and hampers quality of life. Although removal of the primary tumor usually resolves this syndrome, effective treatment in patients with advanced lung carcinoma has not been established. Recently, an orally active, selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) inhibitor ("Gefitinib") provided clinical anti-tumor activity. We describe a 71 -year-old male <b>smoker</b> with <b>cough,</b> who presented with clubbed fingers. A transbronchial lung biopsy (stage T 2 N 3 M 1 -IV) on a cavity lesion in the left lower lobe showed the features of adenocarcinoma, while bone scintigram revealed bilaterally symmetrical abnormal uptakes in the lower extremities, suggesting secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The serum level of growth hormone was increased to 1. 42 ng/ml. Chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinorelbine) was not effective. Gefitinib, as a second-line therapy, induced disappearance of the abnormal accumulation on bone scintigraphy and decrease of the cavity in the lung and of serum growth hormone. The presented case suggests that the EGFR inhibitor might be a promising option {{for the treatment of}} hypertrophic osteoarthropathy with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a syndrome characterized by the triad of periostitis, digital clubbing and painful, swollen joints. The syndrome is a relatively common condition in patients with primary malignant tumor in the lung and pleura (1, 2) Clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are presenting symptoms in 1 % of cases with primary non-small cell lung cancer. Sometimes, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy shows an early curative stage of an occult disease (3). Radiographs of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy usually show subperiosteal new bone formation in the long bone of the lower extremities, and this finding may be considered essential to the diagnosis. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is treated by surgical resection of the primary tumor, with rapid remission of the symptoms after surgery. However, other treatments, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid and anti-cancer drugs have been proposed when the primary tumor cannot be surgically removed. Here, we describe a case where the administration of gefitinib dramatically improved secondary hypertrophic osteroarthropathy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is {{an uncommon}} disease of unknown etiology characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and infiltration of various organs by Langerhans cells. Case report. We presented a 54 -year-old man, heavy <b>smoker,</b> with dyspnea, <b>cough,</b> hemoptysis, headache and ataxia, who died shortly after admission to our hospital. On the autopsy, tumor {{was found in}} the posterior segment of the right upper pulmonary lobe as well as a right-sided occipitoparietal lesion which penetrated into the right ventricle resulting in internal and external hematocephalus. Histologically and immunohistohemically, the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis was made (tumor cells showed positivity for CK 7 and TTF- 1 which confirmed the diagnosis). In the lung parenchyma around the tumor, as well as in brain tissue around the metastatic adenocarcinoma histiocytic lesions were found. Light microscopic examination of the other organs also showed histiocytic lesions involving the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical studies revealed CD 68, S- 100 and CD 1 a immunoreactivity within the histiocytes upon which the diagnosis of Langerhans' cells histiocytosis was made. Conclusion. The multisystem form of LCH with extensive organ involvement was an incidental finding, while metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the brain that led to hematocephalus was the cause of death...|$|R
