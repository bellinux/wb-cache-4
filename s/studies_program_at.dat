25|$|However, {{although}} Transpersonal psychology {{has experienced}} recognition {{from the surrounding}} culture, it has also faced {{a fair amount of}} skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings. Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of Transpersonal psychology. Zdenek, representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inception. Other commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the field. In 1998 the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the holistic <b>studies</b> <b>program</b> <b>at</b> the John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, which included a Transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Several commentators presented their skepticism towards the program. Another controversial aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substances. Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald & Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement. The authors do however note {{that this is not the}} most common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy.|$|E
500|$|Stanford did not {{employ a}} {{full-time}} professor in religion until 1951 {{and did not}} establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. [...] Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. [...] David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. [...] Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. [...] In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted {{in the creation of}} a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. [...] By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.

500|$|Elliot Sperling, a {{specialist}} of Indian {{studies and the}} director of the Tibetan <b>Studies</b> <b>program</b> <b>at</b> Indiana University’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that [...] "the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction." [...] He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century. He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because [...] "Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus" [...] and also that [...] "China's intervening Ming dynasty...had no control over Tibet." [...] He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was [...] "subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers" [...] and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.|$|E
500|$|Author Thomas Homer-Dixon was a 44-year-old {{academic}} and {{director at the}} University of Toronto's Peace and Conflict <b>Studies</b> <b>program</b> <b>at</b> the time of publication. While the book took eight years to write, Homer-Dixon had been developing the ideas behind it {{for most of his}} career. As a youth, an interest in current events was fostered by his parents and led him to study causes of human violence at university. He graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts and, in 1989, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a doctorate in Political science. He accepted the director position at the [...] Peace and Conflict Studies program in 1990. Homer-Dixon and his theories were featured in an article written by Robert D. Kaplan, in the February 1994 edition of The Atlantic Monthly, entitled [...] "The Coming Anarchy". The article made him into an emerging academic celebrity and resulted in several book deal offers. By 1997 Homer-Dixon, working out of his home office, had accumulated more than [...] of paper and was overwhelmed by the project, stating, [...] "I'm living the problem I'm describing." [...] In 1999, Homer-Dixon and Princeton University Press published Environment, Scarcity, and Violence containing Homer-Dixon's research on resource scarcity leading to violence. For The Ingenuity Gap, he re-organized the framework along three strands, thematic, geographical, and metaphoric, and structured it like a travelogue from which he could launch examples.|$|E

40|$|According to the State University of New York-Oneanta (2013), “women’s {{and gender}} studies is an {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of study}} that takes gender as its main category of analysis, and works to reframe the place of gender as essential to the workings of social, cultural, political, and economic systems. ” These <b>programs,</b> especially <b>at</b> community colleges, have not benefitted from much research and/or scholarship within the last ten years. For this reason, I chose to explore the history of women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> <b>at</b> community colleges, their place within higher education, and the creation and maintenance of such <b>programs.</b> A case <b>study</b> methodology was used to conduct this study. Eight community college faculty, all who identified as women, were interviewed. Data were gathered from semi-structured interviews and analysis of institutional artifacts such as program reviews and sample syllabi. Through the data analysis, specific themes emerged regarding women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> <b>at</b> the community college level, including faculty perspectives on why students enroll in women’s and gender studies courses, issues of intersectionality and identity within women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs,</b> {{and the importance of}} women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> <b>at</b> community colleges. Several recommendations were provided that could help strengthen women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> <b>at</b> the community college level, as well as possible topics for future research. This study has implications not only for women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> <b>at</b> community colleges, but within higher education. All educational institutions—regardless of the students they serve and the level of women’s and gender studies courses that are offered—can benefit from learning about the involvement of community colleges and the value in creating alliances to further increase women’s and gender <b>studies</b> <b>programs</b> throughout academia...|$|R
