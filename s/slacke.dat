5000|$|The first direct {{evidence}} that games probably resembling football were being played at English public schools {{comes from the}} Vulgaria by William Horman in 1519. Horman had been headmaster at Eton (1485/6-1494/5) and Winchester College. His Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase [...] "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde", a rough translation of the original Latin [...] "Lusui erit follis pugillari spiritu tumens", which Francis Peabody Magoun translated as [...] "In sport we shall have a ball inflated with air to kick" [...] Even as early as 1519, Horman shows {{us that he was}} well aware of the value of sports to children's education and the need to temper their enthusiasm in order not to affect their studies: [...] "There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren, leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none, or waxe <b>slacke</b> if they haue to many".|$|E
5000|$|The Vulgaria is {{interesting}} {{in the light}} that it throws on the times. For example, {{the book is the}} first to mention [...] "ceruse", a mixture of white lead and vinegar used by wealthy women to whiten their skin. The book defines blotting paper: [...] "Blottynge papyr serveth to drye weete wryttynge, lest there be made blottis or blurris". Children's rattles are first mentioned in the book. [...] He describes the use of wooden swords, or [...] "wasters", used for training: [...] "Let us pley at buckeler and at waster in feyre game". The sentence [...] "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde" [...] (which Horman translates as [...] "lusui erit nobis follis pugillari spritu tumens") is one of the earliest references to the game of football being played at public schools. He praised the value of sports in letting children find an outlet for their energy as a break from their studies: [...] "There muste be a measure in gyuynge of remedies or sportynge to chyldren, leste they be wery of goynge to theyr boke if they haue none, or waxe <b>slacke</b> if they haue to many".|$|E
50|$|EXTRACT from Belfast Newsletter 14th May 1894.'NATIONALIST RIOTING NEAR PORTADOWN' ATTACK ON A FUNERAL PROCESSION. SEVERAL PERSONS SHOT.PORTADOWN, MONDAY. Yesterday, {{a serious}} party row {{took place at}} Maghery, a village {{situated}} {{on the shores of}} Lough Neagh, and distant about six miles (10 km) from Portadown. A man named Thomas Irwin died a couple of days previously at his residence in the townland of Cranfield, and his remains were yesterday removed for interment in Milltown graveyard. Irwin was an old and respected member of the Orange Institution, and his brethren of the Loughgall district turned out in considerable numbers to pay him their last tribute of respect. When passing through Maghery a most dastardly and cowardly attack was made on the procession. A Nationalist mob assailed the Orangemen, and endeavoured to beat them back with sticks and other weapons. Stones were showered into the procession, and the hearse was repeatedly struck with the missiles. A regular riot ensued, and in the fight which followed it is alleged that some of the Orange Party who were attacked in this disgraceful manner described fired revolver shots at their assailants. Two members of the Nationalist mob were shot though the wounds inflicted are said not to be of a dangerous character. A number of persons on both sides received wounds of a more or less serious nature inflicted with stones and other weapons used during the progress of the affray.Information was subsequently conveyed to Portadown, and District Inspector Bigley, Head Constable Donnelly, Sergeants Belford and McQueen, and all the available constables in both barracks drove out {{to the scene of the}} disturbances. Acting on information received some time after their arrival in Maghery, the police arrested two prominent members of the Orange party, and when conveying them to the Birches police barrack they were fired at by a crowd of Nationalists. Some of the police dismounted and pursued the crowd to the shores of the lough, where they arrested twelve members of the party. The peace officers subsequently found a loaded gun and powder cask convenient to the place where the shots were fired. Eye-witnesses of the occurrence state that the attack on the funeral procession was thoroughly organised, and that the Nationalist mob fought fiercely and with determination. The affair has naturally aroused considerable indignation and party feeling in the district surrounding Maghery, and the occurrence formed the sole subject of conversation in the neighbourhood yesterday and today.Captain <b>Slacke,</b> Divisional Commissioner, and Mr. Warburton, county inspector, visited the scene of the occurrence today and made inquiries respecting the affray. In the afternoon the prisoners were brought before Mr. N. L. Townsend, R.M. Armagh, in the Clonmacate Courthouse, Wm. John Vemer and David Fox, member of the Orange party, were charged with firing at and wounding Patrick Tennyson; and the following members of the Nationalist party were charged with unlawful assembly and firing shots: David Skelton, John McNally, James McHelly, Edward Robinson, William Donnolly, Daniel Gallagher, Henry Quinn, John McGrath, James McNally, Daniel Hagan, Joseph Hogan, and Francis Campbell.District Inspector Bigley, of Portadown, conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Crown:Mr. W. H. Wright, solicitor, Portadown, defended Verner and Fox, and the Nationalist prisoners were not professionally represented.After a number of depositions had been taken Mr. Townsend remanded the prisoners for eight days, accepting bail for the appearance of the Nationalist defendants themselves in $20 each, and two sureties of $10. His Worship refused to accept bail for the Protestant prisoners, Verner and Fox, who were charged with firing at and wounding, and they we accordingly conveyed to Armagh Jail this evening. During the affray two members in the Protestant party were wounded with revolver bullets. Their names are Eliza Wilson and Robert McMinn. It is said that the Nationalist defendants who fired at the police when they had Verner and Fox in custody will be charged with riot at a portion of the day prior to the time they were arrested.|$|E

Closely related is the minimum balance problem: Find a potential π:V(G) →R {{such that the}} numbers <b>slack(e)</b> ≔π(w) −π(v) −c((v,w)) (e=(v,w) ∈E(G)) are optimally balanced: for any subset of vertices, the minimum slack on an entering edge should equal the minimum slack on a leaving edge. Both problems can be solved by a parametric shortest path algorithm. We describe an application of these problems {{to the design of}} logic chips. In the simplest model, optimizing the clock schedule of a chip to minimize the cycle time is equivalent to a maximum mean weight cycle problem. It is very important to find a solution with well-balanced slacks; this problem, in the simple model, is a minimum balance problem. However, in practical situations many constraints have to be taken into account. Therefore minimizing the cycle time and finding the optimum slack distribution are more general problems. We show how a parametric shortest path algorithm can be extended to solve these problems efficiently. Computational results with recent IBM processor chips show that the cycle time reduces considerably. Moreover, the number of critical paths (with small slack) decreases dramatically. As a result we obtain significantly faster chips. The running time of our algorithm is reasonable even for very large designs...|$|E
