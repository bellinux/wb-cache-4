5000|$|According to an August 7, 2009 The New York Times {{article by}} Ben Zimmer, the popular {{expression}} FAIL came from this game: [...] "This punchy stand-alone fail most likely originated as a shortened form of “You fail” or, more fully, “You fail it,” the taunting “game over” message." [...] The full [...] "game over" [...] message is [...] "You fail it! Your skill is not enough, <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>time,</b> bye-bye!" ...|$|E

The great difficulty in almost all cases in mechanics is, in getting the power; there is very little difficulty in applying it to any purpose it is wanted for. So, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>next</b> <b>time,</b> Nathan, when <b>you</b> want to fly, you must wish, not that you had wings, but that you were strong enough to use them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Season 4 was the show's final season, {{with the}} {{concluding}} episode airing on August 5, 2006. The final episode was beset with problems, including illnesses on set and Farmer's flight not arriving {{until the final}} day of the shoot. The episode ended without an obvious acknowledgment that it was the series finale, although Farmer did passingly refer to the final scene as [...] "the end of the era" [...] and designer John Bruce addressed the camera in close up to say, [...] "Thank You, While You Were Out." [...] At the very end, Farmer told the audience, [...] "We'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> on While You Were Out," [...] perhaps either out of habit or so that audiences would keep watching reruns without knowing the show was no longer in production.|$|E
5000|$|In 1692 and 1693 Newton {{seems to}} have had a serious illness, the nature of which has given rise to very {{considerable}} dispute. In a letter dated 13 September 1693, addressed to Samuel Pepys, he writes: [...] "Some time after Mr Millington had delivered your message, he pressed me to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> I went to London. I was averse, but upon his pressing consented, before I considered what I did, for I am extremely troubled at the embroilment I am in, and have neither ate nor slept well this twelvemonth, nor have my former consistency of mind. I never designed to get any thing by your interest, nor by icing James's favour, but am now sensible that I must withdraw from your acquaintance, and <b>see</b> neither <b>you</b> nor the rest of my friends any more, if I may but have them quietly. I beg your pardon for saying I would <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, and rest your most humble and obedient servant." [...] And in a letter written to John Locke in reply to one of his about the second edition of his book, and dated the 15th of October 1693, Newton wrote: [...] "The last, winter, by sleeping too often by my fire, I got an ill habit of sleeping; and a distemper, which this summer has been epidemical, put me farther out of order, so that when I wrote to you, I had not slept an hour a night for a fortnight together, and for five days together not a wink. I remember I wrote to you, but what I said of your book I remember not. If you please to send me a transcript of that passage, I will give you an account of it if I can." ...|$|R
60|$|My dear Fanny--My Conscience {{is always}} {{reproaching}} me for neglecting you {{for so long}} a time. I have been returned from Winchester this fortnight, and as yet I have not <b>seen</b> <b>you.</b> I have no excuse to offer--I should have no excuse. I shall expect to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> I call on Mr. A. about George's affairs which perplex me a great deal--I should have to-day gone to <b>see</b> if <b>you</b> were in town--but as I am in an industrious humour (which is so necessary to my livelihood for the future) I am loath to break through it though it be merely for one day, for when I am inclined I can do {{a great deal in}} a day--I am more fond of pleasure than study (many men have prefer'd the latter) but I have become resolved to know something which you will credit when I tell you I have left off animal food that my brains may never henceforth be in a greater mist than is theirs by nature--I took lodgings in Westminster for the purpose of being in the reach of Books, but am now returned to Hampstead being induced to it by the habit I have acquired in this room I am now in and also from the pleasure of being free from paying any petty attentions to a diminutive house-keeping. Mr. Brown has been my great friend for some time--without him I should have been in, perhaps, personal distress--as I know you love me though I do not deserve it, I am sure you will take pleasure in being a friend to Mr. Brown even before you know him.--My lodgings {{for two or three days}} were close in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Dilke who never sees me but she enquires after you--I have had letters from George lately which do not contain, as I think I told you in my last, the best news--I have hopes for the best--I trust in a good termination to his affairs which you please God will soon hear of--It is better you should not be teased with the particulars. The whole amount of the ill news is that his mercantile speculations have not had success in consequence of the general depression of trade in the whole province of Kentucky and indeed all America.--I have a couple of shells for you you will call pretty.|$|R
