40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control strategy for a three- phase four-wire shunt active filter. The shunt active filter is a custom-power device capable to compensate, in real time, harmonics, unbalances and power factor in an electrical installation. In this work the power circuit {{is based on}} a three-leg IGBT inverter, with the dc-link composed by two capacitors connected in split. Thus the neutral point is connected directly to the midpoint of the dc-link capacitors. Its control system is composed by an algorithm based on the active and non-active currents together with a <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit,</b> and a novel algorithm to keep the voltages of the dc-link capacitors balanced and regulated. Due to the applied power-inverter topology, it is imperative to keep these voltages of the dc-link capacitors balanced in order to avoid malfunctioning of the active filter.

40|$|A clock <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit</b> for repeaterless low swing {{interconnects}} {{is presented}} in this paper. The circuit uses a delay locked loop (DLL) to generate multiple phases of the clock, of which the one closest {{to the center of}} the eye is picked by a phase detector loop. The picked phase is then further fine tuned by an analog voltage controlled delay to position the sampling clock at the center of the eye. A clock domain transfer circuit then transfers the sampled data to the receiver clock domain with a maximum latency of three clock cycles.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} a digital <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit</b> would eliminate metastability that plagues flip-flop circuits in digital input/output interfaces. This metastability is associated with sampling, by use of flip-flops, of an external signal that is asynchronous with a clock signal that drives the flip-flops: it is a temporary flip-flop failure that can occur when a rising or falling edge of an asynchronous signal occurs during the setup and/or hold time of a flip-flop. The proposed design calls for (1) use of a clock frequency greater than {{the frequency of the}} asynchronous signal, (2) use of flip-flop asynchronous preset or clear signals for the asynchronous input, (3) use of a clock asynchronous recovery delay with pulse width discriminator, and (4) tying the data inputs to constant logic levels to obtain (5) two half-rate synchronous partial signals - one for the falling and one for the rising edge. Inasmuch as the flip-flop data inputs would be permanently tied to constant logic levels, setup and hold times would not be violated.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with asynchronous circuit design and verification. Specifically, we will focus on new methods of modeling the control of data transmission between submodules in asynchronous systems. Our methods of modeling will be applied to asynchronous circuit synthesis; the methods will also be applied to interface recasting, by which we mean transforming the communication protocol of a module interface while preserving its functional behavior. Therefore, a circuit that uses one protocol for communication at its interface can be recast to another circuit that uses a different protocol at its interface while preserving the functional behavior of the original circuit. Furthermore, our methods would permit a single module to use several different protocols at its interfaces. By applying our methods, an additional degree of flexibility will be offered to designers in asynchronous data transmission design: namely, the choice of protocols for <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit</b> components without affecting the functional behavior of such components.

40|$|Abstract––With the {{widespread}} use of harmonic generating devices, the control of harmonic currents to maintain a high level of power quality is becoming increasingly important. An effective way for harmonic suppression is the harmonic compensation by using active power filter. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DSTATCOM control strategies put forward recently. It is aimed at providing a broad perspective on the status of DSTATCOM control methods to researchers and application engineers dealing with harmonic suppression issues. Many control techniques have been designed, developed, and realized for active filters in recent years. This paper presents different types of Synchronous reference frame methods for real time generation of compensating current for harmonic mitigation and reactive power compensation. All the techniques are analyzed mathematically and simulation results are obtained which are being compared in terms of its compensation performance with different parameters under steady state condition. The three techniques analyzed are the Synchronous Reference Frame Theory (SRF), SRF theory without <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit</b> like phase lock loop (PLL) also called instantaneous current component theory and finally modified SRF theory. Simulation results are obtained under sinusoidal balanced voltage source balanced load condition. The comparison and effectiveness of all the methods is based on the theoretical analysis and simulation results obtained with MATLAB employing a three phase three wire DSTATCOM test system.

40|$|When {{connecting}} distributed {{power generation}} systems to the utility grid, a power converter is normally placed between the main grid {{and the local}} micro-grid, {{at the point of}} common coupling. In order to synchronize the converter to the utility grid voltages, a <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuit</b> is needed. A common way of doing this, is to use a phase-locked loop (PLL). This circuit estimates a voltage reference angle which is fed to the control system of the power converter. One of the simplest PLL designs is based on the grid voltage zero crossings. The drawback of this method is that no information about the grid voltage conditions is available in the interval between the zero crossing. The design has been implemented and successfully tested on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) circuit connected to a power converter. A more advanced way of designing a PLL is by using voltage vector control. The method is more complex and time consuming. On the other hand, information about the grid voltage condition is always available. The design fails to run properly if the grid voltages are unbalanced or distorted. In order to improve the performance, a multi-variable filter tuned at nominal grid frequency may be added. This solution has been implemented on an FPGA circuit and successfully tested. The multi-variable filter will cause an angle displacement if the grid frequency deviates from its nominal value. The author proposes a method called Adaptive Signal Cancellation (ASC), {{in order to make the}} PLL frequency independent. The method is based on a method called Delayed Signal Cancellation (DSC) where the grid voltages are inputted and symmetric voltage components are outputted. Instead of delaying signals, the ASC is phase shifting signals, obtaining approximately the same performance. In addition to providing the control circuit with an estimated voltage reference angle, the circuit also outputs signals determining grid voltage conditions: voltage level, symmetry and frequency. These signals can be used in an overhead control structure taking care of power management and protection. </p...|$|E

Furthermore, the feedforward and feedback control strategy is proposed to suppress fluctuations and eliminate the harmonic components caused by power quality problems of the input voltage. The proposed converter could realize wide range voltage regulation with high power transfer efficiency and low total harmonic distortion.

40|$|Phase-locked loops (PLL), Costas {{loops and}} other <b>synchronizing</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{featured}} {{by the presence}} of a nonlinear phase detector, described by a periodic nonlinearity. In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the system such as multi-stability and chaos. Even if the phase locking is guaranteed for any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit can still be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error caused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e. g. to demodulation and decoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error oscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits extremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in this direction, available in the literature, focus on the phase jitter and cycle slipping under random noise and examine the relations between the probabilistic characteristics of the noise and of the phase error, e. g. the expected number of slipped cycles. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic systems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions, properties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors such as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for the number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by integro-differential equations, allowing to capture effects of high-order dynamics, discrete and distributed delays. We also consider the effects of singular small-parameter perturbations on the cycle slipping behavior...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{timing and}} synchronization methodologies {{that are critical}} to the design, analysis and optimization of high-performance, integrated digital VLSI systems. As process sizes shrink and design complexities increase, achieving timing closure for digital VLSI circuits becomes a significant bottleneck in the integrated circuit design flow. Circuit designers are motivated to investigate and employ alternative methods to satisfy the timing and physical design performance targets. Such novel methods for the timing and synchronization of complex circuitry are developed in this dissertation and analyzed for performance and applicability. Mainstream integrated circuit design flow is normally tuned for zero clock skew, edge-triggered circuit design. Non-zero clock skew or multi-phase clock synchronization is seldom used because the lack of design automation tools increases the length and cost of the design cycle. For similar reasons, level-sensitive registers have not become an industry standard despite their superior size, speed and power consumption characteristics compared to conventional edge-triggered flip-flops. In this dissertation, novel design and analysis techniques that fully automate the design and analysis of non-zero clock skew circuits are presented. Clock skew scheduling of both edge-triggered and level-sensitive circuits are investigated in order to exploit maximum circuit performances. The effects of multi-phase clocking on non-zero clock skew, level-sensitive circuits are investigated leading to advanced synchronization methodologies. Improvements in the scalability of the computational timing analysis process with clock skew scheduling are explored through partitioning and parallelization.
