2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album. Ocean {{previously}} co-wrote [...] "1st & Love" [...] and [...] "Locket (Locked in Love)" [...] with Rich King for Norwood's Human (2008) album. [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track. I just remember feeling like that at a point in my life. I know {{there are so many people}} out there that go through that dark time and I felt like it could speak to a lot of people." ...|$|E

[...] "You {{are always a}} good girl--at least, not always, because <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into passions, you know. Still, altogether {{you are a good}} little girl. Still, you see, you can't always be going about the country with me." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{staff of}} Melody Maker said [...] "we asked Neil Kulkarni {{to review the}} new Ned's Atomic Dustbin LP. Instead, he's written one very long sentence, and one very short one. Well, <b>you</b> can't always <b>get</b> what <b>you</b> want. But if <b>you</b> try <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> might <b>get</b> what <b>you</b> need." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't be helped, {{with two}} such solemn companions! There {{would be no}} bearing you if I didn't take <b>you</b> down <b>sometimes,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> so didactic, and talk of fictitious excitement, indeed! And now {{you are going to}} Rood House, what will you be coming back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, young sir, I {{tell you}} fairly that among my gifts {{is not that}} of {{patience}} with fools. If you are disposed to work right heartily, as I suppose you must be, or you would not make such a request, I on my part will {{do my best to}} teach you; but you must not mind if, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a rough buffet to assist your memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it. But you'll allow it's difficult. That's all I meant. I've known her--let me see--for twelve years, at least; {{ever since}} I first went West. She was about eleven then, {{and her father}} was {{bringing}} her up on the ranch. Her aunt came along by and by and took her to Europe--mother dead before Hazelwood went out there. But the girl was always homesick for the ranch; she pined for it; and after they had kept her in Germany {{three or four years}} they let her come back and run wild again--wild as a flower does, or a vine, not a domesticated animal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Contemplative!" [...] exclaimed the old gentleman with a laugh; [...] "well, yes, it is, a little. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> {{down into}} {{the bed of the}} stream with {{considerable}} difficulty, and you have to contemplate the banks a long time, occasionally, before deciding as to which precipice is least likely to give you a broken neck. Yes, it is a contemplative sport. As to quiet, that depends very much on what your idea of quietude may be. Our burn descends for two or three miles in succession of leaps and bounds. If the roaring of cataracts is quieting to you, there is no end of it down there. See, the pool that I speak of is partly visible now, with the waterfall above it. You see it?" ...|$|E

Other times the younger children look up to the older children as [...] "heroes". Club racing is often like a friendly [...] "family" [...] where {{the focus is on}} learning. Even at major events [...] "Novice" [...] (learning) fleets allow the less experienced to compete and enjoy the fun.|$|R
5000|$|Ars Technica interviewed Rob Pike, one of {{the authors}} of Go, and asked why a new {{language}} was needed. He replied that: It wasn't enough to just add features to existing programming languages, because <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> more in the long run by taking things away. They wanted to start from scratch and rethink everything. ... they did not want to deviate too much from what developers already knew because they wanted to avoid alienating Go's target audience.|$|R

5000|$|In 1956, {{according}} to the documentary Fifties British War Films: Days of Glory, when Elstree Studios was being sold to the BBC, Sir Michael Balcon was asked what had been his greatest achievement during his tenure. He replied [...] "I think perhaps The Cruel Sea because when we saw {{that for the first}} time, we realised that we really had brought it off. It seemed to just gel and be absolutely right. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> that feeling, but with that one we all did." ...|$|R

The four CDs are meant to be played simultaneously in order to hear the complete tracks. Coyne believes Zaireeka embraces [...] "...a kind of anarchy in art. It was like an art happening - you have to bring four sound systems together. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> great synchronicity; other times, it sounds haphazard. You get to hear music in a whole new way." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the talks}} progressed, GM's support receded, and Saab went into administration, the Swedish {{equivalent}} of America's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Saab's managing director Jan-Åke Jonsson {{said that this}} was [...] "the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment". For its part, the Swedish government was reluctant to become involved, with Maud Olofsson, industry minister, stating: [...] "The Swedish state and taxpayers in Sweden will not own car factories. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the impression that this is a small, small company but it is the world's biggest automaker so {{we have a right to}} make demands." ...|$|E
60|$|In some of {{the churches}} of Rome, there are mosaics of very large size, which are exact and {{beautiful}} copies of {{some of the}} most celebrated paintings in the world. Strangers coming into the churches and looking at these pictures, never imagine them to be mosaics, and when they are told that they are so, they can scarcely believe the story. But on examining them very near, or in looking at them through an opera glass,--for <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>get</b> very near them,--you can easily see the demarcations between the little stones.|$|R
5000|$|Going into it, I knew Serj {{wanted to}} sing more, so I {{guess that was}} a kind of a {{progression}} and an evolution for the band. I wanted to do all that, yet not lose the heaviness of the band and I guess the hard, punk, metal aspect. You could lose that <b>sometimes</b> when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a little too eclectic. So we were just trying to balance that fine line and not lose the fans. System of a Down guitarist Daron Malakian, speaking about the band's change in sound on Toxicity.|$|R
5000|$|... "Usually we don't {{write songs}} that {{far in advance}} of an album," [...] {{observed}} Jonathan Cain, the band's keyboardist, as Andy Secher, in his article [...] "Adventures in Frontierland," [...] published in the June 1983 issue of Hit Parader Magazine, quoted him. [...] "But on that occasion, Steve Perry and I were just working an idea backstage and it all came together. He {{was working on a}} bass and I had a guitar, and we just worked out the melody that night and the lyrics the next afternoon. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> lucky and have a song fall together like that." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fellow Penn State {{professor}} Rudy Slingerland called Voight [...] "singleminded", and Dick Janda {{remarked that}} [...] "Barry sometimes gets {{so involved in}} geology that he isolates himself from others. He's not selfish or self-centered, as some people believe; once the task is finished, he's {{back to being a}} warm, generous man with {{a good sense of humor}} ... He becomes totally immersed." [...] Penn State professor Gene Williams described Voight as [...] "the most creative person in his department", with [...] "tremendous powers of concentration. He attacks everything he does with great intensity. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the idea he's unsympathetic to you as a person—but it's really only that he's focusing on something else at the time. He's a good geologist. He has feeling for land." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day Obama {{said he would}} give Clinton {{the benefit of the}} doubt, adding, [...] "I have learned that when you are campaigning for as many months as Senator Clinton and I have been campaigning, <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> careless in terms of the statements that you make. And I think that is what happened here." [...] Throughout the Memorial Day weekend, the Clinton campaign sought to do damage control over the remarks, arguing more strongly that her remarks had been deliberately taken out of context by the news media and the Obama campaign. Campaign spokesperson Howard Wolfson said, [...] "It was unfortunate and unnecessary, and in my opinion, inflammatory, for the Obama campaign to attack Senator Clinton on Friday for these remarks, without obviously knowing the full facts or context." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Disaster" [...] is a pop rock ballad {{written by}} Gino Barletta, JoJo, Mario Marchetti, and Marc Himmel and {{produced}} by Mario Marchetti. The song {{was described by}} Barletta as an [...] "edgy power pop song" [...] with [...] "a huge chorus". Backed by a drum and acoustic guitar, JoJo sings of a relationship turned sour, [...] "I'm trying not to pretend/That it won't happen again and again like that Never thought it would end/Cause you got up in my head/In my head like that." [...] According to JoJo, the song's lyrics are [...] "basically about how <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> so deep into a relationship, and it gets progressively horrifying and real disastrous, whether it be emotional abuse or another type of abuse, it's like, 'How did I end up in this storm?' So it's an emotional record, but it's definitely resilient in the end." ...|$|E
50|$|Mohr im Hemd is an Austrian confectionery. Mainly it {{consists}} of chocolate, crumbs of bread, sugar, yolk, almonds and red wine. It is shaped like a small gugelhupf. Similar to the English Christmas pudding the Mohr im Hemd is cooked in water. Afterwards it is covered in hot chocolate and decorated with whipped cream. Sometimes the Mohr is served along with ice cream and thus gets called Eismohr im Hemd. A Mohr im Hemd can be savoured in Austrian coffee houses as well as restaurants. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> a Mohr in a Bavarian confectionery shop as well.|$|R
40|$|When you’re a kid you don’t {{think very}} much about how your body grows, it just does. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> may <b>get</b> a little taller or {{stronger}} but you never think very far beyond that point - unless you {{have to wear a}} prosthetic. The question of how children that wear prosthetic limbs keep up with their ever-changing bodies as they grow into adulthood is what sparked our curiosity and led us to research the multifaceted prosthetics industry for this thesis project. We wanted {{to see if there was}} a socially, fiscally, and environmentally responsible solution to this problem and if not, what we could do to help...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was delighted}} to take the role of Mr. Hooper, the gruff grocer with the warm heart. Its a big part, and it allows a lot of latitude.

5000|$|During {{the third}} {{practice}} session, Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick collided with each other. Once they both {{drove to the}} garage, they were talking out of anger from the comments that Denny Hamlin had about Clint Bowyer's penalty after New Hampshire. Once the argument ended, Denny Hamlin stated, [...] "There really was {{just a lot of}} cursing. That's all that was being said. There was really nothing logical being said between the two teams." [...] Richard Childress, the owner of the Bowyer's racecar, commented, [...] "When you're talking about comments, you can't win a pissing match with a skunk. There are two things I've learned. One thing is that. The other is that you don't throw stones {{if you live in a}} glass house." [...] Afterward, Robin Pemberton commented about the collision by saying, [...] "They just got together in practice, and that's fine. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> together in practice like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{qualifying}} session, Edwards stated, [...] "There's {{really no}} pressure. It's {{just go out}} and have fun, try not to run into Clint Bowyer or any of those guys that have a lot on the line. I think the key for us is to {{just go out and}} win a race. While the pressure's off, you can go out and you can take risks and race harder and <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a chance to perform really well. That's just what we need to start the Chase." [...] After qualifying fourth, Bowyer predicted that teams would utilize several different strategies as the race went on: [...] "Some teams can afford to take gambles — fuel mileage-wise, tire-wise, strategy-wise. That separates the race out. It really shakes things up. At the end of the races {{you are going to see}} guys keeping track position and doing whatever it takes to be up front to have that opportunity to win." ...|$|E

Additionally, Diddy told MTV that although the track had autobiographical elements, {{it was part of}} the album's [...] "conceptual love story narrated by his character". When asked by Live Lounge's Trevor Nelson what [...] "Coming Home" [...] was based on, Diddy said: [...] "Coming Home" [...] goes to everybody out there who's going through a struggle or obstacle. I've been lost in life, I'm still lost in life in these sense of trying to find your way back to that person who your grandmother or father wanted you to be. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> lost through drug addiction or you break up with up your partner or remission from cancer etc. you struggle to find your way back to yourself. That's what [...] "Coming Home" [...] is about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sadie thoughtfully, [...] "if I'd tried hard, I {{might have}} got Steve then, but I don't know if I'd {{have been any}} happier with him. He'd have gone his own way and taken me along; a good way, perhaps, but it wouldn't have been mine. Bob's different; {{sometimes}} {{he has to be}} hustled and <b>sometimes</b> led, but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> fond of a man you must take care of. Then everybody likes Bob, and he kind of grows on you.

2500|$|... "My {{views were}} {{formulated}} as a 24-year-old officer in Normandy... On one occasion the jeep ahead hit a mine... Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> were too far from a dressing station, <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> couldn't <b>get</b> them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: <b>You</b> <b>get</b> used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1995, on {{the album}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commented on Big in a skit called [...] "Shark Niggas (Biters)." [...] Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas' {{landmark}} release Illmatic, as well as styles from other rap artists. This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda knew who he was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef.
