50|$|The company {{introduced}} canister vacuum {{models in}} the 1930s. In the 1952, Regina introduced its more familiar stick model, the ElectrikBroom. During World War II, the company made bomb fuses. In the 1980s, CEO Donald D. Sheelen led a group of employees who purchased Regina for $38 Million in a leveraged buyout. Don Sheelen’s inventions cross the vacuum sphere from the basic vacuum cleaner to the <b>steam</b> <b>cleaner.</b> During the 90s, the Peanuts character Pig-Pen appeared in commercials. The “tools on board” idea, “cyclonic” vacuum technology, and the modern easy to use <b>steam</b> <b>cleaner</b> were all the brainchild of Don Sheelen. The Regina Company was eventually acquired by Philips Electronics in 1995. Oreck bought the company in 1997, and in 2000, it was sold to the Royal Corporation, which has sold the vacuums under the Home Depot brand ever since.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{types of}} {{cleaning}} can damage some jewelry. For example, some class rings are {{coated with a}} dark pigment, called antiquing, to darken their appearance. A lot of artisan sterling silver jewelry is oxidized to give it an intentionally rustic or industrial look and improper cleaning may remove that oxidation. Some gemstones, such as white topaz, have an overlay to produce certain colors. Ultrasonic cleaning can remove this coating, {{if it is not}} a quality piece. Ultrasonic cleaning is also contraindicated for opals, pearls and amber, and any other gemstone that is porous. Gemstones that are glued in (a common practice with semiprecious stones in non-precious methods and in class rings) should not be placed into an ultrasonic cleaner. An ultrasonic cleaner can cause stones that are loose in their settings to come out. Jewelry should always be examined for overlays and loose stones prior to cleaning with an ultrasonic cleaner or a <b>steam</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|E
50|$|South Perry — Originally {{known as}} the Grant Park addition, the {{neighborhood}} {{dates back to the}} late 19th century. In the old days, it had two lumberyards, a butcher shop, barber shop, library, ice cream parlor, bakery, <b>steam</b> <b>cleaner</b> and several grocery stores. Today the South Perry Business District is undergoing something of a gentrification-fueled renaissance. Trendy restaurants, bars, shops and cafes have taken over many of the storefronts along Perry Street. Being located just to the southeast of the city center, South Perry was settled {{in the early days of}} Spokane and as a result is home to a good bit of history. Grant Elementary has been operating since 1900, though the original building no longer stands. The adjacent Grant Park was established in 1908. One of Spokane's oldest religious congregations, the Liberty Park Methodist Church, has kept its doors open since 1912. Sonora Smart Dodd, regarded as the founder of Father's Day, resided in the neighborhood with her husband. Their Dodd House, built in 1913, is listed on the Spokane Historic Register, the Washington State Heritage Register, and the National Register of Historic Places as a National Landmark. Some of the buildings in the business district date back from the early 1920s, and feature some fine examples of local granite stonework, and decorative shingles. There is even a Dutch windmill, a landmark in the area.|$|E

30|$|Twenty-four slices (14  ×  16  ×  2  mm) of IPS e.max CAD LT A 2 /C 14 (EMAX; Ivoclar Vivadent, AG, Batch R 28294) were {{obtained}} by sectioning CAD/CAM blocks using a slow-speed diamond water-cooled saw (Isomet, Buehler). The slices were crystallized in a ceramic furnace (Austromat 624; DEKEMA Dental-Keramiköfen GmbH) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The slices were embedded in an acrylic resin positioning base (Palapress; Heraeus Kulzer, GmbH) and polished manually with 400 - and 600 -grit silicon carbide paper under water cooling. The surface of all specimens was then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with distilled water for 5  min. All specimens were HF-etched (IPS Ceramic Etching Gel, Ivoclar Vivadent— <  5 %) for 20  s, rinsed for 60  s with air/water spray (40 psi/ 2, 76 BAR) followed by post-etching cleaning and silanization. Four different post-etching cleaning methods were compared: AW—air/water spray, no post-etching cleaning; UB—immersion in ultrasonic bath with distilled water for 2  min; PA—application of phosphoric acid (37 %) for 30  s, followed by rinsing with water; or ST—steam cleaning (AX-SCA dental <b>steam</b> <b>cleaner)</b> for 10  s at 4 – 5 bars and a 10  cm distance. For each post-etching cleaning method, two silane application methods were used: E—no silane treatment; E/S—silane (Silane, Ultradent) applied for 20  s and air dried for 20  s, hot dried at 60  °C for 20  s; or E/S+—silane applied for 60  s, air dried for 20  s and hot air dried 60  °C for another 20  s (with hair dryer at 10  cm-distance), rinsed with boiling water for 15  s and hot air dried for 20  s.|$|E

50|$|Vapor <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners</b> or <b>steam</b> vapor {{systems are}} {{cleaning}} appliances or devices that use steam to quickly dry, clean, and sanitize inanimate surfaces. Often {{the process is}} effective enough to disinfect or even sterilize the surfaces. The steam is produced in a boiler that heats tap water to high temperatures (240-310F/115-155C) to produce low-pressure (several atmospheres), low moisture (4 to 6% water) water vapor (steam).|$|R
50|$|Originally set-up in 1857, {{the company}} was {{established}} as a pumps specialist working on numerous schemes along the River Thames. In the late 1920s, founder Henry Sykes bought land on the Greenwich marshes to supplement premises in Bankside which became the business headquarters.1964 saw the introduction of Andrews Industrial Equipment, which was at this time a separate entity from the Sykes brand. Andrews was predominantly involved with heating equipment and <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners</b> initially but by 1970, had branched out into air conditioning units.|$|R
50|$|Vapor <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners</b> are {{cited as}} {{examples}} of green cleaning since they do not {{require the use of}} chemical cleaning solutions. They are growing in popularity because of steam vapor's ability to kill germs and in some cases disinfect without the use of chemical disinfectants. Steam vapor has also been cited as effective in killing dust mites in carpet, bedding, and upholstery. Additionally, dry steam vapor has shown to be effective for killing bed bugs and their eggs when reaching temperatures of 150-170 degrees.|$|R
5000|$|Maintaining a clean diamond can be {{difficult}} sometimes, as jewelry settings can obstruct cleaning efforts, and oils, grease, and other hydrophobic materials adhere well to a diamond's surface. Some jewelers provide their customers with sudsy ammonia cleaning kits. Many jewelers use <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Some other jewelers sell small ultrasonic cleaners. Home-based cleaning methods include immersing the diamond in ammonia-based or ethyl alcohol-based solutions, or even a solution of mild grease dissolving detergent and warm water. Silver jewelry can be cleaned using aluminium foil, baking soda, and hot water. However, this practice is not recommended by most jewelers.|$|R
50|$|The {{inventor}} Alfred Kärcher (1901-59) from Baden-Württemberg {{founded the}} company in 1935 in Stuttgart Bad-Cannstatt. Initially Kärcher specialised {{in the design of}} industrial submersible heating elements, i.e. in salt smelters which were heated with immersion heaters. After numerous experiments, a hardening furnace for alloys was produced, the so-called “Kärcher Salt-Bath Furnace”. Some 1,200 units were sold up to 1945. Karcher invented the first modern pressure washer, the DS 350 in 1950. The company’s main focus then switched to cleaning equipment for professional and private users. Since then, Kärcher has made lead in the design and development of pressure washers. The company’s product range was expanded and now covers the entire field of cleaning (sweepers, detergents, scrubber-driers, wet and dry vacuums, vacuum <b>cleaners,</b> battery-powered brooms, <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners,</b> dry ice blasting equipment, parts cleaners, water treatment systems, vehicle washes and wastewater recycling systems). Kärcher also offers pumps and watering systems.|$|R

40|$|The multi {{cleaning}} {{system is}} supposed to be system that uses steam which can clean up things that are used by human in day to day life. The commercial detergent washers are compared with the system and {{it was found that the}} washing is very convenient and soapy forms are not produced that made the washing very clumsy. The removal of bacterial populations formed on surface of any material would be totally eradicated. The surface to be cleaned are given bath with steam with high pressure from 3 bar to 7 bar by which removal of dirt and stain particles were washed off very comfortably. High pressure steam would be generated by heat the water in the tank which will mounted on the system itself. The reason behind using the steam for washing purpose is the less wastage of water and also its availability. The development of steam based cleaning system has revolutionized the process of washing. One can choose an appropriate type of high power <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners</b> for challenging cleaning applications in office, commercial and industrial settings. The steam does that thing that commercial washing system cannot do. A steam can remove grease and grime while for normal cleaning requires expensive detergents. The multi cleaning system cannot be only used for industrial use but also for the housework stuff. So our prime focus is to use the steam and make multiple cleanin...|$|R
40|$|Electrocoagulation {{has been}} {{recognized}} positively to treat the wastewater from <b>steam</b> <b>cleaners,</b> textile manufacturing, mining operations, commercial laundry, municipal sewage system plants and palm oil industrial effluents. In this technology, metal cations are released into water through dissolving metal electrodes. Simultaneously, beneficial side reactions can help in removing flocculated material from the water. In present study, three steps of treatment will be carrying out to treat the petroleum based wastewater. The treatment includes preliminary settling process, coagulation process and electrocoagulation process. Preliminary settling is a natural process where no additional of chemical coagulant or additive to the samples. The settling time is set to be 24 hours for all the suspended solids to settle down. Preliminary settling process showed a big removal efficiency in total suspended solid (TSS) of the samples. The efficiency of removal for TSS during the preliminary settling process for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT are 0 %, 72. 44 % and 75. 14 %. However, for coagulation process, the optimum dosage of coagulant required for three different samples were determined using jar test. There was huge reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration after the coagulation process. The removal efficiency achieved for the coagulation process is 27 %, 63 % and 65 % for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT respectively. Although the removal efficiency is higher, further treatment by using electrocoagulant is required to meet the discharge limit. The optimum voltage is determined and all the samples are treated with applied voltage of 100 V. The efficiency of removal for COD achieved during the electrocoagulation process for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT is 99. 75 %, 98. 74 % and 99. 62 % respectively which meet the permissible level, and save to discharge to the environmen...|$|R
