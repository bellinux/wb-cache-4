40|$|Factors {{related to}} falls {{in a nursing}} home for the {{incapacitated}} elderly were investigated. Ninety-five falls of the 60 elderly residents occurred there from 1992 to 1993. They consisted of 21 men and 39 women with an average age of 78. 6 ± 5. 2 (SD) years old. Falls most frequently occurred in the day room, especially between 16 : 00 and 18 : 00. Falls were more common among the elderly with fainting or epilepsy than among those without these disorders. Falls tended to occur within one year after admission to the nursing home, especially among the elderly with walking difficulty, undergoing rehabilitation, or with a <b>self-help</b> <b>device</b> for walking. Thirty-three percent of the elderly experienced falls within one month after admission to the nursing home. The elderly who experienced falls received rehabilitation therapies more commonly, tended to have hearing disabilities, and tended to take sleeping drugs as compared to those who did not experience a fall within one month. Since falls of the elderly worsen both quality of life and activity of daily living, it is important to prevent falls through evaluating risk factors in each elderly care nursing home. Although we should prevent falls, we should avoid restraint to prevent them from becoming bedridden...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of why states maintain nuclear weapons typically receives short shrift: it’s security, silly. The international is a perilous place, and nuclear weapons represent the ultimate <b>self-help</b> <b>device.</b> Other ‘factors’ like status and domestic interests provide the background music. This thesis seeks to unsettle this complacency by drawing on Foucault to reconceptualise nuclear weapon-armed states as nuclear regimes of truth, refocusing on the processes through which governments produce and maintain country-specific discourses that enable their continued possession of nuclear weapons. Building on Derrida’s observation that nuclear weapons are a “fabulously textual” phenomenon, this thesis argues that because nuclear weapons are represented to work by not being used (deterrence) their utility depends on hypotheticals, and therefore remains transcendental. Consequently, maintaining a nuclear regime of truth requires considerable discursive imagination and labour to constitute the benefits of possessing nuclear weapons—whether that be status, security or {{both at the same}} time. To investigate these nuclear regimes of truth, this thesis critiques and modifies Lene Hansen’s Foreign Policy/Identity Nexus: developing a more flexible Weberian conception of legitimacy, theorizing how Hansen’s degrees of otherness can illuminate status seeking, borrowing from nukespeak and Lakoff to theorize policy representations, and adding desirability to the goal of policy makers. Using the UK nuclear weapons policy between 1980 and 2010 as an exploratory case study, this thesis provides practical insights beyond the grasp of conventional approaches to nuclear weapons research. From how Thatcher’s reification of the nuclear peace correlation contributes to a 21 st disarmament-taboo in UK politics, to how the end of the Cold War saw the UK replace its Security legitimacy with a new Non-Proliferation Treaty-based Prefect legitimacy that divests ethical responsibility for the world’s nuclear weapons problem through the performance of a counting bombs narrative, this thesis historicizes and deconstructs the many moving parts of the UK’s 21 st century nuclear common sense. Ultimately, this thesis provides the theoretical legwork for future empirical investigations into other nuclear regimes of truth...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{contribution}} of occupational therapy inside a rehabilitation group, and {{we focus on the}} autonomy of patients with disabilities due to leprosy. There are few studies on the use of assistive technology by leprosy patients; to our knowledge, none of them aim to have a subjective approach of care. Our purpose was to analyze the repercussions of assistive technology on autonomy of care of the self in patients with sequels of leprosy. A qualitative, descriptive exploratory study with a semi-structured interview and a field observation as a research method was conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 at a University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Eight patients from the service of Occupational Therapy were interviewed, and 44 hours of observation were performed. Interviews followed a semi-structured script and a field journal was used to take notes. Analysis was conducted by the hermeneutic approach. Costs were obtained after a global cost analysis of the fixed and variable expenses and direct and indirect costs to the manufactured products with an amount of 100 dollars. Results were grouped according to the following categories: contribution of the adapted devices for the care of the self and feelings and sensations provoked by the use of <b>self-help</b> <b>devices.</b> The reports revealed feelings, perceptions and meaningful contents about the social, familiar and individual dimensions, also the stigma coupled with leprosy. However, forms of re-signification were elaborated. Assistive technology empowers the subject to perform care of the self and promotes social inclusion...|$|R

These students are passed along supported by low minimum-based competency test scores. The purpose of this project was to show teachers how they can present mnemonic procedures to these students in an effort to help these students raise test scores, boost self-esteem, and provide a <b>self-help</b> study <b>device</b> that can aid their progress in subsequent grades, aid morale, and thus avoid potential drop-outs in the system. This curriculum design is offered in the subjects of health and science. The research reviewed shows that mnemonic procedures can be used in all subject areas in the fifth grade...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} legal {{protection}} for database is derived {{mainly from the}} universal problem of piracy. Database piracy has for years become a threat to database producers, primarily because of its nature of “easily susceptible for copying”. Advances in digital technology have facilitated the creation of databases. The technology makes possible for {{a large amount of}} data to be created and converted to a digital form. The same technology used in increasing the value of database, may also permit quick and easy reproduction of those databases or substantial portion of the data contained in it. This encourages the act of “free riding”. In the event that copyright, contract and <b>self-help</b> technical <b>devices</b> fail to repress wholesale copying, the law of actionable torts would suffice to prohibit the free riding activities of database, including parasitical or market-destroying business practices. In Malaysia, the courts should be willing to apply tortious principles in appropriate database cases. This would be a viable alternative to heavy-handed intellectual property legislatio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to specify several {{functions}} of bibliotherapies, focusing the case of self-help books. By the analysis of a sample of 60 books, we propose a number of parameters to classify self-help as a specific discursive genre. That characterisation involves theme, composition structures and literary style, all typical of the genre. The examination of <b>self-help</b> discursive <b>devices</b> enables to understand their performance on discomforms in subjectivty. &nbsp; Sef-help books are answers imbuid both in hegemonic ideology and in common sense that characterize this period. In this way, its historical developement has had different stages recognizables by the explicit objectives of the books, the foundations of their efficacy and the fields to which their influence is restrincted. The systematization of this evolution &ndash;that this article presents- makes easier to understand the eclectisism of this contemporary phenomenom. En este art&iacute;culo, analizo las funciones de las biblioterapias, ocup&aacute;ndome de un caso particular: los libros de autoayuda. A partir del an&aacute;lisis de un corpus de 60 libros, propongo un conjunto de par&aacute;metros que permitan clasificar a esta literatura como un g&eacute;nero espec&iacute;fico, definiendo el tema, el tipo de composici&oacute;n y el estilo que le son propios. El examen de su dispositivo discursivo permite comprender mejor su actuaci&oacute;n en los malestares de la subjetividad. Los libros de autoayuda son respuestas cifradas en la ideolog&iacute;a hegem&oacute;nica y el sentido com&uacute;n de la &eacute;poca. Como tales, su desarrollo hist&oacute;rico reconoce distintas etapas identificadas seg&uacute;n los objetivos pr&aacute;cticos que los textos persiguen, el discurso con el que legitiman su eficacia y el &aacute;rea a la que circunscriben su acci&oacute;n. La sistematizaci&oacute;n de esta evoluci&oacute;n facilita la comprensi&oacute;n del ecl&eacute;ctico fen&oacute;meno contempor&aacute;neo. ...|$|R
