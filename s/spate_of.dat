5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship.

5|$|A {{member of}} the Liberal Party, Loxton entered {{politics}} and was a {{member of the}} Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979. During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970–71. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of the subcontinent in 1959–60, overseeing a successful campaign despite a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton had to deal with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident.|$|E
2500|$|Beeldenstorm in Dutch, roughly {{translatable}} to [...] "statue storm", or Bildersturm in German ("image/statue storm"), {{also the}} Iconoclastic Fury, {{is a term}} used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century. During these <b>spates</b> <b>of</b> iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds {{as part of the}} Protestant Reformation. Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.|$|R

Bologna had submitted to the Church in August 1377, and Florence signed a treaty at Tivoli on 28 July 1378 {{at a cost of}} 200,000 florins indemnity extorted by Urban for the restitution of church properties, receiving in return the papal favor and the lifting of the disregarded interdict.|$|R
5|$|After {{this sudden}} <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> activity, Smoke Imix {{continued}} to rule until almost {{the end of}} the 7thcentury; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on AltarQ. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E
5|$|Anniyan was {{declared}} a blockbuster {{at the close}} of the year and, together with Chandramukhi, earned an estimated gross of 1.1 billion worldwide. The film also collected a distributor's share of 20 million. In Andhra Pradesh, Aparichitudu was named the biggest hit of 2005. The film did better business than straight Telugu films. It was the highest grosser among all Telugu films released that year. The film's success earned Vikram a big fan-following in Andhra. It also prompted producers in the Telugu film industry, which had hit a rough patch following a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> box-office duds, to acquire the dubbing rights to Vikram's previous Tamil films and release them in Telugu.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, Schiff {{and other}} city leaders contended with local ramifications of the 2008-2012 global recession, which {{included}} <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods.

The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered forgivable loans to homebuyers {{who were interested in}} properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods. Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.|$|E
50|$|Fall {{is usually}} cooler but foggy; {{on some days}} the fog never clears. By early-to-mid November, {{rainfall}} begins in typical Northwest fashion. Winter tends to be chilly and rainy, with occasional violent windstorms or <b>spates</b> <b>of</b> unusually warm—65 to 70 F—temperatures. This is due to extremely warm air coming from the Pineapple Express which can drop 3 to 6 in of rain {{in a matter of}} days. Each year there are one or two snowfalls, typically less than 6 in but up to 1 m in the surrounding foothills.

50|$|The 16th-century Reformation engendered <b>spates</b> <b>of</b> venerable image smashing, {{especially}} in England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, the Low Countries (the Beeldenstorm) and France. Destruction of three-dimensional images was normally near-total, especially {{images of the}} Virgin Mary and saints, and the iconoclasts ("image-breakers") also smashed representations of holy figures in stained glass windows and other imagery. Further destruction of cult images, anathema to Puritans, occurred during the English Civil War. Less extreme transitions occurred throughout northern Europe in which formerly Catholic churches became Protestant. In these, the corpus (body of Christ) {{was removed from the}} crucifix leaving a bare cross and walls were whitewashed of religious images.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo was {{member of}} the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing, {{also known as the}} Lockwood Committee because it was headed by Charles C. Lockwood. The {{committee}} investigated renting and building conditions in the City of New York and ended a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> rent-raising {{as a result of the}} housing shortage after World War I. The group found that the housing conditions at the time constituted a serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones. Later he was the chairman of New York state commission to investigate child welfare, and a {{member of the}} Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Exploitation of Immigrants (1923–24).|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled again from the rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E

40|$|Africa {{has earned}} a {{negative}} niche as the region of civil war, lawlessness and dictatorships. Though the all-too familiar derogatory metaphors (such as Kaplan's 'the coming anarchy [1994]) are slightly reversed, particularly since the 2000 s, following substantial democratic transformation, the continent continues to experience <b>spates</b> <b>of</b> intra- and inter-state wars with impact on the prospects of peace, stability and security in the continent.

5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} {{learning was}} all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive <b>spate</b> <b>of</b> Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The drugs were popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil.

Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne {{hundred and}} forty {{species of birds}} have been credibly {{recognised}} (during 1970 – 1990) as Kyzyl Kum desert inhabitants.

The valleys of dry riverbeds occupied with tamarisk saxaul groves contained 56 bird species. The smallest species range (16) was observed in the variations of the takyr spaces with poor vegetation. This paper also outlines the relative abundance of 40 species of birds that are typical inhabitants of desert landscapes.
