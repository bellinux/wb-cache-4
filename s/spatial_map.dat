25|$|The {{hippocampus}} provides {{animals with}} a <b>spatial</b> <b>map</b> of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means {{in reference to}} one's body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term spatial memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has {{the important role of}} processing information about spatial locations.|$|E
25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth <b>spatial</b> <b>map</b> of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a Gaussian filter, which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a <b>spatial</b> <b>map</b> (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
40|$|A {{milestone}} in numerical {{development is the}} acquisition of counting principles which allow children to exactly determine the numerosity of a given set. Moreover, a canonical left-to-right spatial layout for representing numbers also emerges during preschool. These foundational aspects of numerical competence have been extensively studied, but there is sparse knowledge about the interplay between the acquisition of the cardinality principle and <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> of numbers in early numerical development. The present study investigated how these skills concurrently develop before formal schooling. Preschool children were classified according to their performance in Give-a-Number and Number-to-position tasks. Experiment 1 revealed three qualitatively different groups: (i) children who did not master the cardinality principle and lacked any consistent <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> for digits, (ii) children who mastered the cardinality principle and yet failed in <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping,</b> and (iii) children who mastered the cardinality principle and displayed consistent <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping.</b> This suggests that mastery of the cardinality principle does not entail the emergence of <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping.</b> Experiment 2 confirmed {{the presence of these}} three developmental stages and investigated their relation with a digit comparison task. Crucially, only children who displayed a consistent <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> of numbers showed the ability to compare digits by numerical magnitude. A congruent (i. e., numerically ordered) positioning of numbers onto a visual line as well as the concept that moving rightwards (in Western cultures) conveys an increase in numerical magnitude mark the mastery of a <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> principle. Children seem to rely on this spatial organization to achieve a full understanding of the magnitude relations between digits...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) produces data about activity inside the brain, from which <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> can be extracted by independent component analysis (ICA). In datasets, there are n <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> that contain p voxels. The number of voxels is very high compared {{to the number of}} analyzed <b>spatial</b> <b>maps.</b> Clustering of the <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> is usually based on correlation matrices. This usually works well, although such a similarity matrix inherently can explain only a certain amount of the total variance contained in the high-dimensional data where n is relatively small but p is large. For high-dimensional space, it is reasonable to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering. In this research, we used the recently developed diffusion map for dimensionality reduction in conjunction with spectral clustering. This research revealed that the diffusion map based clustering worked as well as the more traditional methods, and produced more compact clusters when needed. Comment: 6 pages. 8 figures.

40|$|Abstract Low-dimensional spatial {{representations}} of political preferences are a wide-spread feature of voting advice applications (VAAs). Currently, VAA <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> {{tend to be}} defined {{on the basis of}} a priori reasoning. This article argues that VAA <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> should be empirically validated to safeguard fundamental psychometric properties – in particular, unidimensionality and reliability. We suggest dynamic scale validation as a pragmatic method for improving measurement quality in VAA <b>spatial</b> <b>maps.</b> The basic logic of dynamic scale validation is to exploit early user data as a benchmark against which ex-ante defined maps can be evaluated. We draw on data from one of the most institutio-nalised VAA settings, Switzerland, to illustrate this dynamic approach to scale validation.

Realignment occurs when spatial discordance signals noncorrespondence between <b>spatial</b> <b>maps.</b> In Experiment 1, generalization of recalibration aftereffects from prism exposure to postexposure depended upon the similarity of target pointing limb postures.

40|$|Mammalian {{hippocampus}} plays a {{key role}} in spatial learning and memory, but the exact nature of the hippocampal representation of space is still being explored. Recently, there has been a fair amount of success in modeling hippocampal <b>spatial</b> <b>maps</b> in rats, assuming a topological perspective on spatial information processing. In this paper, we use the topological model to study 3 D learning in bats, which produces several insights into neurophysiological mechanisms of the hippocampal <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping.</b> First, we demonstrate functional importance of the cell assemblies for producing accurate maps of the 3 D environments. Second, the model suggests that the readout neurons in these cell assemblies should function as integrators of synaptic inputs, rather than detectors of place cells' coactivity and allows estimating the integration time window. Lastly, the model suggests that, in contrast with relatively slow moving rats, suppressing θ-precession in bats improves the place cells capacity to encode <b>spatial</b> <b>maps,</b> which is consistent with the experimental observations.

50|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is located}} in the medial temporal lobe area of the brain and is responsible for governing spatial memory. In animals, this allows them to have a <b>spatial</b> <b>map</b> of their environment and it uses reference and working memory to accomplish this.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new classification method for high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images {{based on a}} strategic mechanism of <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> and reclassification. The proposed method includes four steps. First, the multispectral image is classified by a traditional pixel-based classification method (support vector machine). Second, the panchromatic image is subdivided by watershed segmentation. Third, the pixel-based multispectral image classification result is mapped to the panchromatic segmentation result based on a <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> mechanism and the area dominant principle. During the mapping process, an area proportion threshold is set, and the regional property is defined as unclassified if the maximum area proportion does not surpass the threshold. Finally, unclassified regions are reclassified based on spectral information using the minimum distance to mean algorithm. Experimental {{results show that the}} classification method for high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images based on the <b>spatial</b> <b>mapping</b> mechanism and reclassification strategy can make use of both panchromatic and multispectral information, integrate the pixel- and object-based classification methods, and improve classification accuracy...|$|R
