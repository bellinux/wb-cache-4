Does being detained before trial affect a personâ€™s likelihood of going to prison? In new research that examines the cases of more than 90, 000 federal defendants, James C. Oleson and his colleagues find that those released before trial were {{far less likely to}} be sent to prison if convicted, and if they were, for far shorter periods than those who were not released or who had their pretrial <b>supervision</b> <b>revoked.</b> He argues that this sort of sentencing disparity should be of interest to federal prosecutors and judges alike...|$|E
2500|$|At first, most courts {{ruled that}} a {{sentence}} of imprisonment imposed upon revocation cannot be followed by an additional term of supervised release, unless the defendant is convicted of a new crime for which supervised release is an authorized punishment. However, this law was changed, and now states, [...] "When a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense {{that resulted in the}} original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release." [...] The original [...] had included a clause stating that the term of imprisonment had to be less than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by [...] in order for a term of supervised release to be available, but this led to perverse effects in that, for instance, if the maximum term of imprisonment was two years, a judge could sentence a defendant to two years less one day, and then be able to sentence him to a year of supervised release. If <b>supervision</b> is <b>revoked,</b> it means the defendant spends part of supervision imprisoned, and then supervision is continued until it is terminated by the court or expires.|$|R
