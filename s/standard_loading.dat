2500|$|Further common {{sources of}} {{criticism}} in reviews, discussion and technical support {{are that the}} game suffers from numerous bugs, instability and prohibitively long load screens: [...] "the <b>standard</b> <b>loading</b> screen is preceded by its own loading screen, for meta-loading", as Game-Revolution put it in their review.
