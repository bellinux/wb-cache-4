As a strategy to <b>strengthen</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> in a situation heavily circumscribed by the limited resource support from local governments, the environmental protection authorities at all levels have established a sizable number of service organizations to provide them administrative support. These service organizations have to sponsor their own operation by engaging in revenue-generating or fund raising activities. This has led to the emergence and proliferation of service organizations in the environmental governance system in the last decade.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to move to a}} market economy sets in train two major forces. 1. The fall in output has led to a reduction in personal incomes and created a fiscal crisis. 2. A widening earnings and income distribution is a result of wage and price liberalisation, and is an inherent part of the reform. The change leads to rising unemployment and increased poverty. It also has major administrative implications. Thus, by its very nature, the reform process creates forces which require a major reshaping of the social safety net to address three major issues: poverty relief, cost containment, and <b>strengthening</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity.</b> Of the recommendations, five are paramount. 1. The minimum level of the major benefits should be at or above subsistence and, {{at least in the short}} run, should be fully protected against inflation. 2. Cost containment implies that, in the short run, benefits above the minimum should be protected only to the extent that resources permit; and, to the maximum extent compatible with political realities, the right to combine full old age or invalidity pension with more or less full-time work should be withdrawn for individuals below normal retirement age. 3. <b>Administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> should be <b>strengthened.</b> In particular, the administration of cash benefits requires modernisation. Such a process is crucial both to ensure effective benefit delivery, and to containing costs. 4. Social insurance and pension contributions should be shared between worker and employer, with the worker's contribution appearing on his/her payslip. 5. Short-run problems should be addressed in a manner consistent with long-run policy design. In particular, as soon as economically and administratively feasible, the relationship between social insurance benefits and individual contributions should be strengthened. ...|$|R

The {{strengthening of}} institutional and <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> of Poland (and other candidate countries) {{is also in}} the interest of EU - hence its help with creating and <b>strengthening</b> <b>administrative</b> structures in those countries. The main source of this help is PHARE. One of its components - Institution Building - allows financing the <b>strengthening</b> of <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity.</b> One of the mechanisms of support of institution building is twinning. It is the agreement between an institution in the candidate country and its equivalent in one or more member states. The aim of twinning is to deliver specific and guaranteed results, agreed between the parties in advance and fulfilling the goals set out in the Accession Partnerships. The parties sing the "Twinning Covenant" in which they agree on detailed work plan and means to achieve the result. It is the new form of co-operation of candidates and member states of EU. The article touches on the meaning of twinning projects and the commitment of member states in their implementation. Zadanie pt.

40|$|Abstract The {{merits of}} {{integrated}} conservation and development projects (IC-DPs), which aim to provide development incentives to citizens {{in return for}} con-servation behaviors, have long been debated in the literature. Some {{of the most common}} critiques suggest that conservation activities tend to be strongly overpow-ered by development activities. We studied this assertion through participant observation and archival analysis of five Conservation Area Management Com-mittees (CAMCs) in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal. Committee activities were categorized as conservation activities (policy development and con-servation implementation), development activities (infrastructure, health care, education, economic development, and sanitation), or activities related to institu-tional <b>strengthening</b> (<b>administrative</b> development and <b>capacity</b> building activities). Greater longevity of each ICDP was associated with greater conservation activity in relation to development activities. Project life cycles progressed from a focus on development activities in their early stages, through a transitional period of insti-tutional strengthening, and toward a longer-term focus that roughly balanced con-servation and development activities. Results suggest that the ICDP concept, as practiced in ACA, has been successful at building capacity for and interest in con-servation amongst local communities. However, success has come over a period of nearly a decade, suggesting that prior conclusions about ICDP failures may hav...|$|R

While ALMPs have been implemented to varying degrees in East Asia, they still cannot be considered an important policy instrument; yet, careful consideration by policymakers to such programs, could prove responsive to the economic crisis, and to the longer-term requirements of development. An overview of ALMPs is provided, with key issues reviewed for design consideration. The study discusses the techniques used to evaluate ALMPs, and summarizes the evidence on their impacts, identifying key variables associated with successful outcomes in the region. Recommendations suggest the following issues for the formulation of an active labor market policy: setting priorities, by initially developing strong employment services; identifying {{the roles of the}} public, and private sectors, which leads to more diverse, innovative, and cost-efficient services, closely oriented to labor demand, but focused on public priorities; promoting partnerships, and dialogue within coordinated policies, and <b>strengthened</b> <b>administrative</b> and operational <b>capacities,</b> provided a balanced public, and private financing is in place.

40|$|Preparing for EU {{membership}} requires changes {{across a}} wide range of sectors in many of the institutions and organisations involved in the public governance and legislative enforcement processes. Criteria that every candidate country has to undertake in the process of accession, known as "Copenhagen criteria", can be summed down to political, economical and administrative requirements in order to fully adopt, implement and comply with the Community acquis. The administrative criteria (also known as Madrid criteria) requires from the candidate country to be able to create conditions for adjustment of national governance structure to the EU public governance mechanisms. This requires modernisation of their administrations taking into account the principles of professionalism and neutrality. Transition and EU enlargement deeply rely on capacities and quality of common and national institutions responsible for enforcement and conduct of development policies. In the very core of this adaptation process lays the institutional change and convergence. Institutions create motivational structures for individuals and organisations, and coordinate their activities and behaviour. Although institutions have to provide envisaged and coherent rules, sometimes {{there is a need for}} institutions to change and adapt to social preferences, technology, political and socio-economic structures and external factors. Many challenges in Croatian public administration rise from inadequate education, insufficient monitoring of employees' performance, and high level of political impact, lack of organisational culture, true values, paternalism and no orientation toward a citizen. There is no defined development strategy in public governance. The number of state officials is extremely high. Nevertheless, the government has foreseen seize of public administration growth, horizontal decentralisation, rationality and sound economic behaviour in the accession to EU. It is highly important because public administration is the one to carry the burden of legislative reform within the country. European Commission objects Croatia the weakness of its institutions indebted for efficient cooperation with International Court of Justice and conduct of obligations from international agreements. For the past few years EU-Croatia Parliamentary Committee has adopted several Declarations and Recommendations all stating that Croatia demonstrates continuous progress and efforts in the area of judicial and public administration reform, but also has to pursue <b>strengthening</b> the <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity,</b> not only to implement adopted reforms, but to secure that it can benefit fully from increased financial assistance.

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{following}} question: Why, after 16 years of receiving Structural Funds, do some regions still have difficulties in spending their allocated resources? Empirical evidence shows that Funds implementation rates have varied widely among European Union Objective 1 regions. The overall performance of Italian regions, in particular, has consistently lagged behind other countries. However, an investigation into individual Italian Objective 1 regions reveals that not all follow this general trend. Indeed, some regions have outperformed others remarkably. Why is this the case? I explore these differences and identify potential variables that may account for such regional variation. My central hypothesis is that differences in implementation are strongly dependent {{on the degree of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> that exists in the recipient regional government. Due to the deficiency in the existing literature of a clear definition of <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity,</b> I attempt to fill this gap by introducing a novel characterization that allows me to operationalize and measure the concept. The core of the methodology is an in-depth case study supported by field research based on personal interviews and documented questionnaires. I investigate two contrasting southern Italian regions, Sicily and Basilicata, measure their respective degrees of <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> and provide evidence to suggest that this latter variable is positively correlated to Structural Funds implementation. Answering my first query has prompted a further question: if it is trite that the variation in implementation of resources between regions can be explained by different degrees of regional <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity,</b> then what is it that determines the degree of <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> at the regional level? In studying this second question I further test the hypothesis that the level of <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> is influenced by three key political factors: namely, political interference, government stability and political accountability.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>capacities</b> of regional institutions and the absorption capacity for European Cohesion Funds. Specifically, <b>administrative</b> <b>capacities</b> are expected {{to be one of the}} most important explanations for varying absorption capacity across regions in the EU. First, an extensive literature review provides the main definitions and expectations for this relationship. <b>Administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> is defined here as the ability for reform, and the capacity to overcome structural obstacles stemming from regional and national politics and procedures, and create a culture of mutual learning and capacity building. This was tested in a case study of IPA fund implementation in four Croatian counties, using findings from data analysis, interviews with policy makers and existing evaluation studies, to provide an as complete as possible picture of regional <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity.</b> The study suggests that EU fund absorption capacity differs greatly between Croatian counties, which, despite having many of the same structural obstacles, show large variation in amount of implemented IPA funding. Over time, some counties have overcome obstacles through active training and capacity building, networking and partnership, an active civil society and good evaluation practices. The county that was found to be less successful in this regard had a significantly lower amount of implemented projects, and seemed to be stuck in procedural processes. As such, the results indicate that <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> and ability for reform of regional institutions is an essential part of creating regional absorption capacity for EU funds...|$|R

To do so, we use an augmented {{version of the}} Permanent Income framework with public investment faced with adjustment costs capturing the associated <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> as well as government direct transfers. A key assumption is that those adjustment costs rise {{with the size of}} the resource windfall. The main results from the analytical model are threefold. First, a larger resource windfall commands a lower level of public capital but a higher level of redistribution through transfers. Second, weaker <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> lowers the increase in optimal public capital following a resource windfall. Third, higher total factor productivity in the non-resource sector reduces the degree of des-investment in public capital commanded by weaker <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity.</b> We further extend our basic model to allow for “investing in investing ” — that is public investment in <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> — by endogenizing the adjustment cost in public investment. Results from the numerical simulations suggest, among other things, that a higher initial stock of public administrative “know how ” leads to a higher level of optimal publi...|$|R
