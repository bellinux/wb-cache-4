25|$|A second {{explanation}} {{issued by}} Janssen and Vanhamme {{is that of}} reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do <b>something</b> <b>if</b> they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little {{in return for their}} investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.|$|E

She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do <b>something</b> <b>if</b> it can be twisted {{into one of the}} 'nine levels of competence' of her NVQ. Another {{member of the}} office is the useless Clive (Tom George) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).|$|E

25|$|Harris and Klebold were {{eventually}} released from diversion several weeks early because of positive {{actions in the}} program; they were both on probation. Shortly after Harris' and Klebold's court hearing, Harris's online blog disappeared. His website was reverted to its original purpose of posting user-created levels of Doom. Harris began to write in a journal, in which he recorded his thoughts and plans. In April 1998, {{as part of his}} diversion program, Harris wrote a letter of apology to the owner of the van. However, around the same time, he furiously derided him in his journal, stating that he believed himself {{to have the right to}} steal <b>something</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to. Harris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before he and Klebold committed the Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

500|$|In 1899 Ravel {{composed}} {{his first}} piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ("Pavane for a dead princess"). It was originally a solo piano work, {{commissioned by the}} Princesse de Polignac. In the same year he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. Henri Gautier-Villars ("Willy") described the piece as [...] "a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School" [...] and called Ravel a [...] "mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become <b>something</b> <b>if</b> not someone in about ten years, if he works hard." [...] Another critic, Pierre Lalo, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says <b>something,</b> <b>if</b> it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for <b>something.</b> <b>If</b> I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur Ransome {{described}} The Importance... as {{the most}} trivial of Wilde's society plays, {{and the only one}} that produces [...] "that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful." [...] "It is", he wrote, [...] "precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly." [...] Ellmann says that The Importance of Being Earnest touched on many themes Wilde had been building since the 1880s—the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and Wilde takes it {{as a starting point for}} the two protagonists. While Salome, An Ideal Husband and The Picture of Dorian Gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing, vice in Earnest is represented by Algy's craving for cucumber sandwiches. Wilde told Robert Ross that the play's theme was [...] "That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality." [...] The theme is hinted at in the play's ironic title, and [...] "earnestness" [...] is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue, Algernon says in Act II, [...] "one has to be serious about <b>something</b> <b>if</b> one is to have any amusement in life" [...] but goes on to reproach Jack for 'being serious about everything'". Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in An Ideal Husband), but in Earnest the protagonists' duplicity (Algernon's [...] "bunburying" [...] and Worthing's double life as Jack and Ernest) is undertaken for more innocent purposes—largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations. While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Earnest is superficially about nothing at all. It [...] "refuses to play the game" [...] of other dramatists of the period, for instance Bernard Shaw, who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals.|$|E
