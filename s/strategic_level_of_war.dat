5000|$|While Dai is {{the major}} author of INEW doctrine, the {{strategy}} stems from both U.S. and Soviet IW doctrine. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union had a doctrine called Radio-Electronic Combat (REC), which the U.S. Army describes as “the total integration of electronic warfare and physical destruction resources to deny us the use of our electronic systems.” [...] Multiple authors call INEW “REC on steroids.” This is because INEW adds additional dimensions to REC, specifically INEW moves beyond the tactical and theater realms of operations where REC was applied by elevating the INEW doctrine to a <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Additionally, INEW adds cyber attacks and kinetic attacks on satellites to the REC doctrine. INEW also implements U.S. IW strategy from the AirLand Battle doctrine, the U.S. response to REC that integrated airpower, special operations forces, artillery, armor, and EW. Additionally, INEW implements lessons learned from U.S. information operations in Kosovo, the Balkans, and Iraq. Lessons learned from these U.S. military engagements may have influenced China's decision to apply IW doctrine at the strategic war level. INEW integrates the use of “EW, CNO, and limited kinetic strikes against key command, control, communication, and computer nodes to disrupt the enemy's battlefield network information systems.” CNO include computer network attack, defense, and exploitation. Aligning with Dai's ideology, INEW unites offensive and defensive IW under a single authority, specifically 4PLA. [...] One {{of the most important}} aspects of INEW is that it integrates IW into larger PLA operations, [...] calling for kinetic attacks that make use of opportunities created by IW operations, as Dai discussed above. [...] For example, INEW doctrine combines precision strikes and IW operations, likely targeting command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) targets in line with INEW doctrine. [...] INEW applies a variety of methods, to include the disruption and destruction of systems, creation of false realities through falsified information, electronic jamming, deception, and suppression, computer network attacks, computer intrusions to sabotage information processing, and impeding information transmissions. The goal of INEW is to weaken and/or paralyze an opponent's decision making capabilities and the political, economic, and military component's of the enemy's war infrastructure. [...] To do this, INEW doctrine calls for IW operations to seize control of opponent's information flows and maintain information dominance during campaigns. IW operations also aim to achieve information dominance that would result in denying the opponent access to information that is vital to continuing the conflict. [...] This dominance should be maintained throughout conflicts. INEW continues to be the dominant doctrinal core of PLA IW operations today, with 4PLA likely in the authoritative position to implement this strategy.|$|E
5000|$|Clausewitz was a {{professional}} combat soldier {{who was involved in}} numerous military campaigns, but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> utilizing the campaigns of Frederick the Great and Napoleon as frames of reference for his work. He wrote a careful, systematic, philosophical examination <b>of</b> <b>war</b> in all its aspects. The result was his principal book, On War, a major work on the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution, producing some significant contradictions between different sections. The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate, as are exact meaning behind his seemingly contradictory claims (discussions pertinent to the tactical, operational and <b>strategic</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> are one example). Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments, to include more material on [...] "people's war" [...] and forms <b>of</b> <b>war</b> other than high-intensity warfare between states, but relatively little of this material was included in the book.

40|$|Our {{nation has}} a truly {{impressive}} array of space-based capabilities supporting our armed forces. However, much of this support is focused at the <b>strategic</b> and operational <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> There are several areas of desired improvement in the space force enhancement mission area at the tactical <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> that could be addressed by small, inexpensive satellites dedicated for use by tactical land warfighters. One of these areas of desired improvement is tactical beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications, including support for ground sensors, text message relay, voice communications, and image or video transmission. Technical solutions to fill these areas of desired improvement should be relatively inexpensive, and more importantly, taskable by tactical users {{in the area of}} operations. New trends in the miniaturization of electronic components are leading to smaller satellites with significant capabilities in the nanosatellite (1 - 10 kg) and microsat (10 - 100 kg) classes. For example, the CubeSat standard for nanosatellites now being built by universities around the world is based on tiny cube-shaped satellites with dimensions of only 10 cm on a side and weighing about 1 kg. Slightly larger nanosatellite configurations, with multiple cube formats, allowing for missions from low earth orbit with broader scopes are under investigation by organizations such as NASA, Boeing, and the US Army. One technical approach that could address today’s tactical BLOS communications area of desired improvement for the tactical warfighter would be a constellation of nanosatellites in low earth orbit. To investigate the feasibility of such a constellation, the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is executing the Space and Missile Defense Command – Operational Nanosatellite Effect, or SMDC-ONE, technology demonstration. The key SMDC-ONE demonstration thresholds for success involve designing, developing, building and qualification testing of two nanosatellite units, and acceptance testing of eight flight units within a one-year timeframe ending in April 2009. A custom communications payload will deliver a capability to support simulated ground sensors and text message relay. Communications beyond this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> complexity were not included in this demonstration to reduce schedule risk. SMDC-ONE can help establish the case for inexpensive space force enhancement for the tactical warfighter through relatively inexpensive, rapidly developed nanosatellite constellations...|$|R
40|$|Military Strategy {{is defined}} as a plan at the {{military}} <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> that consists of a set of military strategic ends, ways and means and the relationships between them. This definition leads to the following research questions: 1. How can the extent of the many-to-many relationships that exist between a military strategy, its ends, ways and means be quantified? 2. If the relationships between a military strategy, its ends, ways and means are quantified and if the effectiveness of the force design elements is known, how shall that enable the quantification of the state&# 8217;s ability to execute its military strategy? 3. If the relationships between a military strategy, its ends, ways and means are quantified and if the effectiveness of the force design elements is known, how will it aid decision-making about the acquisition of the future force design? The first research question is answered by mapping a military strategy complete with its ends, ways and means to a ranked tree where the entities in the strategy corresponds with the vertices of different rank in the tree. The tree representation is used to define and determine the contribution of entities in a military strategy to entities at the next higher level. It is explained how analytical, heuristic and judgement methods can be employed to find the relative and real contribution values. Also, a military strategy for South Africa is developed to demonstrate the concept. The second research question is answered by developing measures of effectiveness taking the interdependence of entities at the terminal vertices of the ranked tree into account. Thereafter, {{the degree to which the}} force design would support the higher order entities inclusive of a military strategy could be calculated. The third research question is answered by developing a cost-benefit analysis method and a distance indicator from an optimal point to aid in deciding between supplier options for acquisition. Thereafter the knapsack problem is amended to allow for scheduling acquisition projects whilst optimising the force design's support of a military strategy. Finally, the model is validated and put into a contextual framework for use in the military. Operations ManagementD. Phil...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{interested}} in the legality of the harm caused to civilians in the context of targeted killings with drone attacks. This issue is researched through the example case of the CIA drone attacks in Pakistan. The chosen legal framework is international humanitarian law, and the legal rules that are applied are the principle of discrimination, the principle of proportionality and the obligation to take precautionary measures in attacks. The first two rules are applied cumulatively so that first the discrimination of targeted killings with drones are researched, after which the proportionality of the attacks is discussed. The aim of this thesis is to find out how the application of proportionality principle differs in the context of targeting fighters of terrorist organizations with drones compared to traditional means and methods of combat used in war fighting. Additionally, the aim is to find out whether the traditional rules of international humanitarian law afford sufficient protection for civilians against disproportionate damage in the special context of targeted killings with drone attacks. The thesis concludes that drones are discriminate and thus lawful means of combat. The method of targeted killings with drone attacks and its special tactics are not generally indiscriminate but the determination should be done on a case-by-case basis. In relation to the proportionality rule, attacks should be proportional in the tactical and in the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> However, some of the drone attacks seem to have only insignificant strategic military advantage. Therefore, these attack types – signature attacks – raise concern of disproportion when the insignificant strategic military advantage is compared with collateral damage assessed cumulatively. However, currently the standard of disproportionate drone attack may be that high and ambiguous that the proportionality of an attack is mainly based on the good faith of the attacker that is established by taking precautionary measures. The CIA has made some effort in Pakistan to take precautionary measures. Therefore, the drone attacks may not be considered disproportionate if good faith of the CIA was established. Consequently, I argue that if the precautionary measures were not given that much importance in proportionality analysis, the rule would afford more comprehensive protection for civilians in the context of targeted killings with drone attack...|$|E
40|$|At the {{tactical}} level of war the Germans are {{widely regarded as}} having had the most innovative and proficient army of World War I. Likewise, many historians would agree that the Germans suffered from serious, if not fatal, shortcomings at the <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> It is at the middle level of warfare, the operational level, that the Germans seem to be the most difficult to evaluate. Although the operational was only fully accepted in the 1980 s by many Western militaries as a distinct level of warfare, German military thinking well before the start of World War I clearly recognized the Operativ, as a realm of warfighting activity between {{the tactical}} and the strategic. But the German concept of the operational art was flawed at best, and actually came closer to tactics on a grand scale. The flaws in their approach to operations cost the Germans dearly in both World Wars. Through a thorough review of the surviving original operational plans and orders, this study evaluates the German approach to the operational art by analyzing the Ludendorff Offensives of 1918. Taken as a whole, the five actually executed and two planned but never executed major attacks produced stunning tactical results, but ultimately left Germany in a far worse strategic position by August 1918. Among the most serious operational errors made by the German planners were their blindness to the power of sequential operations and cumulative effects, and their insistence in mounting force-on-force attacks. The Allies, and especially the British, were exceptionally vulnerable in certain elements of their warfighting system. By attacking those vulnerabilities the Germans might well have achieved far better results than by attacking directly into the Allied strength. Specifically, the British logistics system was extremely fragile, and their rail system had two key choke points, Amiens and Hazebrouck. During Operations MICHAEL and GEORGETTE, the Germans came close to capturing both rail centers, but never seemed to grasp fully their operational significance. The British and French certainly did. After the Germans attacked south to the Marne during Operation BLUCHER, they fell victims themselves to an inadequate rail network behind their newly acquired lines. At the operational level, then, the respective enemy and friendly rail networks had a decisive influence on the campaign of March-August 1918.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} prisoners of war (POWs), agents and other groups of persons as source of information in the British conduct of war against Germany during the Second World War and demonstrates its significance. While the successes of Bletchley Park in decrypting German wireless traffic are well-known, human intelligence (HUMINT) has received considerably less scholarly attention. During the years 1939 to 1945, the British used an extensive espionage network, maintained informal contacts in neutral cities, and questioned refugees, convicted enemy spies and soldiers who had escaped from German captivity. Most notably, the military services established a far-reaching system of interrogation facilities to obtain intelligence from German prisoners of war in all theatres of war. These activities provided a valuable amount of intelligence on German weaponry, tactics, plans and mentality, which not only constituted useful background information in rapidly changing war conditions but also improved decision-making processes and resulting actions. During the past decades, {{the main focus of}} academic research lay on signals intelligence and its influence on British strategy and operations which resulted in a neglect of other forms of intelligence. Recent academic research has not only emphasised a more holistic view of intelligence and its impact on warfare but also points to several successful HUMINT operations such as the international cooperation in espionage and the so-called Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, United Kingdom (CSDIC(UK)). At the same time, studies in intelligence provide an extensive framework dealing with various theoretical, practical and ethical aspects which facilitates the analysis of intelligence in historical context. In light of these developments and the unprecedented access to archival material, a re-evaluation of the role of human intelligence in Great Britain during the Second World War is necessary. This thesis combines the theoretical approaches of intelligence with an examination of the organisation of human intelligence during wartime. It utilises three case studies covering the tactical, operational and <b>strategic</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> First, it offers a model of “main areas”, collection, analysis, dissemination and use, to examine the intelligence process in historical context. These elements constitute a set of interacting steps which describe the way from a specific piece of raw material to its use as human intelligence in decision-making. The human origin influences the characteristics of the intelligence process such as the interaction of individuals during collection, the inherent problem of reliability and accuracy, and the question of acceptance by potential users. The model also serves as a basis for an evaluation scheme: the internal value addresses the intelligence process itself, whereas the external value measures the effect within decision-making and its impact on resulting actions. Regarding the organisational aspect, the intelligence agencies responsible for human intelligence used their previous experience from the last war and grew significantly in size during the Second World War. The interrogation of prisoners of war consisted of a multi-step process with the CSDIC(UK) at the top, which over 10 000 POWs passed through. The combination of interrogation techniques – such as the omniscient trick and friendly approach, concealed microphones, and former refugees or prisoners acting as stool pigeons – resulted in a high output of accurate and appreciated HUMINT. The Secret Service (SIS) recovered after some setbacks {{at the beginning of the}} war and – supported by contacts in occupied territory – it was able to deliver reports covering a wide range of topics. In addition, the Security Service (MI 5) and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) supplemented the work of the SIS – besides their primary objectives. In addition to the use of enemy prisoners and agents in the field, there were three other sources for HUMINT: the questioning of refugees in the specifically designed London Reception Centre, regular contacts with interned British soldiers and individual arrangements in neutral countries, most notably in Sweden and Switzerland, which provided the Foreign Office with news of varying quality. The outcome of these extensive efforts is discussed in the three case studies. The tactical example deals with the defence against German attacks during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz in 1940 / 1941. POW Intelligence supplemented the other sources of intelligence with the perspective of the enemy: it provided actual data on armament, armour and equipment of German bomber and fighter aircraft; it added details on the order of battle and combat readiness of the German Luftwaffe; and it gave insight into enemy tactics, targeting and the effectiveness of British countermeasures. Therefore, HUMINT made a valuable contribution to the overall intelligence picture which supported and optimised the efforts of Fighter Command. It helped to prepare fighter pilots for their engagements with the enemy and to counter new tactics and technologies such as navigational aids for night bombing. The operational case study covers the detection of the German plans to use a liquid rocket and cruise missile (the so called V-weapons V 1 and V 2) against British cities, where human intelligence played a key role. In early 1943, SIS reports and secret records of conversations between German POWs convinced the authorities in London of the danger of a long range weapon of a new type. HUMINT later gave indications of the existence of two distinct weapons and the V 1 firing system in Northern France. In 1944, it provided details on the characteristics and launching procedures of the V 2. These contributions enabled the British not only to direct other intelligence resources such as aerial reconnaissance towards the new threat but also to develop effective offensive and defensive countermeasures. These delayed the deployment of the two weapons and significantly reduced the inflicted damage. The strategic example deals with the British efforts to assess the state of morale of the German military and civilian population. This aspect was primarily covered by human intelligence. Although the amount of raw material gradually expanded and the analytical methods became more sophisticated – especially after the drastic increase of prisoner of war interrogations after D-Day –, the impact of HUMINT remained ambivalent. Until 1943, preconceived opinions about an inferior German morale and an especially vulnerable civilian population were not altered by intelligence products provided by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee and a separate “morale committee”. The conviction in the second half of 1943 that Germany would collapse from within as it had happened in 1918 was the most visible result. In the following months, intelligence analysis improved considerably and finally falsified previous hopes; however, that development did not restrain British authorities from over-enthusiastic expectations of a rapid end of war in the summer of 1944. Ultimately, human intelligence provided a considerable insight into the inner state of the enemy, but the intelligence task to detect a predefined collapse and the attempt to conceive an elaborated concept of morale overburdened the intelligence services. This thesis combines theoretical approaches with a historical analysis and shows that human intelligence was a powerful force multiplier which the British early recognized and successfully utilized. Therefore, this thesis offers a new perspective on British intelligence and military history during the Second World War. Furthermore, it seeks to contribute to general discussions about the relevance of intelligence in decision-making up to the present day. ...|$|E
