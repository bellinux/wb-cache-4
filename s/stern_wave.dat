5000|$|After {{experimenting with}} the S-1, the Germans made several {{improvements}} to the design. Small rudders added {{on either side of}} the main rudder could be angled outboard to 30 degrees, creating at high speed what is known as the Lürssen Effect. This drew in an [...] "air pocket slightly behind the three propellers, increasing their efficiency, reducing the <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> and keeping the boat at a nearly horizontal attitude". This was an important innovation as the horizontal attitude lifted the stern somewhat, allowing even greater speed, and the reduced <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> made E-boats harder to see, especially at night.|$|E

40|$|The Institute for Ocean Technology {{specializes in}} researching and testing models of ships. The Department of National Defence has {{contracted}} IOT {{to develop a}} stern appendage that will reduce hydrodynamic resistance on the Halifax Class frigate. This appendage will also improve speed and propeller cavitation performance, and reduce the <b>stern</b> <b>wave.</b> The model used for testing contains sensitive electrical equipment which is vulnerable to forces induced by the <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> impacting the model {{at the end of}} high-speed runs. There is also a risk of the <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> washing over the transom and causing further damage to equipment. Researchers at the Institute have proposed a method to solve these problems through the development of a device called the Wave Suppressor. This device would be used to dissipate the wave energy, and thereby reduce the impact force of the wave on the stern of the model and prevent the <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> from washing over the transom. This report details the design considerations used {{in the development of the}} proposed mechanism and describes its various components. It covers the design criteria that the Wave Suppressor must meet, and how the Wave Suppressor fulfills these requirements. The report first sets the design criteria and then proceeds to describe the Suppressor?s connection to the tow tank carriage, the design factors involved in ensuring the wave will be fully suppressed, and the control of the suppressor. It also includes calculations that were used in the design process and provides assembly drawings of the wave suppressor. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 156 - 162. In {{this thesis}} the wave pattern {{generated}} by a moving ship is investigated experimentally using close range photogrammetry. The author has been primarily interested in validating a new approach in {{the determination of the}} wave making resistance of a ship by means of the energy contained within the wave pattern. Secondary considerations were the measurement of the total ship resistance and other dynamically related applications; squat and trim, bow and <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> profiles and their interactive effects. The proposed theoretical approach in this analysis of the wave resistance from the wave pattern is essentially phenomenological. As a ship proceeds through the fluid, it generates a set of waves radiating from the bow and stern due to the pressure differences along the hull. Energy is needed to maintain this system and is supplied at a constant rate by the ship, this being the energy required to overcome wave-making resistance. If the total change in energy within the wave pattern can be evaluated over a time interval associated with a known ship movement, then the energy difference will be a related to the wave making resistance...|$|E

50|$|A salient {{property}} of water waves is dispersiveness; i.e., {{the longer the}} wave, the faster it moves. Waves generated by a ship are affected by her geometry and speed, {{and most of the}} energy given by the ship for making waves is transferred to water through the bow and stern parts. Simply speaking, these two wave systems, i.e., bow and <b>stern</b> <b>waves,</b> interact with each other, and the resulting waves are responsible for the resistance.|$|R

Driven by a concern regarding the escalating cost of fuel to operate the HALIFAX Class frigates, the Institute for Ocean Technology has been contracted by the Department of National Defence to carry out research, {{in collaboration with the}} Defence R&D Canada ? Atlantic, to develop a viable stern flap appendage that will reduce hydrodynamic resistance for a Class-wide blended annual speed profile with secondary benefits such as an increase in forward speed, improved propeller cavitation performance and a reduced <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> system.

40|$|Summary. The {{turbulent}} free-surface flow {{around the}} Series 60 ship is computed at model- and full-scale ship Reynolds numbers. The steady RaNS equations are solved using the RaNS solver FINFLO SHIP de-veloped at the Ship Laboratory of Helsinki University of Technology. Turbulence is treated with Chien ’ s low-Reynolds number k-ǫ turbulence model. Incom-pressibility {{of the flow}} is taken into account by an artifical compressibility approach. The entire bound-ary layer is resolved till the wall. The nondimen-sional distance of the first node from the wall is about 2. The free-surface is evaluated using a moving-grid technique and regridding. The validation is carried out using experimental results for the resistance and the wave profile obtained at model scale. Further, the wave profiles at the hull are compared with the solution of a potential-flow computation. The results for the wave profile are in good agreement with the experiment and the potential-flow solution. At full scale, the <b>stern</b> <b>wave</b> is little higher than at model scale, which is physically correct, indicating a slight scale effect. The resistance is evaluated with an accu-racy of about 4 percent at model scale and full scale. The measured result is extrapolated to the respec-tive Reynolds numbers using the ITTC- 57 method. The significance of computations and validation at full scale is discussed. The results shown demonstrate that free-surface computations of turbulent ship flows around simple geometries are possible at full-scale ship Reynolds numbers using the moving-grid tech-nique and no wall functions. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{powerful}} {{mathematical method}} for front instability analysis that was recently {{developed in the}} field of nonlinear dynamics is applied to the 1 + 1 (spatial and time) dimensional Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. From the essential spectrum of the LLG equation, it is shown that the famous Walker rigid body propagating domain wall (DW) is not stable against the spin wave emission. In the low field region only <b>stern</b> spin <b>waves</b> are emitted while both <b>stern</b> and bow <b>waves</b> are generated under high fields. By using the properties of the absolute spectrum of the LLG equation, it is concluded that in a high enough field, but below the Walker breakdown field, the Walker solution could be convective/absolute unstable if the transverse magnetic anisotropy is larger than a critical value, corresponding to a significant modification of the DW profile and DW propagating speed. Since the Walker solution of 1 + 1 dimensional LLG equation can be realized in experiments, our results could be also used to test the mathematical method in a controlled manner.
