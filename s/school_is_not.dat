500|$|The Utagawa {{school that}} Toyoharu founded {{was to become}} one of the most influential, and {{produced}} works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.

[...] Other well-known members of the school were Utamaro, Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi, and Kunisada. [...] Though Japanese art schools, such as the Katsukawa in ukiyo-e and the Kanō in painting, emphasized a uniformity of style, a general style in the Utagawa <b>school</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easy to recognize aside from a concern with realism and facial expresseiveness. [...] The school dominated ukiyo-e production by the mid-19th century, and most of the artists—such as Kobayashi Kiyochika—who documented the modernization of Japan during the Meiji period during ukiyo-e's declining years belonged to the Utagawa school.|$|E
