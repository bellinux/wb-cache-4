40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to detect some microscopic effects of acid rain on ovule formation, development, structure and protein content in plants. Bean plants were grown in plots in different groups and treated by different acid solutions of HNO 3, H 2 SO 4 and both HNO 3, H 2 SO 4. The pH of each group regulated at 2, 3, 4, 4. 5. Treatments were taken for 4 weeks, one in each day. Developmental stages of ovules were compared in acid treated and control plants. Results showed that developmental process of ovules show some abnormalities. Embryo sac was not completed its growth and was smaller in the treated plants than control ones. In treated plants, vesiculation of embryo sac and plasmolysis of nucellar tissue were <b>seen.</b> <b>Accumulation</b> of dark particles and disruption of nuclear envelope in embryonic cells are the results of acid treatments. Treatments by HNO 3 with pH 2, was more effective than other acid solutions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{last few}} years have <b>seen</b> the <b>accumulation</b> of {{compelling}} evidence that apoptosis (programmed cell death) {{plays a major role}} in promoting resolution of the acute inflammatory response. Neutropulls are constitutively programmed to undergo apoptosis, which limits their pro-inflammatory potential and leads to rapid, specific, and non-phlogistic recognition by macrophages and semi-professional phagocytes. Similar mechanisms have been implicated in clearance ofeosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes and apoptosis also plays a role in remodeling the inflamed site by deletion of myofibroblasts. A growing understanding ofthe mechanisms regulating leukocyte apoptosis and ofthe molecules mediating safe phagocytic clearance of dying cells may yield new insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of inflammatory diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The past 50 {{years have}} <b>seen</b> an <b>accumulation</b> of {{evidence}} suggesting that associative learning depends on high-level cognitive processes {{that give rise to}} propositional knowledge. Yet, many learning theorists maintain a belief in a learning mechanism in which links between mental representations are formed automatically. We characterize and highlight the differences between the propositional and link approaches, and review the relevant empirical evidence. We conclude that learning is the consequence of propositional reasoning processes that cooperate with the unconscious processes involved in memory retrieval and perception. We argue that this new conceptual framework allows many of the important recent advances in associative learning research to be retained, but recast in a model that provides a firmer foundation for both immediate application and future research...|$|R

We construct a sample of households by matching on the probability of suffering a death (the “propensity score”). We control for possible crowding out of own savings by including the receipt of transfers and credit as instrumented variables, and we bootstrap both the first-stage and the second-stage multinomial logits 1000 times. We find that households do not behave according to the buffer-stock model, and that the consequences of the death are more severe among poorer households than wealthier...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPrevious {{studies of}} serial cloning in animals showed a {{decrease}} in efficiency over repeated iterations and a failure in all species after a few generations. This limitation led to the suggestion that repeated recloning might be inherently impossible because of the accumulation of lethal genetic or epigenetic abnormalities. However, we have now succeeded in carrying out repeated recloning in the mouse through a somatic cell nuclear transfer method that includes a histone deacetylase inhibitor. The cloning efficiency did not decrease over 25 generations, and, to date, we have obtained more than 500 viable offspring from a single original donor mouse. The reprogramming efficiency also did not increase over repeated rounds of nuclear transfer, {{and we did not}} <b>see</b> the <b>accumulation</b> of reprogramming errors or clone-specific abnormalities. Therefore, our results show that repeated iterative recloning is possible and suggest that, with adequately efficient techniques, {{it may be possible to}} reclone animals indefinitely...|$|R

40|$|We review {{some aspects}} of {{financial}} dollarization in Russia, applying the main relevant theories to analyze the dynamics of several dollarization indicators. An econometric model of the short run dynamics of deposit and loan dollarization is estimated for the last decade. We find that ruble appreciation was the main driver of the de-dollarization that occurred then and of the later episode of renewed dollarization. We estimate the overall (and sectoral) currency mismatches of the Russian economy. The results show a gradual improvement of the net foreign currency position of the public sector, where we have <b>seen</b> significant <b>accumulation</b> of international reserves by the Bank of Russia and repayment of government debt. Evidence is also presented for the significant currency risk vulnerability of the nonbanking private sector. Several existing empirical studies are examined {{in order to assess}} the growth losses of the Russian economy following the crisis of 2008, which was linked with the financial dollarization. financial dollarization; currency mismatch; balance sheet effects; Russia...|$|R

40|$|Many sources, {{including}} {{textbooks and}} popular “history”, often perpetuate the myths of science-faith warfare {{rather than an}} accurate picture {{of the development of}} geology. Both creation science and conventional geologists often misinterpret historical views by falsely assuming that a similarity between a past position and a modern one means that the two are the same. Replacing the simplistic false dichotomy of young-earth, biblically-based positions involving global flooding versus old-earth, non-biblical positions with no global flood with a true picture of the variety of historical concepts may promote better thinking about the range of possible positions. As demonstrated by Martin Rudwick, chronologies such as Ussher’s actually were forerunners of geology, whereas the vast timeline of deists like Hutton was on a philosophical dead end. Neptunism and catastrophism were not compatible with modern flood geology.

30|$|Moreover, {{deficiency}} of membrane CFTR also causes autophagy-impairment via induction of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) [12], leading to peri-nuclear accumulation of damaged/misfolded proteins in aggresome-bodies, as <b>seen</b> by the <b>accumulation</b> of ubiquitinated proteins, p 62 and VCP in the insoluble fraction, which may mediate COPD-like symptoms or BPD in pediatric subjects. During fetal development, baseline autophagy is associated with maintenance of healthy pregnancy, while autophagy-impairment can promote preterm delivery [2]. This may explain the higher susceptibility of preterm infants to respiratory infections, as a robust autophagy response is essential for clearance of common lung pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Hence, restoring autophagy-impairment may be a lucrative therapeutic strategy to alleviate COPD-like symptoms and prevent BPD in SHS-exposed infants.|$|R

We reported that the percentage of tumor infiltrating Tregs is strongly correlated with the WHO grade of the brain tumor. We now report on the clinical follow-up of this patient cohort (n= 83). Subgroup analyses in patients with glioblastomas (n= 29) showed a moderate, not significant, inverted association between Tregs and survival. We further show that Tregs in glioblastomas, in contrast to other tumor infiltrating effector lymphocytes, highly express the CCR 4 chemokine receptor.

It has long been assumed that these phenomena depend on extracellular matrix reorganization; however, the demonstration that fibroblastic cells acquire contractile features during the evolution of granulation tissue (for review, see Schürch et al, 1998) has switched the interest from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. The past 30 years have <b>seen</b> the <b>accumulation</b> of advances {{in the field of}} contractile fibroblasts or myofibroblasts that presently appear to be the key cell for the production of granulation tissue remodeling. Myofibroblasts are obviously also producing extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin, and it has become clearer that granulation tissue remodeling depends on the coordinate activities of intracellular and extracellular molecules. The interactions of these molecules are under the control of microenvironmental factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) or other cytokines and mechanical stress. The purpose of our review is to summarize recent advances made in this field by several laboratories, with special emphasis on the evolution of fibrotic phenomena in the liver and the kidney...|$|R
