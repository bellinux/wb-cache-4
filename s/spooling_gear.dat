50|$|The drum seine uses a {{horizontally}} mounted drum to haul {{and store}} the net {{instead of a}} power block. The net is pulled in over a roller, which spans the stern, and then passes through a <b>spooling</b> <b>gear</b> with upright rollers. The <b>spooling</b> <b>gear</b> is moved {{from side to side}} across the stern which allows the net to be guided and wound tightly on the drum.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} development and application of a methodology for preliminary analysis of variable pitch fan (VPF), both as a separate component and as a module integrated into a short-medium range geared turbofan engine developed within European FP 7 project ENOVAL. For this purpose, a high bypass ratio two <b>spool</b> <b>geared</b> turbofan engine model was constructed in software PROOSIS. A VPF performance modelling methodology was then developed using 3 D steady RANS CFD produced fan maps as baseline; the CFD maps characterised five discrete fan pitch angle settings. In order to represent those maps in PROOSIS and add the pitch angle as a degree of freedom, they were transformed into the Map Fitting Tool (MFT) reference frame. Once the complete VPF turbofan model was in place, engine mission optimisation experiments were carried out. The resulting performance is characterised by a good capability to control the fan surge margin, without degrading the engine fuel consumption...|$|R

The propulsor includes a hub and a row of propulsor blades that extends from the hub. The row includes no more than 20 of the propulsor blades...|$|R
5000|$|A free-turbine {{turboshaft}} {{is a form}} of turboshaft or turboprop {{gas turbine}} engine where the power is extracted from the exhaust stream of a gas turbine by a separate turbine, downstream of the gas turbine and is not connected to the gas turbine (the exhaust airflow is what spins the turbine that is connected to the shaft hence the term [...] "free"). This is opposed to the power being extracted from the power <b>spool</b> via a <b>gear</b> box.|$|R
50|$|The Me 155 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} a DB 605A-1 liquid-cooled engine of 1,475 PS (1,455 hp, 1,085 kW). The {{fuselage}} {{was more or less}} that of the standard Bf 109G, but with an entirely new wing. The undercarriage retracted inwards into wing wells, providing the wider track required for safe carrier landings. Standard naval equipment such as folding wings, catapult <b>spools,</b> and arrester <b>gear</b> were to be fitted. Proposed armament was an engine mounted 20 mm MG 151 cannon and two 20 mm MG 151 cannons and two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns in wings. It had an estimated maximum speed of 649 km/h (403 mph).|$|R

Rotation of the turbine drives the propulsor at a different speed than the spool. The propulsor includes a hub and a row of propulsor blades that extend from the hub. Each of the propulsor blades includes an airfoil body. The {{leading edge of the}} airfoil body has a swept profile such that, at the design speed, a component of a relative velocity vector of a working gas that is normal to the leading edge is subsonic along the entire radial span...|$|R
40|$|Yoichiro Ito {{introduced}} countercurrent chromatography (CCC) in 1966, {{reporting the}} separation of blood plasma cells with a sealed helical tube. Since then, CCC has been a fertile ground for instrumental and technical innovation. The key innovation of CCC was to use centrifugal forces to retain the stationary liquid phase in the column {{in such a way}} that it is able to interact dynamically with the mobile phase without any solid support. The broad diversity of countercurrent separation terminology reflects the innovative spirit of the field, as well as the global appeal of this technique. The selection of the appropriate biphasic liquid system is the core of the CCC technique. The CCC columns must generate the centrifugal field needed to maintain the liquid stationary phase; therefore, they cannot be a simple tube with frits at both ends. Rotors, motor, <b>gears,</b> <b>spools,</b> and rotating seals are very specific things that are not needed in a classical liquid chromatography column with a solid stationary phase. The differences between the two main types of CCC columns are described. The bases of the CCC theory are also given...|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamic cycle {{analysis}} is performed {{to study and}} compare possible ways of achieving significant reductions in fuel burn of the N+ 3 commercial aviation gas turbine engines. Here N+ 3 represent the 3 rd generation aero-engines from the current engines in use with the expected Technology Readiness Level, TRL 4 – 6 in the 2025 timeframe. ^ The analysis was carried out using Numerical Propulsion System Software (NPSS). NPSS was developed by NASA Glenn Research Center in collaboration {{with some of the}} top aviation industry partners and the Department of Defense (DOD). A systematic methodology was adopted for this work. Phase one of this work was on calibrating the NPSS code with performance data of several engines available from the public domain including the CFM- 56 / 5 B, CF 680 -C 2 2 ̆ 6 GE 90 engine series along with LM 6000 and LMS 1000, in addition to showing repeatability of a test case, NASA N+ 1 advanced geared turbofan supplied by NASA. The results obtained from the NPSS showed reasonable predictions of the performance data both at ADP (Aerodynamic Design Point) and off-design conditions. ^ Having established the reliability of the methodology, the second phase was to perform thermodynamic analysis of a three <b>spool</b> advanced <b>geared</b> turbofan gas turbine engine cycle at ADP, GTF. Next, GTF with a recuperator and intercooler were analyzed; and optimized operating conditions were established for each of these configurations. The three engines selected from the design point optimization were analyzed for off-design analysis and performed. Finally, the third phase of the project looked at other potential ways of improvement in fuel efficiency by leveraging ideas from other thermal power generating systems to assess the feasibility of application to aviation gas turbine engines. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving <b>spool</b> that is <b>geared</b> so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|R
