40|$|We {{view the}} vectors of a {{semantic}} distributional model as vectors of a <b>semi-module</b> over the semi-ring {{of a real}} interval with its canonical lattice structure. In this approach, the quantum logic of subspaces is distributive and Boolean on the sublattice of subspaces generated by sets of basis vectors. If the basis vectors correspond to strings of words, the <b>semi-module</b> classifies words like a thesaurus. Its Boolean sublattice includes the concepts corresponding to single words. If the basis vectors identify with single words the connectives of quantum logic lift from the basis vectors to the whole space as linear maps. Concept vectors {{are linked to the}} vectors assigned by a pregroup grammar through the classes they determine. The functional composition of pregroup semantics corresponds to a composition of concepts by logical connectives. Examples including compound noun-phrases like πno bank and πred herring illustrate the equivalence of the quantum logic of subspaces to the compositional logic of pregroup grammars...|$|E

We show that the quantum logic of projectors is distributive and includes a Boolean sublattice.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{stratification}} of the reduced subschemes of Rapoport-Zink spaces and of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties that highlights {{the relation between}} the geometry of these spaces and the action of the associated automorphism group. We show that this provides a joint group-theoretic interpretation of well-known stratifications which only exist for special cases such as the Bruhat-Tits stratification of Vollaard and Wedhorn, the <b>semi-module</b> stratification of de Jong and Oort, and the locus where the a-invariant is equal to 1.

40|$|The {{category}} of <b>semi-modules</b> over the lattice {{of a real}} interval $I$ serves as a common frame for extensional logical semantics and conceptual vector semantics of natural language. The vector lattice of an $I$-space is embedded in its projector lattice. Words are represented by an extensional vector given in a pregroup lexicon and a conceptual vector that lives in a tensor product of 2 -dimensional spaces where each 2 -dimensional space stand for a 'basic' concept. Syntactical analysis defines the extensional vector of a grammatical string compositionally. The latter is translated to the concept vector of the string such that the truth of a sentence {{is equivalent to the}} truth of a concept. Examples include compound noun phrases with adjectives, quantifiers, negation and relative pronouns...|$|R
40|$|Dans la thèse on s'occupe des méthodes et des algorithmes de vérifications de la commutativité des diagrammes dans les catégories symétriques monoidales fermées (catégories des modules, des <b>semi-modules</b> etc [...] .). On démontre l'infinité de {{structures}} de catégories intermédiaires entre la structure des catégories libres et la structure triviale et on étudie l'utilisation des méthodes de la théorie de la démonstration pour la vérification de la commutativité dans ces cas intermédiaires. The {{subject of}} this thesis belongs {{to the field of}} categorical proof theory, which lies somewhere between category theory and proof theory. It uses proof theoretical methods in solving problems related to some general matters in category theory, which are syntactical nature (for example, question of commuting diagrams in canonical structure of some freely generated category belonging to a particular class of categories). On the other hand, categrorical proof theory uses categories as contexts where comme questions of particular interest fo general proof theory may be correctly formulated and answered (for example, the question whether two dérivations are equal, which is the main question of general proof theory) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In A {{generalization}} {{of the original}} Diffie-Hellman key exchange in (ℤ/pℤ) * found a new depth when Miller and Koblitz suggested that such a protocol could be used with the group over an elliptic curve. Maze, Monico and Rosenthal extend such a generalization to the setting of a Semi-group action on a finite set, more precisely, linear actions of abelian semi-rings on semimodules. In this paper, we extend such a generalization to the linear actions of quotient semi-rings on semi-modules. In fact, we show how the action of quotient semi-rings on a <b>semi-module</b> {{gives rise to a}} generalized Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal protocol. This leads naturally to a cryptographic protocol whose difficulty is based on the hardness of a particular control problem, namely the problem of steering the state of some dynamical system from an initial vector to some final location.
