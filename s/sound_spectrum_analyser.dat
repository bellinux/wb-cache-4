40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} was to derive the optimal configuration of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> when used for the exposure assessment around base stations, together with the associated uncertainty and the underlying rationale for the chosen settings. A base-band simulation model for both the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> and the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) communication signals has been developed to investigate the behaviour of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> when used for exposure assessment.

Performance of an axial fan is severely impaired by many factors mostly related to system instabilities due to rotating stall and surge phenomenon experienced during its operation.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} front-end {{research for}} a low-cost <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser.</b> Requirement of the front-end are derived and a topology study is performed, both from an analogue as a digital perspective. Simulations {{are carried out}} to confirm the findings. This master project was initiated by Bruco B. V., and deals with a feasibility study of a low-cost <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> front-end. Market research shows a demand for low-cost spectrum analysis for various applications, where moderate specifications compared to commercial available <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysers</b> can be acceptable. The aim is to design a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> system with a maximum degree of integration, since this provides large cost-savings and a competitive product. The project {{is divided into two}} parts; the analysis and design of an analogue <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> front-end, and the analysis from a digital perspective. For the analogue part, typical spectum analyser specifications are examined and relations and trade-offs between them are derived. This results in a balanced set of requirements. Receiver system architectures are explored and a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> frontend design is presented. The design consists of a frequency conversion, frequency selection and a measurement sub-block. These are further discussed and their effect on the achievable performance is estimated. For the digital part, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of digital processing for spectrum analysis are researched. A design is proposed that combines the best of both worlds; the performance of the analogue front-end and the flexibility of digital signal processing. The design is simulated, using MATLAB for the analogue part, while using a specialised reconfigurable architecture for the digital part; the Montium Tile Processor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> is {{a complex}} piece of instrumentation, which {{requires}} careful operator training to fully exploit its features.

A modern <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> thus offers the user an extensive array of functions and options, arranged in complex menu structures. A side-effect of this situation is that sometimes {{it may be difficult to}} retain a common conceptual view of the instrument operation, since a variety of factors and set-up parameters come into play.

40|$|In this article, {{the hearing}} process is {{considered}} from a system engineering perspective. For those with total hearing loss, a cochlear implant {{is the only}} direct remedy. It first acts as a <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> and then electronically stimulates the neurons in the cochlea {{with a number of}} electrodes. Each electrode carries information on the separate frequency bands (i. e., spectrum) of the original sound signal. The neurons then relay the signals in a parallel manner to the section of the brain where sound signals are processed. Photonic and tactile hearing systems displaying the <b>spectrum</b> of <b>sound</b> are proposed as alternative paths to the section of the brain that processes sound. In view of the plasticity of the brain, which can rewire itself, the following conjectures are offered. After a certain period of training, a person without the ability to hear should be able to decipher the patterns of photonic or tactile displays of the <b>sound</b> <b>spectrum</b> and learn to ‘hear’. This is very similar to the case of a blind person learning to ‘read’ by recognizing the patterns created by the series of bumps as their fingers scan the Braille writing.

40|$|For {{several years}} it has been {{apparent}} that a requirement in radioastronomy is a device capable of providing high time resolution polarization spectra of a wide bandwidth. This thesis describes such an instrument. The new polarimeter spectrometer is based on two surface acoustic wave (SAW) <b>spectrum</b> <b>analysers</b> operating in a coherent (phase preserving) mode. The method of spectrum analysis is a high sensitivity one, the analysers being more akin to filterbank types than to swept-frequency instruments. A wideband analog multiplier has been developed, permitting the <b>spectrum</b> <b>analyser</b> outputs to be correlated directly to yield cross-spectral or polarization data. As well, the usual problem with SAW analysers - the high output data rate - has been overcome {{with the development of}} a fast digital spectrum integrator. This device allows the SAW intermediate-frequency processor to be interfaced to a general purpose computer, resulting in a real-time signal processing system with great versatility. The prototype SAW processor produces polarization spectra over a bandwidth of about 30 MHz with frequency and time resolutions of 650 kHz and 2. 4 uS. When interfaced to a typical computer, Stokes polarization spectra with a time resolution of about 150 uS are available.
