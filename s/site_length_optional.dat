40|$|Background: In {{previous}} work, {{we designed}} a modified aptamer-free SELEX-seq protocol (afSELEX-seq) for {{the discovery of}} transcription factor binding sites. Here, we present original software, TFAST, designed to analyze afSELEX-seq data, validated against our previously generated afSELEX-seq dataset and a model dataset. TFAST is designed with a simple graphical interface (Java) {{so that it can}} be installed and executed without extensive expertise in bioinformatics. TFAST completes analysis within minutes on most personal computers. Methodology: Once afSELEX-seq data are aligned to a target genome, TFAST identifies peaks and, uniquely, compares peak characteristics between cycles. TFAST generates a hierarchical report of graded peaks, their associated genomic sequences, binding <b>site</b> <b>length</b> predictions, and dummy sequences. Principal Findings: Including additional cycles of afSELEX-seq improved TFAST’s ability to selectively identify peaks, leading to 7, 274, 4, 255, and 2, 628 peaks identified in two-, three-, and four-cycle afSELEX-seq. Inter-round analysis by TFAST identified 457 peaks as the strongest candidates for true binding sites. Separating peaks by TFAST into classes of worst, second-best and best candidate peaks revealed a trend of increasing significance (e-values 4. 561012, 2. 9610246, and 1. 2610273) and informational content (11. 0, 11. 9, and 12. 5 bits over 15 bp) of discovered motifs within each respective class.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of urethral lesions. MethodsThirteen CT urethrography examinations on 13 male patients were performed with 4 -MDCT, over a 15 month duration. These patients were clinically examined and a urethral lesion was suspected. The study included recently traumatized patients and patients with suspected urethral lesions. The study was performed by retrograde urethral injection or during micturition after IV contrast injection. 3 D-volume rendering (VR) images and VR-multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) sagittal images and virtual images were done. ResultsOut of the 13 patients, two patients were diagnosed having avulsed prostatic urethra. Nine patients were diagnosed having urethral strictures: two at the bulbous urethra (one of them associated with fistulous stricture), five at the membranous urethra (one of them having associated hypospadias) and two at the prostatic urethra. Two postoperative patients with hypospadias were evaluated, one with glans collection {{and the other with}} urethral stricture. One patient was diagnosed having urethral neoplasm.

40|$|Some studies {{describe}} {{an increased risk}} for emboli in infective endocarditis patients with large (> 10 mm) and mobile vegetations. Other studies fail to demonstrate the above relation. Most studies have been performed using transthoracic echocardiography or with a monoplane transesophageal approach. The present study examines whether distinctive characteristics of vegetative lesions detected by transthoracic and multiplane transesophageal echocardiography are predictive of embolic risk. We reviewed both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms of 57 patients with diagnosis of acute infective endocarditis and no documented or suspected previous embolic events. We evaluated <b>site,</b> <b>length,</b> width, mobility, and echodensity of vegetations. Twenty-five patients (44 %) had embolic events. No statistical differences in age, sex distribution, location of endocarditis, or offending pathogens between embolic (n = 25) and nonembolic (n = 32) patients were found. There were no differences {{in any of the}} echo characteristics of vegetations detected by transthoracic and transesophageal approach in embolic and nonembolic groups. Thus, transthoracic and transesophageal characteristics of vegetations are not helpful in defining embolic risk in patients with infective endocarditi...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate peroral balloon angioplasty of salivary-duct strictures (sialodochoplasty) in chronic sialadenitis, analysing the technique, results and limitations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients underwent sialodochoplasty: seven for Stensen"s-duct strictures and two for Wharton"s-duct strictures. One patient had a double stricture of Stensen"s duct and another a salivary stone {{associated with a}} Wharton"s-duct stricture. All patients were subjected to preliminary sialography to evaluate stricture <b>site,</b> <b>length</b> and grade. Sialodochoplasty was performed after local anaesthesia and progressive dilation of the salivary-duct orifice. RESULTS: The stricture was successfully dilated in 7 / 9 patients. The stricture was unchanged after dilatation in one patient, and in another, it recurred after 13 months. In the patient with a double stricture of Stensen"s duct, one was resolved {{and the other was}} only partially dilated, with significant symptom improvement. One patient developed a new episode of sialadenitis after 3 months, which resolved with medical therapy. Five out of seven patients were asymptomatic at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Sialodochoplasty is an effective procedure in the treatment of salivary-duct strictures, improving symptoms in the majority of patients. The procedure is repeatable and can be proposed as a first-line treatment for symptomatic salivary-duct stricture...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of transcription factor binding sites {{is needed to}} unravel the function and regulation of genes discovered in genome sequencing projects. To evaluate current computer prediction tools, we have begun a systematic study of the sequence-specific DNA-binding of a transcription factor belonging to the CTF/NFI family. Using a systematic collection of rationally designed oligonucleotides combined with an in vitro DNA binding assay, {{we found that the}} sequence specificity of this protein cannot be represented by a simple consensus sequence or weight matrix. For instance, CTF/NFI uses a flexible DNA binding mode that allows for variations of the binding <b>site</b> <b>length.</b> From the experimental data, we derived a novel prediction method using a generalised profile as a binding site predictor. Experimental evaluation of the generalised profile indicated that it accurately predicts the binding affinity of the transcription factor to natural or synthetic DNA sequences. Furthermore, the in vitro measured binding affinities of a subset of oligonucleotides were found to correlate with their transcriptional activities in transfected cells. The combined computational-experimental approach exemplified in this work thus resulted in an accurate prediction method for CTF/NFI binding sites potentially functioning as regulatory regions in vivo...|$|R
