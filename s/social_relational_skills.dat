40|$|Childhood disintegrative {{disorder}} (CDD) {{is a rare}} autistic-like {{clinical condition}} with unknown etiology, in that previously acquired age-appropriate language, social and adaptive abilities deteriorate significantly in 2 - 10 -year-old healthy children, although physical and neurological evaluations display no observable abnormality. Our case is a 22 -year-old female born of a consanguineous marriage, {{with the appearance of}} CDD symptoms in her fifth year of age following normal mental and physical development during her initial four years of life. Without any precipitating factor, she gradually lost her language abilities, <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> <b>skills,</b> affectionate behavior, adaptive capacities, peer play and meaningful interest in her surrounding, friends and family members over a period of 4 years, reaching a plateau in her ninth year of age. The unique special clinical symptom in this case is a seasonal total mutism, which after the beginning of her CDD symptoms is revealing every year covering the spring. As no additional physical or psychological change accompanies her total seasonal speech loss, it cannot be attributed to any mental condition known as having a seasonal pattern. Because in the literature CDD is presented mostly as case reports with lacking of advanced research data, describing any new case is recommended to improve the knowledge about this rare condition, especially if it displays some new unusual signs, not reported till now...|$|E
40|$|Background. Recently a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been given on doctors' work related stress and possibility of improving their quality of life. Several studies report that oncologists are overloaded psychologically. Contact with serious diseases, excessive working pressure, structural weaknesses, are some of the factors that predispose oncologists to stress. In 2008, at the ASPHO annual meeting, pediatric hematologists/oncologists noted burnout (considered as a result of protracted stress at work) was a significant challenge in their lives. To date, no studies have extensively ruled out on protective factors from work stress among pediatric oncologists. Aims. Our research investigates the relationship between Work Stress, Work Engagement and Personal Well-being in a sample of doctors working in Italian hospitals. Specifically, the study investigates whether Organizational Support, Self-efficacy Perceived, adaptive Coping styles and specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> mediate between Work Stress, Personal Well-being and Work Engagement. In addition, it investigates the differences between oncologists, pediatricians and other kind of physician. Materials and Methods. The research included 176 physicians (M= 89; F= 83; MS= 4) working in Italian healthcare units of oncology and onco-haematology; 15 of them work in pediatric unit. Doctors filled self-report questionnaires to evaluate Work Stress and Coping Strategies (Health Professions Stress and Coping Scale), Personal Well-being (General Health Questionnaire), Work Engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) and two purpose-built scales to measure the degree of perceived Organizational Support and the level of specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills.</b> Result [...] It was found negative and significant correlations between the scores of the scales that measure the use of adaptive coping strategies and stress levels. Moreover, physicians who obtained higher levels of specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> reported lower levels of stress. Finally, it was highlighted significant differences between pediatricians and other physicians, especially on the use of adaptive coping strategies. Conclusions.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} physicians' stress and quality-of-life improvement. Due to their relationship with patients, oncologists in particular are overloaded physically, emotionally and psychologically. Previous studies showed that training of communication skills improves the satisfaction and well-being of physicians and patients. Aims: Our research investigates the relationship between work stress and engagement and personal well-being in physicians working in Italian hospitals. Materials and Methods: 176 physicians were included. Doctors filled out self-report questionnaires to evaluate work stress and coping strategies, personal well-being, work engagement and two purpose-built scales to measure the degree of perceived organizational support and the level of specific training of <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills.</b> Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data, as well as correlation analysis (Pearson's r), hierarchical regression analysis (enter step) and analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Result: Positive and significant correlations were found between variables. Moreover, physicians who obtained higher levels of specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> reported lower levels of stress. Oncologists experienced greater stress than other physicians in terms of maladaptive coping and lack of additional training. Conclusions: The study suggests that physicians' well-being is mediated by professional aspects, such as social skills in relationships with patients. M...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recently a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been focused on doctors' work related stress and the possibility of improving their quality of life. Several studies report that healthcare professionals, especially oncologists, are overloaded physically, emotionally and psychologically. They develop a confidential relationship with their patients through close contact and interpersonal communication. Previous studies in the field of healthcare have shown that communication skills training improves the sense of satisfaction and well-being of physicians and patients. Aims: Our research investigates the relationship between Work Stress, Work Engagement and Personal Well-being in a sample of doctors working in Italian hospitals. Specifically, the study investigates some protective factors involved in this relationship. Materials and Methods: The research included 176 physicians working in Italian healthcare units. Doctors filled out self-report questionnaires to evaluate Work Stress and Coping Strategies (Health Professions Stress and Coping Scale), Personal Well-being (General Health Questionnaire), Work Engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) and two purpose-built scales to measure the degree of perceived Organizational Support and the level of specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills.</b> Result: The data seem to confirm our hypothesis. Positive and significant correlations were found between variables observed. Moreover, physicians who obtained higher levels of specific training on <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> reported lower levels of stress. Finally, we examined the differences between oncologists and other specialists: oncologists experienced greater stress (particularly in problematic relationships with patients) than other physicians in terms of maladaptive coping (such as emotional distress), and they lack additional training. Conclusions: The results presented seem to confirm that the well-being of physicians is mediated by typical aspects of the profession, such as social skills in relationships with patients.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{engages with}} debates around conceptualising {{competence}} in sport organisations by analysing club leadership and {{management in the}} Australian Football League (AFL) {{at a time of}} professionalisation. The paper asks: What were considered appropriate activities for newly professionalised AFL clubs and, how was the role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as a competent leader in delivering these activities conceptualised in the clubs? Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 38 senior club managers in the AFL. A thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: The paper finds that perceptions of core activities of clubs expanded with professionalisation, and that the role of the CEO emerged as the outcome of internal organisational contests. CEO competence is not only a set of technical <b>skills,</b> but is <b>social,</b> <b>relational,</b> and “essentially contested” (Good, 1998, p. 205). Research limitations/implications: The qualitative methodology adopted means findings cannot be generalised to other sporting leagues however because all clubs participated they do reflect conceptualisations in the AFL at the time. The findings are suggestive of issues that may be relevant to other sporting competitions. Practical implications: The paper provides evidence that CEOs in sporting organisations should not be appointed only on the basis of technical <b>skills.</b> <b>Social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> are critical to organisational success. Originality/value: This paper enriches understandings of AFL clubs and of CEOs as leaders in sport organisations, and contributes to theoretical debates around the organisational construction of competence...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cochlear-implanted deaf {{children}} having additional disabilities {{may develop}} speech perception and language skills {{at a slower}} pace than their implanted peers without such disorders. Nevertheless, it has been shown that, even for these special cases, cochlear implantation (CI) provides benefits for a larger range of neuropsychological functions including <b>social</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills.</b> These benefits are frequently mentioned by parents, but rarely objectively measured by tests. This article presents a new evaluation tool aimed at assessing the global benefits offered by CI in these special cases. DESIGN: The new tool has been designed as a closed-format questionnaire, divided into five areas. It is based on observing the frequency of preselected behaviors in daily activities, which imply specific social, neuropsychological, and perceptual skills. The questionnaire has been presented to the parents of 50 deaf children with additional disabilities, before and at least 6 months after CI. RESULTS: The data show significant improvements in all investigated areas. However, not all skills improve in the same way, and only those skills related to language and communication correlate positively with time after implantation. The present article further discusses changes in skills for which parents have higher expectations, such as the preferred communication mode, speech intelligibility, and the ability to communicate on the telephone. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire has a simple-to-use format, and it has been proven to be sufficiently sensitive for the detection of changes in each examined area. Because the questionnaire is based on observed behaviors, it can be used even when other existing tests involve tasks that are too complex for these children...|$|R

40|$|Two studies, an {{experimental}} analogue study and a correlational field study, {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s (1) <b>relational</b> <b>skill,</b> (2) legal competence, and (3) the effects of sex of subject on the formation of perceptions and attitudes held by clients about attorneys. The analogue study employed a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. One hundred and twenty-two subjects viewed a simulated, video-taped attorney-client interview in which the attorney possessed either: (a) high <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and high legal competence, or (b) high <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and low legal competence, or (c) low <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and high legal competence, or (d) low <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and low legal competence. Analysis of questionnaires completed by the subjects after viewing the tapes revealed the attorney having high <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and high legal competence {{to be viewed as}} most expert, attractive, trustworthy, likely to satisfy the client, and being recommended and used in the future. The attorney having high <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> and low legal competence was rated second on fourteen of the seventeen measures employed, indicating that <b>relational</b> <b>skill</b> may contribute more to the formation of a client 2 ̆ 7 s perception of his or her attorney than does the level of legal competence. The attorney in the analogue study was female. The results reflect similar findings observed in an earlier parallel study wherein the stimulus sample was a male attorney, indicating that attorney gender is not as influential a factor in the formation of client attitudes as the manipulated attorney behaviors. In the field study a Pearson product-moment correlation was performed on the data derived from the Legal Services Clinic of the University Law School. Forty-seven clients of certified student-attorneys were surveyed following their initial legal interview. Significant correlations were found for every combination between the dependent variables of Expertness, Attractiveness, Trustworthiness and Client Satisfaction. Other significant correlations between specific student-attorney behaviors and positive evaluations by clients are noted. Implications for the structure of legal education for law students and the practicing bar are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Leadership and {{personal}} development are concepts {{that are used}} in different contexts and situations. Leadership has long been a favorite object of research and topic for discussion. My impression is that the focus on developing leaders has expanded into including coworkers and the leader himself as a person. This study will examine the experiences leaders have done in their personal development. Especially focused on their experience with the use of peer-assessment and feedback in this overall process. I have chosen a qualitative approach to examine the experiences they have with their personal development. The analysis of the interviews led to three main categories. These are personal development, impact on personal development and self-perceived value. Experience informants have shared has also been discussed from theories that have a holistic approach to leadership, leadership development {{and personal}} development. I have mainly used the theories of Kegan (1994), Kegan and Lahey (2009) and Joiner and Josephs (2007). I have also integrated theory from authors who have summarized and combined theories in a holistic perspective. The informants described increased awareness both towards themselves and towards others {{as a result of their}} personal development process. This is reflected in a better awareness of their own possibilities and limitations. They also experience improved communication skills and improved ability to give and receive feedback. In addition, they describe a greater confidence in themself as a person and leader. All informants believe that personal development is something that occurs all the time, but with periods of increased effect. Peer assessment is mentioned by all as a feedback forum which has facilitated for and influenced their personal development in a positive way. They feel that <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> are essential as a leader. And through the discussion in this thesis it appears that the personal development of the individual plays an important part in developing these skills...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{leadership}} in architecture hinges on three emergent leadership concepts: teamwork, collaboration, and <b>relational</b> <b>skills.</b> Within all organizations and social systems, and throughout all walks of life, effective teams are the key setting in which things get done. By {{the nature of the}} profession, architects work in teams in creative collaboration with other design professionals, engineering disciplines, specialty consultants, construction trades, owners, developers, and many others. The need for knowledge of collaborative and <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> in bringing value to being part of a team is more important than ever. Learning basic leadership skills early in architecture is necessary for productive teamwork, team collaboration, and managing relationships; and it can provide a core building block for a student’s future personal and professional development. The purpose of this qualitative inquiry encompasses an exploration and record of lived experiences to learn leadership in architecture in scholarly and practical environments. The study discusses leadership opportunities in a learning environment and describes the emergent leadership concepts, the participants’ engaged reactions, and leadership lessons learned. The basic research question is: Are there learning opportunities for architecture students to experience and develop the emergent concepts of teamwork, collaboration, and <b>relational</b> <b>skills?</b> Research findings are built upon the lived experiences of the active participant researcher, field notes and observations, and a review of selected literature. The findings affirm that scholarly and practical learning experiences in architecture are about teamwork, collaboration, and <b>relational</b> <b>skills,</b> and in turn, emerge as leadership experiences. These findings also indicate that there are personal descriptors, academic interventions, and leadership involvements that can significantly contribute to the leadership development of architecture students.

40|$|Sport and {{exercise}} psychology research in disability sport seldom engages with social models of disability. As a result, the socio-historical landscape of disability is underrepresented in sport psychology research. The {{aim of this}} study is to interpret influences on participation in disability sport through the conceptual lens of the <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> model (SRM) of disability (Thomas, 1999, 2004, 2007). Ten Irish adult male athletes with physical disabilities participated in semi-structured interviews exploring the barriers and facilitators that influence participation in Wheelchair Rugby. Deductive thematic analysis produced four themes influenced by the <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> model: impairment effects; societal attitudes and discourse; opportunities and access; and psychological well-being. Links were made to the experience of embodied impairment, classification, oppression, inequality, media, independence, and self-efficacy. The analysis illustrates how cultural constructions of disability are inextricably linked to individual influences on participation in Wheelchair Rugby. The results indicate that in disability sport participation, the experience of social oppression, inequality and cultural stereotypes of disability can be synonymous with the personal experience of physical impairment. The implication of this research is that there is a value in sport {{and exercise}} psychology practitioners utilising the <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> model as a tool to conceptualise the lived experience of physical disability...|$|R

Study 1 investigated whether a relationship exists between the PEAK-G and PEAK-D Training protocols, if the skills mastered through these would generalize to the natural environment, and whether staff would rate these protocols as socially valid. In Study 1, participants included 12 children aged 4 - 5 years, 5 with diagnosed autism, 7 with neuro-typical development, and 6 members of staff. Assessments were conducted with all participants using PEAK-G and PEAK-D Modules; subsequently 5 target <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> from the PEAK-G were taught, followed by a second PEAK-G and PEAK-D assessment. Results showed that following PEAK-G training, children derived target skills in the PEAK-D module that were absent in the first assessment which involved no exposure to PEAK-D training. Mastered PEAK skills were also found to have generalised to the appropriate natural environment. Staff rated these PEAK modules as socially valid and acceptable language training protocols. Study 2 aimed to partially replicate results from Study 1 using a multiple-probe design across behaviours to explore if PEAK-G training would result in related PEAK-D scores being mastered without PEAK-D training. Participants were 4 children aged 4 with diagnosed autism. Baseline conditions involved probes of targeted skills from the PEAK-G and PEAK-D modules. This was followed by PEAK-G training and subsequent tests of related target skills in PEAK-D to determine if learning PEAK-G <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> resulted in acquisition of PEAK-D <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> in similar target areas. Results showed that <b>relational</b> PEAK-D target <b>skills</b> that were absent prior to PEAK-G training were evident for 5 children with autism. Procedural fidelity measures also indicated that high levels of fidelity were maintained by staff over an extended period following training via Behaviour Skills Training.

Current meanings of disability in both disability studies and medical sociology are examined and compared, using selected articles from leading authors in each discipline as case studies. These disciplines are often represented as offering starkly contrasting approaches to disability, with their differences amounting to a disciplinary 'divide'. It is argued that, on closer inspection, common ground can be found between some writers in disability studies and medical sociology. It is suggested that this situation has arisen because, in disability studies, the <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> understanding of disability developed by Vic Finkelstein and Paul Hunt in the 1970 s has been lost over time, overshadowed by the rise to prominence of its offspring: the social model of disability. The paper concludes with some reflections {{on the need to}} revive a <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> understanding of disability...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a reinforcement learning system that transfers <b>relational</b> <b>skills</b> from a previously learned source task to a related target task. The system uses {{inductive logic programming}} to analyze experience in the source task, and transfers rules about when to take actions. The target-task learner accepts these rules through an advice-taking algorithm. Our system also accepts humanprovided advice, which can guide the application of transferred skills and provide instruction about new skills in the target task. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} research is to characterize and assess how social networks enhance and inhibit the governance of marine protected areas (MPAs). Specifically, I examine the structure and function of multiple networks between social actors to better understand {{their role in the}} governance of MPAs, and to address a gap in our understanding of how formal and informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor networks contribute to different MPA outcomes. A focus on the social dimensions of MPAs is critical, as they have emerged as a significant marine conservation and climate change adaptation strategy with substantial implications for coastal communities. The research pursues three specific research objectives: (1) to conceptually develop and illustrate the utility of a <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> network perspective for policy-relevant MPA science; (2) to identify and describe how social networks support and constrain transitions to co-management of small-scale fisheries and MPAs; and (3) to examine how social connectivity among actors affiliated with a MPA network can enhance and inhibit governance fit. Formal and informal social networks have been repeatedly cited as a key attribute of multi-actor governance arrangements (e. g., co-managed MPAs) in the broader natural resource management literature. Similarly, the role of social networks has been identified as one of the research frontiers for policy-relevant MPA science. However, not all networks are structurally equal with research suggesting that different patterns of social relations contribute to different management and governance outcomes. Accordingly, understanding how social networks influence outcomes of MPAs is a key research area that has been understudied. A synthetic review was first conducted to outline the emergence and benefit of applying a structurally explicit, <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> network perspective to inform the establishment and governance of MPAs and MPA networks. This <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> network perspective was then used to gain key insights regarding the role of networks for the governance of MPAs and MPA networks based on two empirical cases in Jamaica. The first was a comparative study focused on three Special Fishery Conservation Areas (SFCAs) – i. e., marine no-take areas – and focused on ties between individual fishermen and wardens. The second case examined the actors associated with the national network of Special Fishery Conservation Areas – of which there are fourteen in total – and thus focused on ties between organizations from across the island that contribute to the governance of the SFCAs. Data were collected via a <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> survey (n = 380), semi-structured interviews (n = 63), an organizational network survey (n = 18), focus groups (n = 10), literature and document review, and participant observations. Social network analysis was coupled with qualitative content analysis to assess how patterns of relational ties and interactions between social actors enhance and inhibit the governance of MPAs. This thesis conceptually develops and empirically illustrates the insights and contributions to be gained from taking a <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> network perspective to examine MPA governance, including how such an approach can be applied at different scales (e. g., community level interactions, organizational interactions) and to understand different aspects and issues (e. g., transitions to co-management, governance fit). The second contribution {{of this study is to}} illustrate the utility of a <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> network perspective to examine and understand key governance attributes previously identified in the literature – specifically community cohesion and leadership. The third contribution of this study concerns the re-orientation of thinking about MPA networks from a purely ecological and biophysical perspective towards a greater emphasis on social connectivity. A re-orientation towards the consideration of social connectivity among actors associated with a MPA network contributed to preliminary insights concerning how the structure and function of governance networks may enhance and inhibit mismatches (i. e., spatial, temporal, functional) that plague individual MPAs. While the findings presented here are based on research in Jamaica, they are germane to a wide range of contexts given the global expansion of MPAs and MPA networks where similar <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> challenges and opportunities are bound to occur...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Social {{relationships}} are central in Asian communities. Despite colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increasing in Asian populations {{the roles of}} social activity in facilitating adjustment and optimizing coping resources in Asian peoples remains largely unknown. We derived and validated among Chinese CRC patients, an instrument assessing <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> quality to enable study of these social processes. Methods: Qualitative interviews (n= 16) generated 22 -items subsequently administered to 166 Chinese CRC survivors. Principal components analyses identified underlying constructs. The draft instrument, plus measures of optimism, affect, physical symptoms, and perceived social support were administered to a second cohort of 234 newly diagnosed Chinese CRC patients. Results: Three factors were extracted (54. 44 % of the total variance) : Family Intimacy (7 items, 33. 08 %), Family Commitment (5 items, 14. 17 %), and Friendships (5 items, 7. 19 %). All subscales were internally consistent (α= 0. 75 - 0. 82), exhibiting concurrent validity in negative correlations with anxiety and depression and positive correlations with physical and psychological well-being. Convergent validity was indicated by significant positive correlations with optimism, and divergent validity by insignificant inverse correlations with physical symptoms and moderate correlations with perceived social support. Hierarchical regressions revealed positive correlations of the three subscales with psychological well-being, controlling for perceived social support (β= 0. 13 - 0. 28). Good criterion validity was indicated. Conclusion: The <b>Social</b> <b>Relational</b> Quality Scale is a psychometrically sound self-report measure of <b>social</b> <b>relational</b> quality among Chinese CRC patients and needs further validation among other Asian groups.
