However, {{there have been no}} reports of reversible dendrite-free high-areal-capacity lithium metal electrodes.

The essence of this strategy, that can drastically improve lithium electrodeposition kinetics by cyclic voltammetry premodulation, lies in the tailoring of the top solid-electrolyte interphase layer in a diluted solvate ionic liquid to facilitate a two-dimensional growth mode.

The abundance and materials life-cycle costs of such batteries may present {{issues in the}} long term with foreseeable large-scale applications. To address the issue of sustainability of electrode materials, a radically different approach from the conventional route has been adopted to develop new organic electrode materials. The oxocarbon salt Li 2 C 6 O 6 is synthesized through potentially low-cost processes free of toxic solvents and by enlisting the use of natural organic sources (CO 2 -harvesting entities). It contains carbonyl groups as redox centres and can electrochemically react with four Li ions per formula unit.

Despite the fact that Li-based systems provide a good energy density, they still suffer from some disadvantages concerning cost and safety issues. To overcome these drawbacks alternative systems are under intensive research. Currently sulfur is one of the most promising cathode materials due to its high energy density of 1672 mAh g− 1, its low cost and environmental friendliness. Magnesium features significant advantages as it is abundant and shows no dendrite formation during cycling, which ensures superior safety. Above all magnesium offers a high theoretical volumetric and gravimetric capacity of 3832 mAh cm− 3 and 2230 mAh g− 1 respectively. Thus the combination of a negative magnesium electrode and a positive sulfur electrode (Mg-S) represents a promising cell technology. Until now Mg-S cells suffer from fast capacity decay in the first few cycles and poor cycle stability. To understand the underlying processes and to identify the origin of the rapid degradation, different approaches regarding the synthesis and characterization of S-C electrodes in Mg 2 +-based electrolyte systems are investigated.

Here we report a method based on bacterial iron biomineralization for the synthesis of alpha-Fe 2 O 3 and its subsequent use as a conversion-based electrode material in Li batteries. This high-yield synthesis approach enlists (1) the room temperature formation of gamma-FeOOH via the use of an anaerobic Fe(o) -oxidizing bacterium Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN 1 and (2) the transformation of these BoFeN 1 /gamma-FeOOH assemblies into an alveolar bacteria-free alpha-Fe 2 O 3 material by a short heat treatment under air. As the y-FeOOH precursor particles are precipitated between the two membranes of the bacterial cell wall (40 nm thick space), the final material consists of highly monodisperse nanometric x 15 nm) and oriented hematite crystals, assembled to form a hollow shell having the same size and shape as the initial bacteria (bacteriomorph). This double level of control (nanometric particle size and particle organization at the micrometric scale) provided powders exhibiting (1) enhanced electrochemical reversibility when fully reacted with Li and (2) an impressive high rate capability when compared to non-textured primary alpha-Fe 2 O 3 particles of similar size.

However, because of lithium’s scarcity, the forthcoming demand for large scale energy storage {{will need to be}} satisfied by systems that use more abundant resources. Sodium ion batteries (NIBs) are a suitable alternative, but for NIBs to compete with LIBs their cycle life and capacity need to be improved.

In this study, the effect of the phosphazene additive FM 2 was examined by varying the additive percentage in relation to carbonate solvent in a NIB system.

After testing alternate electrodes and electrolyte concentrations, a standard cell configuration was developed using a zinc foil anode, graphite rod cathode, and 0. 5 M KOH electrolyte. To recharge the cell, the acid refreshment schema was proposed. In this schema, the ZnO coating that forms on the anode during discharge is dissolved in acid solution, exposing a fresh Zn surface for further discharge. The concept of acid refreshment was proved with HCI but the bulk of testing was done with acetic acid (CH 3 COOH). An assembly of 8 standard cells with two-pronged zinc anodes was tested. One Zn surface was "refreshing" while the other was discharging in the electrolyte at all times. The peak power output of the assembly was 18. 5 m W.

But the state-of-the-art batteries based on current cathode and anode material can hardly {{meet the requirements of}} the large-scale applications due to the limitations on power density and safety characteristics. My research has been dedicated to the development and characterization nano-cathode and nano-anode material for new-generation high power lithium-ion batteries. The selected material candidates for cathode is LiFePO 4 and that for anode is Li 4 Ti 5 O 12. The effective combination of solid-state reaction and hydrothermal method has been used to synthesize both LiFePO 4 cathode and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode because of its low cost and availability of the precursors. The goal for my project is to elucidate the fundamental processes for controllable synthesis of stable LiFePO 4 cathode and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode nanomaterials. The first part of my thesis is the controllable synthesis and performance characterizations of carbon-coated LiFePO 4 nanomaterials. A variety of analytical techniques such as x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, HRTEM), electron diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are applied to investigate LiFePO 4 morphologies and phase structures on the nanometer scale. Well-ordered olivine LiFePO 4 crystal with a homogenous carbon coating of ~ 3 nm thickness is clearly revealed. The state-of-the-art structural characterization techniques provide a comprehensive view of the correlation between structure and performance of these LiFePO 4 cathode nanomaterials. The nanostructures characteristics and the amorphous carbon-coating has been demonstrated to improve the electrical conductivity by reducing the path of both electron transfer and lithium ions diffusion, thereby is beneficial to improve electrochemical performance of these LiFePO 4 nanomaterials. The excellent performance in terms of enhanced rate capability, good cycling performance, and high discharge capacity, should enable the development of high power LiFePO 4 batteries. More importantly, the practical performance of these carbon-coated LiFePO 4 nanomaterials as cathode was performed with a prototype of 18650 -type battery cell manufactured by using the commercial graphite as the anode active materials. The remarkable rate capability and cycling performance are clearly demonstrated in the prototype of LiFePO 4 battery cell. The second part of my thesis is the facile synthesis and performance evaluation of carbon-coated spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 nanomaterials. Spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 has been regarded as an attractive anode material for the development of high-power lithium-ion batteries because of its unique attributes of high safety and rate capability. Carbon-coating has been proved to be an effective method to improve electronic conductivity of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode materials. It is critically important to investigate in depth the influence of the carbon-coating on the electrochemical performance. Comparative nanostructure analyses and various electrochemical testing demonstrated that these Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode nanomaterials have the improved capacitive, high-rate, and enhanced cycling performance. These improved lithium storage properties {{can be attributed to the}} combination of uniform thin carbon-coating and high-purity spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 nanocrystal, which increases electron transport and facilitates lithium-ion insertion/extraction simultaneously throughout the electrode, making it a highly promising anode material for use in the development of high power density lithium-ion batteries. The practical comparison of the carbon-coated Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 nanomaterial and the commercial Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 sample was evaluated in half cells with lithium as the negative electrode. More interestingly, the improved cycling performance is demonstrated in the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 battery cell. Finally, the future outlook of the research directions and key developments of spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode and olivine LiFePO 4 cathode are proposed from view of scientific project and industrial demand.
