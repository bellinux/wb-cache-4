The reducing capacity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated using phosphomolybdenum complex method. The obtained results confirmed that all tested compounds possessed reducing capacity. Callcium channel antagonist and agonist activities of the compounds were additionaly assayed by changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration in H 9 C 2 and A 7 R 5 cell lines. The obtained data confirmed that all synthesized 1, 4 -dihydropyridine derivatives have <b>smouth</b> muscle selective antagonist activities, {{and in the case of}} 4 -phenyl derivative the activity was 4. 7 times higher than that of amlodipine...|$|E

The material was fixed in Carnoi’s fixative, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and stained with 0. 1 % toluidine blue. The light microscopy revealed that most mast cells were located in the propria of urethra, the number and density {{were higher in the}} male animals, comparerd with the same in the female ones. High number of mast cells was observed in the internal longitudinal <b>smouth</b> muscle layer in the feline male pelvic urethra. The mast cells were longest in the circular muscle layer and thickest in the propria. The data were statistically processed (Date Analysis of the StatMost for Windows). From our studies, it could be suggested that mast cells in the connective tissue of feline pelvic urethra participate in the normal tissue status. The results of the investigation showed, that the mast cells ` morphology in the female urethra shows variations and depends on their localization in the both sexes...|$|E

We investigated the role of Notch 1 and 3 receptor signaling in controlling vascular SMC differentiation in vitro, and established a role for cyclic strain induced changes in Notch in mediating this response. The expression of <b>smouth</b> muscle cell specific a-atin, calponin, myosin and smoothdin was examined by immunocytochemistry, Western blot analysis and quantitative real time PCR in human vascular SMC cultured under static conditions following over-expression of constitutively active Notch 1 and 3 receptors. The effect of equibiaxial cyclic strain (10 % 24 h) on the expression of Notch receptors and SMC differentiation was subsequently determined using a Flexercell Tension Plus Unit. Over-expression of constitutively active Notch intracellular receptors (Notch 1 IC and 3 IC) resulted in a significant downregulation of a-actin, calponin, myosin and smoothelin expression, an effect that was significantly attenuated following inhibition of Notch mediated CBF- 1 /RBP-Jk dependent signaling by co+xpressia of RPMS-T-I. Cells cultured under conditions of defined equibiaxial cyclic strain (10 % strain, 60 cycles/min, 24 h) exhibited a significant reduction in Notch 1 and 3 IC expression, concomitant with a significant increase in smooth muscle cell a-actin, calponin, myosin and smoothelin expression. Moreover, this cyclic strain-induced increase in SMC differentiation marker expression was further enhanced following inhibition of CBF- 1 /RBP-Jk dependent signaling with RPMS- 1. These findings suggest that Notch receptors modulate vascular SMC phenotype in vitro and cyclic strain enhances SMC differentiation in part through inhibition of Notch receptor expression. The Notch signaling pathway may therefore represent a novel mechanism for targeting vascular disorders in which SMC phenotypic diversity occurs in vivo...|$|E
