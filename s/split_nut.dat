5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a <b>split</b> <b>nut,</b> whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using split gears, where the split halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the screw. Any spring light enough to allow slide movement at all would allow cutter chatter at best and slide movement at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a machine slide unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|E

40|$|An {{irrigation}} experiment involving pistachio (Pistacia vera cv Kerman on Pistacia terebinthus L. rootstocks) {{was performed}} over a four-year period in central Spain {{to determine the}} effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on nut yield and quality. The growth season was divided into three phenological stages: stage I - from sprouting until the end of rapid nut growth; stage II - from maximum nut size until the beginning of kernel growth; and stage III - from the beginning of kernel growth until harvest. Control trees were irrigated to supply their full water needs throughout the growth season, except for the post-harvest period. Sustained deficit irrigation at 65 % (DI 65) and 50 % (DI 50) of control irrigation was provided to two other groups of trees. The RDI provided to a further group was designed to provide a stress period during stages I and II but no water stress during stage III; the aim was to reduce water use and increase the percentage of split nuts. A fifth group of trees was maintained under rain fed conditions. Water potential and leaf conductance were affected in the DI 65, DI 50 and rain fed treatments mainly during stages II and III, with midday water potentials below - 2. 0  MPa. The RDI trees were only significantly water stressed during stage II, showing midday water potentials of around - 1. 4  MPa. On most days, leaf conductance was not significantly affected in any of the irrigation treatments. The nuts of the DI 65 and DI 50 trees were smaller in diameter and their total yield was reduced compared to the controls. However, no significant differences in kernel dry weight were observed. The RDI trees showed a total yield and percentage of split nuts {{similar to those of the}} controls, even though they received around 20 % less water. The <b>split</b> <b>nut</b> yield showed a linear relationship with crop evapotranspiration. However, since the percentage of split nuts was similar in all treatments this variation was likely related to the total yield. The RDI trees did not show the normal alternate bearing pattern (which was clearly maintained in the control trees). Early splitting, a process that decreases the quality of the yield, was not related to water status but to temperatures lower than 13  °C. The results suggest that P. terebinthus L. rootstocks confer P. vera scions a degree of drought-resistance, reducing the likelihood of water stress and, therefore, allowing more severe RDI scheduling.

40|$|Abstract Pistachio nuts rich in {{nutrients}} is {{a widely}} accepted nut's product in Taiwan. Though high oil content, it can lower cholesterol level in blood due to {{a high percentage of}} poly-unsaturated fatty acid in the oil. Most market pistachio products are made of two raw materials with naturally split and artificially split by two processing methods, boiling and roasting. Different methods and materials result products in different quality and cost. In this study, Iranian pistachio was used to compare the quality of raw materials with naturally and artificially split and of products obtained by boiling and roasting. Furthermore, the effect of storage temperature on shelf life and sensory test for several market products were investigated. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Obvious difference in appearance between naturally and artificially <b>split</b> pistachio <b>nuts</b> were observed. Artificial <b>split</b> <b>nuts</b> showed irregular figure and cracking, and a much smaller kernel. Both nuts were not significantly different in physical, chemical, and nutritional properties. 2. Pistachio nuts were processed to similar water content and water activity by boiling and roasting methods. The product from naturally split pistachio was harder in texture and higher in Hunter a value and b value. This was probably related to maturity and reducing sugar content of the nuts. The acceptance of the product obtained by boiling method was higher than that by roasting method. On economics, it is advantageous to make pistachio products by boiling method with artificially split materials. 3. Storage period for pistachio products show that flavor change began to be sensible at 5 - 6 weeks at 45 ℃, 3 weeks at 55 ℃, and about 10 days at 65 ℃. The quality was still acceptable in the duration. Shelf life could be predicted as 6 months at room temperature. More change in quality was observed for the product by frying method, so that product by boiling showed higher acceptability 4. Water content and water activity for four commercial products were not obviously different. Among the four products, two brands were similar in texture but with higher acceptability. Based on appearance and color, the status of raw materials could be recognized. 中文摘要 開心果是廣受國人喜歡的一種堅果，富含豐富之營養成分，油脂含量雖然相當高，但具高量之多元不飽和脂肪酸，可有效降低血液中之膽固醇。市場上流通的開心果製品有兩種不同加工方式，所用原料也有自然開口及人工開口兩大類，售價上亦有差異。本研究使用伊朗產開心果為原料，比較自然開口及人工開口兩種型式原料，經蒸煮及焙烤兩種加工方式後所得製品之品質，同時探討貯藏溫度對製品風味之影響，並與市售商品進行喜好度比較。 所得結果如下： 1. 自然開口與人工開口原料在外觀上呈示明顯差異，人工開口者裂痕不規則，開口形狀亦較不規則，果仁明顯較小。但兩者之水分、水活性、流變性及一般營養成分無顯著差異。脂肪酸含量中兩者皆以油酸(oleic acid) 最高，亞麻油酸(linoleic acid) 次之。色澤上，人工開口原料偏黃綠色，且具較高之明亮度，此應係人工開口原料尚未至成熟期即採收所致。游離胺基酸中，自然開口原料之麩胺酸含量比人工開口者高，此差異可推論自然開口開心果原料及製品會具有較鮮甜之風味。 2. 兩種原料分別進行蒸煮法及焙烤法加工，蒸煮法為於鹽水中煮沸 5 min 後熱風乾燥；焙烤法為於真空下浸漬鹽水後以較高溫直接焙烤乾燥。兩種原料加工至相同水分及水活性後，自然開口者在質地上較硬，顏色較偏紅黃色，此可能係自然開口原料較成熟，還原糖較高，加熱產生梅納反應所致。焙烤法所得製品在色澤上，人工開口者明亮度明顯較低，其因可能是人工開口者之果仁體積小，平均受熱程度較劇烈所造成。在感官品評上以蒸煮法之接受度較高，而在經濟效益上則以人工開口原料經蒸煮法加工之成本較低。 3. 將製品貯存於 45 ℃、 55 ℃及 65 ℃，發現感官風味開始發生變化之期間為 45 ℃者 5 - 6 週， 55 ℃者 3 週， 65 ℃者約 10 天，唯品質仍屬在可接受之範圍，推論製品在常溫貯存 6 個月後風味接受度方會有變化，其中焙烤法加工製品的變化較大，蒸煮法製品之喜好度普遍高於焙烤法製品。 4. 比較市售四種不同品牌開心果製品中，水分與水活性均無顯著差異，兩品牌之質地接近且喜好度較高。外觀與色澤上一品牌較明亮及偏黃綠色，兩品牌顏色較偏紅黃色，由此可推知其所用原料及加工方式之不同。表次 Ⅴ 圖次 Ⅵ 中文摘要 1 英文摘要 3 壹、前言 5 一、研究目的 5 二、文獻整理 5 (一) 開心果簡介 5 (二) 開心果原料處理 15 (三) 開心果營養價值 22 (四) 食品與水活性的關係 23 (五) 食品油脂氧化之機制 25 (六) 不飽和脂肪酸對人體之影響 26 貳、材料與方法 27 一、實驗設計 27 二、材料 27 三、方法 27 (一) 水分測定 27 (二) 粗脂肪測定 28 (三) 粗蛋白測定 29 (四) 灰份測定 29 (五) 碳水化合物測定 30 (六) 游離胺基酸分析 30 (七) 脂肪酸分析 30 (八) 過氧化價測定 30 (九) 水活性測定 30 (十) 質地分析 31 (十一) 色澤分析 31 (十二) 感官品評 31 (十三) 統計分析 32 (十四) 加速試驗 32 叁、結果與討論 32 一、市售開心果製品之品質概況 32 (一) 標示說明 32 (二) 品質分析 33 二、開心果原料之品質分析 39 (一) 外觀與色澤 39 (二) 水分與水活性 39 (三) 質地分析 39 (四) 營養成分 39 (五) 游離胺基酸 39 (六) 脂肪酸 40 三、加工製程對開心果製品品質之影響 47 (一) 蒸煮法 47 1. 加工流程 47 2. 品質分析 47 (二) 焙烤法 53 1. 加工流程 53 2. 品質分析 53 (三) 原料與製法對製品之綜合比較 58 1. 色澤 58 2. 水分與水活性 58 3. 質地分析 58 4. 感官品評結果 58 5. 經濟效益評估 58 (四) 儲藏溫度對感官品質之影響 60 肆、結論 62 伍、參考文獻 63 表次 表一、世界開心果之主要產地與產量 7 表二、開心果品質分級標準 13 表三、市售開心果之包裝標示 34 表四、市售開心果之營養標示 35 表五、市售開心果製品水分、水活性、POV 37 表六、市售開心果製品質地分析及製品喜好性 38 表七、開心果原料之水分及水活性 42 表八、開心果原料之質地分析 43 表九、開心果原料之營養成分 44 表十、開心果原料之游離胺基酸 45 表十一、開心果原料之脂肪酸 46 表十二、蒸煮法開心果製品之水分及水活性 51 表十三、蒸煮法開心果製品之質地分析及製品喜好性 52 表十四、焙烤法開心果製品之水分及水活性 56 表十五、焙烤法開心果製品之質地分析及製品喜好性 57 表十六、開心果製品綜合之色澤比較 59 表十七、儲藏溫度對感官品質之影響 61 圖次 圖一、 1900 - 2000 年間開心果世界之變化 8 圖二、開心果果樹 10 圖三、開心果果實 11 圖四、開心果外觀 12 圖五、開心果結構圖 14 圖六、開心果之原料加工 16 圖七、開心果之採收 17 圖八、開心果去外皮 18 圖九、開心果原料之乾燥 19 圖十、開心果分級 20 圖十一、開心果包裝 21 圖十二、開心果實驗設計流程圖 28 圖十三、市售開心果之外觀 36 圖十四、開心果原料之外觀與色澤 41 圖十五、蒸煮法開心果製品之加工流程 48 圖十六、蒸煮法開心果乾燥曲線圖 49 圖十七、蒸煮法開心果製品之外觀與色澤 51 圖十八、焙烤法開心果製品之加工流程 54 圖十九、焙烤法開心果製品之外觀與色澤 5...|$|R
