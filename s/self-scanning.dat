40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} new concept of self-optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) and self-OCT angiography. Methods: The operator sits in the patient seat and manipulates the instrument body via the joystick with the dominant hand, while the dominant index is ready to press the capture button and while focusing on the fixation target. One senior ophthalmologist judged various OCT machines for ease of <b>self-scan</b> during a major ophthalmic convention. Separately, <b>self-scans</b> were also captured using a single OCT machine by one senior ophthalmologist and 5 junior optometrists and the scans were analyzed for both centration and image quality value (IQV), and compared to regular scans done by an operator. Results: Ten available OCT machines were tested {{for their ability to}} allow self-OCT. Machines that had one or more features of auto-alignment, auto-focus, and auto-shoot were ideal for self-OCT or self-OCT angiography. <b>Self-scans</b> done by the ophthalmologist (total 27 scans of right eye, mean IQV = 32. 6, and 24 left eyes, mean IQV = 37. 3, done over 9 months) and 5 optometrists (total 24 scans, mean 34. 8 done in one session) were comparable to scans (total 11, mean IQV = 38. 1) done by an operator for image quality. Decentration was very common in <b>self-scans</b> of the macula (37 % right eye and 46 % left eye) versus 0 % for scans of the right eye done by an operator. Conclusions: Self-OCT scans of the macular region can be done with good image quality but are often decentered. Advantages include privacy, potential use by ophthalmic health professionals, airspace station officers, and possible future home self-imaging of macula...|$|R

50|$|Most {{stores have}} self {{checkout}} {{and some have}} self scanning facilities. Self-checkout facilities are small checkout for express (15 items or less) purchases, where customers scan and bag their own groceries, with several self-checkouts monitored over by a single staff member for assistance and to clear any restricted transactions (e.g. alcohol). <b>Self-scanning</b> facilities (Shop n' Go) are where a pre-registered customer scans each item with a hand-held scanner as they put them in their trolley.

When the customer has finished shopping, the scanner is brought to a checkout kiosk, where the information from the barcode scanner is downloaded to the kiosk, usually in conjunction with a customer loyalty card. The customer pays and receives a receipt at the checkout kiosk. The integrity of the system is maintained through the use of random audits or RFID.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the scanning forms of Fourier-transform spectrometers, {{there are a number}} of stationary or <b>self-scanned</b> forms. While the analysis of the interferometric output is similar to that of the typical scanning interferometer, significant differences apply, as shown in the published analyses. Some stationary forms retain the Fellgett multiplex advantage, and their use in the spectral region where detector noise limits apply is similar to the scanning forms of the FTS. In the photon-noise limited region, the application of stationary interferometers is dictated by specific consideration for the spectral region and the application.|$|R

40|$|The {{underlying}} aim of {{this paper}} is to find out how the management and employees in a grocery store on a relatively small community in Sweden is experiencing Technology-Based Self-Service (TBSS), and <b>self-scanning.</b> And how store management and employees experience that the <b>self-scanning</b> ability is received by their respective consumers. Several open individual interviews were conducted with the administrative head of sales and various employees working at different departments at Coop Forum in Skara In offering <b>self-scanning,</b> we believe that the store provides consumers with an opportunity to perform their daily purchases by an easy and flexible approach, which we believe will have a positive impact on the entire store visit. A positive store visit, we believe play a major role in consumers choosing to do their shopping in the store. The issue to be elucidated in this paper is; How do management and employees in a grocery store perceive that <b>self-scanning</b> influence consumers' purchase and the service the shop offers? Why would a supermarket use <b>self-scanning</b> as part of the service they offer to their consumers? The report concludes the similarities and differences experienced by administrative sales manager and employees compared to previous research on the subject. Employees at Coop Forum possessed good knowledge of the subject area, sales manager realized current problems and difficulties, but as Coop Forum is one of many chain stores, the individual opportunities were limited. The idea behind the TBSS and <b>self-scanning</b> includes aspects such as cost savings, improved customer service with wider and better service to consumers...|$|E

40|$|A {{hand-held}} {{scanning device}} that let customers scan their own groceries {{has recently been}} introduced on the market. The aim with this <b>self-scanning</b> system is to develop the grocery shopping procedure, hopefully leading to mutual benefits for customers as well as store-owners.

By carrying out a survey and employing a heuristic evaluation we found that improvements concerning language issues, mapping between buttons and the layout of the hand-held scanning device could be made even though the GUI was easy to understand. This paper describes the evaluation of the user interface belonging to a <b>self-scanning</b> system and suggests improvements as well as new features interconnected with a prototype.

40|$|Food is a {{requirement}} for living, and traded in enormous amounts everyday. The globalization has led to optimization of the supermarkets and {{that a lot of}} stores have introduced <b>self-scanning</b> systems at check out and payment. When articles such as vegetables and fruits are traded the process becomes slower because the packages usually do not wear barcodes, which have to be added manually.
