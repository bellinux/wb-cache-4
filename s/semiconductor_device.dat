25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> {{with four}} layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device.</b> In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E

Because thyristors have breakdown voltages of only a few kilovolts each, HVDC thyristor valves are built using large numbers of thyristors connected in series.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the MOSFET has {{continually}} been scaled down in size; typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres, but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths {{of tens of}} nanometers. Robert Dennard's work on scaling theory was pivotal in recognising that this ongoing reduction was possible. Intel began production of a process featuring a 32nm feature size (with the channel being even shorter) in late 2009. The semiconductor industry maintains a [...] "roadmap", the ITRS, [...] which sets the pace for MOSFET development. Historically, the difficulties with decreasing {{the size of the}} MOSFET have been associated with the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> fabrication process, the need to use very low voltages, and with poorer electrical performance necessitating circuit redesign and innovation (small MOSFETs exhibit higher leakage currents and lower output resistance).|$|E
2500|$|With {{some other}} types of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> such as the insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT), both turn-on and turn-off can be controlled, giving a second degree of freedom. As a result, IGBTs {{can be used to}} make self-commutated converters. In such converters, the polarity of DC voltage is usually fixed and the DC voltage, being smoothed by a large capacitance, can be considered constant. [...] For this reason, an HVDC converter using IGBTs is usually referred to as a voltage-source converter (or voltage-sourced converter). [...] The additional controllability gives many advantages, notably the ability to switch the IGBTs on and off many times per cycle in order to improve the harmonic performance, and the fact that (being self-commutated) the converter no longer relies on synchronous machines in the AC system for its operation. [...] A voltage-sourced converter can therefore feed power to an AC network consisting only of passive loads, something which is impossible with LCC HVDC. Voltage-source converters are also considerably more compact than line-commutated converters (mainly because much less harmonic filtering is needed) and are preferable to line-commutated converters in locations where space is at a premium, for example on offshore platforms.|$|E
2500|$|In electronics, a {{transistor}} is a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>device</b> {{commonly used}} to amplify or switch electronic signals. Because the controlled output power can be {{much larger than the}} controlling input power, the transistor provides amplification of a signal. The transistor is the fundamental building block of all modern electronic devices, and is used in radio, telephone, computer, and other electronic systems. From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT Bell Labs, underwent experimentations and finally observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced whereby the output power was larger than the input. The manager of the Bell Labs semiconductor research group, William Shockley, saw the potential in this and worked {{over the next few months}} greatly expanding the knowledge of semiconductors in order to construct the first point-contact transistor. Shockley is considered by many to be the [...] "father" [...] of the transistor. Hence, in recognition of his work, the transistor is widely, yet not universally acknowledged as the most important invention of the entire 20th century since it forms today's building blocks of processors found and used in almost every modern computing and electronics device. In recognition of their invention of the transistor, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
