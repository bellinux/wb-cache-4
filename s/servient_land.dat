50|$|The House of Lords {{recognised}} that easements {{must always}} be exercised civiliter (without amounting to exclusive possession over the <b>servient</b> <b>land),</b> but the House of Lords displayed a more sympathetic attitude to easements that substantially exclude the servient owner.|$|E
5000|$|Servitudes are {{classified}} {{according to whether}} or not they benefit successive owners. Two types are recognised: praedial servitudes and personal servitudes. Whether a servitude should be classified as a personal or a praedial servitude depends on whether it benefits a particular piece of land or a particular person: If the benefit favours land, then, regardless of the identity of the owner at any given point, successive owners will benefit from the interest in the servient land; if the benefit favours a particular person, then, at best, the benefit will exist for the lifetime of that person. Both praedial and personal servitudes are limited real rights, as they burden ownership, and both may be either positive or negative. Positive servitudes confer on the servitude-holder the entitlement [...] "to enter upon the <b>servient</b> proprietor's <b>land</b> to do something positive," [...] to perform a positive act; negative servitudes restrict the entitlements of the owner of the servient tenement.|$|R
50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an equitable easement will arise. Where both the dominant and servient tenements are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an equitable easement would require registration as a land charge. Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a legal easement and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the dominant tenement has a right in equity only.|$|E
40|$|In larger {{developments}} {{there is}} potential for construction cranes to encroach into the airspace of neighbouring properties. To resolve issues of this nature, a statutory {{right of user}} may be sought under s 180 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld). Section 180 allows the court to impose a statutory right of user on <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> where it is reasonably necessary {{in the interests of}} effective use in any reasonable manner of the dominant land. Such an order will not be made unless the court is satisfied that it is consistent with public interest, the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> can be adequately recompensed for any loss or disadvantage which may be suffered from the imposition and the owner of the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> has refused unreasonably to agree to accept the imposition of that obligation. In applying the statutory provision, a key practical concern for legal advisers will be the basis for assessment of compensation. A recent decision of the Queensland Supreme Court (Douglas J) provides guidance concerning matters relevant to this assessment. The decision is Lang Parade Pty Ltd v Peluso [2005] QSC 112...|$|E
40|$|The present diploma thesis {{studies the}} topic of landed servitude, which {{represents}} one of the forms of restriction of real estate ownership rights. Landed servitudes form part of the real property rights, in particular of the rights in rem to another person's property. This legal institute dates back to Roman law when, like today, it represented a restriction of real estate ownership rights of one property in benefit of a better use of another property. The base of the landed servitudes is twofold: first, there is real estate for whose benefit the servitude is established (the dominant land) and a real estate burdened by an easment for another property (the <b>servient</b> <b>land).</b> Second, the servitudes limit the property rights of one real estate (the <b>servient</b> <b>land)</b> {{for the benefit of the}} owner of the other property (of the dominant land). The institute of servitude is compared between two legislations: Czech, covered by law nž 89 / 2012, and French, contained in the Frech civil code, Code civil.

40|$|Implied {{easements}} {{were initially}} created and then developed in eras when a Torrens or title-by-registration system did not operate. Like all traditional easements, implied easements were legal proprietary interests {{in favour of}} the dominant land which bound the successors in title of the <b>servient</b> <b>land.</b> Implied easements worked particularly well to accommodate the presumed intentions of parties, fill contractual gaps and provide a means of access to landlocked land. However, they operated and still operate outside title-by-registration...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit in gross is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to easements in gross, a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable. A large portion of this essay will be devoted to a consideration of this particular problem...|$|E
40|$|Legislation {{in various}} jurisdictions alters {{the common law}} right to control access to ones land by {{allowing}} the imposition of rights of access in favour of one landowner over the land of another. The relevant legislation {{can be divided into}} two categories. The first-generation legislation (s 88 K, Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and s 180, Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)) permits the creation of easements over <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> to facilitate the development of dominant land. The second-generation legislation (the Access to Neighbouring Land Act of New South Wales, Tasmania and the United Kingdom) permits the creation of temporary rights of access over <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> to facilitate work on dominant land. This thesis examines the extent to which this change in the law can be justified by three modes of ethical discourse: right-based, duty-based, and goal-based reasoning. An examination of the first-generation legislation and the cases in which it has been applied suggests that a form of goal-based reasoning can be used to justify its enactment. The legislation is needed to facilitate the efficient use of land where the existence of a bilateral monopoly and the possibility of strategic bargaining puts at risk the conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement regarding access. A review of the second-generation legislation and the law reform reports and parliamentary debate that preceded its enactment indicates that the legislation can be justified by a form of duty-based reasoning. The legislation is needed to bring about a proper social ordering by imposing access rights where this would be consistent with the ideal of good neighbourliness. The thesis concludes that although these goal-based and duty-based discourses make an arguable case for the enactment of both generations of the legislation, neither of them, in an unadulterated form, provides a conclusive justification. Rather, an eclectic approach that draws on both discourses is required. It proposes that the legislations compensation provisions be amended to reflect the commingling of the ideas of efficiency, a properly ordered society and intensive land use, and to allow the servient owner to share in the benefits generated by the imposition of access...|$|E
40|$|Section 180 of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) makes {{provision}} for an applicant {{to seek a}} statutory right of user over a neighbour’s property where such right of use is reasonably necessary {{in the interests of}} effective use in any reasonable manner of the dominant land. A key issue in an application under s 180 is compensation. Unfortunately, while s 180 expressly contemplates that an order for compensation will include {{provision for}} payment of compensation to the owner of <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> there are certain issues that are less clear. One of these is the basis for determination of the amount of compensation. In this regard, s 180 (4) (a) provides that, in making an order for a statutory right of user, the court: (a) shall, except in special circumstances, include provision for payment by the applicant to such 	person or persons as may be specified in the order of such amount by way of compensation or 	consideration as in the circumstances appears to the court to be just The operation of this statutory provision was considered by de Jersey CJ (as he then was) in Peulen v Agius [2015] QSC 137...|$|E
40|$|The case of Flynn v. New York 2 ̆ 6 c Railway Co., {{decided by}} the Court of Appeals of New York in April last, {{involves}} the right of an owner of land to which is appurtenant a so-called equitable easement, arising under a covenant restricting the use of other land, to compensation upon the taking of the <b>servient</b> <b>land</b> for a public use inconsistent with the restriction. A tract of land was laid out in accordance with a plan, and all, lots therein were sold and conveyed by deeds containing covenants, inter alia, that, 2 ̆ 2 No building or structure for any business purpose whatsoever shall be erected on said premises. 2 ̆ 2 The appellant railway company purchased thirty-eight of these lots from the grantees of the original owner, subject to the restrictions, and built its railway across them, partly on an embankment and partly in a cut. Respondents owned lots in this tract, some adjacent to appellant 2 ̆ 7 s lots, some {{across the street from}} them. The maintenance and operation of the railway rendered respondents 2 ̆ 7 property less valuable than it would be if the appellant 2 ̆ 7 s property were used exclusively for residence purposes. The respondents sued to enjoin the construction and operation of the railway across appellant 2 ̆ 7 s lots. The judgment appealed from restrains the maintenance of appellant 2 ̆ 7 s structures (the railway was completed and in operation before the trial), and the operation of the road, unless appellant pays respondents the certain sums which are assessed as damages, measured by the depreciation in value which their lands sustain, not only by reason of the existence of the appellant 2 ̆ 7 s structures but also by reason of the use to which they are put. (As to the assessment of compensation in the injunction suit, see LEWIS, EMINENT DOMAIN (3 d. Ed.) § 892). This judgment is affirmed by a unanimous court. POUND, J., delivering the opinion,-says, 2 ̆ 2 These restrictive covenants create a property right and make direct and compensational the damages which otherwise would be consequential and non-compensational: No matter how unpleasant a neighbor the railroad may prove, if it takes no property by physical appropriation it is not chargeable with damages for impaired values due only to proximity. But something in the nature of an easement of privacy over another 2 ̆ 7 s land may be acquired by covenant in order that one may live apart from the disagreeable sights and sounds of business, if one desires, and if that right has a value and the railroad subtracts a portion thereof by building on the restricted land, it is difficult to conceive why compensation should not follow. 2 ̆...|$|E
