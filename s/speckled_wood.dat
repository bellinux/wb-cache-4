5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood,</b> Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and alder kitten (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} soldier beetle species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> and tortoiseshell.|$|E
25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; ramsons (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple hairstreak, white-letter hairstreak and <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and stag beetles. Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E

50|$|This site is ecologically diverse {{boulder clay}} woodland, {{with a range}} of wildflowers, {{including}} oxlips and the uncommon green hellebore. There are butterlies such as brimstones, large whites, orange-tips and <b>speckled</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Under careful {{management}} the woodland {{is slowly}} becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes {{wood false brome grass}} and wood spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees {{to add a}} cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on silver birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites so close to the City for some very attractive species such as the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> butterfly.|$|E
5000|$|Friends of <b>Speckled</b> <b>Wood</b> Management Trust petitioned to {{keep the}} entire {{woodland}} undeveloped. Friends of <b>Speckled</b> <b>Wood</b> (FOSWMT) presented this public response to the Hastings Borough Council Cabinet. On 12 November 2012, the Hastings Cabinet Councillors were unable to name the entire area as a Nature Reserve, but did keep [...] "a substantial area of land...as woodland instead of potential housing". The Cabinet Meeting held 5th Nov 2012 also decided that <b>Speckled</b> <b>Wood</b> should become a Local Nature Reserve.|$|E
50|$|The wood is {{a habitat}} to {{a wealth of}} mammals, birds and invertebrates. There is a stream that runs right through the wood. The name <b>Speckled</b> <b>Wood</b> is {{believed}} to have come from the butterflies of the same name that thrive here, the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> (SP1861).|$|E
5000|$|Fifteen {{species of}} {{butterfly}} {{have been recorded}} in this <b>wood,</b> including brimstones, <b>speckled</b> <b>woods</b> and purple hairstreaks. There are many wild cherry trees, and twenty-two seasonal ponds, which have scarce and protected great crested newts.|$|R
50|$|The site is two narrow strips {{on either}} side of the Northampton loop railway line between Northampton and Rugby, with a tunnel {{connecting}} the strips. A stream runs along the north-east boundary. It is acid heathland, which is rare in the county.

50|$|The <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> {{occupies}} {{a diversity of}} grassy, flowery habitats in forest, meadow steppe, forest, woods, and glades. It {{can also be found}} in urban areas alongside hedges, in wooded urban parks, and occasionally in gardens. Within its range the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> typically prefers damp areas. It is generally found in woodland areas throughout much of the Palearctic ecozone. P. a. tircis is found in northern and central Europe, Asia Minor, Syria, Russia, and central Asia, and the P. a. aegeria is found in southwestern Europe and North Africa. Two additional subspecies are found within the British Isles: the Scottish <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> (P. a. oblita) is restricted to Scotland and the its surrounding isles, and the Isles of Scilly <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> (P. a. insula) is found only on the Isles of Scilly. P. a. tricis and P. a. aegeria gradually intergrade into each other.|$|E
5000|$|Distressing (or {{weathered}} look) in {{the decorative}} arts is the activity of making {{a piece of furniture}} or object appear aged and older, giving it a [...] "weathered look", and there are many methods to produce an appearance of age and wear. Distressing is viewed as a refinishing technique although it is the opposite of finishing in a traditional sense. In distressing, the object's finish is intentionally destroyed or manipulated to look less than perfect, such as with sandpaper or paint stripper. For example, the artisan often removes some but not all of the paint, leaving proof of several layers of paint <b>speckled</b> over <b>wood</b> grain underneath. This becomes the [...] "finished" [...] piece.|$|R
50|$|The average {{wingspan}} of {{both males}} and females is 5.1 cm, although males tend to be slightly smaller than females. Furthermore, males possess a row of grayish-brown scent scales of their forewings that is absent in the females. Females have brighter and more distinct markings than males. The subspecies P. a. tircis is brown with pale yellow or cream spots and darker upperwing eyespots. The subspecies P. a. aegeria has a more orange background and the hindwing underside eyespots are reddish brown rather than black or dark gray. The two forms gradually intergrade into each other. Subspecies P. a. oblita is a darker brown, often approaching black with white rather than cream spots. The underside of its hindwings has a marginal pale purple band and a row of conspicuous white spots. The spots of subspecies P. a. insula are a tawny orange rather than a cream color. The underside of the forewings has patches of pale orange, and the underside of the hindwing has a purple-tinged band. Although there is considerable variation with each subspecies, identification of the different subspecies is manageable.The morphology of this butterfly varies as a gradient down its geographic cline from north to south. The northern butterflies in this species have a bigger size, adult body mass, and wing area. These measurements decrease as one moves in a southerly direction in the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood's</b> range. Forewing length on the other hand increases moving in a northerly direction. This {{is due to the fact}} that in the cooler temperatures of the northern part of this butterfly's range, the butterflies need larger forewings for thermoregulation. Finally, the northern butterflies are darker than their southern counterpart, and there is a coloration gradient, down their geographical cline.|$|R

50|$|Both genders of the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> {{butterfly}} exhibit asymmetrical wings; however, only males show directional asymmetry (likely to {{be caused}} by genetic factors). Also, females show more asymmetry in general compared to males. Within male <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> butterflies, the melanic form shows greater directional asymmetry and grows more slowly than the pale, territorial males. Furthermore, males that are most successful in territorial disputes are only slightly asymmetrical, as opposed to complete symmetry or asymmetry; this indicates that sexual selection affects asymmetry.|$|E
50|$|Since most {{females in}} the <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> {{butterfly}} behave monandrously, there is decreased sperm competition, and the male's spermatophore is much smaller relative to other species. The <b>speckled</b> <b>wood</b> males's spermatophore size increases as body mass of the male increases. The spermatophore in the second copulation is significantly smaller in the second copulation, so copulation with a virgin male results in a higher number of larval offspring. Therefore, there is a cost to females associated with mating with a non-virgin male.|$|E
