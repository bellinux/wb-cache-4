40|$|Problem statement: The pan {{evaporation}} coefficient (Kp) is used {{to convert}} pan Evaporation (Ep) to reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) due to its simplicity and suitability for locations with limited availability of meteorological data. Approach: This study presents the use of neuro-genetic approach for estimating Kp for Class A pan and Colorado <b>Sunken</b> <b>pan</b> under green and dry fetch conditions. Results: Representative values were used to represent the category data, i. e., wind run and relative humidity. It {{was found that the}} genetic algorithm helped automatically search for the optimal structure of the back-propagation network, replacing the very tedious trial and error approach. Conclusion: A comparative analysis showed that the neural-genetic approach fairly outperformed previous proposed Kp equations for both green and dry fetch conditions...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Pan Evaporation has {{extensively}} {{been used}} for estimating reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) due to its simplicity, low cost, ease of data interpretation and application and suitability for locations with limited availability of meteorological data. With this method, the pan coefficient (Kp) {{is a key element}} to be determined as well as the pan Evaporation (Ep) data. Approach: This study presents the development of new pan coefficient (Kp) equations for Class A pan and Colorado <b>sunken</b> <b>pan</b> under green and dry fetch conditions by using M 5 model tree based on soft computing technique. The Kp values were taken from FAO- 24 Kp table for the development of Kp equations. Results: The results of the study indicate the usefulness and applicability of the M 5 model tree in developing Kp equations. Those proposed equations based on the M 5 model tree gave better performance in estimating Kp values than the previous Kp equations as well as the new Kp equations developed by indicator regression technique. Conclusion: M 5 model tree gave more accuracy in estimating Kp values. The new proposed Kp equations can be reliably used...|$|E
40|$|The {{complementary}} relationship (CR) of evapotranspiration {{allows the}} estimation of the actual evapotranspiration rate (ETa) of the land surface using only routine meteorological data, which is of great importance in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to its sparse observation network. With the highest in situ automatic climate observation system in a typical semiarid alpine steppe region of the TP, the wind function of Penman was replaced by one based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity theory for calculating the potential evapotranspiration rate (ETp); the Priestley-Taylor coefficient, a, was estimated using observations in wet days; and {{the slope of the}} saturation vapor pressure curve was evaluated at an estimate of the wet surface temperature, provided the latter was smaller than the actual air temperature. A symmetric CR was obtained between the observed daily actual and potential evapotranspiration. Local calibration of the parameter value (in this order) is key to obtaining a symmetric CR: a, wet environment air temperature (Twea), and wind function. Also, present symmetric CR contradicts previous research that used default parameter values for claiming an asymmetric CR in arid and semiarid regions of the TP. The effectiveness of estimating the daily ETa via symmetric CR was greatly improved when local calibrations were implemented. At the same time, an asymmetric CR was found between the observed daily ETa and pan evaporation rates (Epan), both for D 20 aboveground and E 601 B sunken pans. The daily ETa could also be estimated by coupling the Epan of D 20 aboveground and/or E 601 B <b>sunken</b> <b>pan</b> through CR. The former provided good descriptors for observed ETa, while the latter still tended to overestimate it to some extent...|$|E
50|$|The <b>sunken</b> Colorado <b>pan</b> is square, 1 m (3 ft) on a {{side and}} 0.5 m (18 in.) deep and made of {{unpainted}} galvanized iron. As the name suggests, it is buried in the ground to within about 5 cm (2 in.) of its rim. Evaporation from a <b>Sunken</b> Colorado <b>Pan</b> can be compared with a Class A pan using conversion constants. The pan coefficient, on an annual basis, is about 0.8.|$|R

It also puts forward explanations on the causes of rapid loss or gain of fertility, the cyclical variations in heat and light upon the earth.|$|R
