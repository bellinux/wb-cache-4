The political and economic instability caused by war or other factors such as strike action can also prevent the proper functioning of the energy industry in a <b>supplier</b> <b>country.</b> For example, the nationalization of oil in Venezuela has triggered strikes and protests in which Venezuela's oil production rates have yet to recover. Exporters may have political or economic incentive to limit their foreign sales or cause disruptions in the supply chain. Since Venezuela's nationalization of oil, anti-American Hugo Chávez threatened to cut off supplies to the United States more than once.

40|$|I {{develop a}} simple dynamic model of reputation-based {{transactions}} between a buyer {{in one country}} and a supplier in another. I use the model to study {{the impact of a}} more stringent regulation on the buyer optimal purchase volume within an existing buyer-seller partnership. A more stringent standard affects the volume of trade in two intuitive ways: directly, a stricter standard affects the supply of quality goods and indirectly through reputation. I refer to the former effect as the regulation effect, and to the latter as the reputation effect. I show that, whereas most of the empirical literature has so far assumed that more stringent standards would be likely to reduce trade, the net effect is in fact non-monotone, even without taking into account endogenous technological upgrading in the <b>supplier</b> <b>country.</b> It varies with the belief the buyer holds about his seller at the time the change in regulation takes place. For both very low and very high seller's reputation, the reputation effect is negligible vis-à-vis the regulation effect. For intermediate levels of the supplier's reputation, reputation has the power to significantly mitigate the direct negative effect of a more stringent sanitary standard on trade. This result has significant implications for developing countries, for which access to developed countries markets is by and large, said to be disproportionately constrained by stricter standards.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{services}} sector has grown significantly {{in most countries}} {{and in the world}} economy as a whole. This has been observed in the progression from primary to secondary and/or tertiary sector-led economic growth and development. Services contribute significantly to output, employment and exports. They account for about 80 % of the United States output (GDP) and about 65 % of GDP of the European Union. Developed countries are the largest service exporters accounting for over 70 % of services traded in the late 1990 s. Although developing countries account for a relatively small proportion of internationally traded services their exports of services grew more significantly than those of developed countries during the 1990 s. Travel and tourism are the most significant service exports of developing countries. Export of financial services became increasingly significant since the 1990 s. Most Caribbean countries have moved directly from primary-sector-led development to tertiary-sector-led development. Despite this, data collection and accounting methods remained largely biased towards measurement of the goods producing sectors of the economy. This is no doubt {{due to the fact that}} the output of {{services sector}}s is more difficult to measure than that of goods sectors. Part of the problem of measurement has to do with the treatment of services within goods producing sectors. One can determine the contribution of services to output if, for example, a firm manufacturing beverages purchases accounting and transport services from external producers of those services. If, however, the firm in question produces the services in house then those services would be included as manufacturing output. Since services constitute a significant part of production, the total output of services is therefore likely to be underestimated. The contribution of the services sector to growth could therefore be much larger than is officially recorded. Separating the services component from the manufacturing component would help in determining the factors that contribute to the competitiveness of particular industries and products. It would also help in determining the real value of services exports from Caribbean countries. In order to effectively measure or assess the contribution of services to economic growth and development it is useful to know what constitutes a service. A service can be defined as an economic activity that produces a good or product that is intangible or invisible. It can be either a final product or an input into another economic activity. It is therefore best understood in terms of its characteristics. A service, unlike a good, cannot be seen and it has to be consumed at the same time that it is being provided. Services therefore cannot be stockpiled like goods. Economists consider most services non-tradable because they have to be consumed where they are produced and therefore lack mobility. However, technological development and the process of trade liberalisation that has intensified since the 1990 s, especially since the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), have facilitated international trade in most services. Nevertheless, the mode of delivery determines the tradability of services. If trade in services is defined only in terms of cross-border supply, that is from <b>supplier</b> <b>country</b> to consumer country, then most services would still be considered non-tradable. In addition to cross-border supply, services can be traded through the movement of the consumer to the <b>supplier</b> <b>country</b> (tourism); through the establishment by the service provider of a firm in the consumer country (bank branch); and through the movement of individual providers (persons) to the consumer country. Trade in services therefore depends on two critical features of economic integration - the movement of capital and the movement of labour. The pace of liberalisation of these movements will determine the growth of international trade in services...|$|E
40|$|A predominância de um único país fornecedor em toda a cadeia de abastecimento acarreta consigo certos riscos de dependência. A transferência e {{outsourcing}} de produção para países asiáticos, nomeadamente a China, é o quotidiano da maioria das empresas na indústria de fast-fashion em fashion retail. A redução de custos de produção, incluindo o de mão-de-obra, a possibilidade de produção em grande escala e a rede de infra-estruturas já preparada para grandes cargas no transporte marítimo, parecem ser as principais vantagens de deslocalizar fornecedores. Mas com a ascensão económica e social da China, a competitividade em custos de produção parece estar a desvanecer-se e novos países fornecedores surgem neste panorama, como a Índia. Até que ponto terá impacto a introdução de novos fornecedores, e de um novo país fornecedor? Os {{lead times}} são cruciais para este tipo de setor, dependendo daí o sucesso ou fracasso das organizações nesta indústria: o consumidor quer um produto trendy nas lojas o mais rápido e com a maior rotatividade possível. A gestão de uma cadeia tão volátil como as que atuam neste tipo de mercado é um processo complexo e difícil de gerir. A expansão internacional de uma marca pode ainda aumentar esta incerteza de comportamentos do consumidor, sendo tão distintos por zona de influência. Os tempos de trânsito constituem ainda um dos maiores entraves quando se procura uma redução eficiente de lead times. O transporte marítimo é o meio mais utilizado, pelo benefício de custo competitivo e de suporte de carga transportável, no entanto é um dos mais morosos meios de transporte. A aposta em avião de carga poderá ser feita, embora o seu custo por volume transportado seja geralmente mais elevado. Contudo, a pronta resposta seria facilmente atingida. Em ambos os casos são necessários trade-offs, quer em benefício da rapidez e prontidão de resposta (avião), quer em benefício de uma maior eficiência de custos (barco). A metodologia de Investigação-ação irá ajudar a compreender melhor qual o caminho mais viável a seguir, quer em escolha de fornecedores, gestão eficiente de tempos de trânsito e, consequentemente, meios de transporte. Todos estes enclaves de uma otimização de lead times. The predominance {{of having a}} single supplier in a supply chain may bring {{a certain amount of}} risks, especially with dependency. Transferring and outsourcing the production to mainly Asian countries, specially China, it’s the regular rule in most companies in fast fashion and fashion retail industry. The reduction of production costs, including labor, the possibility of large scale production and the great infrastructure net already prepared for large loads in maritime transportation, seem to be the primary advantages of relocating suppliers. But with the economic and social development in China the competitive edge in production costs seems to be vanishing and new supplier countries appear in this context, such as India. Which should be the result of acquiring new suppliers in a new <b>supplier</b> <b>country?</b> The lead time is crucial for this type of industry, depending on that {{the success or failure of}} companies in these types of market: the consumer wants a trendy product in stores as soon as possible and with a major turnover. The management of a supply chain this volatile as the market in which it competes can be complex to keep agile. The international expansion of a brand can even increase the uncertainty of consumer’s behavior, being so different by influence area. The transit time is one of the main barriers for an efficient lead time management: the maritime transportation is the most used one, whether for the advantages in competitive costs and the volume for large orders and quantities, although it’s one of the most slow transpor tation means. Improving shipping orders by plain can be made, but its transportation costs in volume can be generally higher than these companies usually tend to pay in a more efficient way. However, responsiveness would be rapidly achieved. In both cases tradeoffs are needed, whether tending to a more responsive and rapid approach (plain), or tending to an efficient cost process approach (boat). The methodology of Investigation-action will help to understand better which way is more viable to follow, in the choice of suppliers, efficient transit time management and, hence, transportation means. All of them pillars of an optimization in lead time...|$|E
