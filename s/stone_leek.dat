40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that female lifespan and egg production in some dipteran species decrease as an increasing function of the body size of their mates. The purpose of our study was to determine whether females of the <b>stone</b> <b>leek</b> leafminer Liriomyza chinensis were harmed by their mates through copulation. We tested the effects of male size on female longevity, feeding and fecundity by mating small, middle and large males to medium-sized females. Females mated wlth larger males had no sig-nificant lower lifetime feeding and fecundity. Also male size had no significant effect on female longevity. Small males lived shorter than large males did. Our results indicate that male size does not affect female fitness. Meanwhile small males had a lower reproductive success because of a decreased chance of fmding their mates...|$|E
40|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>leek</b> leafminer, Liriomyza chinensis (Kato), {{has become}} a serious pest on onioncrops in the whole Vietnam, and it is treated by {{a wide range of}} {{conventional}} insecticides. Growers apply insecticides early after a few mines on several leaves have been seen, and repeated applications are usually made. Field trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of a single application of four currently and potentially used insecticides on L. chinensis. These insecticides were applied at recommended field rates. Leaf samples were used to monitor larval population, and yellow sticky traps were used to monitor adult population. Cyromazine was effective on the larvae, but no effective on the adults. Cartap, permethrin and phenthoate were not or less effective on neither larvae nor adults of the leafminer. These results suggest that cyromazine application provide one potential component of an effective L. chinensis control strategy for Vietnamese onion farmers...|$|E

Its biology on L. chinensis was studied in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 25 ℃ and a photoperiod of 16 L: 8 D. Total developmental time from egg to adult emergence was 12. 1 and 12. 2 days for males and females, respectively. Pupal development lasted slightly shorter than the combined egg and larval stages. The females laid a mean of 60. 1 eggs and caused other 36. 4 host larvae died during an average lifespan of 20. 1 days. Fecundity peaked at age 3 days.

40|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>leek</b> leafminer, Liriomyza chnensis (Kato), {{has become}} a serious pest on Allium spp. In several Asian countries. However, {{knowledge}} concerning the biology of L. chinensis, which affect development of control programs, is still limited. The biology of the leafminer on onion was investigated at a constant temperature of 25 ℃ and photoperid of 16 L: 8 D. To distinguish different larval instars, some morphological characteristics such as the length of mouth hooks and cephalopharyngeal skelton, body and mine were measured. The length of mouth hokks and cephalopharyngeal skelton of first, second and third instars were 0. 021 mm and 0. 089 mm, 0. 054 mm and 0. 165 mm, and 0. 092 mm and 0. 261 mm, respectively. Developmental time for the immature stages was 22. 6 days; pupal development lasted slightly longer than the combined egg and larval stages. The females laid a mean of 108 eggs and fed on 1013. 9 punctures during an average lifespan of 9 days, Feeding and fecundity peaked at age 5 days.

40|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>leek</b> leafminer, Liriomyza chnensis (Kato), {{has become}} a serious pest on onion in the whole Vietnam, and it was {{controlled}} by {{a wide range of}} conventional insecticides. Because there is no recommendation on insecticide application, growers continue to use whatever is available without considering the effectiveness. The susceptibility of larva and adult L. chinensis to several insecticides currently and potentially used for the management of leafminers was investigated in the laboratory. Among 10 insecticides available in Vietnam, dimethoate, phenthoate, permethrim, and cartap were highly or moderately effective on either larvae or adults of L. chinensis, but ethofenprox was ineffective. Of the seven insecticides labeled for leafminer control in Japan, crymazine, emamectin benzoate, cartap, and spinosad were highly effective, but thiamethoxam, flufenoxuron, and chlothianidin were less or no effective on L. chinensis at their field recommended dilutions. While dimethoate was effective on both the larvae and adults, cyromazine was only highly effective on the larvae and spinosad, and phenthoate were only found highly effective on the adults. There results suggest that dimethoate, cyromazine, spinosad,phenthoate, and cartap can be rotationally used for L. chinensis control...|$|E
40|$|Liriomyza chinensis {{is a major}} pest of Welsh onion Allium fistulosum in Asia {{but little}} is known about the {{abundance}} of its natural enemies. A field survey was made to explore the major parasitoids of L. chinensis leaf miner in central Vietnam. An eulophid parasitoid, Neochrysocharis okazakii, comprised more than 95 % of parasitoids reared from leaf miner larvae collected in the onion field and 98. 3 % of leaf miner parasitoids found during searches of onion plants. The mean number of female N. okazakii on plants was greater in onion fields with a higher density of L. chinensis, and, during searches, a greater proportion of N. okazakii was found on onion with more L. chinensis mines, suggesting density-dependent parasitoid aggregation. Melanized dead larvae of L. chinensis were more frequently found in onion fields with more parasitoids, demonstrating that melanized leaf miners are a good indicator of parasitoid activity. Mean instant rate of host encounter by N. okazakii in the field was estimated at 0. 077, and the likelihood of a parasitoid finding a host increased with host density. Taken together, these results show that N. okazakii is the major parasitoid of L. chinensis. Usefulness of this parasitoid in <b>stone</b> <b>leek</b> leaf miner management is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Green {{bunching}} onion (or Welsh onion) Allium fistulosum {{is traditionally}} an important vegetable in Vietnam. The {{present study was}} undertaken to survey {{the current status of}} insect pests on green bunching onion in the country. Survey was conducted in conventional fields in central and southern Vietnam. The most widespread pest was <b>Stone</b> <b>leek</b> leafminer Liriomyza chinensis, which occurred all lowland sites investigated except Da Lat, a highland site in central Vietnam. Although insecticides were intensively applied, the percentage of the occurrence in green onion fields was 100 % in Bien Hoa, Hue, Huong An, and Quang Nam. In Dalat, L. huidobrensis instead was widely found in Allium fistulosum and A. cepa. Serious infestation by lepidopterans often occurred, and the main species was beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua, which was widely found in lowland areas. Infestation by S. exigua was heavier in summer than in spring. Damage by S. litura was observed in all localities. Helicoverpa armigra infested green bunching onion in Hue though it was rare. Thrips were rather a minor pest though it was abundant in Quang Nam. No pest aphids were confirmed. Taken together, management of leafminer and lepidopteran pests is crucial to stable production of marketable green bunching onions. Current problems associated with insect pest control in Vietnam are discussed, and the importance of IPM practices is emphasized. A series of color photographs of pests and the damage they can cause are presented to facilitate identification of the pest...|$|E
