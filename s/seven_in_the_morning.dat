5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to avoid {{the worst of the}} heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E

25|$|At <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> the Kandyans appeared, {{covering}} the slopes {{that lined the}} Danture tract. They waited for the Portuguese to come within range, then opened fire with muskets, gingals and arrows. The brunt of the attack fell on the advance guard; its commander, D. Gastão Coutinho, and several captains including Simão Pereira and Francisco de Brito were killed. This attack slowed the retreat, and the columns came to a halt. The forest concealed the Kandyans, {{who were able to}} cause casualties while remaining largely unseen. So the Portuguese decided to charge the enemy in front of them, in order to clear a path.|$|E

25|$|While {{the control}} of the {{railroad}} included control of Vanderbilt's ferry, the North Shore Ferry was leased separately and was operated by John H. Starin. His lease was set to expire on May 1, 1884. On July 18, 1884, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company outbid Starin for the North Shore operation. As part of the purchase, ferry service would have been operated every forty minutes instead of an hour. The fare for the railroad and the ferry would have been ten cents, except between the hours of five and <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and between five and seven in the evening when the fare would have been seven cents. Mr. Starin continued to fight the lease in the courts for several years.|$|E

After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{disappeared}} on 1 February 1995, on the {{day when}} he and James Dean Bradfield were due to fly to the US on a promotional tour.

He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, at <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station. On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the £68 fare in cash.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth {{was taken}} on 26January {{to the house}} of Jane Armstrong, {{sleeping}} there in a hammock. [...] The continued noises strengthened the resolve of the ghost's supporters, while the press's ceaseless reporting of the case continued. [...] Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, announced that with the Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke and Lord Hertford, he was to visit Cock Lane on 30January. [...] After struggling through the throngs of interested visitors though, he was ultimately disappointed; the Public Advertiser observed that [...] "the noise is now generally deferred till <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> it being necessary to vary the time, that the imposition may be the better carried on".|$|E
500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Southwark, London, on 23 February 1826, to Henry and Mary Evans. He {{attended}} school in Jamaica Row, where he enjoyed mathematics but wished he had learned Latin.

However, he was reassigned as a general errand boy because his stutter interfered with his duties. The hours were long—from <b>seven</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> until nine or ten at night—but the printmaking process itself, and the books produced by the establishment, fascinated Evans. Bentley soon realized the boy was talented after seeing his early attempts at scratching illustrations on slate, and arranged for Evans to begin an apprenticeship with wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells.|$|E

2500|$|On television, Lagasse {{is known}} for his light and jovial hosting style as well as several catchphrases, {{including}} [...] "Bam!".

The interjection soon proved a hit with viewers. [...] "Kick it up a notch", [...] "Aw, yeah, babe" [...] and [...] "Feel the love", are usually said before or after adding something spicy to a dish, or after the reaction to adding something. When frying or making dishes like sausage, Lagasse advocated using genuine lard, boasting, [...] "Pork fat rules!"
