25|$|Monorail means {{a system}} of guided transit {{vehicles}} operating on or suspended from a single rail, beam, or tube. Usually they operate in trains. Monorails are distinguished from other types of elevated rail system by their use of only a <b>single</b> <b>beam,</b> and from light rail and tram systems by the fact they are always grade separated from other vehicles and pedestrians.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{to salvage}} Pasha Bulker used anchors laid out at sea, which {{the ship was}} to use to then winch itself seawards, and three tug boats towing it {{with the aim of}} {{dragging}} the bow over a rock reef. The carrier would then be pulled seaward in a path between two rocky reefs. A hydrographic survey was conducted to survey and map {{the bottom of the ocean}} through the surf zone using a surf ski <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> echo sounder and GPS. This gave the salvage team more insight into the direction for refloating the ship.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of three arch bridges all steel bridges consisted of very simple, straight, <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> truss constructions. These had to be reinforced already before 1914 still during steam operation of the Gotthardbahn due to quickly increasing traffic and load. Fish-belly truss structures were attached to the bridges from below where possible and an arch truss structure was added from the top, where a short clear height made this necessary, besides other measures. Eventually all original iron bridges had to be replaced with modern bridges {{because they had been}} built and were repeatedly reinforced to specifications that again and again were surpassed by increasing traffic, velocity and load.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{completed}} in 2008 and the experiment detected its first <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> events on 10 September of that year. Data taking was then interrupted {{for over a year}} due to an LHC magnet quench incident. On 23 November 2009, the first proton-proton collisions occurred at the LHC, at a relatively low injection energy of 450GeV per beam. These collisions were successfully registered in ATLAS, which has been logging data ever since. All the while LHC energy has been increasing: 900GeV per beam at the end of 2009, 3,500GeV for the whole of 2010 and 2011, then 4,000GeV per beam in 2012. After a Long Shutdown in 2013 and 2014, in 2015 ATLAS saw 6,500 GeV per beam.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinguishable}} {{differences between}} the EMD models and the Canadian GMD-built models. Most notable are the headlight configurations. The biggest giveaway is the rear light. GMD SD40-2s have a <b>single</b> <b>beam,</b> where EMD has twin-beam styled lights, usually placed next to each other. GMD models also have lights mounted on the nose, and EMD is above the cab between the numberboards. Some EMD variations have a nose headlight, although the headlight style and placement usually isn't the same as seen on the GMDs. Other features on the GMD models include the bell mounted above the cab between the numbers, triple-style classification lights above the numbers(since trains don't use classlights anymore, many locomotives have had them removed), and no numberboards on the back.|$|E
40|$|Process for the {{production}} of high power and high quality laser radiation, in particular for high- performance solid state lasers by which the radiation of several <b>single</b> <b>beams</b> (2 a to 2 c) generated in non-consecutive ray path sections (1 a to 1 c) is concentrated in a collecting device (3) to form a <b>single</b> output <b>beam</b> (4). In order to obtain that the beam quality of the high-performance output beam resulting from the individual beams is equal to the beam quality of the individual beams, the process involves the operation of a first laser device (5 a) during a first period of time (t<-a), the operation of second laser device (5 b) during a second period of time following the first period of time (t<-b)) and that the operating times (t<-a, t<-b) of the two laser devices (5 a, 5 b) or at least a further laser device (5 c) alternate cyclically to obtain a temporally uninterrupted output beam (4), and that the resulting <b>single</b> <b>beams</b> (2 a to 2 c) occurring chronologically are concentrated in the same axis by the collecting device (3) ...|$|R

25|$|Conventional {{external}} beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) is delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays. 2DXRT mainly {{consists of a}} <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. Conventional refers {{to the way the}} treatment is planned or simulated on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired plan. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning {{to such an extent that}} tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.|$|E
500|$|Under some conditions, {{an energy}} {{transition}} can be excited by [...] "two" [...] photons that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy {{only in the}} spectrum [...] where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made {{much smaller than the}} excitation volume of a <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> (see two-photon excitation microscopy). Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.|$|E
500|$|Typically (see Fig.1, the {{well-known}} Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be {{split into two}} identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). [...] Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, {{the difference in the}} distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.|$|E

2500|$|H/SJD-1 sonar is an indigenously {{developed}} bow mounted sonar, {{first of}} its kind in China. [...] Initial proposal of adopting Soviet Tamir-11(MG-11, NATO reporting name Stag Hoof) search light sonar was rejected, because it was not considered adequate enough due to its <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> search capability, which means the low speed of search cycle would easily lose targets. A more capable indigenous Chinese sonar was ordered to be developed, with Mr. Huo Guozheng (霍国正) named as the general designer. The resulting indigenous Chinese domestic sonar was SJD-1 low frequency (LF), high power, large aperture sonar with a cylindrical array (designated as Type 601 sonar array), which was accepted into service after eleven major trials at the sea. Type 601 sonar array of SJD-1 sonar has a diameter of 2 meters, height of 1 meter and weight of 4 tons, and the range is in excess of 6 nautical miles (nm), more than twice the range of Soviet Tamir/MG-11 search light sonar originally proposed. SJD-1 sonar was jointly developed by 706th Research Institute, 726th & 461th Factories, and it is the first bow mounted sonar adopted by Chinese navy. SJD-1 is frequently confused with its successor SJD-2, more commonly referred as SJD-II, whose design started in the 1970s, but was not completed until the 1980s due to major redesign. SJD-1 sonar was installed on Luda class destroyers and subsequently upgraded to SJD-2 in the 1980s.|$|E
