5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|In Greek Mythology, Canis Major {{represented}} the dog Laelaps, {{a gift from}} Zeus to Europa; or sometimes the hound of Procris, Diana's nymph; or the one given by Aurora to Cephalus, so famed for its <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs, pursuing Lepus the Hare or helping Orion fight Taurus the Bull; and is referred to in this way by Aratos, Homer and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks refer only to one dog, but by Roman times, Canis Minor appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 Alfonsine tables.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1936, the Canadiens re-hired Cecil Hart to be {{the coach of the}} team. Hart agreed to the job on one condition: that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team. On September 1, 1936, Morenz once again joined the Canadiens, his {{contract}} being purchased by the team from the Rangers. The Canadiens spent most of the 1936–37 season {{as one of the best}} teams in the NHL; Morenz contributed regularly, occasionally showing the <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> had made him notable at the start of his career. By mid-January, he had 4 goals and 20 points, far better totals than previous years.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk. IV in July 1940 {{improved}} matters, {{but it was the}} delivery of the Bristol Beaufighter starting in August that produced a truly effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E

5|$|The car speeds {{over the}} French {{countryside}} {{and into the}} Alps, leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes. At the gates of Dijon, town officials {{try to stop the}} car to enforce the octroi tax, but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials, who explodes in his turn. The car wends its way across the Mediterranean coast, overturning a fruit stand, crashing through a greenhouse, colliding with a tar wagon (with another explosion ensuing), and, finally, arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo. The car is now going at such <b>speed</b> <b>that,</b> rather than stopping in front of the grandstand, it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth. The King and chauffeur, unharmed by their adventurous race, are greeted warmly.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design with the <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> {{allowed it to}} fly past most defences. Just as importantly, the design's long, straight wing gave it the lift needed to operate at very high altitudes, placing it above the range where even jet powered fighters were able to operate. The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity, a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions, spawning a number of spin-off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range.|$|E

5|$|Under Patton, the Third Army {{landed in}} Normandy during July 1944 and {{would go on}} to play an {{integral}} role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise Pocket in mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December, a feat {{regarded as one of the}} most notable achievements in the war. The rapid offensive action and <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> Patton called for in the speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells <b>Speed</b> <b>that</b> Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Children of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls a main character, chosen from one of four options. Each of the characters have different ratings from one to five in four areas: the damage they do with magic, the <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> they can attack, {{and the amount of}} health and mana they have. The game plays out nearly identically regardless of which character is chosen, except for a few quests specific to each character. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, the main character typically has no companions during the game; however, a cooperative multiplayer option is present for up to four players, who all appear on each player's screens. This multiplayer mode is only present with local WiFi, and progress is only saved on the host player's game.|$|E

5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high <b>speed,</b> <b>that</b> the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

25|$|Three of {{the four}} probes have tiny heating {{elements}} and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring {{the rate at which}} the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the heat pulse arrives. The <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> the heat travels away from the probe as well as the <b>speed</b> <b>that</b> it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E

40|$|The {{speed of}} a moving object is a {{critical}} variable that factors into actions such as crossing a street and catching a ball. However, {{it is not clear}} when the ability to discriminate between different speeds develops. Here, we investigated speed discrimination in 6 - and 10 -month-old infants using a habituation paradigm showing infants events of a ball rolling at different speeds. The 6 -month-olds looked longer at novel <b>speeds</b> <b>that</b> differed by a 1 : 2 ratio than at the familiar ones but showed no difference in looking time to <b>speeds</b> <b>that</b> differed by a 2 : 3 ratio. In contrast, the 10 -month-olds succeeded at discriminating a 2 : 3 ratio. For both age groups, discrimination was modulated by the ratio between novel and familiar <b>speeds,</b> suggesting <b>that</b> <b>speed</b> discrimination is subject to Weber's law. These findings show striking parallels to previous results in infants' discrimination of duration, size, and number and suggest a shared system for processing different magnitudes...|$|R
