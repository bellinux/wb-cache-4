5|$|In Mahoning County, {{the route}} {{becomes part of}} the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes {{concurrent}} with I-80 few miles later. Here, most of the route is surrounded by urban areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 <b>split</b> <b>at</b> the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing.|$|E
5|$|Not far to {{the east}} of this junction, NY5 and NY92 meet I-481 by way of a {{cloverleaf}} interchange. East of the interchange, Genesee Street widens to six lanes (three in each direction) as it heads along a commercial strip anchored by a large plaza featuring a Wegmans Food Markets store. NY5 and NY92 <b>split</b> <b>at</b> the east end of the strip in the hamlet of Lyndon. While NY5 continues east along Genesee Street to Fayetteville, NY92 heads southeast along the two-lane Highbridge Road and bypasses Fayetteville to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal <b>split</b> <b>at</b> this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E
5|$|Early {{plans for}} the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same {{alignment}} as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel to MN13, which cut northeast to Saint Paul from old US65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton {{and then to the}} present day I-35E–I-35W <b>split</b> <b>at</b> Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US8 had joined US61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the county's road committee, led by Øverland, sent an {{official}} {{request to the}} railway committee, asking for details about their plans, so the appropriate roads could be planned. This spurred the committees work and a cooperation with Nordland County Council was initiated to increase the projects priority by national politicians. On 2 March 1896, with 87 against 27 votes, Parliament passed legislation approving a railway from Hell to Sunnan. Costs were estimated at 8.75 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 15 percent was to be financed with local grants and the remainder by the state. Construction was scheduled to take 15 years. The decision initially called for the railway {{to be built in}} two stages, with the <b>split</b> <b>at</b> Rinnan in Levanger—the site of the military camp Rinnleiret. Final approval of construction was made by Parliament on 11 June 1898.|$|E

5|$|Officially, NY18F {{begins at}} {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston at an {{interchange}} between NY104 and the Niagara Scenic Parkway. Signage for NY18F, however, exists as far south as the interchange between NY104 and NY18 south of the village. According to signage, NY18F is concurrent to NY104 from NY18 north to the interchange between NY104 and the Moses Parkway, where NY18F and NY104 <b>split</b> <b>at</b> the western extent of the interchange. The Seaway Trail, routed along NY104 from Niagara Falls north to Lewiston, follows NY18F west into Lewiston along the path of Ridge Road, here named Center Street. At 4th Street, NY18F turns northward, following 4th Street for four blocks to Oneida Street. NY18F cuts west on Oneida for two blocks before continuing northward out of the village on 2nd Street.|$|E
5|$|Past Route 3, {{the highway}} narrows to four lanes, {{continuing}} east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on it, though many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US 46 has an exit for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street {{before coming to}} a large interchange with Route 19/CR 509 and the Garden State Parkway. After this, the road passes over the New Jersey Transit Main Line and has an exit for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. After the exit, US 46 begins a brief concurrence with Piaget Avenue in Clifton {{with a series of}} connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads <b>split</b> <b>at</b> a fork, marked as an exit, with US 46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right. Vehicles traveling west on Piaget Avenue have access to US 46 West through use of a one way underpass that carries US 46 East over it, and also have access to US 46 East by a right-turn only lane near the intersection of Piaget Avenue and Fourth Street.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} urban {{routes of}} the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955, including a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) {{began at the}} interchange of US 101 north of downtown San Jose and followed the Nimitz Freeway (SR 17/Route 69, now I-880) to the <b>split</b> <b>at</b> Warm Springs (the present location of SR 262), SR 21 to Benicia, and Route 74 (no sign route number) to I-80 in Vallejo. The first piece of I-680 freeway built, other than the pre-existing Nimitz Freeway, was in the late 1950s, along the SR 24 overlap between North Main Street in Walnut Creek and Monument Boulevard in Pleasant Hill. A southerly extension, bypassing downtown Walnut Creek to South Main Street, opened on March 22, 1960, connecting with the SR 24 freeway to Oakland. In the next decade, the freeway was completed from Vallejo south to SR 238 at Mission San Jose, and the roadway north from Benicia to Fairfield, which became the only remaining piece of SR 21, was also upgraded to freeway standards.|$|E

5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in the vein of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is <b>split</b> <b>at</b> the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{concurrent}} US 9 and Route 35 head northwest on a four-lane {{divided highway}} through commercial areas and woodland, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations before turning north and interchanging with Raritan Street and Kearney Road, crossing back into Sayreville at the interchange with the former. At this point, the road widens to six lanes. The two routes <b>split</b> <b>at</b> an interchange (the former Victory Circle) that {{has access to}} the southbound Garden State Parkway and from the northbound Parkway by way of Chevalier Avenue. From here, US 9 closely parallels {{the east side of the}} Garden State Parkway as it crosses the Raritan River on the Edison Bridge, with the parkway crossing the river on the Driscoll Bridge. Upon crossing the Raritan River, US 9 enters Woodbridge Township, where it reaches a complex interchange with the Garden State Parkway, Route 440, and CR 656. Within this interchange, the Garden State Parkway’s travel lanes run in between the travel lanes of US 9, with this configuration continuing past the interchange for a short distance. Along this stretch, there are ramps to and from CR 616 and to the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95).|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of US113 to be {{expanded}} to a divided highway {{was part of the}} new US13 bypass of Dover. The latter highway's new four-lane course, which included a new bridge across the St. Jones River, was constructed starting in 1950 and opened to traffic April 16, 1952. As part of the project, the portion of US113 from State Street north of Silver Lake to the new US13 highway was expanded to a divided highway, and both U.S. Highways were marked on the expanded highway from State Street to their <b>split</b> <b>at</b> the modern intersection of US13 and Bay Road. DSHD may have removed US 113 markers from north of Bay Road as early as 1965, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the northern terminus of the U.S. Highway being retracted from the north end of State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road at their spring 1974 meeting. In conjunction, AASHTO approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus.|$|E
