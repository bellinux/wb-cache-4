5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper on {{consumer}} search where the cost {{of going back to}} stores already searched is explicitly taken into account. We show that the optimal sequential search rule under costly <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> {{is very different from the}} traditional reservation price rule in that it is nonstationary and not independent of previously sampled prices. We explore the implications of costly <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> on market equilibrium in two celebrated search models. In the Wolinsky model some consumers search beyond the first firm and in this class of models costly <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> do make a substantive difference: equilibrium prices under costly <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> can both be higher and lower than their perfect recall analogues. In the oligopoly search model of Stahl where consumers do not search beyond the first firm, there remains a unique symmetric equilibrium that has firms use pricing strategies that are identical to the perfect recall case. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|After the 1918 {{enactment}} of the Representation of the People Act, allowing women over age30 to vote, Singh joined the Suffragette Fellowship and remained a member until her death. Her arrangement of a flag day that year for Indian troops generated shock waves in England and New Delhi. In September 1919 Singh hosted the Indian soldiers of the peace contingent at Faraday House. Five years later, she made her <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to India with Bamba and Colonel Sutherland. Singh visited Kashmir, Lahore, Amritsar, and Murre, where they were mobbed by crowds who came to see their former maharaja's daughters, and this visit boosted the cause of female suffrage in India.

40|$|Context: Topical {{corticosteroids}} are {{the treatment}} of choice for oral lichen planus (OLP) due to its potential anti-inflammatory effect. However, chronic nature of OLP often requires long-term and frequent applications, exposing patients to local and systemic side effects. Aim: To detect the systemic absorption of 0. 1 % triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) through the oral mucosa of patients with OLP. Subjects and Methods: This was a pilot pharmacokinetic study {{carried out in the}} Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology in collaboration with the Department of Toxicology, over 10 months. A total of twenty patients with OLP were included and advised to apply 0. 1 % TAC 3 times/day for 2 weeks and 2 times/day for next 2 weeks. Blood samples were obtained on the first and <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> and analyzed for triamcinolone using High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Statistical Analysis Used: Paired t-test was done to compare visual analog scale (VAS) score for burning sensation at the first and <b>second</b> <b>visits,</b> statistically significant if P < 0. 05. The baseline demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Paired t-test was done to compare VAS score for burning sensation at the first and <b>second</b> <b>visits,</b> which turned to being statistically significant (P = 0. 001). Although HPLC is an established method for the detection of TAC, none of the study populations showed evidence of steroid (TAC) in the blood sample during 4 weeks of treatment duration. Conclusions: 0. 1 % triamcinolone is a relatively safe drug to be used with no systemic absorption in the standard dose regimen for oral lichen palnus...|$|R

5|$|Allan Ramsay {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors. His work has been seen as anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E
5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E

5|$|During Titus' <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to the {{disaster}} area, a fire struck Rome which lasted for three days. Although {{the extent of}} the damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64, crucially sparing the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of Pompey's Theatre and the Saepta Julia among others. Once again, Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague similarly struck during the fire. The nature of the disease, however, or the death toll are unknown.|$|E

In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita. During his <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a <b>second</b> <b>visit</b> to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with newly}} found raised blood {{pressure}} {{are known to}} have lower pressures at subsequent measurements even when not treated. A study was undertaken {{to determine the extent to}} which (a) the number of follow-up measurements and (b) the duration of the intervals between them contributed to this fall in pressure. In 42 general practices 110 patients were identified as having for the first time a diastolic pressure (phase V) greater than 90 and less than 110 mm Hg. Both diastolic and systolic pressures were appreciably lower when measured at return visits when compared with the first measurement. The systolic pressure dropped appreciably in the intervals between the first and the <b>second</b> <b>visits</b> and again between the <b>second</b> and third <b>visits.</b> The diastolic pressure fell appreciably only between the first and <b>second</b> <b>visits.</b> The duration of the interval between visits was not associated with a fall in either systolic or diastolic pressure, but the number of measurements was. This pattern of fall in pressure was not affected by the patient's age or sex. From these results we conclude that patients with newly identified blood pressures that are mildly raised should be seen at two further visits before a decision about treatment is made. The timing of these follow-up visits is not crucial...|$|R

5|$|After the Olympics, Camet {{traveled}} to Navarreux in France {{to visit his}} old family home, where his father had studied both academics and fencing. While the victory at Amsterdam was considered a milestone in Argentine athletics at the time, Camet, as a substitute was often forgotten as a contributor by his contemporaries in the fencing community such as Oscar Viñas and Eugenio Peni, despite being a legitimate and official medal winner. He was always given credit by his teammates, however, even if they emphasized his position as a substitute on the team. Camet's father died on July 15, 1931, {{a few years after}} Carmelo's success at the Olympics. Carmelo subsequently married Elsie Muir and, in 1981, returned to Navarreux for a <b>second</b> <b>visit.</b> He lived {{the rest of his life}} in Buenos Aires.
