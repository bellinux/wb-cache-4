40|$|<b>Superfinished</b> {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} vital to prolong the life of orthopaedic implants against corrosion and wear debris. However, the bearing surfaces of knee implants are usually freeform surfaces which are difficult to be designed, fabricated and measured with sub-micrometer form accuracy and surface finish in the nanometer range. This paper presents an integrated approach for supporting design, ultra-precision polishing and measurement of <b>superfinished</b> orthopaedic implants for bio-medical applications. The platform mainly consists of five key modules which include CAD model design module, data exchange module, model-based simulation system, tool path generator, as well as freeform measurement and characterisation module, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reliability}} when testing gear efficiency and on how gear mesh efficiency {{can be increased}} without {{detrimental effects on the}} gears. Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for gear efficiency testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on gear mesh efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and <b>superfinished,</b> were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect gear mesh efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and <b>superfinished</b> gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of spray lubrication (before and after gear mesh contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated gear mesh efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for <b>superfinished</b> gears, which show the same gear mesh efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with spray lubrication rather than dip lubrication. The gear mesh efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when <b>superfinished</b> gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study and model the performance of <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces in rolling contact fatigue. The rolling contact fatigue is first modeled by taking into account the residual stresses generated by the hard turning process. Then, micro-hardness along with residual stresses produced were used for modeling. ^ Results show that changing the cutting conditions will change the residual stresses and the micro-hardness produced and consequently change the fatigue life. Within the range of this study, it is shown that changing the cutting parameters will change the fatigue life by a factor of 40 times. It was also shown that high speeds and/or large flank wear will result in structural changes known as white layer, the presence of which was shown to drastically decrease the fatigue life. Moreover, it is shown that the rolling contact fatigue life of <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces has a highly consistent repeatability as compared with ground surfaces. Finally, it is shown that hard turning results in softening the surface layers to varying degrees depending on the cutting conditions. ^ In modeling the rolling contact fatigue life of the <b>superfinish</b> hard turned surfaces, first, the residual stresses were superimposed on the service stresses due to the loading, and then the fatigue life was modeled using the maximum equivalent stress (Von-Mises). It is shown that including the residual stress in the fatigue life model gives better prediction than that obtained by the maximum Hertzian stress which does not account for the residual stresses. Moreover, the inclusion of the maximum equivalent stress, its location and the volume-at-risk gives better results than using the maximum equivalent stress alone. The fact that the above models could not accurately predict the rolling contact fatigue life, prompted the author to include the micro-hardness distributions along with the residual stress distributions. The author used Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics to develop a model that includes loading, residual stresses, and micro-hardness. The predicted lives using this model were found to correlate very well with the experimental data. ...|$|R

40|$|With ever shorter {{development}} {{times and}} market demands on overall system performance such as efficiency, reliability and low maintenance, accurate predictive tools are necessary and gear drives {{prove to be}} no exception. All these characteristics {{have an impact on}} a process which has remained a riddle: running-in. Even though no consensus on a definition of this phenomena is readily available, this thesis examines efficiency, surface roughness and simulation through the optics of running-in. Geared transmissions are known for their formidable efficiency and their extreme reliability. However, with an ever increasing power density, the ability to accurately predict mesh losses becomes of utmost importance. The accurate quantification of bearing losses as well as efficiency of ground and <b>superfinished</b> gears under dip lubrication are examined with respect to running-in. Results show a considerable influence on the calculation of gear mesh losses originating from which bearing loss model is chosen. Furthermore, when a larger running-in load is used on ground gears, an increase in efficiency can be observed during working operation, while for <b>superfinished</b> no significant changes are found. These efficiency/frictional changes are also shown to occur in the initial cycles of the running-in phase. From a surface transformation point of view running-in is shown to be a reduction of asperity tips in case hardened ground gears, while in <b>superfinished</b> gears no changes were seen. These gear surface changes were measured with a novel method with a surface profilometer in-situ before, after running-in and after efficiency testing. Results also show that such changes in ground gear roughness profile occur during the very initial cycles. In order to predict running-in, a simulation method was developed. Such method utilizes a 2 D surface integral method to simulate contact between rough surfaces, but requires the use of surface hardness and an accurate lower cutoff wavelength. This cutoff wavelength proved to play a pivotal role in determining an accurate contact pressure at the proper level of granularity, hence a well defined real contact area. The predicted and measured run-in surfaces are compared and are found to be in accordance with each other. QC 20170928 </p...|$|R
