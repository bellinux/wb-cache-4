50|$|Following {{the sale}} of Mersey Television to All3Media in 2005, all the {{properties}} on Brookside Close became surplus to requirements so all the Hollyoaks characters based at this set quickly transferred to new homes at Mersey Television's Childwall site. The entire set was sold to a developer who then stripped, gutted and attempted to rebuild the entire interior {{of each of the}} 13 houses before making them available for sale to the public in January 2007. Of the houses on Brookside Close (that were used as sets), Numbers 7 and 8 were the cheapest at £199,000, while the famous number 10 was for sale at £295,000 according to the particulars of Off Plan Investments, who were selling the houses at that time. The houses were put up for sale in a <b>semi-finished</b> <b>condition,</b> and coupled with the extremely high asking prices, they did not sell, and the developer went into receivership soon after. The set then became neglected and fell into decay.|$|E
40|$|Two cracked NLG brackets; one in {{finished}} {{condition and}} the other in <b>semi-finished</b> <b>condition,</b> were sent to the laboratory for analysis. Cracks were noticed in the components during dye penetrant inspection. It was established that the cracks were resulted during heat treatment of the semi-finished components. Hence, study was undertaken to establish first whether or not there were any problems in the material or in heat treatment procedure. Microstructural and fractographic examination confirmed that there were no abnormalities in the material. Based on the microstructural study, the possibility of overheating during heat treatment was also ruled out. However, analysis of the failure, in general, indicated that most probably, the cracking of the NLG brackets occurred due to differential stresses that got developed in different sections of the components during quenching process. Because of the shape, varying thickness and extra material left in the component after semi-finishing operation, some of the fillet regions were found to be vulnerable for crack generation during quenching operation. Analysis also shows that such heat treatment cracking in the NLG brackets in its present form is probably unavoidable. In view of this, it is recommended that suitable modification be made in the design so that the fabrication problems encountered currently can be avoided...|$|E
