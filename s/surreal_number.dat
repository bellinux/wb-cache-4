5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the <b>surreal</b> <b>number</b> , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E
25|$|In what is {{now called}} the sign-expansion or sign-sequence of a <b>surreal</b> <b>number,</b> a <b>surreal</b> <b>number</b> is a {{function}} whose domain is an ordinal and whose codomain is { −1, +1 }. This is equivalent to Conway's L-R sequences.|$|E

In this paper, we present a simple connection between transfinite iterates of the inverse of the tent map and the class of all the <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers.</b> This connection extends Louck's work to all <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, one can define the arithmetic operations of addition, multiplication, division, square roots, etc., of transfinite iterates by conversion of them to <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers.</b> The extension is done by transfinite induction. Inverses of other unimodal onto maps of a real interval could be considered and then the possibility exists of obtaining different structures for <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} Écalle’s transseries and their {{variants}} (LE and EL- series) {{can be interpreted}} as functions from positive infinite <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers</b> to <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers.</b> The same holds for a much larger class of formal series, here called omega-series. Omega-series are the smallest subfield of the <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers</b> containing the reals, the ordinal omega, and closed under the exp and log functions and all possible infinite sums. They form a proper class, can be composed and differentiated, and are surreal analytic. The <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers</b> themselves {{can be interpreted as}} a large field of transseries containing the omega-series, but, unlike omega-series, they lack a composition operator compatible with the derivation introduced by the authors in an earlier paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the <b>Surreal</b> <b>Numbers</b> from an elementary, con- structivist point of view, with the {{intention}} of introducing the numbers in a palatable way for a broad audience with minimal background in any specific mathematical field. Created from two recursive definitions, the <b>Surreal</b> <b>Numbers</b> form a class that contains a copy of the real numbers, transfinite ordinals, and infinitesimals, combinations of these, and in- finitely many <b>numbers</b> uniquely <b>Surreal.</b> Together with two binary operations, the <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers</b> form a field. The existence of the <b>Surreal</b> <b>Numbers</b> is proven, and the class is constructed from nothing, starting with the integers and dyadic rationals, continuing into the transfinite ordinals and the remaining real numbers, and culminating with the infinitesimals and uniquely <b>surreal</b> <b>numbers.</b> Several key concepts are proven regarding the ordering and containment properties of the numbers. The concept of a surreal continuum is introduced and demonstrated. The binary operations are explored and demonstrated, and field properties are proven, using many methods, including transfinite induction...|$|R
25|$|The numeric {{forms are}} placed in {{equivalence}} classes; each such equivalence class is a <b>surreal</b> <b>number.</b> The elements of {{the left and right}} set of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of forms, but of their equivalence classes).|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} y ≤ c {{between a}} form y and a <b>surreal</b> <b>number</b> c is performed by choosing a form z from the equivalence class c and evaluating y ≤ z; and likewise for c ≤ x and for comparison b ≤ c between two surreal numbers.|$|E
