5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> easy way out and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally consonant with myself. I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "symbol of courage, strength, and wisdom", Link was {{designed}} by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif for players to identify with: he begins the game an ordinary boy but strengthens to triumph over the ultimate evil. The name of the princess was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald: [...] "Zelda {{was the name of}} the wife of the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title," [...] Miyamoto explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "In such a company, {{where only}} the leader enjoys the {{privilege}} of a family name, the like would be unbecoming its least member. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> name that best becomes in me. And I think it is Parvissimus--the very least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} German. He hated this country--yours and mine. He plotted with the I.W.W. He hated {{your father and}} wanted to destroy him.... Before he died he {{realized}} his crime. For <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> few words he spoke to Jerry. But all the same he was a traitor to my country. I bear his name. I have German in me.... And by God I'm going to pay!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My cousin's contribution. She came so late we {{only had}} time for that. <b>So</b> glad <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of {{bringing}} her and them." ...|$|R
500|$|Zelda's name {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games. Series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained, [...] " [...] {{was a famous}} and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked {{the sound of her}} name. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title." [...] New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, [...] "Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature." [...] In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It {{is one of the few}} places where some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{became an}} American citizen in December 2006 and holds dual {{citizenship}} in the United States and the United Kingdom. The {{results of the}} 2004 United States presidential election, and a comment made by actor Tom Hanks, prompted her desire to naturalise. “Tom Hanks was standing in a corridor at a party and I said something, {{and he was just}} very nice and he went, ‘Oh, yeah. I know that but you’re British. You know, you don’t {{have to put up with}} that stuff ... I went, ‘No. Actually I’ve been here a long time.‘ I thought, that’s it. I’m going to join in. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> [...] test.” In 2006, she topped the list for the [...] "Wealthiest British Comedians," [...] with an estimated wealth of £75 million. In 2015, Ullman's wealth was estimated to be £77 million, making her the wealthiest British actress and female comedian. In 2017, The Sunday Times increased it to £80 million.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> typewritten copy from my work basket {{and handed it}} to him.|$|E
6000|$|You mistake me, if {{you think}} I dislike Lord Carlisle; I respect him, [...] and might like him did I know him better. For him too my mother has an [...] antipathy, why I know not. I am afraid he could be but of little use [...] to me, in {{separating}} me from her, which she would oppose with all her [...] might; but I dare say he would assist me if he could, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> [...] will for the Deed, and am obliged to him {{in exactly the same}} manner as [...] if he succeeded in his efforts.|$|R
60|$|SERGIUS. Precisely. But I have no {{ambition}} to succeed as a tradesman; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> advice of that bagman of a captain that settled {{the exchange of}} prisoners with us at Peerot, and given it up.|$|R
60|$|Palm. Indeed I must; I cannot help my love; <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> {{tender when}} <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> bent, That now I grow that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "My daughter! My little girl," [...] he answered! [...] "And I {{heard her}} calling {{to me with}} her mother's voice across the sea. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> money." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> hint, {{and came}} too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall {{get some sleep}} tonight.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a neck of mutton and a chicken. She {{said the}} neck of mutton would keep hot best, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> chicken. I hope you like lukewarm neck of mutton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend of mine you {{may have}} heard of," [...] he said, [...] "asked me to leave this with you. I am {{catching}} the Princess Cecilia from Southampton tomorrow. I thought, perhaps, if I waited an hour or <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> might <b>take</b> <b>the</b> answer back with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I set a lot o' snares, an' there's no sayin' {{how many}} rabbits may have got into 'em. Besides, if the rabbits in them parts are tender-hearted, a lot o' their {{relations}} may have died o' grief, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>take</b> <b>the</b> sled to fetch 'em all home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] said Hetty, with {{a little}} playful pout, taking the rose out of her hair. [...] "I'll put one o' Dinah's caps on when we go in, and you'll see if I look better in it. She left one behind, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> pattern." ...|$|R
60|$|The bull charged on me with fury. As he did <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> spade {{and held}} it on a level with my waist, resting the butt end {{on the wall behind}} me.|$|E
6000|$|I added immeasurably {{to my old}} friend's {{surprise}} by {{not even}} employing the post-office. I wished to see the [...] "instructions" [...] which my husband had left behind him. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> letter to his lawyers myself.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not know}} that lions are not fond of water, nor did I know if Victory could swim, but death, {{immediate}} and terrible, stared us in the face if we remained, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> chance.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him by <b>the</b> hand and raised him up.|$|R
6000|$|I saw {{we should}} have no more {{gardening}} if I let {{this sort of thing}} go on, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> quietly <b>took</b> <b>the</b> snail away, and put it on a bank where he couldn't reach it. [...] "We'll hunt it afterwards, Bruno," [...] I said, [...] "if you really want to catch it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Without {{asking why}} it was <b>so</b> {{precious}} <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> pig {{and placed it in}} my work bag, where it has been ever since. Only yesterday we offered it to the Bassa, who laughed at us, and this so enraged us against the dervish that we cut off his beard when he was asleep, and now he dare not show himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I—I {{called to}} see the captain," [...] he said, hastily, [...] "and Joseph {{told me you were}} in the garden. I couldn’t see you anywhere, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of sitting out there to wait for the captain’s return." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> 288 {{pages to}} Bliss {{and told him}} that was the very last line I should ever write on this book. (A book which {{required}} 2600 pages of MS, and I have written nearer four thousand, first and last.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] Quest replied coolly. [...] "You garrotted {{and robbed}} {{an old man}} and had the spree of your life. The old man {{happened}} to be a friend of mine, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> trouble to see that you paid for it. Well?" ...|$|E
60|$|Estella told me we {{were both}} to go in, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> Joe by <b>the</b> coat-cuff and {{conducted}} him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was seated at her dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.|$|R
60|$|Sir,--Coming {{into town}} {{this morning to}} attend my duty in this office, it being collection-day, I met with a gentleman who tells me he {{is on his way}} to London; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} of writing to you, as franking is at present under a temporary death. I shall have some snatches of leisure through the day, amid our horrid business and bustle, and I shall improve them as well as I can; but let my letter be as stupid as..., as miscellaneous as a newspaper, as short as a hungry grace-before-meat, or as long as a law-paper in the Douglas cause; as ill spelt as country John's billet-doux, or as unsightly a scrawl as Betty Byre-Mucker's answer to it; I hope, considering circumstances, you will forgive it; and as it will put you to no expense of postage, I shall have the less reflection about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because if <b>I</b> {{had done}} <b>so,</b> Umbezi, <b>I</b> should have {{ceased to be}} a quiet white man. Yes, yes, my friend, I should have been in some such place as yours to-day, and that is the last thing that I wish.

6000|$|... "My! I'm {{glad to get}} back," [...] said Katy. [...] "Ma wasn't sick {{to amount}} to anything.

6000|$|... "I only obeyed orders, Nan; for {{a certain}} dear old lady had a motherly presentiment that you had got into a {{domestic}} whirlpool, and sent me {{as a sort of}} life-preserver. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> basket of consolation, and came to fold my feet upon the carpet of contentment in the tent of friendship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Luckily, I am {{a strong}} man, and I soon {{overpowered}} him.

If I had thought that you were still alive you may rest assured I would not have left you behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an American citizen," [...] he declared. [...] "I {{am willing}} to listen to the advice of any physician, but <b>so</b> long as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk, <b>I</b> am not bound to follow it.|$|R
6000|$|A {{dear old}} sentimental friend, with whom I discoursed {{on the subject}} of novels yesterday, said that her {{favorite}} hero was Lord Orville, in [...] "Evelina," [...] that novel which Dr. Johnson loved <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> down <b>the</b> book from a dusty old crypt at a club, where Mrs. Barbauld's novelists repose: and {{this is the kind of}} thing, ladies and gentlemen, in which your ancestors found pleasure:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{mean what}} I say, Billie, for you are light-headed {{as well as}} light-hearted--a sort o' human balloon, ready to go up like a rocket at any time--so that even an or'nary man like me weighs you down.
