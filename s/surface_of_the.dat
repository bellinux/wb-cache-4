5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined to the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathway.

5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In this study, we {{investigated}} tooth-wear patterns in adolescents with either normal occlusion or Class II Division 2 malocclusion. Methods: <b>The</b> sample consisted <b>of</b> dental casts from 165 subjects that {{were divided into}} 2 groups: 115 normal occlusion subjects (mean age, 14. 3 years) and 50 complete Class II Division 2 subjects (mean age, 13. 9 years). Dental wear was assessed by using a modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth wear index. The 2 groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney test for the frequency and severity of wear on each <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> each group <b>of</b> teeth. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> statistical significance was set at 5 %. Results: The normal occlusion group statistically had greater tooth wear on <b>the</b> incisal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary lateral incisors and <b>the</b> incisal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary canines than did the Class II Division 2 malocclusion group. The malocclusion group showed statistically greater tooth wear on <b>the</b> labial <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular lateral incisors, <b>the</b> occlusal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary premolars and first molars, <b>the</b> occlusal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular premolars, <b>the</b> palatal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary second premolars, and <b>the</b> buccal <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular premolars and first molars than did the normal occlusion group. Conclusions: Subjects with normal occlusion and those with complete Class II Division 2 malocclusions have different tooth-wear patterns. Tooth wear on the malocclusion subjects {{should not be considered}} pathologic but, rather, <b>the</b> consequence <b>of</b> different interocclusal arrangements.
