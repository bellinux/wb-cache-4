40|$|Purpose: Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{plays an important}} role in the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance of clinically localized diseases. Combined PET/CT imaging exhibits significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than conventional imaging when it comes to detecting malignant tumors in children. However, the radiation dose from positron-emitting radionuclide to the pediatric population is a matter of concern since children are at a particularly high risk when exposed to ionizing radiation. Methods: The authors evaluate the absorbed fractions and specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) of monoenergy photons/electrons as well as <b>S-values</b> of 9 positron-emitting radionuclides (C- 11, N- 13, O- 15, F- 18, Cu- 64, Ga- 68, Rb- 82, Y- 86, and I- 124) in 48 source regions for 10 anthropomorphic pediatric hybrid models, including the reference newborn, 1 -, 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -yr-old male and female models, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended general purpose Monte Carlo transport code. Results: The self-absorbed SAFs and <b>S-values</b> for most organs were inversely related to the age and body weight, whereas the cross-dose terms presented less correlation with body weight. For most source/target organ pairs, Rb- 82 and Y- 86 produce the highest self-absorbed and cross-absorbed <b>S-values,</b> respectively, while Cu- 64 produces the lowest <b>S-values</b> because of the low-energy and high-frequency of electron emissions. Most of the total self-absorbed <b>S-values</b> are contributed from non-penetrating particles (electrons and positrons), which have a linear relationship with body weight. The dependence of self-absorbed <b>S-values</b> of the two annihilation photons varies to the reciprocal of 0. 76 power of the mass, whereas the self-absorbed <b>S-values</b> of positrons vary according to the reciprocal mass. Conclusions: The produced <b>S-values</b> for common positron-emitting radionuclides can be exploited for the assessment of radiation dose delivered to the pediatric population from various PET radiotracers used in clinical and research settings. The mass scaling method for positron-emitters can be used to derive patient-specific <b>S-values</b> from data of reference phantoms. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to being a powerful clinical tool, Positron emission tomography (PET) is also used in small laboratory animal research to visualize and track certain molecular processes associated with diseases such as cancer, heart disease and neurological disorders in living small animal models of disease. However, dosimetric characteristics in small animal PET imaging are usually overlooked, though the radiation dose may not be negligible. In this work, we constructed 17 mouse models of different body mass and size based on the realistic four-dimensional MOBY mouse model. Particle (photons, electrons and positrons) transport using the Monte Carlo method was performed to calculate the absorbed fractions and <b>S-values</b> for eight positron-emitting radionuclides (C- 11, N- 13, O- 15, F- 18, Cu- 64, Ga- 68, Y- 86 and I- 124). Among these radionuclides, O- 15 emits positrons with high energy and frequency and produces the highest self-absorbed <b>S-values</b> in each organ, while Y- 86 emits gamma-rays with high energy and frequency which results in the highest cross-absorbed <b>S-values</b> for non-neighbouring organs. Differences between <b>S-values</b> for self-irradiated organs were between 2 % and 3 %/ g difference in body weight for most organs. For organs irradiating other organs outside the splanchnocoele (i. e. brain, testis and bladder), differences between <b>S-values</b> were lower than 1 %/g. These appealing results can be used to assess variations in small animal dosimetry as a function of total-body mass. The generated database of <b>S-values</b> for various radionuclides can be used in the assessment of radiation dose to mice from different radiotracers in small animal PET experiments, thus offering quantitative figures for comparative dosimetry research in small animal models. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Nonuniform {{activity}} {{within the}} target lesions {{and the critical}} organs constitutes an important limitation for dosimetric estimates in patients treated with tumor-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. The tumor control probability and the normal tissue complication probability {{are affected by the}} distribution of the radionuclide in the treated organ/tissue. In this paper, a straightforward method for calculating the absorbed dose at the voxel level is described. This new method takes into account a nonuniform activity distribution in the target/organ. METHODS: The new method is based on the macroscopic <b>S-values</b> (i. e., the <b>S-values</b> calculated for the various organs, as defined in the MIRD approach), on the definition of the number of voxels, and on the raw-count 3 D array, corrected for attenuation, scatter, and collimator resolution, in the lesion/organ considered. Starting from these parameters, the only mathematical operation required is to multiply the 3 D array by a scalar value, thus avoiding all the complex operations involving the 3 D arrays. RESULTS: A comparison with the MIRD approach, fully described in the MIRD Pamphlet No. 17, using <b>S-values</b> at the voxel level, showed a good agreement between the two methods for (131) I and for (90) Y. CONCLUSIONS: Voxel dosimetry {{is becoming more and more}} important when performing therapy with tumor-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. The method presented here does not require calculating the <b>S-values</b> at the voxel level, and thus bypasses the mathematical problems linked to the convolution of 3 D arrays and to the voxel size. In the paper, the results obtained with this new simplified method as well as the possibility of using it for other radionuclides commonly employed in therapy are discussed.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the possible differences between SPECT/CT based whole-remnant and maximum-voxel dosimetry in patients receiving radio-iodine ablation treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Methods: Eighteen DTC patients were administered 1. 11 GBq of 131 I-NaI after near-total thyroidectomy and rhTSH stimulation. Two patients had two remnants, so in total dosimetry was performed for 20 sites. Three SPECT/CT scans were performed for each patient at 1, 2, and 3 - 7 days after administration. The activity, the remnant mass, and the maximum-voxel activity were determined from these images {{and from a}} recovery-coefficient curve derived from experimental phantom measurements. The cumulated activity was estimated using trapezoidal-exponential integration. Finally, the absorbed dose was calculated using <b>S-values</b> for unit-density spheres in whole-remnant dosimetry and <b>S-values</b> for voxels in maximum-voxel dosimetry. Results: The mean absorbed dose obtained from whole-remnant dosimetry was 40 Gy (range 2 - 176 Gy) and from maximum-voxel dosimetry 34 Gy (range 2 - 145 Gy). For any given patient, the activity concentrations {{for each of the}} three time-points were approximately the same for the two methods. The effective half-lives varied (R = 0. 865), mainly due to discrepancies in estimation of the longer effective half-lives. On average, absorbed doses obtained from whole-remnant dosimetry were 1. 2 ± 0. 2 (1 SD) higher than for maximum-voxel dosimetry, mainly due to differences in the <b>S-values.</b> The method-related differences were however small in comparison to the wide range of absorbed doses obtained in patients. Conclusions: Simple and consistent procedures for SPECT/CT based whole-volume and maximumvoxel dosimetry have been described, both based on experimentally determined recovery coefficients.
