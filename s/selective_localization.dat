40|$|Effect {{of carbon}} black (CB) on the {{morphology}} of filled polyethylene (PE) /polystyrene (PS) blends {{has been investigated}} by image analysis of optical micrographs (2 -D analysis) and by the selective extraction of one phase of the binary blends (3 -D analysis). The macroscopic electrical resistivity of the filled polyblends strongly depends on the <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of CB in one phase or at the interface and above all on the double percolation, i. e. percolation of the polymer phases and percolation of the CB particles. The <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of CB in the PE phase has remarkable effects on the polyblend phase morphology. The phase cocontinuity is indeed extended over a much larger composition range, and the phase morphology is stabilized toward post-thermal treatment at 200 degrees C. In the case of double percolation and <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of CB at the polyblend interface, electrical conductivity is observed at a CB content as low as 0. 4 wt %.

The {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) images reveal that SIC and p-SiC nanoparticles have different selective localizations in the PS/PVDF blends. The melting and crystallization behaviors of the PVDF component investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry {{are consistent with the}} SEM results. To reduce the volume fraction of fillers in the composites, a cocontinuous structure of PS/PVDF has also been built up. The cocontinuity window for PS/PVDF blends is similar to 30 - 70 vol % according to the selective solvent dissolution technique. The <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of SiC in the PVDF phase of the PS/PVDF 70 / 30 blends produces a slightly higher thermal conductivity than that of p-SiC in the PS phase of the PS/PVDF 30 / 70 blends.

40|$|The {{research}} activities carried {{out during the}} doctoral program focused on <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of nanoparticles in microstructured polymer systems. Three distinct processes, very different from each other, were employed to achieve similar results. The first area of research has involved the <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of the carbon nanotubes within a biphasic and bicontinuous blend of polystyrene and polylactic acid, obtained by melt mixing the two thermoplastic polymers. Nanoparticles were selectively dispersed in the polystyrene phase achieving a lower percolation threshold than the initial one. In the second line of research, carried out {{in collaboration with the}} Soft Matter Physics group of the Adolphe Merkle Institute (Fribourg, Switzerland), hybrid organometallic perovkite nanocrystals were produced by precipitation in liquid phase. These nanocrystals were then incorporated into a thin film of polyethylene glycol diacrylate deposited by spin-coating on a glass substrate. The polymer crosslinking, triggered by exposure to an oxygen plasma, induced the formation of corrugations on the film surface (wrinkles) allowing the microstructuring of the perovskite. In the third line of research, carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of Optics (INO-CNR), <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of quantum dots in polydimethylsiloxane microlenses on a pyroelectric lithium niobate substrate were achieved through electrohydrodynamic and dielectrophoretic mechanisms.

Employing two-step mixing process can make MWNTs localize in PS or PVDF phase successfully. When three components are simply mixed together by one-step processing, the MWNTs are selectively distributed in PVDF phase, which is supported by the dielectric measurements and the SEM observations and is consistent with the wetting coefficient evaluation. For the two-step mixing, when the fillers are first mixed with PS in the first step, some of them will migrate into PVDF phase in the second step although the migration is very slow. When the overall volume fraction of MWNTs is 3. 9 vol%, the <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of MWNTs in PVDF phase produces higher dielectric constant (e 0, ca. 485) than the case when the fillers are only in PS phase (e 0 of ca. 16) at 100 Hz and room temperature of 25 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and mechanical tests show that the <b>selective</b> <b>localization</b> of all the fillers in PVDF phase produces little change of the melting point and crystallinity of PVDF component but slightly higher tensile strength. In contrast to the one-step mixing process, the two-step mixing to selectively localize the fillers in their favorite phase could be used to control the dielectric and mechanical properties of the materials...|$|E

A combination of therapeutic and imaging modalities for PDT enables real-time tracking, cancer characterization, targeted delivery, triggered drug release and pharmacokinetic profiling. Cancer imaging involves use of various modalities such as ultrasound imaging, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence imaging and nuclear imaging. Although various imaging modalities may be applied, high spatial resolution, low-cost and real-time display of fluorescence imaging provides a unique advantage [17, 18]. As most fluorescent drugs and dyes are small hydrophobic molecules, their selective accumulation in tumor tissue is contingent upon the circulation time. In order to impart stealth properties to drugs, their aggregates can be encapsulated into polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) with PEG polymer decorated on the surface, which provide a long circulation time leading to {{enhanced permeation and retention}} (EPR) in the tumor tissue [19].
