5|$|The 1951 charter reforms {{included}} {{consolidation of}} {{city and county}} offices. When all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County were consolidated into one city in 1854, the surviving county offices often duplicated the efforts of city offices. The new charter allowed for their consolidation, but litigation ensued about which county offices were actually state offices, and thus immune from the city's jurisdiction. A <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court case decided in 1953 settled the issue, for the most part, leaving the Register of Wills as an independently elected official.|$|E
5|$|The Appellate Division of the New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court {{ruled that}} NYSDOT had {{to provide a}} new {{environmental}} report by May12, 1989 or face having the reconstruction shut down. The order by the court reversed {{a decision by the}} New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Lincoln Center campus {{and some of the}} Upper West Side community residents have been strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the University's expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the <b>State</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E

Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted.
