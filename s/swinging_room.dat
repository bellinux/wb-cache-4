Nursery age children (3 – 4 years), children with co-ordination difficulties (DCD: 10 – 12 years), age-matched controls and adults were compared in their sway responses when they were presented with a moving visual world while standing upright on a static floor. Gain estimates for the vision-posture transfer function suggested that nursery children still depend upon vision as {{a major source of}} postural information, whereas this dependence is not evident in older control children. The children with DCD could be separated into two groups: (i) those who had postural control problems and demonstrated a bias to use visual information equivalent to the nursery children and (ii) those who passed a standard postural control assessment and did not differ from age-matched controls in the <b>swinging</b> <b>room</b> context. ...|$|E

It is generally critical that the VR setups produce behavior that closely resembles real world behavior. One part of any task {{is the ability to}} control our posture. Since postural control is well studied in the real world and is known to be strongly influenced by visual information, it is an ideal metric for examining the behavioral fidelity of VR setups. Moreover, VR-based experiments on postural control can provide fundamental new insights into human perception and cognition. Here, we employ the "swinging room paradigm" to validate a specific VR setup. Furthermore, we systematically examined a larger range of room oscillations than previously studied in any single setup. We also introduce several new methods and analyses that were specifically designed to optimize the detection of synchronous swinging between the observer and the virtual room. The results show that the VR setup has a very high behavioral fidelity and that increases in <b>swinging</b> <b>room</b> amplitude continue to produce increases in body sway even at very large room displacements (+/- 80 cm). Finally, the combination of new methods proved to be a very robust, reliable, and sensitive way of measuring body sway...|$|E

50|$|The 1940 {{addition}} {{extended the}} building 38.0 {{feet to the}} north. This required that the parking and loading functions be relocated to the west portion of the site. The design duplicated the original materials {{and most of the}} detailing. The new side elevations are recessed eighteen inches so that the massing of the original building is distinct. The window openings are dimensioned similar to the originals and are likewise equally spaced. The sash, however, are double hung types at all three levels. Transoms were retained at the first and second levels. The new parapet was designed to be solid stone, unlike the original which had balustraded portions. A new loading platform was constructed on {{the north end of the}} west elevation. The two pairs of loading doors were recessed and were protected from rain by a marquee. The dock also had an employee entrance. The north elevation was redesigned along the lines of the side elevations with five equally spaced window openings that utilized metal sash. The use of two outer flanking openings was retained from the original composition. At the center of the first level, three large rectangular windows provided the postal workroom with day lighting. The interior boiler chimney was relocated to the north elevation. A new fire escape, basement stairway, and area-way for the new <b>swing</b> <b>room</b> were also constructed on the north elevation. The original east, west, and south elevations were left intact with exception of the entry approach. The original ceremonial steps were replaced by dual side stairs leading to a common entry landing. The new granite stair was enclosed with wrought iron railings. The roof mounted flagpole was also relocated to the ground at this time. The addition retained much of the original north elevation by creating a new light-well on the center third, and by incorporating the remaining wall within the new construction. (Portions of the original cornice are visible from the attic.) A new concrete block (with cement plaster exterior finish) rooftop penthouse over the main stair replaced the 1916 structure at this time, and the low sloped, built-up roof construction was continued onto the addition.|$|R

We demonstrate that the principle of PC-TFET switching relates to an internal amplification resulting in a sub-unity body factor, m, which is reduced to values below 0. 1 for a current range larger than 2 – 3 decades. We report a full experimental digital and analog benchmarking of the new device and compare it with Tunnel FETs and CMOS. Remarkably, the PC-TFET can achieve analog figures of merit like gm/Id breaking the 40 V− 1 limit of MOSFETs.

40|$|Tunneling field-effect {{transistors}} (TFETs) {{have gained}} {{a great deal}} of recent interest due to their potential to reduce power dissipation in integrated circuits. One major challenge for TFETs so far has been achieving high drive currents, which is a prerequisite for high-performance operation. In this paper we explore the performance potential of a 1 D TFET with a broken-gap heterojunction source injector using dissipative quantum transport simulations based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, and the carbon nanotube bandstructure as the model 1 D material system. We provide detailed insights into broken-gap TFET (BG-TFET) operation, and show that it can indeed produce less than 60 mV/decade subthreshold <b>swing</b> at <b>room</b> temperature even in the presence of electron-phonon scattering. The 1 D geometry is recognized to be uniquely favorable due to its superior electrostatic control, reduced carrier thermalization rate, and beneficial quantum confinement effects that reduce the off-state leakage below the thermionic limit. Because of higher source injection compared to staggered-gap and homojunction geometries, BG-TFET delivers superior performance that is comparable to MOSFET's. BG-TFET even exceeds the MOSFET performance at lower supply voltages (VDD), showing promise for low-power/high-performance applications. Comment: 34 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

The use of the Schottky source/drain contacts can effectively prevent the off-state leakage current, leading to high ON/OFF current ratio of similar to 10 (10) in the proposed devices. At room temperature, SS as low as 6. 6 mV/dec was observed and SS lower than 60 mV/dec was obtained over a wide drain bias range of 3 similar to 10 V during the forward sweep of V-GS.

40|$|With the {{continued}} miniaturization of MOSFETs, the OFF-state leakage current (IOFF) is exponentially increasing {{due to the}} nonscalability of the threshold voltage imposed by the fundamental 60 mV/decade subthreshold <b>swing</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. This limits the on current (ION) and the ION-IOFF ratio severely as the supply voltage is reduced. Interband tunnel transistor [1] features sub- 60 mV/dec subthreshold slope operation {{and can be used}} to circumvent this limitation. This paper examines the potential of double gate (DG) inter-band tunnel FETs (TFET) in 3 different material systems, Si, Ge and InAs, for logic circuit applications down to 0. 25 V supply voltage (VCC). Based on two-dimensional numerical drift-diffusion simulations [2], we show that 30 nm gate length (LG) InAs (indium arsenide) based TFETs can achieve ION/IOFF of> 4 x 104 with < 1 ps intrinsic delay at 0. 25 V VCC. The key features of the InAs TFETs are: a) asymmetric source drain design to suppress the ambipolar leakage b) use of a lower dielectric constant gate oxide (non high-K) and c) high source side injection velocity at moderate electric fields. The n-channel DG TFETs and MOSFETs used in this study have an LG of 30 nm and 2. 5 nm thick SiO 2 or HfO 2 gate dielectrics. The typical body thickness (Tbody) is kept at 7 nm. Gaussian doping profiles with doping gradients of 2 nm/decade are used for the source and drain regions. Despite the steep subthreshold slope and the ION-IOFF ratio spanning 12 decades over 1 V VGS swing, Si DG TFET ION (105 µA/µm) is much less than Si DG MOSFE...|$|R
