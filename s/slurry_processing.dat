The machine grinds soaked grains and separates the slurry food (starch) content of the ground grain paste from its fibrous chaff in a single flow process thereby reducing drudgery in the discharging and feeding of the paste between the milling and sieving processes. It also eliminated human contact with the ground grain paste during sieving as contained in the existing semi-mechanized and traditional <b>slurry</b> food <b>processing</b> methods. Performance analysis revealed 64. 25 %, 66. 01 % and 70. 16 % as the respective average extraction rate of this machine when millet, maize and soybean were processed using 2. 90 kg of water while 53. 62 kg/hr, 56. 21 kg/hr and 47. 76 kg/hr constitutes its throughputs with the respective grains.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{rheological}} behaviour of mineral <b>slurries</b> affects their <b>processing.</b> However, in addition to controlling the transportation of <b>slurries</b> around <b>processing</b> circuits, rheological behaviour also influences separation processes such as flotation. The rheological behaviour of mineral slurries {{is indicative of the}} level of inter-particle interaction or aggregation. In fact, rheological studies {{can be used as a}} direct approach to investigating such phenomena, thereby furthering our understanding of inter-particle interactions and potentially of bubble–particle interactions in mineral slurries. Although the impact of rheology in unit operations such as grinding and slurry transport has received considerable attention, this has not been the case for flotation. The pathways by which the rheology influences the flotation performance are not yet fully understood. These pathways may include various mechanisms occurring in the pulp and froth phases. However to date, little work has been done on froth rheology. Measuring the rheological properties of mineral slurries is also difficult since particles tend to settle during measurement. Finding a proper practical way for taking such measurements remains a challenge for research.

40|$|Livestock slurry is a {{valuable}} source of phosphorus (P) fertiliser for crops, but can also result in eutrophication following mobilisation and delivery to watercourses. The transfer of slurry-derived P to watercourses {{is likely to be}} strongly influenced by its particle size distribution and the chemical form of the P within the slurry. Advanced <b>slurry</b> <b>processing</b> (e. g. acidification, anaerobic digestion) is also likely to alter the forms and distribution of P within slurry particle size fractions. In response to this, this thesis explores the effects of <b>slurry</b> <b>processing</b> on P speciation within a range of slurry particle size fractions and on potential P bioavailability and movement through soil. The P characteristics of cattle slurry, acidified slurry, anaerobically digested slurry, in terms of P speciation of different particle size fractions, was studied in Chapter 3 - 5. The results showed that in the whole untreated cattle slurry, labile inorganic P (IP-H 2 O + IP-NaHCO 3) and labile organic P (OP-H 2 O + OP-NaHCO 3) dominated the total P (TP) of the whole slurry (45 % and 24 % of TP respectively). Acidification increased the labile inorganic P proportion to 55 % of TP and decreased the stable P (IP-HCl + OP-HCl + TP-Residue) proportion from 21 % to 15 % of the TP of whole slurry. Anaerobic digestion increased the labile inorganic P and moderately labile P (IP-NaOH + OP-NaOH) proportions of whole slurry to 53 % and 12 %, but decreased the labile organic P proportion to 12 % of TP. After physical separation, the proportion of TP in the liquid fractions (2000, > 500, > 63 μm), while solid fractions tended to show greater proportions of moderately labile and stable P than liquid fractions. After acidification, the P speciation of the solid fractions showed little change. However, the labile inorganic P and the moderately labile P proportions increased in TP in the acidified liquid fractions, while stable P proportion in the liquid fractions decreased. After anaerobic digestion, in the TP of both solid and liquid fractions, the labile inorganic P and moderately labile P proportions increased, while the labile organic P proportion was reduced. The colloidal fraction (0. 45 - 63 μm) accounted for 62 % of the TP of whole untreated cattle slurry. Acidification reduced this proportion, while anaerobic digestion did not change it. In contrast, anaerobic digestion increased the labile inorganic P content of the colloids. P availability in soil after slurry application was explored in an incubation experiment monitored by sequential fractionation method (Chapter 7), and in a pot experiment involving P uptake by ryegrass (Chapter 8). The vertical mobility of P in soil was studied in laboratory microcosms (Chapter 6) and a pot experiment (Chapter 8). The results showed that untreated and treated cattle slurry increased the labile P content of soil and the P lability decreased gradually over time. Ryegrass P uptake was also increased by addition of different slurries. However, the differences between untreated and treated slurry amended treatments was not necessarily significant for labile P content in the soil and P uptake by ryegrass. In Chapter 6, the results implied that colloid-associated P in cattle slurry caused greater potential P leaching and that anaerobic digestion even increased this mode of P loss. Although in the pot experiment, slurry amended treatments showed no difference in cumulative P leaching compared to the control, the colloidal fraction in untreated and treated slurries was still a dominant fraction associated with a large portion of P. Further work is necessary to demonstrate the effect of <b>slurry</b> <b>processing</b> on P bioavailability and mobility at the plot- and field-scale, and on recovering colloidal P prior to land spreading...|$|E

40|$|Mechanically {{agitated}} {{vessels are}} widely used unit operations in the modern processing industry. Mixing vessels are critical for bulk materials chemical <b>slurry</b> <b>processing</b> such as leaching, digestion, crystallization, adsorption, ion-exchange and polymerization. Homogeneous mixing is vital for product blending consistency and purity of the reaction products. Inconsistent solute distribution and non-homogeneous blending due to poor mixing can lead to undesirable by-product which is often unacceptable in terms of product quality. One distinctive phenomenon related to poor mixing in a stirred vessel is the formation of isolated mixing regions. Isolated mixing regions or IMRs refer to regions of confined mixed zone, segregated by well-defined boundary layer. The present work is driven by a need to eliminate IMRs at high viscosities with practical engineering designs. Experiments were carried out in a small perspex tank. The features of the IMRs formed in the viscous Newtonian systems in a stirred tank have been studied. Homogeneous mixing can be achieved via some geometrical modifications including baffle installation and addition of particles, via completely eliminating the isolated mixing regions. The experimental and CFD results confirmed that the breaking spatial symmetry in the angled-shaft system leads to destruction of the isolated mixing regions. A new particle-localization phenomenon has been discovered in a solid-liquid laminar mixing tank, and the mechanism has been uncovered from the prospective of dynamical systems. The results demonstrated that sufficiently straining flow combined {{with the presence of}} separated flow regions (i. e IMRs) are the necessary conditions for particle clustering and the particles cluster into the IMRs when the total fluid strain on a particle exceeds a critical value that depends on the particle and fluid inertia.

They are: (1) Development of low cost, reliable slurry-on-demand approaches for semi-solid processing; (2) Application of the novel permanent grain refining technology-SiBloy for the manufacture of high-quality SSM feedstock, and (3) Development of computational and modeling tools for semi-solid processing to enhance SSM process control. Salient results from these studies are summarized and detailed in our final technical report...|$|R
40|$|With {{increased}} pressure to redistribute animal manure {{in order to}} lower the environmental pressure from agriculture, it seems obvious to consider <b>processing</b> <b>slurry</b> into nutrient rich fractions which can easily be transported. In this paper, an overall analysis of four different separation technologies is presented. The four technologies are Decanter, Funki Manura 2000, Green Farm Energy and Staring. These technologies are all implemented on a full scale in Denmark. In this paper both the economic and environmental aspects are considered, looking at the entire chain from stable to the field. The total investments range from 50, 000 to 4 million Euros and the total net costs are from 1 to 7 Euros per tonne for the four different technologies. One of the clear environmental benefits is a better utilisation of phosphorus, but using phytase in feeding is a cheaper first step when reducing phosphorus surplus. Improved nitrogen utilisation is only apparent with the Staring and Green Farm Energy concepts. The conclusion is that the Funki Manura 2000 system is too expensive and the Decanter system a fairly cheap way to reduce phosphorus levels, but other benefits are limited. Staring and Green Farm Energy show the greatest potential, but these systems have not been running long enough to validate the expected results included in this paper.

40|$|Radioactive {{high level}} wastes (HLW) {{generated}} from production of special nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{are held in}} interim storage in 51 underground, million gallon tanks. Radioactive cesium ({sup 137 }Cs) is segregated by evaporation of aqueous waste solution for interim storage in a salt matrix comprised of Na and K salts or in concentrated salt solution. The saltcake will be dissolved and {sup 137 }Cs will {{be separated from the}} nonradioactive salts in solution in the In-Tank Precipitation (ITP) Process. The cesium will be combined with other radioactive species and glass formers to be melted and poured into stainless steel canisters in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The salt solution remaining after decontamination in the ITP process will be incorporated into grout for disposal at the site`s Saltstone facility. In the ITP facility, sodium tetraphenylborate (STPB) will be added to precipitate the cesium. Potassium in the waste solution also reacts with STPB and precipitates. Due to radiolytic and chemical degradation of the tetraphenylborate (TPB) precipitate, benzene is generated. The benzene dissolves into the decontaminated salt solution (DSS) and into water (WW) used to {open_quotes}wash{close_quotes} the precipitate to lower the soluble salt content of the <b>slurry.</b> Safety and <b>processing</b> requirements for disposal of the DSS and for temporary storage of the WW dictate that the benzene concentration be reduced...|$|R
