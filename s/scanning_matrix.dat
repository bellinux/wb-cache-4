But after emerging the fuzzy logic concept, a lot of Researcher of image processing has been shifted towards the fuzzy logic and its applicability {{in the field of}} image processing.

This way, an important research topic is the study of the impact of mutations in the treatment of complex diseases. Mutations have fundamental roles in evolution by introducing diversity into genomes, however, they can affect protein stability. Actually, researchers need accurate computational tools for prediction of how single point amino acid mutations affect the stability of a protein structure. Recent works show significant advances in predicting stability upon point mutation. This paper presents an evaluation of computational tools for thermodynamics and structural analysis of protein stability upon point mutation prediction. We choose to evaluate for thermodynamic analysis the software CUPSAT (Cologne University Protein Stability Analysis Tool) and mCSM (mutation Cutoff <b>Scanning</b> <b>Matrix),</b> and for structural analysis the software FoldX and Modeller. These software were chosen these software due to their popularity in this type of analyzes. In our proposed evaluation we verified the software outputs and evaluated the proximity to experimental results.

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} of binding affinity changes (ΔΔG) upon mutations in protein complexes relies {{not only on}} the performance of computational methods but also on the availability and quality of experimental data. Binding affinity changes can be measured by various experimental methods with different accuracies and limitations. To understand the impact of these on the {{prediction of}} binding affinity change, we present the Database of binding Affinity Change Upon Mutation (DACUM), a database of 1872 binding affinity changes upon single-point mutations, a subset of the SKEMPI database (Moal,I. H. and Fernández-Recio,J. Bioinformatics, 2012; 28 : 2600 - 2607) extended with information on the experimental methods used for ΔΔG measurements.

40|$|Abstract Background The unforgiving pace {{of growth}} of {{available}} biological data has increased the demand for efficient and scalable paradigms, models and methodologies for automatic annotation. In this paper, we present a novel structure-based protein function prediction and structural classification method: Cutoff <b>Scanning</b> <b>Matrix</b> (CSM). CSM generates feature vectors that represent distance patterns between protein residues. These feature vectors are then used as evidence for classification. Singular value decomposition {{is used as a}} preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality and noise. The aspect of protein function considered in the present work is enzyme activity. A series of experiments was performed on datasets based on Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and mechanistically different enzyme superfamilies as well as other datasets derived from SCOP release 1. 75. Results CSM was able to achieve a precision of up to 99 % after SVD preprocessing for a database derived from manually curated protein superfamilies and up to 95 % for a dataset of the 950 most-populated EC numbers. Moreover, we conducted experiments to verify our ability to assign SCOP class, superfamily, family and fold to protein domains. An experiment using the whole set of domains found in last SCOP version yielded high levels of precision and recall (up to 95 %). Finally, we compared our structural classification results with those in the literature to place this work into context. Our method was capable of significantly improving the recall of a previous study while preserving a compatible precision level. Conclusions We showed that the patterns derived from CSMs could effectively be used to predict protein function and thus help with automatic function annotation. We also demonstrated that our method is effective in structural classification tasks. These facts reinforce the idea that the pattern of inter-residue distances is an important component of family structural signatures. Furthermore, singular value decomposition provided a consistent increase in precision and recall, which makes it an important preprocessing step when dealing with noisy data. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} algorithms for a multicore {{environment in}} which each core has its own private cache and false sharing can occur. False sharing happens when two or more processors access the same block (i. e., cache-line) in parallel, {{and at least one}} processor writes into a location in the block. False sharing causes different processors to have inconsistent views of the data in the block, and many of the methods currently used to resolve these inconsistencies can cause large delays. We analyze the cost of false sharing both for variables stored on the execution stacks of the parallel tasks and for output variables. Our main technical contribution is to establish a low cost for this overhead for the class of multithreaded blockresilient HBP (Hierarchical Balanced Parallel) computations. Using this and other techniques, we develop block-resilient HBP algorithms with low false sharing costs for several fundamental problems including <b>scans,</b> <b>matrix</b> multiplication, FFT, sorting, and hybrid block-resilient HBP algorithms for list ranking and graph connected components. Most of these algorithms are derived from known multicore algorithms, but are further refined to achieve a low false sharing overhead. Our algorithms make no mention of machine parameters, and our analysis of the false sharing overhead is mostly in terms of the the number of tasks generated in parallel during the computation, and thus applies to a variety of schedulers.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{laser scanning}} methodology {{applied to the}} study of a gothic stained-glass window: the work can help understanding how glass objects are measured by laser scanner, conforming to more parameters. A glass window from King’s Chapel, Cambridge (UK) was modelled: a vertical ensemble, divided into more parts, made of glass, coloured during its realisation or coloured before being placed on the wall. Thus, a different sensitivity to laser beam is expected from glass. The acquisition was performed using Konica Minolta Vivid 910, with a 5 x 8 <b>scan</b> <b>matrix.</b> Registration via ICP algorithm was carried in 8 horizontal stripes. Scans seem to be quite homogeneous, except some lacunas, probably depending on a “brownout-effect ” induced by the presence of stain structure, partly obscuring glass surface. Otherwise they could be depending on local condition of glass, causing loose of signal from the surface. Some details show a particular noise in the acquisition, probably caused by an outdoor metal scaffolding, especially in more transparent areas. A comparison with the acquisition of an object protected by a glass showcase is illustrated too, to study the response of glass material. It was argued that glass painted with non covering colours is more sensitive to such object while covering colours (or coloured glass) “stop ” laser beam and give no noise. Besides with painted sheets, a 3 D laser scanning model can give a sub-millimetrical mapping with the thickness of colour layers: thus, noise induced by the metal scaffolding can be evaluated too. 1...|$|R
