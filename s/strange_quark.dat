25|$|The eta meson is a meson {{made of a}} mix of up quark, down quark, <b>strange</b> <b>quark,</b> quarks, and anti-quarks. It was {{discovered}} by a team at the University of California, Berkeley using the Bevatron.|$|E
25|$|When Nf=2, i.e., {{only the}} up and down quarks are treated as massless, the three pions are the Goldstone bosons. When the <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> is also treated as massless, i.e., , all eight pseudoscalar mesons of the quark model become Goldstone bosons. The actual masses of these mesons are {{obtained}} in chiral perturbation theory through an expansion in the (small) actual masses of the quarks.|$|E
25|$|In {{particle}} physics, a kaon , {{also called}} a K meson and denoted , and θ+, {{as it was}} supposed to be two different particles until the 1960s. See the parity violation section. is any of a group of four mesons distinguished by a quantum number called strangeness. In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> (or antiquark) and an up or down antiquark (or quark).|$|E
50|$|Isospin {{symmetry}} can {{be generalized}} to flavour symmetry, an SU(3) group corresponding to the similarity between up quarks, down <b>quarks,</b> and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks.</b> This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions—in fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the <b>strange</b> <b>quark's</b> noticeably higher mass.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{particle}} is the analogous state {{made from}} <b>strange</b> <b>quarks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and the study}} of the properties of quark-gluon plasma can be undertaken using quarks not present in matter seen around us. The experimental and theoretical work relies on the idea of strangeness enhancement. This was the first observable of quark-gluon plasma proposed in 1980 by Johann Rafelski and Rolf Hagedorn. Unlike the up and down <b>quarks,</b> <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> are not brought into the reaction by the colliding nuclei. Therefore, any <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> or antiquarks observed in experiments have been [...] "freshly" [...] made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the mass of <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other hadrons dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.|$|R
25|$|Although isospin {{symmetry}} is very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to {{the much}} higher mass of the <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> compared to the up and down. The discovery of charm, bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, but the very large masses of these quarks make such symmetries almost useless. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, isospin symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.|$|E
500|$|The symbols {{encountered}} in these lists are: I (isospin), J (total angular momentum), P (parity), u (up quark), d (down quark), s (<b>strange</b> <b>quark),</b> c (charm quark), b (bottom quark), Q (charge), B (baryon number), S (strangeness), C (charm), B′ (bottomness), {{as well as}} a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name). (See the baryon article for a detailed explanation of these symbols.) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Strange</b> <b>quarks</b> also bind {{with the}} heavier charm and bottom quarks which {{also like to}} bind with each other. Thus in {{presence}} {{of a large number}} of these quarks quite unusually abundant exotic particles can be produced, some of these have never been observed before. This should be the case in the forthcoming exploration at the new Large Hadron Collider at CERN of the particles that have both charm and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks,</b> and even bottom quarks as components.|$|R
5000|$|Jaffe 1977 {{suggested}} the H dibaryon, a six-quark state with {{equal numbers of}} up-, down-, and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> (represented as uuddss or udsuds).|$|R
2500|$|... {{neutrally}} charged (antiparticle of above) (containing a <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> and a down antiquark) has {{the same}} mass.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the charm}} quark was {{discovered}} in 1974, it was noticed that the down and <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> could decay into either the up or charm quark, leading to two sets of equations: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November 2014, the LHCb {{experiment}} {{announced the}} discovery of two new heavy subatomic particles, [...] and [...] Both of them are baryons that are composed of one bottom, one down, and one <b>strange</b> <b>quark.</b> They are excited states of the bottom Xi baryon.|$|E
5000|$|Hypercharge was {{a concept}} {{developed}} in the 1960s, to organize groups of particles in the [...] "particle zoo" [...] and to develop ad hoc conservation laws based on their observed transformations. With {{the advent of the}} quark model, it is now obvious that (if one only includes the up, down and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> out of the total 6 quarks in the Standard Model), hypercharge Y is the following combination of the numbers of up (nu), down (nd), <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> (ns), charm quarks (nc), top quarks (nt) and bottom quarks (nb): ...|$|R
25|$|Hyperons, {{such as the}} Λ, Σ, Ξ, and Ω particles, {{which contain}} one or more <b>strange</b> <b>quarks,</b> are {{short-lived}} and heavier than nucleons. Although not normally present in atomic nuclei, they can appear in short-lived hypernuclei.|$|R
50|$|One cannot {{assume that}} under all {{conditions}} the yield of <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> is in thermal equilibrium. In general, the quark-flavor {{composition of the}} plasma varies during its ultra short lifetime as new flavors of quarks such as strangeness are cooked up inside. The up and down quarks from which normal matter is made are easily produced as quark-antiquark pairs in the hot fireball because they have small masses. On the other hand the next lightest <b>quark</b> flavor, <b>strange</b> <b>quarks,</b> will reach its high quark-gluon plasma thermal abundance only on the most violent collisions generating high temperatures and {{that at the end}} of the cooking process.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{different}} {{standard model}} fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the electron and the down quark, the muon and the <b>strange</b> <b>quark,</b> and the tau lepton {{and the bottom}} quark for [...] and [...] Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most don't (see Georgi-Jarlskog mass relation).|$|E
2500|$|All three bosons have {{particle}} spin s=1. The {{emission of}} a [...] or [...] boson either raises or lowers the electric {{charge of the}} emitting particle by one unit, and also alters the spin by one unit. At the same time, the emission or absorption of a W boson can change the type of the particle – for example changing a <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> into an up quark. The neutral Z boson cannot change the electric charge of any particle, nor can it change any other of the so-called [...] "charges" [...] (such as strangeness, baryon number, charm, etc.). The emission or absorption of a Z boson can only change the spin, momentum, and energy of the other particle. (See also weak neutral current.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top quark}} interacts {{primarily}} by the strong interaction, but can only decay through the weak force. [...] It decays to a W boson and either a bottom quark (most frequently), a <b>strange</b> <b>quark,</b> or, on the rarest of occasions, a down quark. [...] The Standard Model predicts its mean lifetime to be roughly [...] This is about a twentieth of the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not form hadrons, giving physicists {{a unique opportunity to}} study a [...] "bare" [...] quark (all other quarks hadronize, meaning that they combine with other quarks to form hadrons, and can only be observed as such). Because it is so massive, the properties of the top quark allow predictions to be made of the mass of the Higgs boson under certain extensions of the Standard Model (see Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson below). As such, it is extensively studied as a means to discriminate between competing theories.|$|E
50|$|In {{particle}} physics, a hyperon is any baryon containing {{one or more}} <b>strange</b> <b>quarks,</b> but no charm, bottom, or top quark. This form {{of matter}} may exist in a stable form within the core of some neutron stars.|$|R
500|$|The <b>strange</b> <b>quark's</b> {{existence}} was indirectly validated by SLAC's scattering experiments: {{not only was}} it a necessary component of Gell-Mann and Zweig's three-quark model, but it provided an explanation for the kaon (...) and pion (...) hadrons discovered in cosmic rays in 1947.|$|R
40|$|Based on the quark {{coalescence}} {{model for}} the parton-to-hadron phase transition in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, we relate the elliptic flow (v_ 2) of high hadrons to that of high quarks. For high hadrons produced from an isospin symmetric and quark-antiquark symmetric partonic matter, magnitudes of their elliptic flows follow a flavor ordering as (v_ 2,π=v_ 2,N) > (v_ 2,Λ=v_ 2,Σ) > v_ 2,K > v_ 2,Ξ > (v_ 2,ϕ=v_ 2,Ω) if <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> have a smaller elliptic flow than light quarks. The elliptic flows of high hadrons further follow a simple quark counting rule if <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> and light quarks have same high spectrum and coalescence probability.

50|$|Strange stars {{might exist}} without regard of the Bodmer-Witten {{assumption}} of stability at near-zero temperatures and pressures, as <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> matter might form and remain stable {{at the core}} of neutron stars, {{in the same way as}} ordinary quark matter could. Such strange stars will naturally have a crust layer of neutron star material. The depth of the crust layer will depend on the physical conditions and circumstances of the entire star and on the properties of <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> matter in general. Stars partially made up of quark matter (including <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> matter) are also referred to as hybrid stars.|$|E
50|$|For a <b>strange</b> <b>quark,</b> with charge −1/3, a baryon {{number of}} 1/3 and strangeness of −1 {{we get a}} hypercharge Y = −2/3, so we deduce an I3 = 0. That means that a <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> makes a singlet of its own (same happens with charm, bottom and top quarks), while up and down {{constitute}} an isospin doublet.|$|E
5000|$|... and [...] mesons {{contain a}} bottom quark {{along with a}} charm quark or <b>strange</b> <b>quark</b> respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Unless specified, the non-up/down quark {{content of}} Xi baryons is strange (i.e. {{there is one}} up or down <b>quark</b> and two <b>strange</b> <b>quarks).</b> However a [...] {{contains}} one up, one strange, and one bottom quark, while a [...] contains one up and two bottom quarks.|$|R
50|$|Strangeness {{production}} is a signature and a diagnostic tool of quark-gluon plasma (or QGP) formation and properties. Unlike {{up and down}} quarks, from which everyday matter is made, <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> are formed in pair-production processes in collisions between constituents of the plasma. The dominant mechanism of production involves gluons only present when matter has become a quark-gluon plasma. When quark-gluon plasma disassembles into hadrons in a breakup process, the high availability of strange antiquarks helps to produce antimatter containing multiple <b>strange</b> <b>quarks,</b> which is otherwise rarely made. Similar considerations are at present made for the heavier charm flavor, which is made {{at the beginning of}} the collision process in the first interactions and is only abundant in the high-energy environments of CERN's Large Hadron Collider.|$|R
50|$|Its {{existence}} (along {{with that}} of the down and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks)</b> was postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of hadrons. The up quark was first observed by experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968.|$|R

25|$|In {{the rare}} {{case of a}} hypernucleus, a third baryon called a hyperon, {{containing}} one or more <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> and/or other unusual quark(s), can also share the wave function.

40|$|Nuclear {{collisions}} recreate {{conditions in}} the universe microseconds after the Big Bang. Only a very {{small fraction of the}} emitted fragments are light nuclei, but these states are of fundamental interest. We report the observation of antihypertritons - composed of an antiproton, antineutron, and antilambda hyperon - produced by colliding gold nuclei at high energy. Our analysis yields 70 +- 17 antihypertritons and 157 +- 30 hypertritons. The measured yields of hypertriton (antihypertriton) and helium 3 (antihelium 3) are similar, suggesting an equilibrium in coordinate and momentum space populations of up, down, and <b>strange</b> <b>quarks</b> and antiquarks, unlike the pattern observed at lower collision energies.
