5|$|Daughter of the Chedi king, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparichara Vasu) and a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) turned fish called Adrika, Satyavati {{was brought up}} as a commoner. She is the adopted {{daughter}} of a fisherman chieftain, Dusharaj (also a ferryman) {{on the banks of}} the river Yamuna. Due to the smell emanating from her body, she was known as Matsyagandha ("She who <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> fish"), and helped her father in his job as a ferryman.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E

25|$|Carvone forms two {{mirror image}} forms or enantiomers: R-(–)-carvone <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> {{spearmint}} leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> caraway seeds. The {{fact that the}} two enantiomers are perceived as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also {{been found to be}} able to discriminate between carvone enantiomers.|$|E

It was produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The release represents an era of the band full of drugs, abuses, tours, sound experiments, and references the Child Catcher, a villain from the 1968 musical film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.|$|E

25|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is {{a disease}} of the vagina caused by {{excessive}} growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally, {{there may be no}} symptoms. Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.|$|E

In 1999 he remade director Nobuo Nakagawa's famous film Hell (Jigoku; 1960), using the trial of Aum sect leader Shoko Asahara as an inspiration. Ishii's last film, The Blind Beast Vs The Dwarf (2001) was another {{based on the work}} of Edogawa Rampo.|$|E

25|$|Wife and I are come {{to settle}} here. We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, {{goes down to}} it in ships; to and fro {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; {{so that when he}} comes to it at last, it <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|E

25|$|Amortentia {{is a love}} potion {{that does}} not create actual love, but gives the drinker a {{powerful}} obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. As {{a rule of thumb}} the longer a love potion awaits consumption, the stronger the effects will be, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Ron Weasley mistakenly eats a box of Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with the intense love potion intended for Harry previously bought from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The potion's aroma is unique to each person who consumes it, as it <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> whatever attracts each individual, e.g. Hermione Granger says that she smells spearmint toothpaste, freshly cut grass and a piece of fresh parchment in the movies. In the books, she does not say spearmint toothpaste as the third aroma but instead blushes. (she smelled Ron's hair according to later clarification by the author). It can also be identified by its characteristic spirals of steam and its mother-of-pearl sheen, as noted by Hermione. Unless constantly administered, its effects eventually wear off.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said <b>smells</b> <b>like</b> rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, to {{continue}} promoting the album, the band started a South American tour, passing over Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador. Right after {{coming back to}} Europe, the band presented a semi-acoustic Dutch theater tour in March 2012, called Sanctuary, much like their previous live album An Acoustic Night at the Theatre in which they played many songs never played before like Say My Name, The Last Dance, Overcome, Bittersweet and some that they don't play often like Restless, Sounds Of Freedom, The Swan Song and Our Farewell. Most of them were played in acoustic version. On the 8th of May, 2012 Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie appeared on DWDD Recordings to perform an acoustic cover of Nirvana's song <b>Smells</b> <b>Like</b> Teen Spirit. The band embarked on a second leg of festivals, headlining several of the biggest European 2012 Summer Festivals, such as Sonisphere, Masters of Rock, Rock Werchter, Summerbreeze and Gods of Metal. Later, the band officially announced a very special show called Elements. The sold out special show celebrated the band's 15 year anniversary at the Sportpaleis, Belgium, and the band was accompanied by the Il Novecentro Orchestra and other special guests, such as band's ex-members.|$|E
