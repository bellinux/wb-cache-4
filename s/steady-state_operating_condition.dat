The different sources of irreversible losses, such as the electrochemical reaction, electric resistances, finite-rate heat transfer between the fuel cell and the heat engine, and heat-leak from the fuel cell to the environment are specified and investigated. Energy and entropy analyses are used to indicate the multi-irreversible losses and to assess the work potentials of the hybrid system. Expressions for the power output and efficiency of the hybrid system are derived and the performance characteristics of the system are presented and discussed in detail. The effects of the design parameters and operating conditions on the system performance are studied numerically. It is found that there exist certain optimum criteria for some important parameters. The results obtained here may provide a theoretical basis for both the optimal design and operation of real fuel cell-heat engine hybrid systems.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{controller}} with fixed modu-lation index (MI) {{and variable}} dc capacitor voltage reference to minimize {{voltage and current}} harmonics is presented for a distribution static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The STATCOM with the proposed controller consists of a three-phase voltage-sourced inverter and a dc capacitor and is used to provide reactive power compensation and regulate ac system bus voltage with minimum harmonics. A systematic design procedure based on pole-zero cancellation, root locus method, and pole assignment method has been developed to determine proper parameters for the current regulator, the dc voltage controller, and the ac volt-age controller of the STATCOM. With the proposed STATCOM controller, harmonic distortions in the inverter output current and voltage can be reduced since the MI is held constant at unity in steady state. In addition, a fast adjustment in the STATCOM output reactive power is achieved to regulate the ac bus voltage through the adjustment of the dc voltage reference during the transient period.

40|$|Simulation of {{high speed}} {{propulsion}} systems may {{be divided into}} two categories, nonlinear and linear. The nonlinear simulations are usually based on multidimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies and tend to provide high resolution results that show the fine detail of the flow. Consequently, these simulations are large, numerically intensive, and run much slower than real-time. ne linear simulations are usually based on large lumping techniques that are linearized about a <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> These simplistic models often run at or near real-time but do not always capture the detailed dynamics of the plant.

To detect the highest power that the woofer can run, two different phenomena must be considered. The amplification circuit is designed for amplifying music, while working with a monotone high-amplitude signal is harder. In order to ensure circuit safety, the temperature of Darlington transistors was monitored with an IR pyrometer, and the test was stopped every time the superficial transistor temperature was higher than 90 °C. To keep the system working in linear conditions, as suggested by [1], it is important to increase the power until a second harmonic is barely audible. Once the highest admissible power tolerable by all the resonators was reached, the test was started. The first test compared the different stack design, then the best stack design was built in two diameters in order to compare the resonator with the influence of resonator diameter on refrigerator performance. All the tests were run, fixing the working power at an RMS of 30 W. All the tube lengths were set at 225 mm with a respective resonating frequency of 383 Hz.|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} motor is without doubt {{the most widely}} used form of electric power device in any modem power system, giving power to millions of homes, farms and factories all over the world. The early detection of developing machine faults can therefore be vital if the costs of lost production arising from motor failures are to be avoided. Traditional induction machine condition monitoring techniques usually involve the use of sensors embedded in the machine to measure, for example, temperature or vibration. There has also been considerable interest in detecting winding and other machine faults by examination of terminal current waveforms using data gathered under <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> and may involve the calculation of quantities such as input power or negative sequence components. Recent trends in condition monitoring also include the detection of machine faults using data acquired during speed transients. A different approach for machine condition monitoring and fault identification using terminal and rotor speed data is presented in this thesis. In this method, a stochastic search is carried out to estimate values of machine parameters which give the best possible match between the performance of the faulty experimental machine and its mathematical model, thus identifying both the location and nature of the winding fault. The performance of three stochastic search methods, Simulated Annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO), ABSTRACT when used for condition monitoring of the stator and rotor windings of a three-phase Induction Motor (IM), is evaluated in this thesis. The proposed condition monitoring technique uses time domain terminal voltage and current data in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to indicate the presence of a winding fault and provide information about its nature and location. The technique is demonstrated using experimental data from a laboratory general machine set. In order to verify the proposed fault detection technique, experimental tests were carried out simulating different potential {{induction motor}} winding faults under different operation conditions. In this method, stator currents are calculated using an ABC-abc induction motor model and compared to the actual measured currents to produce a set of current errors that are integrated then summed to give an overall error function. Fault identification is carried out by adjusting the model parameters off-line, using the stochastic search method to minimize the error. The new set of model parameters then defines the nature and location of the fault. Unlike many other methods, the new stochastic search based approach does not require any expert prior knowledge of the type of fault or its location; both are identified {{as an integral part of}} the optimisation process.

The cable model is undergrounded system, making it ideal for the harmonics studies. A flexible approach to the modelling of the frequency dependent part provides information about possible harmonic excitations and the voltage waveform during a transient. The power line is modelled by means of lumped-parameters model and also describes the long line effect. The modelling depth and detail of the cable model influences the simulation results. It compares two models, first where an approximate model which make use of complex penetration is used and the second where an Bessel function model with internal impedance is used. The both models incorporate DC resistance, skin effect and their harmonic performances are investigated for <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> The methods illustrate the impotance of including detailed representation of the skin effect in the power line and cable models, even when ground mode exists. The cable model exhibit lower harmonics comparable to overhead transmission lines due to strong influence of the ground mode. Due to the application of voltage source converter (VSC) technology and pulse width modulation (PWM) the VSC-HVDC {{has a number of}} potential advantages as compared with CSC-HVDC, such as short circuit current reduction, independent control of active power and reactive power, etc. With these advantages VSC-HVDC will likely be widely used in future oil and gas transmission and distribution systems. Modular multilevel PWM converter applies modular approach and phase-shifted concepts achieving a number of advantages to be use in HVDC power transmission. This thesis describes the VSC three-phase full-bridge design of sub-module in modular multilevel converter (MMC). The main research efforts focus on harmonic reduction using IGBTs switches, which has ON and OFF capability. The output voltage waveforms multilevel are obtained using pulse width modulation (PWM) control. The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) MMC is used to investigate for two-level, five-level, seven-level, nine-level converter staircase waveforms. The results show that the harmonics are further reduced as the sub-module converter increases. The steady-state simulation model of the oil platform for harmonic studies has been developed using MATLAB. In order to save computational time aggregated models are used. The load on the platforms consists of passive loads, induction motors, and a constant power load representing variable speed drives on the platforms. The wind farm consists of a wind turbine and an induction machine operating at fixed speed using a back-to-back VSC. Simulations are performed on system harmonics that are thought to be critical for the operation of the system. The simulation cases represent large and partly exaggerated disturbances in order to test the limitations of the system. The results show low loss, low harmonics, and stable voltage and current. With the developments of multilevel VSC technology in this thesis, multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) systems integrating modular multilevel converters at all nodes may be more easily designed. It is shown that self-commutated Voltage Source Converters (VSC) is more flexible than the more conventional Current Source Converter (CSC) since active and reactive powers are controlled independently. The space required by the equipment of this technology is smaller when compared to the space used by the CSCs. In addition, the installation and maintenance costs are reduced. With these advantages, it will be possible for several oil and gas production fields connected together by multi-terminal DC grid. With this development the platforms will not only share energy from the wind farms, but also provide cheaper harmonic mitigation solutions. The model of a multi-terminal hypothetical power system consisting of three oil and gas platforms and two offshore wind farm stations without a common connection to the onshore power grid is studied. The connection to the onshore grid is realized through a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmissions system based on Voltage Source Converter (VSC) technology. The proposed models address a wide array of harmonic mitigation solutions, i. e., (i) Local harmonic mitigation (ii) semi-global harmonic mitigation and (iii) global harmonic mitigation. In addition, a computationally-efficient technique is proposed and implemented to impose the operating constraints of the VSC and the host IGBT-PWM switches {{within the context of the}} developed harmonic power flow (HPF). Novel closed forms for updating the corresponding VSC power and voltage reference set-points are proposed to guarantee that the power-flow solution fully complies with the VSC constraints.

The NN simulator was able to perform calculations in a really short computing time {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, predicting various <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> on the basis of inputs that can be easily obtained,vith existing plant instrumentation. The optimization of NN parameters like number of hidden neurons, training sample size, and learning I ate is discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector (CLFR) is a linear-concentrating {{solar thermal}} energy system {{currently}} in the prototype stage at the Liddell power station in the Hunter Valley, NSW. A system-level thermo-fluidic model for the CLFR has been developed in order to predict <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> required pumping power and pressure, mass transfer around the system and likely start-up, shutdown and cloud transient effects. Flow regimes within the absorber at different irradiance level are found. The interaction of the absorber pressure, irradiance and pump speed is discussed. A simple model for steady-state system pressure is presented, built around an assumed controller that maintains the absorber steam exit quality as 80 %. Finally, a more complex steady-state model, in which the total mass of fluid in the system is used to drive fluctuations in system pressure, is presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we are {{interested}} to simulate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of three-pass type fire-tube boiler. The plant is designed to produce 4. 5 tons per hour of saturated steam at 8 bar destined principally for heating applications. A calculation program is developed in order to simulate the boiler operation under several <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This program is based upon heat transfer laws between hot gases and the fire-tube internal walls. In the boiler combustion chamber, the heat transfer has been simulated using the well-stirred furnace model. In the convection section, heat balance {{has been carried out}} to estimate the heat exchanges between the hot gases and the tube banks. The obtained results are compared to the <b>steady-state</b> <b>operating</b> data of the considered plant. A comparative analysis shows that the calculation results are in good agreement with the boiler operating data. Furthermore, a sensitivity study has been carried out to assess the effects of input parameters, namely the fuel flow rate, air excess, ambient temperature, and operating pressure, upon the boiler thermal performances...|$|R
