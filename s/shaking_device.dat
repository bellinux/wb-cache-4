5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have {{constructed}} a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, {{when not in}} thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work {{by means of a}} granular gas, which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. [...] Because the ratchet's gear and pawl mechanism, as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation. [...] The experiment was filmed.|$|E

Current methods available for measuring the dynamic charging of bulk powders are unsuitable for testing/handling small quantities of powders, some of which are highly active. Furthermore, very little work has been reported on the effect of tribo-electrification on the segregation of components of mixtures. A methodology has recently been developed for investigating the tribo-electrification of small quantities of bulk powders using a <b>shaking</b> <b>device.</b> Two common pharmaceutical excipients, namely α -lactose monohydrate (α -LM) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were used as model materials. The electric charge transferred to the particles was quantified as a function of shaking time,frequency and container material. The temporal trend follows a first-order rate process. Using numerical simulations based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM), the charge accumulation of an assemblage of alumina beads inside the <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> was analysed based on the single particle contact charge obtained from the experiments. It was shown that the inclusion of electrostatic mechanisms into the DEM model leads to an improved prediction of the charge buildup, but the difference with experimental data is still notable. Using the above method, segregation induced by tribo-electric charging was characterised for binary mixtures comprising α -LM and HPC. The bulk and wall-adhered particles were analysed for the mass fraction of each component using selective dissolution of one component and filtration of the non-dissolving component, followed by a gravimetric analysis.

Secure device pairing is {{especially}} difficult for spontaneous interaction in ubiquitous computing environments because of wireless communication, lack of powerful user interfaces, and scalability issues. We demonstrate {{a method to}} address this problem for small, mobile devices that does not require explicit user interfaces like displays or key pads. By <b>shaking</b> <b>devices</b> together in one hand for a few seconds, they are securely paired. Device authentication happens implicitly as part of the pairing process without the need for explicit user interaction “just for security”.

40|$|Powder {{handling}} operations {{can give}} rise to the electrification of particles therein, causing particles {{to adhere to the}} walls of processing equipment. This can lead to a loss of powder through deposition; however the problem often extends further and affects the end products’ quality. Segregation can also occur when powders have been subjected to tribo-electrification. The existing literature reveals that the few methods that are available to predict the dynamic charging of bulk powders are unsuitable for testing/handling small quantities of powders, some of which are highly active. Furthermore, very little work has been reported on the effect of triboelectrification on the segregation of components of mixtures. The objective of this work is to develop a methodology for investigating the triboelectrification of small quantities of bulk powders through the adaptation of a Retsch® <b>shaking</b> <b>device,</b> with the aim of characterising two common pharmaceutical excipients; namely alpha-lactose monohydrate (a-LM) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The electric charge transferred to the particles has been quantified as a function of shaking time, frequency and container material. The temporal trend follows a first order rate process. Using numerical simulation based on Distinct Element Modelling, the transient charge accumulation of an assemblage of alumina beads inside the <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> was predicted based on the single particle contact charge obtained from the experiments. It is shown that the inclusion of electrostatic parameters into the DEM model leads to an acceptable prediction of the charge build-up. Binary mixtures comprising of a-LM and HPC were firstly tribo-charged and then the wall adhered particles were separated by a selective dissolution of one component and the filtration of the non-dissolving component, followed by a gravimetric analysis. The findings reveal that a considerable level of segregation can take place on the wall-adhered particles.

40|$|Tribo-electrification is an {{important}} phenomenon in powder handling, as it could cause hazards and nuisance, such as dust explosion, adhesion to walls and blockage of pipelines leading to powder losses and difficulties in flow control. At present, {{there are only a}} few methods available to predict the dynamic charging of bulk powders, and they are not suitable for testing a small quantity of powders or handling highly active powders, for which full isolation would be needed. In this paper, the operation of a simple test device is analysed.

The single particle contact charge obtained from experiments is incorporated in numerical simulations based on Distinct Element Method (DEM) and is used to predict the transient charge accumulation of an assemblage of beads. In the model, the tribo-charging of a single bead is related to the contact area of the bead on impact with the capsule wall. The effects of long range forces, space charge and image charge at boundary condition are investigated for bulk charging.

40|$|The {{generally}} accepted view that alpha staphylolysin is thermolabile {{has recently been}} questioned by Smith. 2 " He further demonstrated that some samples of toxin were rendered inactive by heating at 60 ° C. for 30 minutes, yet retained considerable lytic activity when heated {{for the same period}} at 80 °. The thermostability of staphylolysin during certain stages of its evolution in shake cultures, as well as the phenomenon of greater stability at higher than at lower temperatures, have been fully confirmed. The present report is concerned with an attempt to elucidate further the mechanisms underlying this unusual behavior toward heat. General Methods Alpha staphylolysin of the Wood 46 strain was produced by a modification of the method of Casman, 6 consisting in the agitation of the culture throughout its period of incubation. Both a relatively slow, vacuum-driven rocking type of <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> and a more rapid motor-driven shaker operating in the horizontal plane only were employed. All cultures were grown at 37. 5 ° C., usually on heart infusion broth with physiological saline and 1 per cent neopeptone at an initial pH of 7. 2 - 7. 4. The hemolysin tests were carried out in an open water-bath at a temperature of 400, using thricewashed rabbit cells suspended in physiological saline. The degree of hemolysis was estimated on a scale of 4 + for the maximum at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, as well as after refrigeration overnight. Whenever numerical representations for hemolysin titers are given, they consist in an expression of the velocity of the reaction during the first hour of observation in the waterbath, and are calculated according to the method of Smith, 2 ' representing the summation of the reciprocal values of the time by the degree of lysis at the stated intervals.

Kinetics of dry rupture of {{bacterial}} spores {{in the presence}} of salt. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 952 – 960. 1964. —The kinetics of breaking spores in the dry state by use of an excess of sodium chloride and a steel ball in a <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> were investigated. Under most conditions, disruption is a first-order process. The disruption-rate constant varies directly with the weight of the ball and inversely with the weight of the capsule contents (spores plus salt). Different spore batches differ somewhat in susceptibility to dry rupture. The dry-rupture process is highly reproducible and it is relatively simple to obtain preparations in which exactly 50 %, or 90 %, of the spores are broken. The procedure is uniquely suited to the disruption of small (5 to 20 mg) samples, but 150 mg of spores have been handled with conventional equipment. Apparently, the chief function of the salt is to separate the spores from one another with a relatively hard, energy-nonabsorbing matrix, preventing aggregation and consequent cushioning of the ball's impact. However, under certain conditions (small ball, high salt, large crystals) appreciable breakage results from collisions of spores with the salt crystals. The minimal salt-spore ratio for efficient breakage depends on the spore batch, but is usually greater than 3 : 1. Fine glass beads or inorganic salts other than sodium chloride will also serve as the matrix. Electron micrographs of the spores in various stages of disruption are shown, as are electron micrographs of the spore coats of Bacillus macerans, B. megaterium, B. cereus, B. coagulans, and Clostridium bifermentans. Prolonged agitation disintegrates spore coats. The spore coats of B. macerans exhibit a characteristic ribbed structure, previously detected only by carbon replicas of intact spores.

40|$|Runoff from paved {{surfaces}} {{in the urban}} environment is recognised as a major contributing source to deteriorated water quality. In stormwater, both various metals and organic compounds can be present {{and the quality of}} stormwater is dependent on e. g. the characteristics of the surfaces that the runoff encounters. Diffuse pollution sources, i. e. anthropogenic emissions from e. g. traffic or constructions, has been pointed out by the European Water Framework Directive to significantly contribute to pollution of stormwater receivers. In order to create and obtain a sustainable, liveable and aesthetical urban environment it is critical to be able to mitigate stormwater pollution, not least considering the increasing amount of stormwater due to climate change. The aim of this master’s thesis was to evaluate the potential release of inorganic- and organic stormwater pollutants from conventional roofing materials by laboratory leaching experiments. The study was mainly aimed to serve as a first screening on the roofing materials, {{in order to be able}} to select a number of materials for further investigation later on. The organic compounds included in this study were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nonylphenols and -ethoxylates, phthalates and herbicides. Previous research on stormwater pollution has mainly focused on metals and there is therefore a knowledge gap on organic compounds in urban runoff. The leaching experiments were designed considering previous similar studies. Synthetic rainwater was prepared based on measurements of rainwater quality in Sweden. Duplicates of 16 commonly used roofing materials were prepared and immersed in beakers of synthetic rainwater. The beakers were agitated on an orbital <b>shaking</b> <b>device</b> for 24 hours and pH as well as conductivity was recorded in the leachates before sending the samples to the contracted laboratory for analysis. Metals were analysed on all materials and the organic compound analyses were performed on selected materials based on each material’s composition and was limited with the substance’s probability to release from each material. From the analysis results, mean values for the leached concentrations of all duplicates were calculated. The annual potential release of substances from materials was estimated based on the leached concentrations and data on the average annual precipitation in Sweden, in order to get an indication of the order of magnitude of the pollutant release. The results showed a potential release of a number of the included substances from many of the studied roofing materials, in varying order of magnitude. The shingle roofing was the material that showed the ability to release the largest number of pollutants. Some materials e. g. the clay tile also showed potential to adsorb substances on the material surface. Metals were mainly released in dissolved form from most materials. Phthalates were not present in concentrations above report limits in the leachates from any of the studied materials. The results also indicate a significant different in the release potential from materials that were considered similar in their composition and expected to have similar leaching behaviour prior to the laboratory experiments, e. g. two similar felt roof materials from different manufacturers.

30|$|During evaluation, we {{manually}} {{examine the}} assembly code of some apps that use accelerometer {{to understand why}} it is so popular. We find that a common usage of accelerometer in apps, like Booking and Tumblr, is to detect whether the user is <b>shaking</b> the <b>device.</b> To detect this high-level motion event, Android developers need to implement the algorithm based on raw sensor data by themselves. Unlike Android, iOS does not only provide raw sensor data to developers but also supports APIs to detect high-level motion events, like <b>device</b> <b>shaking,</b> in order to lighten developers’ burden. This strategy also reduces the risks of exposing users’ privacy because, for apps that reply on accelerometer only for detecting <b>device</b> <b>shaking,</b> they do not need to access raw data anymore. Instead, they only need to ask the system whether the <b>device</b> is <b>shaking</b> through the high-level APIs. We recommend Android to provide such high-level motion event APIs, which could also be applied to other sensors and their high-level motion events. These high-level APIs can also cooperate with the permission system, e.g., apps with permission.accelerometer_fine could retrieve raw sensor data while those with permission.accelerometer_coarse can only use high-level APIs.|$|R
