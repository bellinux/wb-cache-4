5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his <b>specific</b> <b>agreement</b> not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E

2500|$|Amongst {{those within}} RC who know about it, CCI {{is often seen}} as an [...] "attack organisation" [...] and was {{specifically}} condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a <b>specific</b> <b>agreement</b> not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron {{and many of his}} supporters claimed that RC was authoritarian and cult-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in sexual abuse of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a sexually-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and relationships.|$|E
2500|$|The Weavers {{were formed}} in 1947 by Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert, Lee Hays, and Fred Hellerman. After they [...] debuted at the Village Vanguard in New York in 1948, {{they were then}} {{discovered}} by arranger Gordon Jenkins and signed with Decca Records, releasing a series of successful but heavily orchestrated single songs. The group's political associations {{in the era of}} the Red Scare forced them to break up in 1952; they re-formed in 1955 with a series of successful concerts and album recordings on Vanguard Records. A fifth member, Erik Darling, sometimes sat in with the group when Seeger was unavailable and ultimately replaced Seeger in The Weavers when the latter resigned from the quartet in a dispute about its commercialism in general and its <b>specific</b> <b>agreement</b> to record a cigarette commercial.|$|E

The subpoena was served on Al-Arian in October 2006. He sought to quash it on the assertion that his plea agreement prevented his being forced to testify before the Virginia grand jury. He said the government had agreed {{that he would not be}} required to cooperate with it in any manner, though that <b>specific</b> <b>agreement</b> was not reflected in the written plea agreement. In a verbal agreement that he says appears in court transcripts, federal prosecutors agreed he would not have to testify in Virginia. Second, Al-Arian also said he refused to testify because he believed [...] "his life would be in danger if he testified." [...] Third, Al-Arian claimed he has no information that could further the investigation. Fourth, Al-Arian said he would not testify because he felt IIIT was inappropriately charged. When called before the grand jury on October 19, Al-Arian refused to answer questions about IIIT.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pressure}} to oust [...] "Indians" [...] from the American {{portion of the}} Red River Valley dated back well before Minnesota statehood (1858) to {{the early years of}} the Minnesota Territory. U.S. Army Major Samuel Woods, on his expedition in 1849 to locate a site on the Red River of the North for a military post, also was ordered to proceed further north to Pembina, where he was [...] "to hold conferences with the Indians and learn whether their lands in the Red River Valley may be purchased and opened for white settlement." [...] These instructions came directly from the Secretary of the Interior, Thomas Ewing, who, with the approval of President Zachary Taylor, suggested the United States should acquire the Indian lands so the area could be thrown open to agricultural settlement. After locating the site for what later became Fort Abercrombie, Major Woods continued downriver to Pembina, where he spent 25 days and met first with Dakota and then with Ojibwe and Métis half-breeds from the Pembina band as well as members of the Red River band, but reached no <b>specific</b> <b>agreement</b> for land cessions.|$|E
60|$|We held {{our little}} house on lease; {{the owner was}} a mean, saving old man named Pettigrew, {{who lived in a}} villa adorned with plaster images of dogs and goats, at Overcastle, and in spite of our <b>specific</b> <b>agreement,</b> he would do no repairs for us at all. He rested secure in my mother's timidity. Once, long ago, she had been behind-hand with her rent, with half of her quarter's rent, and he had {{extended}} the days of grace a month; her sense that some day she might need the same mercy again made her his abject slave. She was afraid even to ask that he should cause the roof to be mended for fear he might take offence. But one night the rain poured in on her bed and gave her a cold, and stained and soaked her poor old patchwork counterpane. Then she got me to compose an excessively polite letter to old Pettigrew, begging him as a favor to perform his legal obligations. It is part of the general imbecility of those days that such one-sided law as existed was a profound mystery to the common people, its provisions impossible to ascertain, its machinery impossible to set in motion. Instead of the clearly written code, the lucid statements of rules and principles that are now at the service of every one, the law was the muddle secret of the legal profession. Poor people, overworked people, had constantly to submit to petty wrongs because of the intolerable uncertainty not only of law but of cost, and of the demands upon time and energy, proceedings might make. There was indeed no justice for any one too poor to command a good solicitor's deference and loyalty; there was nothing but rough police protection and the magistrate's grudging or eccentric advice for the mass of the population. The civil law, in particular, was a mysterious upper-class weapon, and I can imagine no injustice that would have been sufficient to induce my poor old mother to appeal to it.|$|E

50|$|Friends {{groups are}} {{non-profit}} organizations that partner with public lands agencies to accomplish activities that typically benefit a specific park or public lands area.

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a <b>specific</b> <b>agreement,</b> when one party defaults on the loan, {{the other party}} may still {{be held responsible for}} repayment. Another disadvantage in comparison with currency swaps is that back-to-back loan transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their capitalization requirements, while currency swaps were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstream}} XML {{standards for}} interoperation of web services specify only syntactic interoperability, not the semantic meaning of messages.

This requires programmers to reach <b>specific</b> <b>agreements</b> on the interaction of web services and makes automatic web service composition difficult.|$|R
50|$|Especially when a {{separation}} is acrimonious to begin with, <b>specific</b> <b>agreements</b> about who will discharge these responsibilities and {{when and how}} they are to be discharged can reduce the need for litigation. Avoiding litigation spares parties not only the financial and emotional costs of litigation but the uncertainty of how favorable or unfavorable a court's after-the-fact decision will be. Moreover, the agreement itself can authorize the employment of dispute-resolution methods, such as arbitration and mediation, that are less costly than litigation.|$|R
