40|$|Ten adult buffalo {{heads were}} used in this study. Following skin removal, the length, width and {{thickness}} of the gland was measured. by ruler and caliper. Dye injection was used to distinguish the <b>sublingual</b> duct <b>papilla</b> and 1 cm sections from the gland were removed and fixed to prepare histologic sections for microscopic studies. The long, ribbon like and lobulated monostomatic part of the gland is situated underneath the tongue alongside the hypoglossus muscle. The average length, width and thickness of this part was 20. 6, 1. 01 and 1. 99 cm respectively. The polystomatic part was observed as small scattered fragments near the mucosa of the oral cavity. The average size of these fragments was approximately 0. 5 cm and the diffuseness of the polystomatic part in caudal region {{is more than the}} cranial region. The monostomatic part has a single duct which together with the mandibular salivary duct enters the sublingual caruncle. The minute polystomatic ducts open into the lateral sublingual recess and their number is equal to the number of scattered parts. Histologically, approximately 90 % of the secretory cells of this gland consist of mucous secreting cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{heads of}} ten adult camels {{were used in}} this study. Following skin removal, the length, width and {{thickness}} of the gland was measured by ruler and caliper. Dye injection was used to distinguish the <b>sublingual</b> duct <b>papilla</b> and 1 cm sections from the gland were removed and fixed to prepare histologic sections stained with H & E for microscopic studies. The long, ribbon like and lobulated monostomatic part of the gland is situated underneath the tongue alongside the hypoglossus muscle. This part of the gland begins from the mandibular symphysis and is continued caudally to near {{the root of the}} tongue. The average length, width and thickness of this part were 15. 2 ± 0. 02, 2. 2 ± 0. 03 and 0. 5 ± 0. 05 cm respectively. The polystomatic part was observed as scattered and lobulated near the submucosa and in front of the monostomatic part with decreasing concentration caudally. The average size of these fragments was approximately 0. 5 ± 0. 02 cm. The overall appearance of the gland was lobulated with a pink colour. The monostomatic part has a single duct entering the sublingual caruncle. The minute polystomatic ducts open into the depressions alongside the tongue inside the oral cavity. These ducts are numerous. Histologically, the gland is surrounded by a capsule of dense connective tissue. Trabcules from the capsule penetrate the gland and divide it into lobules. Loose connective tissue makes up the framework of the gland and there are tubulo-acinus glands in the spaces of this framework. Approximately 95 % of the secretory cells of this gland consist of mucous secreting cells. Myoepithelial cells are seen on the external surface of the secretory cells and also alongside the connecting ducts...|$|R
