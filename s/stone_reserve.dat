5000|$|Quilt {{complained of}} stomach pain {{that night and}} the {{following}} day, but refused to ride in an ambulance to Williams Lake's Cariboo Memorial Hospital (because the ambulance carried {{the body of a}} dead child). He instead went to the <b>Stone</b> <b>Reserve</b> until the following day when he was taken to Cariboo Memorial Hospital where he would die on November 30, 1971. [...] Before his death he told a nurse at the hospital that a RCMP officer jumped up and down on him a claim which was supported by Quilt's wife, Christine, and sister-in-law, Agnes. An autopsy performed by Dr. Han Choo Lee found that Quilt died from peritonitis due to [...] "complete severance of the small bowel".|$|E

50|$|There are two {{distinct}} and rich architectural traditions in Andhra Pradesh. The first traces {{back to the}} building of the city of Amaravathi under Satavahanas. This unique style of architecture emphasises the use of intricate and abstract sculpture with inspiration from religious themes. The second tradition draws on the enormous granite and lime <b>stone</b> <b>reserves</b> of the region and is reflected in the various temples and forts built over a very long period of time.|$|R
5000|$|Tadipatri {{is located}} at [...] Its average {{elevation}} is 223 metres or 731 feet. Tadipatri lies on the southern bank of Pennar River. Due to Mid Pennar Dam constructed upstream, the section of river in Tadipatri is usually dry throughout the year. Tadipatri is rich in cement grade limestone deposits. The lime <b>stone</b> <b>reserves</b> are extending in a triangle from Tadipatri in Anantapur district to Kamalapuram in Kadapa district and Bethamcherla in Kurnool district.|$|R
50|$|Urbanization is {{recorded}} in the region since the first millennium BCE. This {{was part of the}} second wave of urban civilization in the Indian subcontinent, following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. Ancient Bengal was part of a network of urban and trading hubs stretching to Ancient Persia. The archaeological sites of Mahasthangarh, Wari-Bateshwar ruins, Chandraketugarh and Mainamati provide evidence of a highly organized urban civilization in the region. Terracotta became a hallmark of Bengali construction, as the region lacked <b>stone</b> <b>reserves.</b> Bricks were produced with the clay of the Bengal delta.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is organized around a courtyard and a garden. The elevations are of brick, the <b>stone</b> is <b>reserved</b> for the frames of the bays, {{except for the}} south elevation of the court entirely in stone.|$|R
50|$|A {{few feet}} {{to the west of}} the monument, an {{additional}} granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a time capsule buried under the tablet, but spaces on the <b>stone</b> <b>reserved</b> for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened have not been inscribed, so it is uncertain if the time capsule was put in place.|$|R

50|$|The {{sarcophagus}} is massive {{with the}} chest measuring 128 cm or 4 ft 2 in high, 233 cm or 7 ft 7 in long, and 157 cm or 5 ft 1 in wide. It {{is made of}} porphyry, a hard purple <b>stone,</b> <b>reserved</b> by the Romans for use only by the imperial family, whose colour purple was. It was quarried from only one place, Mons Porphyriticus (Coptos, Egypt), making it even more exclusive. It appears, but can not be certain, that the sarcophagus of Constantina is a copy of that of Constantine I, her father, which is now lost. A piece of what {{is believed to be}} his sarcophagus is similar in style and of the same material. A cast replica has been placed in the church, though in the ambulatory; presumably its original position was in the centre of the church, now occupied by the altar. There is another in the Museum of Roman Civilization in the city.|$|R

5000|$|Beawar (...) {{is a city}} in Rajasthan, India. Beawar was the {{financial}} capital of Merwara (मेरवाड़ा) state of Rajputana. As of 2011, the population of Beawar is 342,935. It is located 184 km southwest of the state capital Jaipur, amidst Aravali hills. The city {{used to be a}} major center of trade, especially in raw cotton, and used to have cotton presses and the Krishna cotton mills. Currently, major industries include mineral-based units, machine-based units, machine tools and accessories, pre-stressed concrete pipes, plastic products, textiles, wooden furniture and asbestos cement pipes. Beawar is the largest producer of cement in northern India and home to Shree Cement. It lies in mineral-rich region having reserves of feldspar, quartz, asbestos, soapstone, magnesite, calcite, limestone, mica, emerald, granite, and masonry <b>stone.</b> <b>Reserves</b> of barytes, fluorite, wollastonite and vermiculite have also been found. Nearest airports are Jodhpur (145 km) and Jaipur (190 km). It is also connected by RSRTC operated buses to all parts of Rajasthan, and neighboring Delhi NCR, Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh). It also had railway connectivity with Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Bangalore (bi-weekly), Haridwar, Dehradun (weekly), Bareilly and Kolkatta.|$|R
50|$|The poet Spenser {{states that}} the custom amongst the Irish was to place {{the man who is}} to be chief upon a <b>stone,</b> always <b>reserved</b> for that purpose alone and located on a hill.

40|$|The {{globalization}} and saturated domestic markets force international firms to gradually expand their businesses across the borders to capture potential emerging markets. The decision {{to select a}} country for a new cement plant location demands analysis {{of a large number}} of factors. It is a multifaceted problem which requires investigation and prioritization of factors in a hierarchical way. This paper uses an FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) based procedure proposing a practical framework for solution of the GCPLP (Global Cement Plant Location Problem). It deals with real world ambiguities and handles a broader spectrum of influencing factors. The criteria for selection of a country for a new cement plant installation are prioritized from the FAHP based evaluation made by experts. Different global databases including the World Bank are used for the fuzzy ratings of the alternatives. It has been learnt in this particular problem that cement specific and cost related factors are the most sensitive while legal regulations and economic conditions are relatively less sensitive for the decision makers. Therefore, the countries having strong lime <b>stone</b> <b>reserves,</b> cheaper fuel costs and good internal marketing positions are higher in ranking. The paper concludes with different rankings of the four countries analyzed which assist the strategic managers in making decisions on the basis of mathematically computed results...|$|R

50|$|Bushland on {{the east}} side of the South Western Railway, {{opposite}} the townsite reserve and extending from the former <b>Stone</b> Street <b>reserve</b> to Eleventh Road, is a 19 ha reserve named Fletcher Park. This reserve has the Cooliabbera Creek running along its north-eastern boundary and is characterized by open forest of Marri (Corymbia calophylla) and dense shrubbery dominated by grass trees (Xanthorrhoea preissii and Kingia Australis). The Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda) also occurs in this area. From 1980, the 10 acre area through which the creek flows has been leased to the Wallangara Riding and Pony Club which has developed an arena, bridle trails, jumps and clubroom facilities on the site.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the materialization of human representations in Neolithic northern Greece {{and particularly the}} materials used in their production. Contending that materialization is contingent upon but not reducible to the materials used, an attempt is made to understand the implications of using different materials to represent humans, especially clay and stone. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} in the earlier Neolithic, clay and <b>stone</b> were <b>reserved</b> for different classes of artefacts. Human figures in this period show an interest in action, whereas in the later Neolithic, changes occur that suggest a preoccupation with the substance of the figures. It is suggested that these changes point to the emergence of different subjectivities during the later Neolithic...|$|R
25|$|East of the Unetice culture, in Lesser Poland {{and further}} {{north to the}} Masovia region, during roughly the same span of time, lay the {{territory}} of the Mierzanowice culture, named after the type-site village near Opatów. These people, culturally also descendants of the Corded Ware culture, at first lived as mobile cattle breeders, but around 2200 BC started building permanent settlements and engaged in agriculture as well. Mierzanowice culture was a conservative society, frequently still using <b>stone</b> tools and <b>reserving</b> copper for decorations.|$|R
50|$|Each village {{would send}} representatives {{to attend the}} ceremony; others {{performed}} various services, such as providing the stone against which the king sat to be anointed, called a pepe. Two stones are {{in the village of}} Alofi where Tui-toga and Fata-a-iki were anointed. They are rough flat coral rocks, about four feet high and two feet wide. One other pillar-like stone lies at Tuapa; it was twelve feet high, sixty feet long, and fifty feet wide, although history doesn't record which kings were anointed there. Seventy or eighty yards away were <b>stone</b> seats <b>reserved</b> for the council of chiefs. Only the last three Niuean monarchs' anointment were recorded by Westerners: Tui-toga, the first Christian king, was anointed on March 2, 1875, Fata-a-iki was anointed on November 21, 1888, and Togia-Pulu-toaki, the last king, was anointed on June 30, 1898.|$|R
40|$|No reprints available. Advances in {{magnetic}} resonance cholangiography (MRC) {{have resulted in}} consistently high sensitivity and specificity {{for the detection of}} common duct stones by MRC. There are multiple advantages to using MRC over endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in the diagnosis of common duct <b>stones,</b> thereby <b>reserving</b> the use of ERC mainly as a therapeutic tool. Endoscopic ultrasonography has emerged as a modality capable of common duct stone detection and, when available, will compete with MRC and ERC for the diagnosis of com-mon duct stones. However, its ability to image intrahe-patic or proximal common duct stones would seem to be limited. Laparoscopic ultrasonography helps shorten operative time and costs less compared with intraoperative cholangiography. As more surgeons gather experience with laparoscopic ultrasonography and it becomes widely available, it has the promise to substitute for intraoperative cholangiography...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the modelling of two strategies for conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes: the enlargement of existing reserve sites and {{the allocation of}} stepping stones between these sites. We developed two spatial allocation models that plan new habitat according to these strategies, considering simple ecological rules of thumb {{to meet the requirements}} for population sustainability and the suitability of the land for competing land use. The model ENLARGE enlarges the existing sites. The model MENTOR modifies the spatial arrangement of patches by adding new patches that may act as stepping <b>stones</b> between <b>reserve</b> sites. These two models result in different habitat configurations. Both the allocation of stepping stones and the enlargement of existing sites provide a higher percentage of occupied habitat. These models may help to address the question under which conditions either the allocation of stepping stones or the enlargement of existing sites is preferred as strategy for conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes.
