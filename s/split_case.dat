50|$|Going {{from the}} real numbers to an {{arbitrary}} field, Moufang 3-gons {{can be divided into}} three cases as above. The <b>split</b> <b>case</b> in the first diagram exists over any field. The second case extends to all associative, non-commutative division algebras; over the reals these are limited to the algebra of quaternions, which has degree 2 (and dimension 4), but some fields admit central division algebras of other degrees. The third case involves ‘alternative’ division algebras (which satisfy a weakened form of the associative law), and a theorem of Bruck and Kleinfeld shows that these are Cayley-Dickson algebras. This concludes the discussion of Moufang 3-gons.|$|E
50|$|Rajasthani {{belongs to}} the {{languages}} that mix three types of case marking systems: nominative - accusative: transitive (A) and intransitive (S) subjects have similar case marking, {{different from that of}} transitive object (O); absolutive-ergative (S and O have similar marking, different from A), tripartite (A, S and O have different case marking). There is a general tendency existing in the languages with split nominal systems: the split is usually conditioned by the referents of the core NPs, the probability of ergative marking increasing from left to right in the following nominal hierarchy: first person pronouns - second person pronouns - demonstratives and third person pronouns - proper nouns - common nouns (human - animate - inanimate). Rajasthani <b>split</b> <b>case</b> marking system partially follows this hierarchy:first and second person pronouns have similar A and S marking, the other pronouns and singular nouns are showing attrition of A/S opposition.|$|E

Internet retail today relies heavily on manual labor for order fulfillment.

40|$|Let D be {{a central}} {{division}} algebra and A Θ = GLm (D) the unit group of a central simple algebra over a p-adic field F. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to give types (in the sense of Bushnell and Kutzko) for all level zero Bernstein components of A Θ and to establish that the Hecke algebras associated to these types are isomorphic to tensor products of Iwahori Hecke algebras. The types which we consider are lifted from cuspidal representations of M(kD), where M is a standard Levi subgroup of GLm and kD is the residual field of D. Two types are equivalent if and only if the corresponding pairs (M(kD);) are conjugate with respect to A Θ. The results are basically the same as in the <b>split</b> <b>case</b> A Θ = GLn (F) due to Bushnell and Kutzko.
