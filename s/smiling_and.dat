Paredes, according to his brother, was led to his execution <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> singing an anthem of the Basque Army.

5|$|After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and {{his family}} go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} {{to go on with}} the marriage, and stands weeping. Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> giving her the thumbs up. Rahul and Anjali Sharma get married.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{opened on}} 14 August 1985. The police gave {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} murder–suicide, and the bodies were released. The Bambers and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, he was <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> joking.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Japanese director Yusuke Tanaka. The video features Perfume as robots, controlled by an automated-computer to perform human-like interactions such as eating, dancing, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> crying. Some verses and the choruses feature the group dancing to the song. It ends with member Nocchi pulling the power-plug from member A-chan's back, shutting down the computer and Perfume. The members stated that they found it interesting to try and imitate the image of themselves as robots and dolls and found the choreography {{to be the most}} powerful that they've done so far.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Trainor leaning {{on a bed}} reciting the song's lyrics, {{interspersed}} with scenes of dolls and a young girl and boy having a tea party. As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing the kitchen floor. The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly capsizing and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's home with a carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> inviting Puth into her home.|$|E

25|$|The {{symbol of}} British government, Number 10 became a {{gathering}} place for protesters. Emmeline Pankhurst and other suffragette leaders stormed Downing Street in 1908; anti–Vietnam War protestors marched {{there in the}} 1960s, as did anti-Iraq and Afghanistan War protestors in the 2000s. Number 10 became an obligatory stop in every tourist's sightseeing trip to London. Ordinary people, not only British but foreign tourists, posed <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughing in front of its famous door.|$|E

25|$|On January 9, 2010, Foye {{was fined}} $10,000 by the Washington Wizards for {{participating}} in Gilbert Arenas' antics before a game on January 5, 2010 against the Philadelphia 76ers. Arenas was being investigated for a prior incident involving guns in the Wizards' locker room, but made light of the accusations by pointing his finger at his teammates, {{as if he were}} shooting them. His teammates were photographed <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughing with him.|$|E
25|$|Commissioner Phiyega of the ANC {{came under}} further {{criticism}} as being insensitive and uncaring {{when she was}} caught <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> laughing during the Farlam Commission's video playback of the 'massacre'. Archbishop Desmond Tutu has announced {{that he no longer}} can bring himself to exercise a vote for the ANC as it is no longer the party that he and Nelson Mandela fought for, and that the party has now lost its way, and is in danger of becoming a corrupt entity in power.|$|E
25|$|Positive affective {{display in}} service interactions, such as <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> {{conveying}} friendliness, are {{positively associated with}} customer positive feelings, and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality. There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' emotional exhaustion and burnout over time, and may also reduce employees' job satisfaction. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related {{to higher levels of}} employees' emotional exhaustion, and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the first two series, it slides across four boxes with each character's face in them. The first box stands alone with Ben and Susan in it. The other three are lapped over each other with a photo of Michael, Janey and Nick from left to right in them. While it slides across at the start, each character's face turns with Janey and Nick <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> the others being fairly plain faced. Once the boxes are placed, the boxes with youngsters in them drop {{to the bottom of the}} screen and are {{replaced}} with the show's logo.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E
25|$|Dual-process {{theories}} of persuasion (such as the elaboration likelihood model) {{maintain that the}} persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not {{last as long as}} persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.|$|E

25|$|Jan van Mill has {{described}} βN as a 'three headed monster' — the three heads being a <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> friendly head (the behaviour {{under the assumption}} of the continuum hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what you can prove about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn't quite right - there {{is in fact a}} fourth head of βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of βN almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin's axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.|$|E
25|$|On February 19, 1977, Wonder was {{nominated}} for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, an award that he had already won twice, in 1974 and 1975, for Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Since 1973, Stevie’s presence at the Grammy ceremonies had been consistent – he attended most of the ceremonies and also used to perform on stage. But in 1976, he did not attend as he was not nominated for any awards (as he had not released any new material during the past year). Paul Simon, who received the Grammy for Album of the Year in that occasion (for Still Crazy After All These Years) jokingly thanked Stevie “for not releasing an album” that year. A year after, Wonder {{was nominated}} for Songs in the Key of Life in that same category, and was widely favored by many critics to take the award. The other nominees were Breezin’ by George Benson, Chicago X by Chicago, Silk Degrees by Boz Scaggs, and the other favorite, Peter Frampton’s Frampton Comes Alive!, which was also a huge critical and commercial success. Wonder was again absent from the ceremony, as he had developed an interest in visiting Africa. In February he traveled to Nigeria for two weeks, primarily to explore his musical heritage, as he put it. A satellite hook-up was arranged so that Stevie could be awarded his Grammys from across the sea. Bette Midler announced the results during the ceremony, and the audience was only able to see Wonder at a phone <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> giving thanks. The video signal was poor and the audio inaudible. Andy Williams went on to make a public blunder when he asked the blind-since-birth Wonder, “Stevie, can you see us?” In all, Wonder won four out of seven nominations at the Grammys: Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R Vocal Performance and Producer of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Two {{separate}} {{music videos}} were produced for [...] "Porcelain". The first version, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, {{is primarily a}} simple close-up of a human eye; various images are reflected onto the eye {{throughout the course of}} the video, including Moby performing the song, people <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> a piano being played.|$|E
