25|$|In Waldorf education, pentatonic {{music is}} {{considered}} to be appropriate for young children due to its simplicity and unselfconscious openness of expression. Pentatonic music centered around intervals of the fifth is often sung and played in early childhood; progressively smaller intervals are emphasized within primarily pentatonic as children progress through the early school years. At around nine years of age the music begins to center around first folk music using a six-tone scale, and then the modern diatonic scales, with the goal of reflecting the children's developmental progress in their musical experience. Pentatonic instruments used include lyres, pentatonic flutes, and tone bars; <b>special</b> <b>instruments</b> have been designed and built for the Waldorf curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|The second 1998 {{special edition}} was the [...] "Heritage", {{intended}} to hark {{back to the}} early days of Land Rover in the 1940s. Available in 90 or 110 variants, the Heritage was only available in the two original colours offered by the company— the dark bronze green and the light pastel Atlantic green. A metal mesh-effect front grille, body-coloured alloy wheels and wing mirrors and silver-painted door and windscreen hinges were all employed to make the Heritage look similar to the original Series I of 1948. Inside, <b>special</b> <b>instruments</b> were used, with black-on-beige displays. The powertrain was the standard Td5 diesel engine and 5 speed manual transmission.|$|E

2500|$|Typically, dental hygienists (or dentists) use <b>special</b> <b>instruments</b> {{to clean}} (debride) teeth below the gumline and disrupt any plaque growing below the gumline. This is a {{standard}} treatment to prevent any further progress of established periodontitis. [...] Studies show that after such a professional cleaning (periodontal debridement), microbial plaque tends to grow back to precleaning levels after about three to four months. [...] Nonetheless, the continued stabilization of a patient's periodontal state depends largely, if not primarily, on the patient's oral hygiene at home, {{as well as on}} the go. [...] Without daily oral hygiene, periodontal disease will not be overcome, especially if the patient has a history of extensive periodontal disease.|$|E
2500|$|Huysmans' novel, Against the Grain, {{has more}} discussions of sound, {{smell and taste}} than any other work of {{literature}} we know of. For example, one chapter consists entirely of smell hallucinations so vivid that they exhaust the book's central character, Des Esseintes, a bizarre, depraved aristocrat. A student of the perfumer's art, Esseintes has developed several devices for titillating his jaded senses. Besides <b>special</b> <b>instruments</b> for re-creating any conceivable odour, he has constructed a special [...] "mouth organ", designed to stimulate his palate rather than his ears. The organ's regular pipes {{have been replaced by}} rows of little barrels, each containing a different liqueur. In Esseintes's mind, the taste of each liqueur corresponded with the sound of a particular instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Supernatural {{features}} a synthesized orchestral score, although traditional acoustic instruments such as guitars and cellos are used at times. <b>Special</b> <b>instruments</b> {{have also been}} used in specific episodes, such as [...] "bluesy gospel music" [...] played on a broken-down piano in the faith-healing episode [...] "Faith". Unlike other television shows, the series features two composers: Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. Each composer scores every other episode, giving them extra time to write the scores, which usually end up being around 30minutes per episode. They write themes for their own episodes and characters and work with one another if there is overlap between episodes. They try to base the music on the visuals of the episode, {{such as in the}} episode [...] "Dead in the Water", in which off-angle shots are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes, and spoken words such as [...] "water" [...] and [...] "die" [...] are followed by a lower pitch to create a [...] "gurgly" [...] sound. While there are similarities in the scores for situations such as the brothers and their father, about a third of each episode's score is newly written for the series.|$|E
