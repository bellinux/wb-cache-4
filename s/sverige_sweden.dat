40|$|Freezing of boar {{spermatozoa}} {{includes the}} cryoprotectant glycerol, but renders low cryosurvival, owing to {{major changes in}} osmolarity during freezing/thawing. We hypothesize that aquaporins (AQPs) 7 and 9 adapt their membrane domain location to these osmotic challenges, thus maintaining sperm homeostasis. Western blotting (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) at light and electron microscope levels with several commercial primary antibodies and protocols explored AQP location on cauda epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa (from different fractions of the ejaculate), unprocessed, extended, chilled and frozen-thawed. Although differences in WB and ICC labelling were seen among antibodies, AQP- 7 was conspicuously located in the entire tail and cytoplasmic droplet in caudal spermatozoa, being restricted to the mid-piece and principal piece domains in ejaculated spermatozoa. AQP- 9 was mainly localized in the sperm head in both caudal and ejaculated spermatozoa. While unaffected by chilling (+ 5 °C), freezing and thawing of ejaculated spermatozoa clearly relocated the head labelling of AQP- 7, but not that of AQP- 9. In vitro mimicking of cell membrane expansion during quick thawing maintained the localization of AQP- 9 but relocated AQP- 7 towards the acrosome. AQP- 7, but not AQP- 9, appears as a relevant marker for non-empirical studies of sperm handling.

40|$|The cation {{channel of}} sperm (CatSper) {{comprises}} four transmembrane subunits specifically expressed in human, equine, murine and ovine spermatozoa, apparently implicated in capacitation, hyperactivation and acrosome exocytosis. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry showed hereby that CatSper subunits are {{also present in}} boar spermatozoa, primarily over the sperm neck, tail and cytoplasmic droplets; albeit CatSper - 1 presented in addition some distribution over the membrane of the acrosome and CatSper - 2 and - 4 over the membrane of the post-acrosome. The role of the Catsper channel in boar spermatozoa was investigated by extending the spermatozoa in media containing different calcium (Ca(2 +)) availability and exposure to the capacitation-trigger bicarbonate, to progesterone or CatSper inhibitors (Mibefradil and NNC 55 - 0396), separately or sequentially, at physiological and toxicological doses. Extracellular Ca(2 +) availability, combined with bicarbonate exposure (capacitation-inducing conditions) decreased sperm motility, similarly to when spermatozoa incubated in capacitation-inducing conditions was exposed to Mibefradil and NNC 55 - 0396. Exposure of these spermatozoa to progesterone did not cause significant changes in sperm motility and nor did it revert its decrease induced by CatSper antagonists. In conclusion, the CatSper channel regulates sperm motility during porcine capacitation-related events in vitro.

The traditional official title used until 1980 for other dynastic male heirs was Hereditary Prince of <b>Sweden</b> (<b>Sveriges</b> arvfurste), although the word prince (prins) was used in constitutional legal texts such as the Act of Succession and also colloquially and informally. In all cases the title of princesses was Princess of <b>Sweden</b> (Prinsessa av <b>Sverige).</b> Since 1980, the official title of all dynasts is Prince/Princess of <b>Sweden</b> (Prins/Prinsessa av <b>Sverige).</b>|$|R
