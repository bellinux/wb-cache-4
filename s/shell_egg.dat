Forty-eight eggs {{were randomly selected from}} each of six strains during the last week of each period.

The average shell thickness of the white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 390 mm) was significantly thicker than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> (. 368 mm). The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly higher average shell weight (5. 62 vs. 5. 30) and contained a significantly greater percentage of shell (9. 35 vs. 8. 65) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> The white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs</b> had a significantly greater shell weight per unit surface area (72. 97 vs. 78. 43 mg/cm 2) than the brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs.</b> (Key words: brown <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> white <b>shell</b> <b>eggs,</b> <b>shell</b> quality, shell weight) 1985 Poultry Science 64 : 297 - 30...|$|R

40|$|The Egg Safety Action Plan {{released}} in 1999 raised questions concerning egg temperature {{used in the}} risk assessment model. Therefore, a national study was initiated to determine {{the internal and external}} temperature sequence of eggs from oviposition through distribution. Researchers gathered data from commercial egg production, <b>shell</b> <b>egg</b> processing, and distribution facilities. The experimental design was a mixed model with 2 random effects for season and geographic region and a fixed effect for operation type (inline or offline). For this report, internal and external egg temperature data were recorded at specific points during <b>shell</b> <b>egg</b> processing in the winter and summer months. In addition, internal egg temperatures were recorded in pre- and postshell egg processing cooler areas. There was a significant season × geographic region interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for both surface and internal temperatures.

During <b>shell</b> <b>egg</b> processing, summer egg surface and internal temperatures were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than during the winter. When examining the effect of <b>shell</b> <b>egg</b> processing time and conditions, it was found that 2. 4 and 3. 8 °C were added to egg surface temperatures, and 3. 3 and 6. 0 °C were added to internal temperatures in the summer and winter, respectively.

Thirty five E. coli isolates were isolated from the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> surface. Ten E. coli strains were also isolated from shell crush. However, the internal contents of eggs appeared to be sterile. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on forty-five E. coli isolates using primers for heat stable enterotoxin genes A and B (STa and STb) and also for colicin V gene (cvaC). STa gene was detected in four E. coli isolates isolated from <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> surfaces. All the E. coli isolates were negative for STb and cvaC genes. These data provide useful information regarding the prevalence of virulent E. coli and Salmonella spp. on and in unwashed eggs collected from layer farms.
