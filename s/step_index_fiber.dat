40|$|We report herein {{the results}} of a series of {{round-robin}} experiments performed under strict procedures to determine the measurement veracity by which eventual standards may be established for measuring the effects of steady-state ionizing radiation on optical fibers. The responses of <b>step</b> <b>index</b> multimode, graded index multimode, and single-mode optical fibers exposed to ionizing radiations were measured by eight laboratories of the NATO Panel IV Research Study Group 12, Nuclear Effects Task Group, during the period of 1987 - 1989.
