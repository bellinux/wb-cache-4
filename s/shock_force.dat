25|$|Interior Minister Mario Scelba {{announced}} {{that the government had}} 330,000 men under arms, including a special <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> of 150,000 ready to take on the Communists if they tried to make trouble on election day. The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} July 1936, the Spanish {{rebel forces}} were in dire straits. The Republic held two-thirds of the country, the capital city, the gold reserves, the major urban centers {{and most of the}} industries. Furthermore, the main <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> of the rebels, the Spanish Army of Africa, was {{isolated}} in Spanish Morocco, the Republic held most of the Navy, and from 19 July Spanish Republican Navy warships were patrolling the waters between Morocco and the mainland. Nevertheless, with the assistance of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, the Nationalists managed to airlift their troops from Africa to Andalusia.|$|E
25|$|During {{the balance}} of 1942 and into early 1943 the 50th, reduced to just four rifle {{divisions}} and a few supporting units, manned the defenses southwest of Moscow. It played a very limited role in the Third Rzhev–Sychevka Offensive Operation, liberating a small sector {{at the base of}} the Rzhev Salient as the Germans withdrew. Attacking on the left wing of the Front's <b>shock</b> <b>force,</b> it pivoted towards Miliatino and confronted the German 4th Army's XII Corps, which held strong defenses north of Spas-Demensk: In reality, directives from STAVKA on Mar. 18 ordered Western Front to make a concerted effort to smash the new German line, in spite of its obvious strength. The effort failed at the cost of heavy Soviet casualties.|$|E

50|$|Since World War I, {{the concept}} of close combat as an {{offensive}} tactical doctrine has evolved from the bayonet charge to more sophisticated concepts {{such as the use}} of elite <b>shock</b> <b>forces,</b> first popularized by the German Army through their use of stormtroop tactics.|$|R
50|$|Director Teshigahara, {{himself a}} master and {{teacher of the}} Japanese {{traditional}} art of ikebana, brings the viewer into appreciation and deep sympathy for Rikyu's aesthetic idealism and his careful diplomatic efforts to avoid excessive entanglement in political affairs. The film itself is very studied in its aestheticism, and very expressive of the <b>shocking</b> <b>force</b> of life intruding into the guarded hermetic space of the artist/idealist.|$|R
500|$|On 6April, four Beaufort torpedo-bombers {{attacked}} Gneisenau in port. Only one of {{the aircraft}} attacked successfully; the hit did significant damage to the ship. Gneisenau shipped some [...] of water, which caused her to list 2° and settle lower in the water. The <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> of the explosion also did {{a great deal of}} internal damage; fuel tanks were ruptured and electrical systems were damaged. A salvage tugboat was brought alongside to assist in flood control. Gneisenau was put into dry dock for repairs, which were prolonged by further British air raids. On the night of 9–10 April, British high-level bombers attacked both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst. The latter escaped unscathed, but the former was struck four times; 72men were killed and another 90were wounded.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the July 17 coup was to secure Spanish Morocco, because the Spanish Army of Africa was the main <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> of the Spanish Republican Army. [...] Their members were Spanish regular soldiers, the Spanish Legion, and Moroccan mercenaries, Regulares. Most of their {{officers}} supported the plot and rejected the liberal democracy. Only a handful of officers, such as General Manuel Romerales, the Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Army in Morocco, General Gomez Morato, and the High Commissioner, Placido Alvarez Buylla, were loyal to the Republic, and the Spanish workers in Morocco had no weapons and were isolated from the Moroccan population.|$|E
2500|$|Mytton was {{apparently}} {{seen by the}} committee as sharing Denbigh's brusqueness and arrogance. In January 1645 committee members Robert Clive, Andrew Lloyd, Thomas Hunt and Robert Charlton wrote to William Brereton to solicit help for their plan to retake Shrewsbury. They said that Mytton [...] "carries himself crossly towards us on all matters," [...] and proposed not to inform him of the plan, but to pretend they were making an attempt on the nearby village of Atcham - a plausible target, as it commanded important bridges where Watling Street crossed the River Severn and River Tern. In the event, Mytton {{was in charge of}} one of the cavalry units that occupied the town on 21 February. However, the crucial first entry to the town was made by a tiny <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> under William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier employed by the Wem committee, which was admitted into the town by a sympathiser. Mytton seems to have expected the governorship of the town. However, [...] on 27 February, immediately after news of the town's capture arrived in London, the Commons voted £4000 for Shrewsbury's defence and resolved: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{inserted}} provision {{would limit}} the CIA to the 19 interrogation tactics in the U.S. Army Field manual, effectively banning waterboarding, exposure to extreme temperatures and other techniques used on War on Terror detainees after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. It bans a total of eight interrogation techniques: mock executions, beatings, electrical <b>shocks,</b> <b>forced</b> nakedness, sexual acts, causing hypothermia and heat injuries.|$|R
5000|$|In a brief proposal, Mosler {{stated the}} energy crisis could be solved by {{lowering}} the speed limit nationally to 30 mph. According to Mosler, this would cut gasoline consumption and pollution since automobiles run more efficiently at slower speeds, while also greatly increase the demand for public transportation. [...] He states that such an initiative would eventually lead to a supply <b>shock</b> <b>forcing</b> prices down, and improve real terms of trade.|$|R
5000|$|Testing with {{a variety}} of {{ammunition}} proved the USP meets these high standards. During the USP testing phase, it was shown the recoil-reduction system reduces the force on the USP grip to approximately 300 newtons (67 pounds-force). Peak <b>force</b> <b>shock</b> on competing [...]40 caliber polymer and metal framed pistols was around 5,000 newtons (1,100 pounds-force). The primary benefit of low peak shock is a decrease in wear and tear on pistol components, a great concern with the +P cartridge in 9 mm, [...]40 S&W, and [...]45 ACP. Reduction of peak <b>shock</b> <b>forces</b> also contributes to softer recoil for the shooter, although these [...] "felt recoil" [...] values are much more subjective.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{victories}} against Rome in Africa. In the First Punic War, the Roman general Marcus Atilius Regulus {{decided to}} bring the campaign directly to African soil, hoping to crush Carthage right in its own ground (256–255 BC). Regulus' invasion proceeded well in the initial stages, and soon the legions overran Tunis, {{using it as a}} base to mount raids against the city itself. Carthage rejected harsh peace terms by Regulus, and reformed its army, adding fresh contingents, including Greeks, native levies, and the veteran troops of Hamilcar's Sicilian campaign. Of note is the employment of the Spartan commander Xanthippus who tightened up organization, and instituted rigorous drill before the walls of the city. On the day of decision, about 100 war-elephants were also mobilized for action. The Carthaginian formation placed native levies in the center, and mercenary forces on the right. Cavalry was split between the wings. The elephants formed a <b>shock</b> <b>force</b> in the vanguard. In response, Regulus seemed to have deepened his formation, but he was heavily outnumbered by Carthaginian horse. Xanthippus ordered the war-elephants to charge, and they wreaked havoc on the legion front line. Roman cavalry was also routed, and the Carthaginian horsemen returned to attack the flanks and rear of the infantry. Almost the entire Roman force was destroyed in the battle, although some 2,000 men fought their way to safety. In this first major land victory against Rome by Carthage, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Tunis, the [...] "mixed" [...] approach of the North African city brought victory. A second encounter on African soil was not to go so favorably.|$|E
50|$|An expansion, called Combat Mission: <b>Shock</b> <b>Force</b> - Marines was {{released}} on 26 September 2008 and marketed by direct sale through Battlefront's website, requiring Combat Mission: <b>Shock</b> <b>Force</b> to play. The module was sold by direct download, physical disc, or both, and included the latest patch for the <b>Shock</b> <b>Force</b> base game, which was also made available via free download to all non-Marines customers and works without the module for owners of the base game. Content of Marines include an increased number of units, 15 standalone scenarios, a 14-mission campaign, and 25 new Quick Battle maps. New units represent United States Marine Corps and Syrian Airborne troops, as well as regular Syrian units such as the T-90 tank.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>Force</b> depicts fictional {{battles in}} the year 2008 between the Syrian Army and US Stryker Brigades. This is the {{original}} incarnation of Battlefront.com's Combat Mission series using the new CMX2 game engine. <b>Shock</b> <b>Force</b> features improved graphics and 3D modelling. Modelling of infantry features a 1:1 representation, where every single soldier is depicted in the 3D world by its own animated graphic. The new engine also features real world lighting conditions, and models sun and star positions in the sky. The engine allows the game to be played in real time {{in addition to the}} established 60-second incremental format.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>forced</b> {{the oxygen}} valves {{closed on the}} number 1 and number 3 fuel cells, leaving them {{operating}} for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines. The shock also either partially ruptured {{a line from the}} number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.|$|R
50|$|Chapter 4 {{is about}} shock metamorphism, the unique changes made to rocks by the extreme but brief <b>shock</b> <b>forces</b> of an impact. The effects include shatter cones, planar {{deformation}} features (PDFs), selective melting and many others. The amount of shock metamorphism {{in the rocks}} progresses in stages {{with the amount of}} pressure that they were exposed to, ranging from fracturing and brecciation to vaporization of the rocks and later condensation into glass.|$|R
40|$|Many food products, such as jams, {{drinks and}} sauces, are hot filled into glass {{containers}} directly after cooking or pasteurisation. Unlike tin cans, hot glass cannot be directly placed into {{cold water to}} cool for fear of breakage due to thermal <b>shock.</b> <b>Forced</b> cooling of such hot filled foods is, however, is generally recommended to reduce changes in product colour and flavour. Some products are much more sensitive than others to changes of this type...|$|R

50|$|Geologic factors {{also play}} a major role in weapon {{effectiveness}} and facility survivability. Locating facilities in hard rock may appear to reduce the effectiveness of bunker-buster type weapons by decreasing penetration, but the hard rock also transmits <b>shock</b> <b>forces</b> to a far higher degree than softer soil types. The difficulties of drilling into and constructing facilities within hard rock also increase construction time and expense, as well as making it more likely construction will be discovered and new sites targeted by foreign militaries.|$|R
50|$|This lasted {{well into}} the 20th century, until President Lyndon B. Johnson {{abolished}} Peonage in 1966, which rapidly decreased sharecropping in every plantation nationwide. Although slavery is commonly understood to have ended with the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Thirteenth Amendment, exhaustive research conducted by journalist Douglas A.
