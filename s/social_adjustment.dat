25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable {{people may be}} more likely to cause harm. Researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents, as well as poor <b>social</b> <b>adjustment.</b> People low in agreeableness are also more likely to be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight.|$|E

25|$|In some Western {{cultures}} shyness-inhibition {{plays an}} important role in psychological and <b>social</b> <b>adjustment.</b> It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of Islamic ex-gay (i.e. people {{claiming}} to have experienced a basic change in sexual orientation from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality) groups aimed at attempting to guide homosexuals towards heterosexuality. A large body of research and global scientific consensus indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and <b>social</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful. People who have gone through conversion therapy face 8.9 times the rates of suicide ideation, face depression at 5.9 {{times the rate of}} their peers and are {{three times more likely to}} use illegal drugs compared to those who did not go through the therapy.|$|E

40|$|Traditional social skill {{studies have}} treated only Positive (so-called desirable) Communications such as {{assertion}} and relational maintenance as social skills. However, under the circumstance of real life, we often use Negative-Communications including deception, lying, and avoiding, as useful communication tools. To reconsider the definition about {{social skills and}} the possibility of Negative-Communications to be social skills must be examined. In this study, I did the questionnaire investigation about the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>adjustments</b> and <b>social</b> skills including "inter personal Distancing skill" via Negative-Communications which include lying, deception, and avoiding and "Interpersonal approaching skill" via positive communications. 284 male and female participated to the survey (mean age was 22. 5). The result of ANOVA, the main effect of approaching skill to <b>social</b> <b>adjustments</b> was significant positively, while the main effect of distancing skill to them was singificant negatively. However, there were some interaction effects. When meta-cognition about one's communication situations were exerted, using distancing skill reduced negative emotions. Moreover, only against middle intimate partner, using distancing skill related to high positive emotion...|$|R

[...] The researchers of the mentalization program educated children through group therapy in positive psychology and tried to do activities that put the child in a happy mood while interacting.

He described group work as an [...] "educational process" [...] concerned with [...] "the development and <b>social</b> <b>adjustment</b> of an individual through voluntary group association" [...] and [...] "the use of this association as a means of furthering other socially desirable ends" [...] (p.291).|$|E

2500|$|The longstanding {{consensus}} {{of research and}} clinical literature demonstrates that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality. There is now {{a large body of}} research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and <b>social</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The World Health Organization's ICD-9 (1977) listed homosexuality as a mental illness; it was removed from the ICD-10, endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly on 17 May 1990. Like the DSM-II, the ICD-10 added ego-dystonic sexual orientation to the list, which refers to people who want to change their gender identities or sexual orientation because of a psychological or behavioral disorder (...) [...] The Chinese Society of Psychiatry removed homosexuality from its Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders in 2001 after five years of study by the association. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists [...] "This unfortunate history demonstrates how marginalisation of {{a group of people who}} have a particular personality feature (in this case homosexuality) can lead to harmful medical practice and a basis for discrimination in society. There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and <b>social</b> <b>adjustment.</b> However, the experiences of discrimination in society and possible rejection by friends, families and others, such as employers, means that some LGB people experience a greater than expected prevalence of mental health difficulties and substance misuse problems. Although there have been claims by conservative political groups in the USA that this higher prevalence of mental health difficulties is confirmation that homosexuality is itself a mental disorder, there is no evidence whatever to substantiate such a claim." ...|$|E

2500|$|Witnesses {{are urged}} to {{minimize}} their social contact with non-members, even if they possess [...] "decent qualities", because of perceived dangers of worldly association. Sociologist Andrew Holden indicated they are highly selective in choosing with whom they spend leisure time, generally choosing the company of other Witnesses. Many Witnesses interviewed by Holden reported tensions and ostracism at work because of their religious beliefs. He reported that many Jehovah's Witness converts required some <b>social</b> <b>adjustment</b> as they gradually reduced contact with non-Witness friends. Association with those outside the organization, commonly termed by Witnesses as [...] "worldly" [...] and [...] "not in the Truth", is acceptable only when it is viewed {{as an opportunity to}} preach and Witnesses are under considerable pressure from the Society to show outsiders they are people of high moral fiber. Holden claims that as a result, Witnesses working with [...] "worldly" [...] colleagues tend to closely adhere to Watch Tower teachings.|$|E

60|$|The {{establishment}} of the intricate co-operative commonwealth by a rush of eighty million flushed and shiny-eyed enthusiasts, in fact, is Lloyd's proposal. He will not face, and few Americans to this day will face, the cold need of a great science of <b>social</b> <b>adjustment</b> and a disciplined and rightly ordered machinery to turn such enthusiasms to effect. They seem incurably wedded to gush. However, he did express clearly enough the opening phase of American disillusionment with the wild go-as-you-please {{that had been the}} conception of life in America through a vehement, wasteful, expanding century. And he was the precursor of what is now a bulky and extremely influential literature of national criticism. A number of writers, literary investigators one may call them, or sociological men of letters, or magazine publicists--they are a little difficult to place--has taken up the inquiry into the condition of civic administration, into economic organisation into national politics and racial interaction, with a frank fearlessness and an absence of windy eloquence that has been to many Europeans a surprising revelation of the reserve forces of the American mind. President Roosevelt, that magnificent reverberator of ideas, that gleam of wilful humanity, that fantastic first interruption to the succession of machine-made politicians at the White House, has echoed clearly to this movement and made it {{an integral part of the}} general intellectual movement of America.|$|E

Regulation is explained {{as a set of}} <b>social</b> <b>adjustments</b> motivated by the economy, or its crises, but not always clearly related to its performance. By way of supplement to the other papers in this issue, special attention is paid to the Netherlands. Regulation in the Netherlands is a product of self-regulation and balancing induced by the comparative 'weakness' of the different social and political actors (interest groups). Finally some conclusions are drawn about the reactions to the neo-liberal challenge in the countries dealt with in this special issue: the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands. The author argues that the differences in regulatory discourse reflect differences in political tradition and culture in these countries. Copyright Royal Dutch Geographical Society 2000. ...|$|R
