Doctor Nemesis, who had been trying to find a cure to the virus the entire time, realizes that his attempts have backfired because the victims only became even more dangerous. The only option left is to not only destroy the virus but also kill the infected men. Despite Colossus’ fervent protests, Cable orders him to carry out the kill-order. The authorities, including Havok and his Uncanny Avengers, only arrived after all the workers’ mutated bodies morphed back to their regular human forms and were <b>strewn</b> dead <b>across</b> the floor.

40|$|Deneubourg et al. [1] {{introduced}} {{a model of}} sorting behavior in ants.

The model ants operate according to local strategic rules and possess only local perceptual capacities. Nonetheless, {{they are able to}} impose global order. What is the mechanism underlying this phenomenon? We hypothesize that it is the combination of two processes, one which decreases smallscale complexity, and another which couples small-scale decreases in complexity to larger scales. To test this hypothesis, we introduce variant ants which have a complexity-seeking strategy. These ants can "see" local complexity, and tend to perform actions (picking up and putting down objects) in regions of highest local complexity. Using this strategy, they are able to accomplish their task more efficiently than the basic ants. For both basic and co [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{fascinating}} {{result on}} {{the dependence of}} the network's robustness to its node mixing may be explained as follows. According to their definition, high-degree nodes in assortative networks tend to form a core group among them. Such a core group provides robustness to the network by concentrating all the obvious target nodes together in one portion of the graph. Removing these high-degree nodes {{is still one of}} the most effective ways to destroy network connectivity, but it is less effective (compared to neutral networks) because by removing them all from the same portion of the graph we fail to attack other portions. If these other portions are themselves percolating, then a giant cluster will persist even as the highest degree nodes vanish. On the other hand, the disassortatively mixed network is particularly susceptible to removal of high-degree nodes because these nodes are <b>strewn</b> far apart <b>across</b> the network, so that attacking them is like attacking all parts of the network at once.|$|R

40|$|Four painted {{works in}} the {{exhibition}} "Pebbles and avalanches" This joint exhibition of ten artists from the University of Lincoln was curated by Clare Charnley and used artworks {{to draw attention to}} the complex dynamics of the two-way process of influence between teachers and students of art. This show included stills from one of my video pieces - ‘Domain of formlessness’, which was inspired by Steve Dutton whom I met whilst doing my Masters. The video relates (quite literally) to the notion of ‘avalanches’ in the title of this exhibition and the film stems from a conversation that started between Steve and myself (and continues to this day) about the catastrophes that result from trying to deal with landslides of material from abandoned artistic activities which often end up <b>strewn</b> chaotically <b>across</b> the studio. Dutton and Peacock made a film called ‘Plague-Orgy-Time’ in 1997 and I first saw it in their exhibition ‘Apocatropes’ at the Mappin Gallery in the same year. I was taken by their approach to a ‘series of accretions of things in a space punctuated by scattered evidence of artistic activity’ (Glover, I. 1997). My film deals with a similar issue but in this case the studio is reduced to a model and artistic activities are miniaturised in a series of ‘Gulliver-esque’ tableaux or enactments – each one punctuated by the close of a stage curtain. In a way my film consciously tends towards 'the reproduced', the constructed stage, film or theatre set in its depictions of a series of avalanches and visually references old slapstick humour films in a sequence of ‘vignettes’. The strange beauty of this apparently absurd process experienced in the studio is foregrounded in this 'homage'. References Izi Glover 1997 ‘Musée Imaginaire’ Frieze Issue 3...|$|R

Acting on Hitler’s direct order, the men of the small mining village were rounded up and shot in groups of five, until the SS Commander in charge, irritated by the delay in carrying out the executions, ordered that ten be shot at a time.

Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E

As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it.

Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night.

The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E
50|$|As they {{go further}} into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing {{multiple}} gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling {{to move up the}} mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Persian or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body <b>strewn</b> out <b>across</b> rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff.|$|R
50|$|This deadly, long-track EF3 tornado first {{touched down}} in Menifee County, Kentucky to the {{southwest}} of Mariba. It rapidly attained EF3 strength before moving east and passing {{to the south of}} Wellington, heavily damaging or destroying multiple homes along this segment of the path, snapping or uprooting many large trees, killing two people, and injuring many others. One block foundation home was removed from its foundation and leveled, while a nearby brick home lost its roof and exterior walls. A brick split-level home had only its basement floor remaining, {{with the rest of the}} house being completely carried away and disintegrated. Structural debris and house contents from this location was <b>strewn</b> long distances <b>across</b> nearby hillsides. Further east, the tornado expanded to nearly a mile wide and entered Morgan County, passing north of Ezel before ripping directly through downtown West Liberty at EF3 strength, resulting in catastrophic damage. Massive structural damage occurred in the downtown square of West Liberty, with many brick buildings and businesses being heavily damaged or destroyed, and many vehicles being tossed against buildings or crushed by falling structural debris. Every building in and around the downtown area sustained major damage, with the 105-year-old courthouse, the depression-era WPA building that housed the community center, and the 100-year-old West Liberty United Methodist and Christian churches all being either heavily damaged or suffering total destruction. The local hospital sustained major damage as well. Residential areas in town were also devastated with numerous homes destroyed, including some unanchored homes that were swept from their foundations. Footage of the tornado in this area revealed a rapidly rotating lowered cloud base with a large debris cloud underneath, but no visible condensation funnel. Six people were killed in West Liberty, and many others were injured, some severely. Past West Liberty, the tornado continued through other rural portions of the county, expanding up to a full mile wide as it snapped thousands of trees and caused extensive damage to structures. Maintaining EF3 strength, the tornado then briefly moved through a portion of Lawrence County near the community of Terryville, obliterating several mobile homes and injuring two people. Crossing into Johnson County, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength as downed many trees and caused roof damage to several structures before crossing back into Lawrence County and regaining EF3 strength as it passed near Martha, Blaine, and a few other rural communities further to the east. 30 homes and mobile homes were destroyed along this segment of the path, 9 others sustained major damage, and the Blaine community building was damaged as well. A double-wide mobile home was lofted and slammed into a hillside by the tornado, killing two people inside. The tornado then crossed the state border into Wayne County, West Virginia.|$|R
