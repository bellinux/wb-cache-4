5|$|Traditionally, the Galapagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and Japanese <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California <b>sea</b> <b>lion.</b> However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> differs from the Galapagos <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{had never}} {{believed}} in <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion,</b> while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion.</b> Both went their own ways. Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was willing to do it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid, Hitler postponed Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion.</b> Having been defeated in daylight, the Luftwaffe turned its attention to The Blitz night campaign which lasted until May 1941.|$|E
50|$|Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> live on sand {{beaches and}} smooth rocks on island {{offshore}} of the Australian Coast. Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> tend {{to live on}} islands between Pages Island in the south coast of Australia and Houtman Adbrolhos island west coast of Australia. Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> predominantly are on Kangaroo island. These <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are non-migratory mammals that live on the coastal land of western and southern Australia. These <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> live around their birthplace and are at most 300 km away from their birthplace. Also Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> travel inward on land during tumultuous weather. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are known to travel up to 9.4 km inland. Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> biographical range from the Indian and Pacific Ocean.|$|R

5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|R
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion,</b> although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> pups {{have been}} found {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{wild salmon}} stocks, a main {{resident}} food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On {{the west coast}} of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> populations have also substantially declined.|$|E
50|$|California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{have always}} been present in San Francisco Bay. They started to haul out on docks of Pier 39 in September 1989. Before that they mostly used Seal Rock for that purpose. Ever since September 1989 the number of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> on Seal Rock has been {{steadily}} decreasing, while their number on Pier 39 has generally increased. Some people speculate that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> moved to docks because of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but the earthquake occurred months after the first <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> had arrived at Pier 39. It {{is likely that the}} <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> feel safer inside the Bay.|$|R
50|$|Subsistence {{hunting and}} {{commercial}} harvest of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> greatly reduced the breeding range and population size of New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> between the 13th and 19th Centuries. In 1893, sealing for both New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and New Zealand fur seals was prohibited by law in New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Aerial and {{land-based}} sighting {{surveys were}} conducted to clarify the distribution of Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during winter in the northern Sea of Japan, along {{the west coast of}} Hokkaido, from 2001 to 2003. Aerial surveys revealed that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> gathered around the Rishiri-Rebun Islands in March 2002 and 2003, and between Iwanai and Cape Obana in February 2003. Higher numbers of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were also confirmed at Cape Ofuyu and Cape Kamui on the central-west coast compared to that at the haul-out sites in the 1980 s on the upper-west coast in March 2002 and 2003. Additionally, fisherman observed <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> along the coast of the Tsugaru Strait from February to May 2003, where the presence of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> was not reported in the 1980 s. These facts suggest that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> have recently expanded their distribution southward. Land-based surveys at the recent haul-out sites indicated that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in the central-west coast were composed mainly of adult and subadult males (average: Cape Ofuyu 75. 2 %, Cape Kamui 69. 5 %), which stayed from November 2002 to May 2003. In this area, <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> arrived earlier and stayed longer than in the 1980 s...|$|R
5|$|No {{land mammals}} {{are known to}} be native to North Island, but the Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Neophoca cinerea) {{occasionally}} hauls out on the island's beaches, and {{it has been suggested that}} the island once had a native population of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii).|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Portions of the Romney Marsh, {{which was}} the planned {{invasion}} site of Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion,</b> were flooded and there were plans to flood more of the Marsh if the invasion were to materialise.|$|E
50|$|Seal Harbour has the {{capacity}} to feature up to 20 inhabitants, including Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> California <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> New Zealand fur seals and subantarctic fur seals. As of January 2012, a collection of nine animals inhabit the exhibit, including California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> as well as New Zealand and subantarctic fur seals.|$|R
50|$|The {{populations of}} <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in Washington State have increased. Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{specifically}} are showing {{an increase in}} population; 10% every year.|$|R
40|$|Aggregations by 3 {{species of}} {{dolphins}} (the bottlenose dolphin [Tursiops truncatus], the {{short-beaked common dolphin}} [Delphinus delphis], and the long-beaked common dolphin [Delphinus capensis]) and California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Zalophus californianus) were investigated in Santa Monica Bay, California. Groups were followed and observed during 201 boat-based surveys conducted in 1997 – 2001 documenting that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were aggregated in 18. 6 % of the sightings with bottlenose dolphins (150 bottlenose dolphin sightings) and in 45. 9 % of the sightings with 1 of the 2 species of common dolphins (98 common dolphin sightings). Aggregations of bottlenose dolphins and <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were observed in inshore (, 500 m from shore) and offshore (. 500 m) waters, whereas common dolphins and <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were observed only in offshore waters. These aggregations were often recorded feeding near escarpments and submarine canyons, showing a striking preference for these bathymetric features. The results show that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> spend {{a significant amount of}} time following dolphins, <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> initiate aggregation and departure from dolphin schools, these aggregations occur more often than is expected by chance, and no aggressive behavior between <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and dolphins was ever observed at or near the surface. I argue that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> may take advantage of the superior food-locating abilities of dolphins. This paper provides the 1 st detailed description of mixed-species aggregations and habitat usage by 3 dolphin species and <b>sea</b> <b>lions...</b>|$|R
5|$|The California <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Zalophus californianus) is {{a coastal}} eared seal native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of <b>sea</b> <b>lion.</b> Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent manmade environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{had promised}} Hitler that Adlertag and Adlerangriff would achieve the results {{required}} within days, or at worst weeks. It {{had meant to}} {{be the beginning of}} the end of RAF Fighter Command, but Adlertag and the following operations failed to destroy the RAF, or gain the necessary local air superiority. As a result, Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> was postponed indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|The Olivarez College <b>Sea</b> <b>Lions</b> is {{the collegiate}} men's varsity {{basketball}} team of Olivarez College - Parañaque. It {{plays in the}} NCR-UCL Athletic Association (NCR-UCLAA) in the Philippines. The collegiate women's varsity basketball team is called the Lady <b>Sea</b> <b>Lions,</b> while the high school varsity basketball team is called the Junior <b>Sea</b> <b>Lions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> defecate nutrient-rich faeces {{which may}} provide an {{important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. Metagenomic {{analysis of the}} bacterial consortia found in the faeces of Australian <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> found very high levels of nutrient cycling and transport genes which may break down the nutrients defecated by <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> into a bioavailable form for incorporation into marine food webs.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand fur seals’ known predators are killer whales, sharks, male New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> and {{possibly}} leopard seals. New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are also known to target pups as their prey.|$|R
5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. A litter of wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> ranges {{along the}} western coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 350 variety of aquatic animals include finless porpoises, sea otters, Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and penguins. Hours are from January 1 to December 25, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.|$|R
5000|$|Seals and <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> The {{channels}} of the Fraser River are frequented by harbour seals throughout the year, {{and in the}} spring by California <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> These species are most visible during fish runs.|$|R
5000|$|Sea lions: Beginning in 1971 and {{continuing}} until present day, Dr. Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied sea lions’ cognitive ability. They {{have discovered that}} <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli's common features. This is called “equivalence classification.” This ability to recognize equivalence may be a precursor to language. Research is currently being conducted at the Pinniped Cognition & Sensory Systems Laboratory to determine how <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> form these equivalence relationships. <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> have also been proven {{to be able to}} understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language similar to the one used with primates. The <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> studied were able to learn and use a number of syntactic relations between the signs they were taught, such as how the signs should be arranged in relation to each other. However, the <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In the wild it's thought that <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> use the reasoning skills associated with equivalence classification in order to make important decisions that can affect their rate of survival (e.g. recognizing friends and family or avoiding enemies and predators). <b>Sea</b> <b>lions</b> use the following to display their language: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{ecosystem}} of the RNSP preserves {{a number}} of threatened animal species such as the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>lion.</b> In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the United Nations designated them a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980 {{and part of the}} California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and northern elephant seal—found that the <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} would not improve until 1942. Coastal Command did operate with effect alongside RAF Bomber Command in disrupting enemy shipping during the Battle of Britain in 1940. Coastal Command attacked shipping and mined waters around invasion ports. The German invasion of Britain in 1940, Operation <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion,</b> was eventually cancelled {{owing to the}} German defeat in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5000|$|Harvest {{records from}} Japanese {{commercial}} fishermen {{in the early}} 1900s show {{that as many as}} 3,200 <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were harvested {{at the turn of the}} century, and overhunting caused harvest numbers to fall drastically to 300 <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> by 1915 and to a few dozen <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> by the 1930s. Japanese commercial harvest of Japanese <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> ended in the 1940s when the species became virtually extinct. In total, Japanese trawlers harvested as many as 16,500 <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> enough to cause their extinction. Submarine warfare during World War II is even believed to have contributed to their habitat destruction. [...] The most recent sightings of Z. japonicus are from the 1970s, with the last confirmed record being a juvenile specimen captured in 1974 off the coast of Rebun Island, northern Hokkaido.There were a few unconfirmed sightings in 1983 and 1985.|$|R
25|$|The Northwest Passage exhibit {{opened on}} March 1, 2006, with {{underwater}} viewing for polar bears and <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> The animals frequently interact with visitors, and the <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{are fond of}} following and mimicking small children.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> {{are known}} to predate {{on a wide range}} of prey species {{including}} fish (e.g. hoki and red cod), cephalopods (e.g. New Zealand arrow squid and yellow octopus), crustaceans, seabirds and other marine mammals. Studies indicate a strong location effect on diet, with almost no overlap in prey species comparing <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> at Otago Peninsula and Campbell Island, at the north and south extents of the species' breeding range. New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> are in turn predated on by great white sharks, with 27% showing evidence of scarring from near-miss shark attacks in an opportunistic study of adult NZ <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> at Sandy Bay, Enderby Island.|$|R
