[...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for <b>safety.</b> Hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> have been used by firefighters in the United States.

40|$|Purpose: Since we {{reported}} about a landmark technique to reopen an occluded subclavian artery, we have faced difficulty in using <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in the vertebral artery {{to protect against}} thromboembolism from the reversed steal phenomenon after angioplasty and stenting. Therefore, we are presenting an optimal solution in using a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> while recanalizing the occluded subclavian artery. Materials and Methods: Among 21 cases of stenting for subclavian artery steno-occlusion, we applied the landmark technique {{at the opposite end}} of an occluded segment in 4 patients and used a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> in two patients. Because the embolic <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was placed in the vertebral artery via the brachial artery, optimal angioplasty and stenting via the brachial route were limited. Therefore, angioplasty via the trans-brachial approach was needed to be followed by stenting through a trans-femoral approach.

Results: The procedure was safely performed when a stent was introduced via the femoral artery and a <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> was used via the brachial artery.

40|$|Like pedestrians, bicyclists are {{vulnerable}} road users, representing a population {{with a high}} risk of fatal and severe injuries in traffic accidents as they are unprotected during vehicle collisions. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the kinematics response of bicyclists and the correlation of the injury severity with vehicle impact speed. Twenty-four car-bicyclist cases with detailed information were selected for accident reconstruction using mathematical models, which was implemented in the MADYMO program. The dynamic response of bicyclists in the typical impact configuration and the correlation of head impact conditions were analyzed and discussed with respect to the head impact speed, time of head impact and impact angle of bicyclists to vehicle impact speed. Furthermore, the injury distribution of bicyclists and the risk of head injuries and fractures of lower limbs were investigated in terms of vehicle impact speed. The results indicate that wrap-around distance (WAD), head impact speed, time of head impact, head impact angle, and throw-out distance (TOD) of the bicyclists have a strong relationship with vehicle impact speed. The vehicle impact speed corresponding to a 50 % probability of head AIS 2 + injuries, head AIS 3 + injuries, and lower limb fracture risk for bicyclists is 53. 8 km/h, 58. 9 km/h, and 41. 2 km/h, respectively. A higher vehicle impact speed produces a higher injury risk to bicyclist. The results could provide background knowledge for the establishment or modification of pedestrian regulations considering bicyclist protection as well as being helpful for developing <b>safety</b> measures and <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> for bicyclists...|$|R
5000|$|Garrett Morgan {{invented a}} <b>safety</b> hood smoke <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> after seeing firefighters {{struggling}} from the smoke they {{encountered in the}} line of duty. His device used a wet sponge to filter out smoke and cool the air. It also took advantage of the way smoke and fumes tend to rise to higher positions while leaving a layer of more breathable air below, by using an air intake tube that dangled near the floor. The safety hood used a series of tubes to draw clean air off the lowest level the tubes could extend to. Smoke, being hotter than the air around it, rises, and by drawing air from the ground, the Safety Hood provided the user with a way to perform emergency respiration. He filed for a patent on the device in 1912, and founded a company called the National Safety Device Company in 1914 to market it. He was able to sell his invention around the country, sometimes using the tactic of having a hired white actor take credit rather than revealing himself as its inventor. For demonstrations of the device, he sometimes adopted the disguise of [...] "Big Chief Mason", a purported full-blooded Indian from the Walpole Island Indian Reserve in Canada. He would demonstrate the device by building a noxious fire fueled by tar, sulfur, formaldehyde and manure inside an enclosed tent. Disguised as Big Chief Mason, he would enter the tent full of black smoke, and would remain there for 20 minutes before emerging unharmed.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives：Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is {{emerging}} as a reasonable alternative to carotid endartere-ctomy, and especially for those patients with comorbidities.

We report here on our early experiences with balloon occlusion and filter type distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> that were used for CAS. Subjects and Methods：CAS was performed on 92 lesions of 73 patients (age： 61. 0 ± 12. 7 years, males： 71. 2 %). Of these patients, 16 patients with 17 carotid lesions underwent CAS using distal <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> A balloon occlusion type <b>protection</b> <b>device,</b> PercuSurge GuardWire system, was used for 8 lesions and a filter type, FilterWire EX system, was used for 9 lesions.

Material and methods All patients older than 75 years with carotid stenosis treated in our center between January 2002 and December 2012 were included in this prospective study. All were treated by carotid stenting without <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Angiographic results, neurologic complications and Doppler ultrasound were collected during the procedure and within 30 days. Results 49 patients were included (mean age 78. 2 years, range 75 – 86). The average degree of stenosis was 88. 2 %. During the procedure there were two cases of transient ischemic attack and one intraparenchymal hemorrhage. At 30 days there was a non-disabling stroke. The combined rate of disabling stroke plus myocardial infarction plus death was 6 % at 30 days and the rate of any stroke was 4 % during the procedure and 2 % at 30 days.
