2500|$|In 1979, four storm sewers along Midland Avenue in Yonkers (which {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of Tibbetts Brook Park) {{were found to}} be illegally connected to the brook, pumping raw sewage into it which proceeded to enter Van Cortlandt Lake downstream. That year, another storm drain located at approximately Lawton Street and McLean Avenue near the Saw Mill Parkway, [...] north of the Yonkers/Bronx border, was found to be leaking household sewage into the brook. In 1984, sewage from Yonkers was again found to be contaminating Van Cortlandt Lake, due to the crossing of raw sewage pipes and storm sewers which feed into Tibbetts Brook. This included water from the Lawton <b>Street</b> <b>drain</b> pipe. The same sewage pipe was found to be the cause of pollution of the lake in 2016.|$|E
50|$|A large drain, {{known as}} the Reilly <b>Street</b> <b>drain</b> (now located under Alexandra Parade), was {{constructed}} to drain the Crown land in Clifton Hill, {{in order to increase}} profits for the government when selling the land to private developers. However, this scheme failed when the drain overflowed onto the Collingwood Flat in the first winter after it was constructed. The Reilly <b>Street</b> <b>drain</b> became notorious and continued to be a hazard as occasionally someone fell in and was drowned.|$|E

50|$|Elizabeth Street is {{the lowest}} point in the Melbourne central {{business}} district, with land rising both {{to the east and}} west, and more gradually to the north. The street was built on top of a historic natural creek and has suffered numerous floods in Melbourne's history. Flash flooding south towards the Yarra River occurred in 1882, 1972 and more recently during the 2010 Victorian storms. The Elizabeth <b>Street</b> <b>drain</b> runs from Carlton in the north to the Yarra River in the south, carrying stormwater from the inner northern suburbs and city centre.

50|$|Boston, Lincolnshire {{established}} a street drinking ban in January 2015 to address concerns with the antisocial {{problems associated with}} public alcohol consumption. The street drinking ban includes the town center and other areas. Under rules of the ban, those caught drinking in these areas can be fined £100 for a first offense. A second offense within six months after having committed a first one can be fined up to £500. Additionally, those that are requested to stop drinking and {{continue to do so}} can receive a fine of up to £500.

25|$|Bioretention systems {{involve the}} {{treatment}} of water by vegetation prior to filtration of sediment and other solids through prescribed media. Vegetation provides biological uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and other soluble or ﬁne particulate contaminants. Bioretention systems offer a smaller footprint than other similar measures (e.g. constructed wetlands) and are commonly used to filter and treat runoff prior to it reaching <b>street</b> <b>drains.</b> Use on larger scales can be complicated and hence other devices may be more appropriate. Biorentention systems comprise bioretention swales (also referred to as grassed swales and drainage channels) and bioretention basins.|$|R

50|$|Two large {{excavation}} {{areas have}} been exposed at Rojdi, which are known as the South Extension and the Main Mound. There was also a systematic excavation at an outer gateway and at an isolated structure at the northern slope of the site. All of these very finely preserved structures can be dated to Rojdi C period (early second millennium BCE). The houses in Rojdi were built on stone foundations, probably with mud walls above them. No bricks were found, baked or otherwise, in the excavations. No wells, bathing platforms and the associated <b>street</b> <b>drains</b> were found either.|$|R

25|$|Not {{only did}} the weather {{frustrate}} efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses; Since the <b>street</b> <b>drains</b> were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also {{had to be removed}} with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.|$|R

On the evening of 9 December 1886 and amid great ceremony, the baths were opened by the Mayor of Brisbane, James Hipwood, who took the first plunge. The Brisbane Courier reported:His Worship the Mayor appeared in regulation bathing costume at 8 p.m., and was loudly cheered as he stepped briskly along the springboard and took a [...] "header" [...] into the bath. This was the opening ceremony {{as far as the}} formal business of the evening was concerned. The Mayor was followed by Alderman Watson, Mr. C. E. Birkbeck (Ithaca Divisional Board) and the representatives of the Musgrave and Brisbane Amateur Swimming Clubs. The civic dignitaries disported themselves with grace and vigour equal to that of the most lissome of the clubmen, and the mayor and Alderman Watson treated the spectators to a few spurts up and down the bath at a pace which was quite surprising.One of the principal reasons for establishing the Arthur Street (now Torrington Street) bath was its location above the Spring Hollow (Water <b>Street)</b> <b>drain,</b> installed in 1884, the waste water from the baths providing a daily cleanse. River water from Petrie Bight was pumped to a small reservoir at the top end of Albert Street, then gravity fed down Spring Hill to the Hollow, where it was stored in holding tanks (now boarded over) {{at the far end of}} the baths. Each evening the pool was drained and every morning the water was replenished in a process lasting several hours. This system of flushing the Spring Hill drain was employed for three-quarters of a century.|$|E

Wetlands were drained and paved, unable to filter pollutants from the water, made worse by the river's own slow discharge. Algal blooms, fish kills, and deformations and lesions on fish occur regularly in the river from Palatka to Jacksonville. Although most of the pollutants in the river are washed from the southern parts of the river, the Jacksonville area produces approximately 36 percent of them found in the lower basin.|$|R
