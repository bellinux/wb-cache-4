40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The aim was, firstly, {{to study}} the {{validity}} of the <b>sentinel</b> <b>network</b> data by analysing the correlation between the weekly influenza cases detected by the network and the number of cases notified to the compulsory disease notification system and, secondly, to describe the epidemiology of the period 1991 - 92 in terms of the <b>sentinel</b> <b>network</b> data. DESIGN [...] The study design was descriptive. SUBJECTS [...] The population resident in the city of Madrid. MAIN RESULTS [...] There was a high correlation between the cases notified to the compulsory disease notification system and those listed by the <b>sentinel</b> <b>network</b> (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 82). The epidemic activity during the period 1991 - 92 was centred approximately on week 48 in 1991 and week 6 in 1992 (24 November 1991 - 8 February 1992). Altogether 913 cases of influenza were notified through the <b>sentinel</b> <b>network.</b> The greatest number of cases occurred in people aged between 20 and 39 years. CONCLUSION [...] For the epidemiological surveillance of influenza it is necessary to develop systems that can quickly detect epidemic periods and provide information about populations at risk, in addition to systems that isolate and identify seasonal epidemic viruses. Both types of data will help the development of adequate public health policies. Sentinel networks provide these data and offer additional advantages such as lower cost...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground and Objective Influenza {{epidemics}} are a {{major public}} health concern and require a costly and time-consuming surveillance system at different geographical scales. The main challenge {{is being able to}} predict epidemics. Besides traditional surveillance systems, such as the French <b>Sentinel</b> <b>network,</b> several studies proposed prediction models based on internet-user activity. Here, we assessed the potential of hospital big data to monitor influenza epidemics. Methods We used the clinical data warehouse of the Academic Hospital of Rennes (France) and then built different queries to retrieve relevant information from electronic health records to gather weekly influenza-like illness activity. Results We found that the query most highly correlated with <b>Sentinel</b> <b>network</b> estimates was based on emergency reports concerning discharged patients with a final diagnosis of influenza (Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0. 931). The other tested queries were based on structured data (ICD- 10 codes of influenza in Diagnosis-related Groups, and influenza PCR tests) and performed best (PCC of 0. 981 and 0. 953, respectively) during the flu season 2014 – 15. This suggests that both ICD- 10 codes and PCR results are associated with severe epidemics. Finally, our approach allowed us to obtain additional patients’ characteristics, such as the sex ratio or age groups, comparable with those from the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>network.</b> Conclusions Conclusions: Hospital big data seem to have a great potential for monitoring influenza epidemics in near real-time. Such a method could constitute a complementary tool to standard surveillance systems by providing additional characteristics on the concerned population or by providing information earlier. This system could also be easily extended to other diseases with possible activity changes. Additional work is needed to assess the real efficacy of predictive models based on hospital big data to predict flu epidemics. © 2017 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|In 2003, an internet-based {{monitoring}} system of influenza-like illness (ILI), the Great Influenza Survey (GIS), was initiated in Belgium. For the Flemish part of Belgium, we investigate the representativeness of the GIS population {{and assess the}} validity of the survey in terms of ILI incidence during eight influenza seasons (from 2003 through 2011). The validity is investigated by comparing estimated ILI incidences from the GIS with recorded incidences from two other {{monitoring system}}s, (i) the Belgian <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Network</b> and (ii) the Google Flu Trends, and by performing a risk factor analysis to investigate whether the risks on acquiring ILI in the GIS population are comparable with results in the literature.

Good to excellent correspondence is observed between the estimated ILI trends in the GIS and the recorded trends in the <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Network</b> and the Google Flu Trends.

To demonstrate the value of <b>sentinel</b> <b>networks</b> an international study on the incidence of chicken pox has been undertaken. Chickenpox was chosen as an acute condition for which incidence data {{are important to the}} determination of health policy on vaccine use. The project examined the incidence of chickenpox reported in <b>sentinel</b> <b>networks</b> in England and Wales, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (two regional networks) in January-June 2000 and the potential underestimate from patients who did not consult. An investigation of secondary household contact cases was undertaken. Reported incidence of chickenpox (all ages) in England and Wales was 25 per 10, 000, in The Netherlands 13 per 10, 000, in Portugal 21 per 10, 000, in Spain Castilla y Leon 27 per 10, 000 and in Spain Basque 55 per 10, 000. Analysis of secondary contact cases suggested underestimation of incidence between 2. 4 % in Spain Castilla y Leon and 32. 2 % in The Netherlands. There was a trend towards incidence at an earlier age in England and Wales and in The Netherlands compared with Portugal and Spain. Whilst there was little problem in reliably identifying the number of incident cases in the recording networks and relating the non-consulting contact cases to them, the security of the denominator remains a problem where networks are comprised of differing categories of health care provider. It is essential that numerator and denominator information are made available specifically for each category. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

The objectives are to identify and monitor outbreaks of influenza, gastroenteritis, and chicken pox, and to characterize circulating influenza viruses. The network can monitor other potentially epidemic diseases. Method: The Réunion <b>sentinel</b> <b>network</b> ensures a continuous and permanent surveillance. Physicians send their weekly activity data to the Cire that collects, processes, and interprets it; they also collect samples for biological {{surveillance of}} influenza.

A factorial analysis was performed on the basis of demographic, socio-cultural and socio-occupational variables. A cluster analysis was conducted to group the 247 basic health areas into homogeneous strata, which were then tested using a discriminant analysis. The general practitioners and pediatricians needed in each stratum were selected by simple random sampling. The representativeness of the population monitored by the selected physicians was studied with respect to the population of Madrid. ResultsFactorial analysis yielded five factors. Using these, 14 strata were obtained, which were shown to be homogeneous and mutually different by discriminant analysis. The minimum population that needed to be monitored consisted of 146, 946 adults and 24, 518 children, proportionally distributed among the respective strata.

40|$|Abstract Background In Norway {{there is}} a {{shortage}} of valid health activity statistics from the primary care out-of-hours services and the pre-hospital emergency health care system. There is little systematic information available because data registration is lacking or is only recorded periodically, and definitions of variables are not consistent. Method A representative sample of Norwegian municipalities and out-of-hours districts was contracted to establish a <b>sentinel</b> <b>network,</b> "The Watchtowers", and procedures were developed for collecting continuous data from out-of-hours services. All contacts, either per telephone or direct attendance, are recorded during day and night. The variables are registered in a computer program developed by the National Centre for Emergency Primary Health Care, and sent by email in Excel-file format to the Centre on a monthly basis. Results The selection process yielded a group of 18 municipalities, with a fair degree of representativeness for Norwegian municipalities as a whole. The sample has 212, 921 inhabitants, which constitutes 4. 6 % of the total Norwegian population. During a pilot period lasting three months the Watchtowers recorded all individual contacts. The procedures for registration, submitting and checking data worked satisfactorily. There was little data missing, and during the last three months of 2006 a total of 23, 346 contacts were registered. Conclusion We have been able to establish a <b>sentinel</b> <b>network</b> with a fair degree of representativeness for Norwegian out-of-hours districts and municipalities.

40|$|In Italy, several <b>sentinel</b> <b>networks</b> for {{estimating}} {{the incidence of}} influenza have been created in recent past. However, these networks only covered certain areas of northern and central Italy and thus did not provide epidemiological data representative of the entire country. For this reason, {{in the winter of}} 1999 / 2000, the first nationwide <b>sentinel</b> surveillance <b>network</b> for influenza was created. The network's main objective is to provide estimates of the incidence of influenza and to identify the specific virus or viruses in circulation, also in order to prepare vaccines for the following season. The network relies on general practitioners and paediatricians and consists of two sub-networks, working on the same objectives, whose combined data cover the entire country. One sub-network is co-ordinated by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita' (ISS; the Italian National Institute of Health) and the other by the Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerca sull'Influenza (CIRI; the Inter-university Research Centre on Influenza). The ISS collects data from 9 of Italy's 20 regions and from 2 autonomous provinces; data from the remaining regions are collected by the CIRI. For national-level analyses, all data are recorded in a single database and analysed as a whole; data are available on a specially created web-site. The present report describes the activities conducted to create the sub-network of the ISS, named FLU-ISS and the specific surveillance methods adopted; the epidemiological and virological results from the winter of 1999 / 2000 are also presentedConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche - Biblioteca Centrale - P. le Aldo Moro, 7, Rome Istituto Superiore di Sanita' - Viale Regina Elena, 299, Rome / CNR - Consiglio Nazionale delle RichercheSIGLEITItal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Abuse of and {{addiction}} to medication {{are a major}} public health issue which is evolving fast, in particular in coun-tries like France, {{one of the largest}} consumers of medication in Europe. As a single source of information is not generally sufficient to measure a phenomenon as difficult to apprehend as medication-related addiction, {{as can be seen in}} the case of methylphenidate, it is essential to mobilise all the tools available, here surveillance programmes developed by the French CEIP Addiction vigilance network, such as suspicious prescriptions indicating possible abuse data (OSIAP) or observatory of illegal or misused psychoactive medications (OPPIDUM), as well as the health insurance databases, and health profes-sional <b>sentinel</b> <b>networks.</b> The latest data available on methylphenidate abuse in France suggests a stabilisation of the phe-nomenon, which emerged in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur (PACA) region in southern France. It also evidences its dif-fusion to other regions, so that the information needs to be widely relayed, and suggests that health professionals should exercise the greatest caution in the use of this substance, and should look for early signs of its misuse.
