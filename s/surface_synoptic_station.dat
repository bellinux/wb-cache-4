40|$|Introduction: Rainfall has {{the highest}} {{variability}} at time and place scale. Rainfall fluctuation in different geographical areas reveals the necessity of investigating this climate element and suitable models to forecast the rate of precipitation for regional planning. Ardabil province has always faced rainfall fluctuations and shortage of water supply. Precipitation {{is one of the}} most important features of the environment. The amount of precipitation over time and in different places is subject to large fluctuations which may be periodical. Studies show that, due to the certain complexities of rainfall, the models which used to predict future values will also need greater accuracy and less error. Among the forecasting models, Arima has more applications and it has replaced with other models. Materials and Methods: In this research, through order 2 Autoregrressive, Winters, and Arima models, monthly rainfalls of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> (representing Ardabil province) for a 31 -year period (1977 - 2007) were investigated. To assess the presence or absence of significant changes in mean precipitation of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station,</b> rainfall of this station was divided into two periods: 1977 - 1993 and 1994 - 2010. T-test was used to statistically examine the difference between the two periods. After adjusting the data, descriptive statistics were applied. In order to model the total monthly precipitation of Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station,</b> Winters, Autoregressive, and Arima models were used. Among different models, the best options were chosen to predict the time series including the mean absolute deviation (MAD), the mean squared errors (MSE), root mean square errors (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE). In order to select the best model among the available options under investigation, the predicted value of the deviation of the actual value was utilized for the months of 2006 - 2010. Results and Discussion: Statistical characteristics of the total monthly precipitation in Ardabil <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> indicates that in May, the highest and in August, the lowest monthly total rainfall accounted in this station. Standard deviation of rainfall reached to the lowest level in August and its peak in November. Coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of total rainfall in all seasons, indicates a lack of compliance with normal distribution. From the view of the range of total monthly rainfall, October and August have highest and the lowest tolerance in these parameters, respectively. The results showed that the percentage of the mean absolute error for Arima, Winters and Autoregressive models was 61. 82, 148. 39 and 81. 54 respectively and its R square came to be 88. 28, 61. 07 and 85. 12 respectively. The comparison of the parameters is an indication of the fact that Arima {{has the highest}} R square and the lowest mean absolute error of 88. 28 and 61. 82 respectively than Winters and Autoregressive models.

In this paper, this {{phenomenon}} is of interest during the warm and cold halves {{of the year at}} 11 <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> in Poland. The five classes of drought are specified by the value of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). This article attempts to verify the hypothesis of the connection between the class of drought and changes in the stratosphere.

The information capacity for the full set of predictors is compared with the capacity given by the selected explaining variables.

40|$|Although {{wind and}} wave {{modeling}} is rather {{successful in the}} open ocean, modeling enclosed seas, particularly seas with small basins and complex orography, presents challenges. Here, we use data assimilation to improve wind and wave simulations in the Red Sea. We generated two sets of wind fields using a nested, high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model implemented with (VARFC) and without (CTL) assimilation of observations. Available conventional and satellite data were assimilated using the consecutive integration method with daily initializations over one year (2009). By evaluating the two wind products against in-situ data from <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations,</b> buoys, scatterometers, and altimeters, we found that seasonal patterns of wind and wave variability were well reproduced in both experiments. Statistical scores for simulated winds computed against QuikSCAT, buoy, and <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> observations suggest that data assimilation decreases the root-mean-square error to values between 1 and 2 m s- 1 and reduces the scatter index by 30 % compared to the CTL.

40|$|Introduction: Climate {{change has}} been one the most {{important}} subject in studies in the recent decades. Precipitation is an effective climatic parameter in the municipal and rural studies and in the industry, architecture, agriculture, climate and other fields. Trend analysis of average monthly and yearly rainfall investigated in many studies, but less researches probe regional rainfall analysis. In this study average yearly precipitation data measured at 31 <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> of Iran {{in the period of}} 1961 to 2010 used to study regional variations of precipitation. In this order station divided to five regions by fuzzy clustering. Then, using the regional Kendall method, trend of precipitation investigated at five regions and all of Iran. Materials and Methods: Iran with an area of over 16480000 square kilometers is situated in the northern hemisphere and southwest of Asia. Almost all parts of Iran have four seasons. In general, a year can be divided into two warm and cold seasons. Iran with range annual precipitation of 62. 1 - 344. 8 mm is located between two meridians of eastern 44 ° and 64 ° and two orbits of northern 40 ° and 25 °. In order to investigate trend of precipitation two Mann-Kendall and Regional Kendall tests used. Also to evaluate the regional trends the Fuzzy method applied to clustering the studied region. The classic form of Mann-Kendall test has been used in many studies. The null hypothesis (no trends) is accepted when, otherwise H 0 is rejected and its opposite hypothesis, i. e. the existence of a trend is accepted (5, 13). To estimate regional trend, the mean S statistic of Regional Mann-Kendall introduced that was presented by Douglas et al (7). Fuzzy Clustering: Clustering the studied area was done using the Fuzzy clustering method. One of the first clustering methods that were based on the objective function and Euclidean distance was presented by Dunn in 1974 and then was generalized by Bezdak in 1981. The FCM clustering algorithm is modified type of K-Means clustering algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the variance of clusters (1). The assumption of this algorithm is that data are in a vector space and the objective of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of variance in the D v cluster. Results and Discussion: In this section the results of decreasing and increasing trend of annual precipitation of Iran can be observed in order to the data that recorded at provinces <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> in the 1 and 5 percentage significance levels. Isfahan <b>Synoptic</b> <b>station</b> detected an increasing trend insignificant level of 5 percentages and the East Azerbaijan <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> followed a significant and severe decreasing trends. In order to investigate regional trend it is needed to use the clustering methods. After investigation the trend of mean annual precipitation at each station, the studied area was clustered using the Fuzzy clustering method and then the regional trend of Iran’s precipitation was evaluated. At first the number of different clusters investigated using the geographic properties and mean annual precipitation of the studied area and then with attention to the correlation of precipitation series in each cluster, five clusters selected to investigate the regional trend of precipitation. Overall the results showed that about 67 percentages of <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> in center of provinces detected decreasing trend in the recent half century. Increasing the precipitation almost accrued in the center and northern part of Iran and other areas detected a decreasing precipitation trend in the studied data period that this subject is corresponded with Azerakhshi and et al (2). The observed trends over Iran and almost all stations and provinces were downward trend. This decreasing trend of precipitation also observed in Iran in the two past decades by Khalili et al (13). Conclusion: Result showed decreasing trend in the west, north of Iran at each station and regional scale. Results indicated also a significant downward trend at northwest, central and south-west of the country, non-significant downward trend in western of Iran and non-significant upward trends in northern regions and Caspian Sea margins in the regional analysis.

Then by the Man-Cendal graphical test how and starting time of trend or changes is determined and changes value measured. The research result show more changes in the series related to the starting and the ending of germination season with thermal bases 10 °c to series with 5 c°. In spite of other stations, Oroomiyeh, Khoramabad, Saghez, Shahrekord is faced with decreasing of germination season. Zoning maps showed that growing season length in the studied area is decreased from south to west and west north, so that in the studied thermal bases, Bandarabas station has longest and Shahrekord station ha...|$|R
30|$|The climatic {{regime is}} sudanian with two climatic seasons: a dry season from October to April when {{rainfall}} {{is less than}} 100  mm and a rainy season from May to September with rainfall exceeding 100  mm. The months of December, January and February are the driest months while July, August and September are the wettest with an average monthly rainfall over 200  mm. This climate regime strongly influences the activity of 53 % {{of the population that}} depend mainly on extensive agriculture. For the rest of the population, 11 % are in the secondary sector (factories, construction and other industries) and 36 % in the tertiary sector (trade, services, transport and administration). There are five (5) rainfall <b>stations</b> and one <b>synoptic</b> <b>station</b> in the basin (Figure  1).|$|R

Eight irradiation models are analysed {{based on the}} meteorology information of 22 <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations.</b> Afterwards, accuracy of these methods is compared using standard error criteria. Hence, Daneshyar and Modified Daneshyar are introduced as the most precise methods. Then, a new coefficient is added to Daneshyar model and Niroo Research Institute (NRI) model is presented. Ultimately, errors of NRI method are compared with other methods and {{it is observed that}} regarding all types of errors, NRI model has the most conformity with experimental data. cloud factor; diffused radiation; direct radiation; error analysis; Iran; irradiation modelling; meteorological data; optimum; solar energy; solar power; total radiation; total solar irradiation; Iran. ...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{important}} effects on earth environment and human life. Therefor, investigation and study {{of climate change}} is very essential. This study investigated rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind variability by analyzing data for annual and monthly climatic factors collected at 13 <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> (industrial cities of Iran) by using Mann-Kendall test. The results of monthly rainfall trends showed that most of <b>synoptic</b> <b>stations</b> have significant positive and negative trends in winter and spring months. About 23 % and 1. 7 % of stations have significant negative and positive trends, respectively, in annual trend of this factor. The results of monthly number of rainy days showed the major number of significant trends occurs in spring. In autumn (September, October and November) like as summer most of the stations have no significant trends. Analyzing the annual number of rainy days trends also showed that 4 stations have significant positive trends and 2 stations negative trends. Trend of greatest daily precipitation is low throughout the year, so there is not any significant trend in winter. Annual investigations confirm the seasonal investigations. The major number of significant trends in monthly mean maximum temperature occurs in summer but there are not any significant trends in winter and March. The trend of mean minimum temperature is approximately high {{in all of the}} seasons and the major number of significant trends occurs in summer and autumn and then in spring and ultimately in winter. In annual investigation, most of the stations showed positive trends and only Oroomieh station has negative trends. Trend of mean temperature is high except for winter. Most of the stations showed positive trend, indicating increasing trends in this factor. Annual studies vertify the positive trends and about 63 % of stations have significant positive trends...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some statistical {{evaluations of}} the surface energy and soil water balance fluxes, for a prairie-type canopy, using the Earth model with a double-reservoir system {{for the management of}} the soil water reserve and the regulation of actual evapotranspiration. The mean values of these fluxes are estimated from energy and water balance simulations done on a 30 -year climatic reference period (1951 – 1980). From values of these fluxes calculated for each meteorological <b>synoptic</b> <b>station,</b> mappings of net radiation, actual evapotranspiration, drainage and conduction fluxes have been made over French territory. Lastly, a few conclusions pertaining to the spatial variability of fluxes and to the partition of rainfall between run-off and drainage {{on the one hand and}} replenishment of the soil water reserve on the other hand are drawn from these preliminary results...|$|R
