50|$|When {{considering}} whether a specific nuclear transmutation, a reaction or a decay, is energetically allowed, one only needs to sum {{the masses of}} the initial nucleus/nuclei and subtract from that value {{the sum of the}} masses of the product particles. If the result, or Q-value, is positive, then the transmutation is allowed, or exothermic because it releases energy, and if the Q-value is a negative quantity, then it is endothermic as at least that much energy must be added to the system before the transmutation may proceed. For example, to determine if 12C, the most common isotope of carbon, can undergo proton emission to 11B, one finds that about 16 MeV must be added to the system for this process to be allowed. While Q-values can be used to describe any nuclear transmutation, for particle decay, the particle <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> quantity S, is also used, and it is equivalent to the negative of the Q-value. In other words, the proton <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> Sp indicates how much energy should be added to a given nucleus to remove a single proton. Thus, the particle drip lines defined the boundaries where the particle <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> is {{less than or equal to}} zero, for which the spontaneous emission of that particle is energetically allowed.|$|E

50|$|The dineutron {{is another}} {{hypothetical}} particle. In 2012, Artemis Spyrou from Michigan State University and coworkers {{reported that they}} observed, for the first time, the dineutron emission in the decay of 16Be. The dineutron character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two neutrons. The authors measured the two-neutron <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> to be 1.35(10) MeV, in good agreement with shell model calculations, using standard interactions for this mass region.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{the only}} type of nuclei that are longer lived and undergo proton or neutron {{emission}} {{are in the}} class of beta-delayed decays, where first the isospin of one nucleon is reversed (proton to neutron or vice versa) via beta-decay, and then if the particle <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> is non-positive, the daughter nucleus will undergo particle decay. Most naturally occurring γ-sources are technically β-delayed γ-decay, so this concept should be familiar; some gamma-sources are α-delayed but these are generally categorized with other alpha-sources.|$|E
50|$|As the photon bath will {{typically}} {{be described}} by a Planckian distribution, higher energy photons will be less abundant, and so photodisintegration will not become significant until the nucleon <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> begins to approach zero towards the drip lines, where photodisintegration may be induced by lower energy gamma rays. At 1 × 109 Kelvin, the photon distribution is energetic enough to knock nucleons out of any nuclei that have particle separation energies less than 3 MeV, but to know which nuclei exist in what abundances one must consider also the competing radiative captures.|$|E

50|$|Proton {{emission}} (also {{known as}} proton radioactivity) {{is a rare}} type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus. Proton emission can occur from high-lying excited states in a nucleus following a beta decay, {{in which case the}} process is known as beta-delayed proton emission, or can occur from the ground state (or a low-lying isomer) of very proton-rich nuclei, in which case the process is very similar to alpha decay. For a proton to escape a nucleus, the proton <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> must be negative - the proton is therefore unbound, and tunnels out of the nucleus in a finite time. Proton emission is not seen in naturally occurring isotopes; proton emitters can be produced via nuclear reactions, usually using linear particle accelerators.|$|E
50|$|The general {{location}} of the proton drip line is well established. For all elements occurring naturally on earth and having an odd number of protons, at least one species with a proton <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> less than zero has been experimentally observed. Up to germanium the {{location of}} the drip line for many elements with an even number of protons is known, but none past that point are listed in the evaluated nuclear data. There are a few exceptional cases where, due to nuclear pairing, there are some particle-bound species outside the drip line, such as 8B and 178Au. One may also note that nearing the magic numbers, the drip line is less understood. A compilation of the known first unbound nuclei beyond the proton drip line is given below, with the number of protons, Z and the corresponding isotopes, taken from the National Nuclear Data Center.|$|E

An atomic force microscope (AFM) colloid probe technique was correlated with physico-chemical properties and in-vitro performance. Briefly, micronised drug particles of salbutamol sulphate, triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) were mounted onto Vshaped tipless cantilevers using a developed micromanipulation technique. Interactions between the AFM ‘drug probes’ and a series of model drug surfaces were conducted at a 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 % relative humidity using a custom built perfusion apparatus connected to the AFM. As expected, <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> distributions for drug probe interactions were dependent on the surface rugosity of the drug model surfaces. <b>Separation</b> <b>energy</b> measurements conducted between drug probes and individual micronised drug particles (mounted in polymer resin) suggested large variations in <b>separation</b> <b>energy.</b> Further analysis of such data suggested a lognormal <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> distribution, however, limitations in individual particle measurements (finite particle measurements per experiment) allowed restricted statistical analysis...|$|E
40|$|We reexamine the {{phenomenon}} of neutron-proton pairing using a new measure of its presence in nuclear binding, namely the second difference of the neutron or proton <b>separation</b> <b>energy</b> {{with respect to the}} nucleon number of the other kind.
