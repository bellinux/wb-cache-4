500|$|In November 2010, after sister Lauren was recast to Jossa, Jossa {{stated that}} she enjoys working with Fitzgerald, adding {{the two have}} a lot in common. Jossa, in 2012, wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more. She commented: [...] "I think realistically they would when they're going through a family problem like this. It would bring the family a little bit closer. I think they are quite close already and {{they have a lot of}} family banter! They may not like each other as people, but they love each other as family". In December 2012, Fitzgerald {{conducted}} her first magazine interview and spoke of a storyline where Abi comforts Lauren over a relationship break up, saying [...] "It's nice to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> [...] taking care of the bigger one." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, I--I've <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> green shoes {{she left}} at Brickwall House--down the road, you know. They're {{in a glass}} case--awfully tiny things.' ...|$|R
60|$|Bottles agreed. Could he have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> {{scheme that}} was dawning in his brother's brain, {{perhaps he would}} not have assented so readily.|$|R

6000|$|Joe Taylor led the {{way over}} the rail, and the three boys, eager to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> steamer, {{followed}} directly behind Bob, Jim whispering to his friends: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do you ask?" [...] inquired Rinkitink, uneasy at the {{question}} because he remembered he had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> Prince of Pingaree that morning.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Ruth {{nodded and}} leaned back. Wingrave smiled faintly {{as he turned}} away. He had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> shudder which she had done her best to hide! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> boy was uninjured, {{the crowd}} moved on, and {{presently}} the young oarsman found himself {{alone with the}} girl, {{who appeared to be}} several years older than himself.|$|R
6000|$|After {{taking some}} of the tea, the poor woman revived, and I whispered to her daughter,--"Don't you think it might please her to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> picture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Uncle, do you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> {{birds that}} fly back and forward over the castle walls so freely, and build their nests in the thatch of the housetops?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At Edinburgh," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "It is {{the place}} where Mary lived. We shall <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> room there where they murdered her poor secretary, David Rizzio." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> coffin tremble {{above the}} hole, he craned his head still further forward. It sank; a smothered sobbing rose. The old butler touched the arm {{in front of}} him with shaking fingers.|$|R
6000|$|He sees {{nothing of}} that traffic. He <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> sea garden at Sandgate and that little {{group of people}} very small and bright and something--something hanging over them. [...] "It isn't fair on them--or me--or anybody!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't so {{very much}} mind barrel-organs myself,' said Logan; 'I don't know {{anything}} prettier than to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> girls dancing to the music in a London side street.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that may be; {{but this}} will not fail, I know, for I can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> bubbles of choke damp coming up. There are {{millions}} of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'ye <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> lumps on the {{shoulder}} o' each horse?" [...] said Joe. [...] "Them's Injun's feet; an' if we don't want to lose our scalps we'd better make for the forest." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{wondered}} if <b>the</b> master had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> episode which {{had taken place}} immediately before his arrival. Then he remembered that it had happened inside the court. It must have been over by the time Mr Spence had come upon the scene.|$|R
60|$|But Joe had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> note copied, {{and while}} the others were at the window working the {{telegraph}} he caught up the original, carelessly thrust by Jack under the pillow, and read it aloud before any one {{knew what he was}} about.|$|R

6000|$|Venetia {{walked home}} with Mistress Pauncefort, but Lady Annabel's little {{daughter}} {{was not in}} her usual lively spirits; many a butterfly glanced around without attracting her pursuit, and the deer trooped by without eliciting a single observation.
