The press often uses nicknames for DVAs. For example, I found the expression “accounting quirk” in ten articles (untabulated, e.g., Eavis 2009 b; Landy 2011).

6000|$|When {{these issues}} of public honour and {{efficient}} democratic administration {{have begun to}} move towards a definite solution, the community {{will be in a}} position to extend the operation of the new methods towards a profounder revolution, the control of private property. [...] "We are all Socialists nowadays," [...] and it is needless, therefore, to argue here at any length to establish the fact that beyond quite personal belongings all Property is the creation of society, and in reality no more than an administrative device. At present, in spite of some quite hideous and mischievous local aspects, the institution of Property, even in land and the shares of quasi- public businesses, probably gives as efficient a method of control, and even it may be a more efficient method of control than any that could be devised to replace it under existing conditions. We have no public bodies and no methods of check and control sufficiently trustworthy to justify extensive expropriations. Even the municipalization of industries needs to go slowly until municipal areas have been brought more into conformity with the conditions of efficient administration. Areas too cramped and areas that overlap spell waste and conflicting authorities, and premature municipalization in such areas will lead only to the final triumph of the private company. Political efficiency must precede Socialism. [Footnote: <b>See</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>I.</b> ] But there can be no doubt that the spectacle of irresponsible property is a terribly demoralizing force in the development of each generation. It is idle to deny that Property, both in Great Britain and America, works out into a practical repudiation of that equality, political democracy so eloquently asserts. There is a fatalistic submission to inferiority on the part of an overwhelming majority of those born poor, they hold themselves cheap in countless ways, and they accept as natural the use of wealth for wanton pleasure and purposes absolutely mischievous, they despair of effort in the public service, and find their only hope in gambling, sharp greedy trading, or in base acquiescences to the rich. The good New Republican can only regard our present system of Property as a terribly unsatisfactory expedient and seek with all his power to develop a better order to replace it.|$|E

30|$|I {{quantified}} groundcover {{species composition}} within sub-subplots (or subplots in 2006) by calculating species richness and fidelity of the sub-subplot assemblage to open habitats, forests, and disturbed habitats. I derived habitat fidelity calculations from weighted sums of abundances of all species with habitat indicator values of greater than 0 {{for a given}} habitat category, wherein the weights were species-specific habitat indication scores. For details of the calculation, see Brewer and Menzel (2009), Brewer et al. (2012, 2015), and Appendix 1. In short, I obtained each species’ habitat indication score from the proportional similarity in species composition between those specific habitats in the region in which the species occurred (as determined from regional flora manuals) and species composition of the general habitat category of interest (e.g., open or forest or disturbed), again as determined by regional flora manuals (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> 1). <b>I</b> further refined each species’ habitat indication score by subtracting from the score {{the average of the}} indication scores of the other two habitats of interest.

40|$|With advancements in {{information}} technology, people can now access {{enormous amounts of}} information with ease. The education system, which plays {{a vital role in}} developing our future, has undergone important changes. In the past decades, nearly every part of the education process, from curricula design, assessment methodologies, to teaching methodologies, have been scrutinized. As a result, a series of reforms or changes have been implemented. The purposes of the present study are to investigate more about perceptions and attitudes of secondary school mathematics teachers towards the use of computers in their teaching. Besides, the factors affecting teachers’ attitudes towards computer application in teaching are also analyzed. Finally, the study will also explore the effectiveness of students’ learning through cooperative learning One class of 36 students from 5 C, aged 14 - 16, were invited to participate in this research by using the DMS of GeoGebra for teaching the topics of ‘Basic Properties of Circles’. The teaching outcome of 5 C would then be compared with 2 other classes of 5 A and 5 B, which would be taught by my peer teachers. 5 A and 5 B’s teachers would employ conventional teaching methods to teach ‘Basic Properties of Circles’ (i. e. the Control Group). Five student worksheets for Basic Operation of GeoGebra and each sub-topic of “Basic Properties of Circles” were devised (<b>see</b> <b>Appendices</b> <b>I</b> to V). Those 5 students were all asked to fill in the questionnaire I. Besides, 12 mathematics teachers were asked to fill in the questionnaire <b>I</b> (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> VIII) of Mathematics with Technology Perceptions Survey (MTPS) in order to investigate their perceptions of using information technology (IT) in teaching mathematics. The purpose of the MTPS items was to ascertain the prevalence of key attitudes and perceptions creating barriers or enabling teachers’ intentions to alter their practice and to teach mathematics with technology. Demographic data of MTPS items were collected on gender, age group, years of teaching, education level, teacher training, teaching level and subject taught. During the whole study, video-recording was taken. In addition, my two peer teachers from classes 5 A and 5 B were also invited to have an interview. Then, they were asked to fill in the questionnaire II (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> XIII) in order to investigate their’ intention in using the DMS of GeoGebra for teaching and learning mathematics in Secondary 5 classes. Besides, 14 students were randomly selected in order to find out the effects of their learning by using DMS of GeoGebra through peer groups, and these 14 students were invited to complete an extended version of questionnaire II (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> X). Finally, students were asked to conduct a test (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> VI) in order to compare the learning outcome of students learning ‘Basic Properties of Circles’ with the DMS of GeoGebra with those learning in its absence. It is suggested that the integration of computer in learning mathematics should be required. Schools need to make full use of technology to guide students {{to learn as much as}} possible. Also, leadership needs to be available to teachers and to provide an in-service education in technology use, so that technology use was operating as well as possible. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2005. This {{research}} was initiated {{as a response}} to a request for assistance from a group of students at the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine who had reported feeling unprepared to prescribe medicines. This led to an interest in the level of competence shown by students in making prescribing decisions {{and the extent to which}} they were confident of their prescribing judgments. Student prescribing competence and confidence were assessed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative assessment comprised a test where students were asked to rate their confidence in some of their responses. A stratified sample of 10 of these student interviewed, where they were asked to choose treatment for four paper cases. Prescribing skills were found to be lacking, with test results averaging 47 %. appropriate treatment selected for only 4 of the total of 40 paper cases. Upon reviewing the literature, it became apparent that poor prescribing skills, leading to the problem of irrational prescribing was a worldwide phenomenon The study aimed to address areas of weak prescribing skill using a short intense intervention comprising of several different learning strategies. Student change in confidence following the course was assessed using an evaluation form where students rated their perceived changes in key competences. Students showed improved confidence for each of the prescribing abilities measured. These findings have been compiled into 3 research publications, the texts of which are bound together as they were submitted together to comply with the research requirement of an M. Ed. The findings are reported in a paper titled Building successful therapeutics into a problembased medical curriculum in Africa in the South African Journal of Higher Education (<b>see</b> <b>Appendices).</b> <b>I</b> was also interested in how prescribing ability builds as students develop new prescribing skills. The student interviews provided an opportunity to explore the variation shown between the students relating to the quality of the treatment they prescribed for a given paper case. A sample of two sets of paper cases were assessed using a phenomenographic method, yielding two different perspectives of student experience. The research outlined above is the focus of the dissertation, which also includes an exploration of the teaching and learning issues which guided the design of the intervention and which I believe led to the positive finding of improved student prescribing confidence. Also included in the dissertation is an analysis of the quantitative assessment according to the cognitive categories of Bloom's Taxonomy, as well as qualitative data gathered from student interviews which revealed an understanding about prescribing abilities which predominated at differing Bloom cognitive levels for different students. In the second paper titled Undergraduate medical students' reasoning with regard to the prescribing process which has been submitted to Medical Teacher, (<b>see</b> <b>Appendices)</b> the range of student cognition associated with prescribing is explored.

40|$|I {{have long}} had a passion for writing music, {{particularly}} for visual media, because of the deep emotional impact that it can have on viewers. Film music {{has the capacity to}} draw viewers in to new experiences and emotions that they might otherwise never have. It is fascinating to me how subtle changes in music can completely change the meaning of a film, and as a composer I am always striving to better understand those subtleties in order to bring out the desired emotions of a film. For this reason, I used my thesis project to explore just how drastically I could alter one short film with my original music. On November 11, 2013, I presented the creative portion of my honors thesis entitled Listening to Movies: The Emotional Response of an Audience to Music in Correlation with Film. For the presentation, I wrote three contrasting scores to accompany a public domain film (<b>see</b> <b>appendices).</b> <b>I</b> had in mind a general mood but also a specific story and situation for each setting of the film. I {{spent a great deal of}} time with the film before writing a single note so that I knew exactly what moments and overarching emotions needed to be highlighted with each score. I gave myself approximately three weeks to write each score but ended up spending an uneven amount of time on them. Some of the music became clear to me quite quickly while other parts of it took much longer to conceive. The process for scoring a film is always unique to each project for me, and this instance was no different. Each of the three scores took on its own life and style as I wrote to match the film and my imagined story as closely as possible. The full film is 16 minutes long and follows an older woman and her dog waking up and going about their day. It is a silent, black and white film without much of a plot, and I used only the first two minutes and thirty seconds of it for this project. On the evening of my thesis presentation, I conducted and performed my three scores with a chamber orchestra for a live audience. After seeing the film without any music and upon hearing each score, I gave the audience time to provide written feedback regarding their reactions, and asked the following questions: 1. What do you believe to be the genre of this film? 2. What do you believe is about to happen when the clip ends? 3. Give a brief description of the woman in the film and/or her current situation. 4.
