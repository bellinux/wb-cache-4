40|$|Many studies {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} welfare benefits on mothers’ living arrangements while housing costs <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> are rarely the focus of <b>study.</b> Housing costs <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> affect the affordability and accessibility of housing. This article estimates the effects of housing prices and public and subsidized housing on the living arrangements of mothers three years after a non-marital birth while controlling for welfare benefit levels, sex ratios, unemployment rates, child support enforcement and personal characteristics. Results suggest that housing prices are positively associated with marriage, cohabitation and living with family. The availability of public and subsidized housing are negatively associated with both marriage and cohabitation relative to living alone. The relative risk of marriage is reduced more than cohabitation suggesting eligibility criteria and meanstesting make marriage more costly. Failure to control for housing costs <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> leads to underestimates {{of the effects of}} welfare and unemployment rates on living arrangements.

The result is that an all-or-nothing choice between quotas <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> will generally favor the use of subsidies. A combination of quotas <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> however, usually remains the most efficient means of income redistribution through market intervention.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of patents <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> on R&D {{investment}} decisions. The theoretical framework is a two-stage game consisting of an investment and a market stage. In equilibrium, both patents <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> induce {{the same amount of}} R&D investment, which is higher than the investment without governmental incentives. In the first stage, the firms can invest in a stochastic R&D project which might lead to a reduction of the marginal production costs and in the second stage, the firms face price competition. Both stages of the game are implemented in a laboratory experiment and the obtained results support the theoretical predictions. Patents <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> increase investment in R&D and the observed amounts of investment in the patent <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> treatment do not differ significantly across both instruments. However, we observe overinvestment in all three treatments. Observed prices in the market stage converge to equilibrium price levels...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{commodity}} prices <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> on {{the adoption of}} soil conservation has been widely debated yet is poorly understood. One {{reason for this is}} the complex nature of the relationship between soil loss and yield damage. This paper examines the effects of price <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> policy on adoption of soil conservation measures in tea lands in Sri Lanka. The soil conservation technologies considered are lateral drains, stone terraces and Sloping Agricultural Land Technique (SALT). The study uses a non-linear yield damage function to estimate tea yield loss due to soil erosion. The yield function is then used in conjunction with a simple analytical model {{to examine the effects of}} changes in price <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> on the incentives to adopt various soil conservation technologies. When there is a yield increment with soil conservation, increases in both prices <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> are found to make soil conservation economically attractive. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Do price interventions, namely {{taxes on}} {{unhealthy}} food <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> on healthy food, affect food-purchasing behavior? If so, {{can they be}} used to improve health? With the intent to better understand these questions as well as the general dynamics between food preference and price, this paper (a) provides a theoretical framework for understanding purchasing behavior of lower income households subject to taxes <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> <b>and</b> (b) estimates the effects of a price intervention by using data from a six-month field experiment where 212 households were randomized into a control or treatment group, where the treatment group faced a 5 percent tax on unhealthy foods <b>and</b> 5 percent <b>subsidy</b> on healthy foods relative to the control group. The theoretical model suggests that price interventions will have different, and sometimes undesirable, effects depending on the individual's preferences, with lower income individuals being more likely to be negatively impacted by a tax. In the empirical model, the combined tax <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> had little effect on household purchasing behavior, and did not increase food purchases in important health-related categories such as fruits and vegetables. To policy makers these results suggest that small taxes <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> may not help individuals make better, healthier, food choices. iii 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R
