These measurements should incorporate the assessment of surface performance by riders. This study provides data from objective and subjective assessment of functional properties of high-level show jumping competition and warm-up arenas. Twenty-five arenas in nine international show jumping events were evaluated by mechanical in-situ testing with a <b>surface</b> <b>tester,</b> rider assessments using visual analogue scales (198 riders provided 749 arena evaluations), descriptions of arena constructions and by laboratory tests of surface material. Mixed models were used to present subjective evaluation of rider perception of the functional properties for each arena while controlling for rider and event. The association between objective and subjective assessments were also explored creating mixed models, controlling for rider and event. Mechanical measurements of impact firmness, {{and to a lesser extent}} cushioning and grip, had a significant positive association with the riders’ perception. Responsiveness as assessed by the Orono biomechanical <b>surface</b> <b>tester</b> (OBST) was negatively associated with the riders’ perceptions, which suggests riders and the OBST had different concepts of this functional property and that further developments of the OBST might be necessary. Objectively measured uniformity showed no useful association with riders’ perception. Even though arena assessments were made by top level riders, a substantial inter-rider variation was demonstrated...|$|E

5|$|The <b>surface</b> {{friction}} <b>tester</b> {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. <b>Surface</b> friction <b>testers</b> are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. <b>Surface</b> friction <b>testers</b> often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the <b>surface</b> friction <b>tester</b> works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|R

The task of this master’s thesis {{is to use}} data from the Laser Road <b>Surface</b> <b>Tester</b> to detect road sections with risk of aquaplaning. A three-dimensional model {{based on data from}} road surface measurements is created using MATLAB (version 6. 1).

The pond model seems to work well assuming that the data from the road model is correct. Determining limits for depth and length of risk ponds can be made directly by the user. MATLAB code is reasonably easy to understand and this leaves great opportunities for changing different parameters in a simple way. Supplementary research is needed to further improve the risk pond detection model. Collecting data at smaller intervals and with more measurement points would be desirable for achieving better correlation with reality.

Measurements were made north of Uppsala, Sweden, where a highway stretch includes both types of pavements. In a previous study a method was developed to measure fuel consumption with high precision. According to the method, measurements are made repeatedly with a 1992 Volvo 940 that carries instrumentation for precise measurement of speed, fuel consumption, fuel temperature, distance travelled etc. Measurements were made at 90 km/h. Prior to the measurements, pilot trials were conducted to calibrate the methodology and to get a first idea of possible differences between the pavements. The trials indicated that there was a difference which led to that a full scale study was initiated. It was concluded that differences were related to differences in pavement texture. A Road <b>Surface</b> <b>Tester</b> (RST) vehicle was used to investigate these properties (i. e. Mean Profile Depth, MPD).

Therefore, the self-developed vertical ball/disk friction tester with the measurement system was used to study the effects of nitride on the tribological properties of the low carbon alloy steel—SCM 415 — in this study. The experiments were conducted under dry and severe wear conditions. The variations of friction coefficient and surface magnetization were simultaneously recorded during dynamic friction process. After each test, the microstructures of the wear particles were observed and analyzed under a SEM, and the depth of wear track is measured by means of a <b>surface</b> <b>tester.</b> According to the experimental results, the wear resistance of the specimens with carburizing-nitride is significantly larger than the case of nitride-carburizing. Moreover, the surface magnetization was especially larger for the case of nitride-carburizing. As a result, the wear particles always stay in the interfaces and the wear mechanism becomes complex.

The Ministry of Transport (MOT) of Saudi Arabia has been collecting pavement condition data using the Road <b>Surface</b> <b>Tester</b> (RST) vehicle. The MOT measures roughness (ROU), rutting (RUT), cracking (CRA), and raveling (RAV). Roughness measurements are calculated {{in terms of the}} International Roughness Index (IRI). In the present three relationships, including CRA versus IRI, RUT versus IRI, and RAV versus IRI have been developed. The models relating to three types of distresses under study, and model relating IRI to ride quality have been studied in the present work. The results of the analysis indicate that a significant relationship exists between IRI and cracking, and IRI and raveling at 95 % confidence level. The results also show that the rutting did not show a significant relationship to IRI values. It can be concluded from the results that cracking and raveling may possibly be described as ride quality distresses, whereas the rutting distress may be described as non-ride quality distress. The results indicate that while statistically significant relationships exist between IRI and both cracking and rutting, these relationships are not strong enough for IRI {{to be used as a}} surrogate measure for pavement condition...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the current industry standard Securisport® Sports <b>Surface</b> <b>Tester</b> that measures skin surface related frictional behaviour of artificial turf. Little research has been published about the device and its efficacy, despite its widespread use as a standard FIFA test instrument. To achieve a range of frictional behaviours, several “third generation” (3 G) carpet and infill combinations were investigated; friction time profiles throughout the Securisport rotations were assessed in combination with independent measurements of skin roughness before and after friction testing via 3 D surface scanning. The results indicated that carpets without infill had greatest friction (coefficients of friction 0. 97 – 1. 20) while those completely filled with sand or rubber had similar and lower values independent of carpet type (coefficient of friction (COF) ≈ 0. 57). Surface roughness of a silicone skin (s-skin) decreased after friction testing, with the largest change on sand infilled surfaces, indicating an “abrasive” polishing effect. The combined data show that the s-skin is damaged in a surface-specific manner, thus the Securisport COF values appear to be a poor measure of the potential for skin abrasion. It is proposed that the change in s-skin roughness improves assessment of the potential for skin damage when players slide on artificial turf...|$|E
