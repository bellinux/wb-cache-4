5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution.

On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only <b>slightly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a fifth of its swimming speed.
