5|$|Following the Davis Cup, Murray's {{season was}} cut short by his {{decision}} to undergo surgery, in order to <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lower back problems that had caused him problems since {{the early stages of}} the previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice to}} choose Las Vegas as the {{location}} was {{widely regarded as}} a bid by the city to give it its first major sports franchise. Mayor Oscar Goodman met with David Stern to discuss the possibility during the events.

In 1853 an {{administrative}} body was created, called the Board of Police Commissioners, consisting of Mayor Westervelt, the recorder {{and the city}} judge. Apart {{from the fact that}} the chief of police was selected by the Mayor with the Board's approval, the Board had full powers of appointment and dismissal of all members of the force and was charged with general administrative duties.|$|E

25|$|All {{reconfiguration}} {{work was}} completed at Severodvinsk, Russia; however it was delayed by three years due to underestimation {{of the amount}} of cabling needed.

The MiG-29K entered operational service with India in February 2010. A compromise was finalised and India was to pay an extra undisclosed amount. Russia was to install new systems instead of repairing the old ones.|$|E

25|$|The near-debacle of March 1918 was {{an object}} of {{political}} controversy. Repington wrote that it was “the worst defeat {{in the history of}} the Army”. Bonar Law had claimed in a House of Commons debate (23 April) that Haig and Petain had agreed the extension of the British line, which was not wholly true as in January 1918 the Supreme War Council had ordered a longer extension than Haig and Petain had agreed between themselves in December 1917, only leaving them to <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> details.|$|E

25|$|The Commissioners were {{replaced}} following {{the passing of}} the Land Drainage Act in 1861. A special commission, which was only responsible for King's Sedgemoor, was created, but like their predecessors, they found that their powers were limited, and their ability to raise funds by rates was inadequate. A high tide in 1876 carried the clyse gates away, and the adjacent bridge had to be demolished for safety. Tides passed up the channel and flooded the moors. Work to construct a new bridge with tidal doors cost £16,000, and the area was impoverished by the debt. The Somerset Drainage Act of 1877 was another attempt to <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lack of administrative power, but no work was undertaken in King's Sedgemoor. Serious breaches of the banks occurred in 1872, 1891, 1894, 1924 and 1929.|$|E
25|$|After {{the crowd}} (perhaps accidentally) toppled {{one of the}} Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, {{including}} toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try and <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> problem, only to be punched {{in the head and}} knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set, as seen in the documentary film Gimme Shelter. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer out, one of the bikers took hold of a microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.|$|E
25|$|There were {{collective}} punishments after enclosures {{built for}} distributing rations and counting refugees {{were destroyed by}} unidentified refugees (1994 and 1996). Because of that food distribution was cut off for 21 days and 14 days, respectively and the 'incentives' paid to employed refugees were withdrawn. After these tensions some refugee leaders were invited to a meeting with UNHCR representatives in the next bigger town (Lodwar). They attended believing it would {{provide an opportunity to}} <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> misunderstandings between the refugees and the agencies. However these leaders were arrested, charged with incitement, destruction of property and theft of building materials. They spend two months in prison and the following court hearings had to be paid by the refugee community. They were acquitted for this charge but couldn't get compensation for being in prison because of UNHCRs jurisdictional immunity.|$|E

Potter, the local banker and the richest man in town. Potter wishes to dissolve the Building and Loan to take over its business. George convinces the board of directors to vote against Potter. They agree, on condition that George runs the business, along with his absent-minded uncle Billy. George and Mary get married. On their way to their honeymoon, they witness a run on the bank and use their honeymoon savings to lend financial support at the Building and Loan until the bank reopens.|$|E
25|$|While the Allen and Unwin sheets {{appear to}} have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not phototypeset new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had {{accumulated}} up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the way it would with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its crispness, it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Hence, comparisons of type degradation to <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> 15th, 16th, and 17th impressions would seem fruitless. Indeed, the 23rd impression's type block seems just as effectively identical.|$|E
25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, had thought {{it would have been better}} if rival groups would eventually end the violence and <b>sort</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions and blame to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E
