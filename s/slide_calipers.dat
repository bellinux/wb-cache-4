40|$|Introduction: Odontoid {{process is}} a bony {{projection}} of axis around which the atlas rotates. It measures 1 to 1. 25 cms in length and projects upwards {{from the body of}} Axis. An elongated odontoid process may narrow the foramen magnum causing compressive neurological symptoms. It can cause cervical stiffness, serious restrictions of neck movement, and even a bone-derived torticollis. Observation: During routine osteology classes, we encountered an Axis vertebra with an elongated odontoid process. The measurements of the elongated odontoid process were taken using digital Vernier <b>slide</b> <b>calipers.</b> Conclusion: Elongated odontoid process can be mistaken for fracture of dens in radiological images; hence the knowledge of elongated odontoid process is useful for the radiologists, neurosurgeons and orthopaedicians for accurate diagnosis and treatment involving cranio-vertebral junctions. ...|$|E

The present study investigates the evidence for this advice by comparing the real travelled cf path lengths (RTPLs) at both body sides and comparing the straight distance (as can be obtained with a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper)</b> with the tape measure distance. Methods: RTPLs were measured with MRI in 98 individuals (49 men, age 21 - 76 years). Path lengths from the aortic arch to the carotid (AA-CA) and femoral (AA-FA) sites were determined. RTPL was calculated as (AA-FA) - (AA-CA) and compared between both sides. RTPLs were compared with 80 % of the direct cf distance using a tape measure and the straight cf distance obtained from MRI images. Results: RTPL was slightly longer [11 mm (12), P < 0. 001] at the right side. The 80 %-rule overestimated RTPLs with 0. 5 % at the right and 2. 7 % at the left side. Straight MRI distance tended (P = 0. 09) to perform slightly better than tape measure distance. Conclusion: The travelled cf path is slightly longer at the right than at the left body side and the straight MRI distance tends to perform better than tape measure distance.

In addition, all length-length relationships were highly significant (P < 0. 001) {{and most of the}} r 2 values were greater than 0. 950. The fin formula was- dorsal, D. 10 – 11 (2 – 3 / 8); pectoral, Pc. 8 – 10 (4 – 6 / 4); pelvic, Pv. 8 (2 – 3 / 5 – 6); anal, An. 6 – 7 (2 / 4 – 5); and caudal, Ca. 20 – 22 (6 – 8 / 14 – 16). Conclusions: The findings of the present study will keep a crucial contribution to fisheries scientist in favor of identification of this fish, stock assessment and sustainable conservation in the Ganges River of Bangladesh and adjoining countries. Also, these results will impart valuable information for the FishBase, as well as provide an important baseline for further studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{threatened}} Reba carp, Cirrhinus reba is a {{freshwater fish}} species found in ponds, rivers, canals and tanks of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. The present study describes the first complete and inclusive description of life-history traits including sex ratio, length-frequency distributions (LFD), length-weight relationships (LWR), condition factors (Allometric, KA; Fulton’s, KF; Relative condition, KR; Relative weight, WR), form factor (a 3. 0) and size at first sexual maturity of C. reba in the Ganges River, NW Bangladesh. Sampling was done using traditional fishing gears including cast net, square lift net and conical trap from April 2011 to March 2012. The total length (TL), fork length (FL) and standard length (SL) were measured {{to the nearest}} 0. 01 cm using digital <b>slide</b> <b>calipers</b> and total body weight (BW) was measured using an electronic balance with 0. 01 g accuracy. The LWR was calculated using the expression: W= a Lb, where W is the BW, L the TL. The size at first sexual maturity of C. reba was estimated using the empirical equation by Binohlan and Froese (2009) for male and female, separately. A total of 250 specimens ranging from 8. 00 cm – 23. 40 cm TL and 4. 30 g – 200 g BW were analyzed in this study. The overall sex ratio {{did not differ significantly}} from the expected value of 1 : 1 (χ 2 = 3. 38, p 3. 00) in male and female and there was significant differences in the intercepts (ancova, p< 0. 001) and in the slopes (ancova, p< 0. 001) between the sexes. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test showed significant differences in the Fulton’s condition factor between male and female (p< 0. 001). The one sample t-test showed that the mean WR (actual mean = 99. 50) did not differ from 100 for male (p= 0. 523) and female (p= 0. 197) in this study, indicating the habitat was still in good condition for C. reba. Moreover, the size at sexual maturity of male and female C. reba were estimated as 11. 50 cm TL and 13. 50 cm TL, respectively. The results of this study would be useful for the sustainable conservation of this threatened carp fishery in Bangladesh and also neighboring countries...|$|E
30|$|The {{proximal}} femur {{from nine}} young (5  months) porcine hips were dissected and cleaned of soft tissue, muscle and capsular attachments. The porcine subjects were male domestic pigs, {{obtained from the}} local abattoir, with a median weight of 90  kg (range 85 – 95). The diameter of the femoral heads was measured in the coronal and sagittal planes with a measurement error of less than 1  mm using a <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> [[22]].|$|R
50|$|The Lambretta TV125 Series 3 was {{the first}} modern two-wheeled {{production}} machine to be fitted with a disc brake. MV Augusta followed with their limited production 600 cc touring motorcycle announced in 1965 which {{had a pair of}} cable-actuated Campagnolo front disc brakes. In 1969 Honda released the world's first mass produced bike to have a disc brake. The CB750 had a hydraulically operated single piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> with a solid front disc.|$|R
40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and <b>slide</b> <b>caliper.</b> Bark gauge gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring. Both two methods gave the closest results to real values while our tests and it is very simple to use this instrument...|$|R
