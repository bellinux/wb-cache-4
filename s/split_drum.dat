5000|$|While Time in Malta {{formed in}} San Francisco, its members were all {{formerly}} from Indianapolis, Indiana. After recording a demo at Toast Studios, the band signed to Escape Artist Records and released its debut EP in July 1999. This lineup included lead vocalist/bassist Todd Gullion, drummer Sander Leech, and guitarist Chris Lyon. In 2001, Ryan Downey {{joined the group}} as lead vocalist, and former lead vocalist/bassist Todd Gullion continued on bass and backing vocals. The band played one show with this line up; soon after Ryan left the band on good terms. 2002 saw the release of A Second Engine, their first full-length album, and their first release on Equal Vision Records. The band attracted attention for its openly political lyrical stances. Sander Leech having prior obligations could not go out to support the record so Eric Alexander joined playing drums. Todd Gullion asked good friend Jesse Hayes {{to step in and}} play bass so he could focus on vocals. This lineup toured heavily {{for a year and a}} half. Eric Alexander parted ways with the band and moved to Los Angeles to focus on session drumming. The winter of 2003 Sander Leech came back and <b>split</b> <b>drum</b> duties with Adam Goldstein to help write a new record. Adam joined Time In Malta in 2003. 2004 saw the release of Alone with the Alone, Time In Malta’s final studio album, which was also released on Equal Vision. The band disbanded winter of 2004.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2011, The Grownup Noise {{released}} {{their second}} LP This Time With Feeling, mixed by Scott Solter, who also performed on a track. On this release, recent addition Aine Fujioka <b>split</b> <b>drum</b> duties with Kyle Crane. A review from the Boston Globe said that The Grownup Noise was “one of Boston’s most promising outfits... {{a sense of}} sincerity, wonder, and poetry beats {{at the heart of}} skewed folk-pop songs”. In April of that year, their song [...] "Carnival" [...] was the most downloaded song for Paste Magazine’s Songs for Haiti. [...] "Carnival" [...] also won a songwriting contest judged by [...] NY Times best selling author and co-host of the podcast Dear Sugar, Steve Almond. In 2012, the band had their first official SXSW showcase opening for Tommy Stinson of The Replacements through Green Room Music Source, led by Craig Grossman. They also performed with Lucius at the Berklee College of Music SXSW Showcase that year, and opened for Young@Heart in Northampton, MA. During this time the band transitioned from Katie Franich to Rachel Barringer on cello. In April 2012, they were featured as the ceremonial, non-competing guest band at the Boston Rock n Roll Rumble. And in December the band covered Slow Runner’s ‘Break Your Mama’s Back’ for the special re-issue of SR’s album No Disassemble. In 2013, the band toured the Midwest with Golden Bloom, and Timmy Williams of The Whitest Kids U Know. They also performed at the American Repertory Theater ‘Kick-ass Art Party’ on May 28 at Oberon with 100% of proceeds going to the One Fund to benefit victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. In spring 2013, their song [...] "the same the same" [...] was featured on the MTV documentary show World of Jenks and the band toured the west coast including stops at L.A.’s Silver Lake Lounge.|$|E
40|$|Proposed motor {{based on}} {{magnetostrictive}} effect provides stepped angular motion with angular increments of order of 100 microradians. Driven to repeat stepping cycle rapidly enough to achieve maximum speed of about 20 rpm, provides torque {{an order of}} magnitude greater than electric motors, and brakes itself when power turned off. Magnetostrictive rods in electromagnet coils push against drive plate, causing it to rotate slightly. This slight rotation jams conical rollers between cam surfaces on outer drive ring and <b>split</b> <b>drum,</b> so rollers transmit rotation to drum. Suitable for precise, high-torque, fail-safe-braking, direct drive of robot joint, without bulk and weight of additional brake mechanism and gear train...|$|E

40|$|Digital {{material}} and resources {{associated with this}} volume are hosted by the World Oral Literature Project [URL] and Open Book Publishers [URL] This volume is complemented by original recordings of stories and songs from the Limba country (Sierra Leone) which are freely accessible at: [URL] Ruth Finnegan’s Limba collection was recorded during her fieldwork in Limba country in northern Sierra Leone, mainly in the remote villages of Kakarima and Kamabai. Recorded mostly in 1961, but with some audio clips from 1963 and 1964, the collection consists of stories and occasional songs on the topics {{of the beginning of}} the world, animals and human adventures, with some work songs and songs to accompany rituals also included. Performances were regularly enlivened by the dramatic arts of the narrator and by active audience participation. Songs in this collection are accompanied by the <b>split</b> <b>drum</b> (gong) known as Limba nkali ki, although story songs are unaccompanied. The predominant language of the recordings is Limba (a west Atlantic language group), with occasional words in Krio (Creole), which was rapidly becoming the local lingua franca {{at the time of the}} recordings. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to movements involving {{a large part}} of the visual field, the eyes of vertebrates typically show an optokinetic nystagmus, a response in which both eyes are tightly yoked. Using a comparative approach, this study sets out to establish whether fish with independent spontaneous eye movements show independent optokinetic nystagmus in each eye. Two fish with independent spontaneous eye movements, the pipefish Corythoichthyes intestinalis and the sandlance Limnichthyes fasciatus were compared with the butterflyfish Chaetodon rainfordi, which exhibits tightly yoked eye movements. In the butterflyfish a single whole-field stimulus elicits conjugate optokinesis, whereas the sandlance and pipefish show asynchronous optokinetic movements. In a <b>split</b> <b>drum</b> experiment, when both eyes were stimulated in opposite directions with different speeds, both the sandlance and the pipefish compensated independently with each eye. The optokinetic response in the butterflyfish showed some disconjugacy but was generally confused. When one eye was occluded, the seeing eye was capable of driving the occluded eye in both the butterflyfish and the pipefish but not in the sandlance. Monocular occlusion therefore unmasks a link between the two eyes in the pipefish, which is overridden when both eyes receive visual input. The sandlance never showed any correlation between the eyes during optokinesis in all stimulus conditions. This suggests that there are different levels of linkage between the two eyes in the oculomotor system of teleosts, depending on the visual input...|$|E

50|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Nick Launay at Studio Ferber in Paris in March-April 2004 and Nick Cave used The Bad Seeds line up of Mick Harvey, Thomas Wydler, Martyn Casey, Conway Savage, Jim Sclavunos, Warren Ellis, and James Johnston. It was the first album by the group for which Blixa Bargeld did not perform - English guitarist and organist Johnston, of the group Gallon Drunk, replaced Bargeld. Cave decided to <b>split</b> <b>drumming</b> duties for the two parts, with Sclavunos on Abattoir Blues and Wydler on The Lyre of Orpheus.

It was this line-up of Manitoba, Shernoff, Friedman, Kempner, and Teeter which recorded Bloodbrothers (yet again produced by Pearlman and Krugman with songs written by Shernoff). It was the first album to feature Manitoba as the group's vocalist on all the songs, though Bruce Springsteen - {{a big fan of}} the group to this day - can be heard counting [...] "1-2-1-2-3-4" [...] during the album's opening track, [...] "Faster and Louder." [...] The album's [...] "Baby, Let's Twist" [...] was a minor hit on a number of east-coast radio stations, but the lack of mainstream success caused the band to split the following year.

60|$|A thin {{rain was}} falling and the damp air held the smoke low, {{so that we}} could only catch glimpses of what was doing just in front of us, though the roar of the guns told us that the battle was general all along the lines. Four hundred of them were all {{crashing}} at once now, and the noise was enough to <b>split</b> the <b>drum</b> of your ear. Indeed, there was not one of us but had a singing in his head for many a long day afterwards. Just opposite us on the slope of the hill was a French gun, and we could see the men serving her quite plainly. They were small active men, with very tight breeches and high hats with great straight plumes sticking up from them; but they worked like sheep-shearers, ramming and sponging and training. There were fourteen when I saw them first, and only four left standing at the last, but they were working away just as hard as ever.|$|R
