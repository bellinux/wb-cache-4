25|$|Chinese {{vocal music}} has {{traditionally}} been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in falsetto and is usually solo rather than choral. All traditional Chinese music is melodic rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from <b>sung</b> <b>poems</b> and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an erhu or dizi are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the pipa and zheng music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The qin {{is perhaps the most}} revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or seen and heard one being played. The zheng, a form of zither, is most popular in Henan, Chaozhou, Hakka and Shandong. The pipa, a kind of lute, believed to have been introduced from the Arabian Peninsula area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in Shanghai and surrounding areas.|$|E

50|$|Stating {{the communion}} of ludic {{spaces between the}} bohemian {{aristocracy}} and the most disfavoured fringes of Lisbon's population, the history of fado crystallized into myth the episode of the amorous relationship between the Count Vimioso and Maria Severa Onofriana (1820-1846), a Romani gypsy (Cigana) prostitute consecrated by her singing talents, who would soon transform into one of greatest myths {{of the history of}} fado. In successive image and sound reprises, the allusion to the involvement between a bohemian aristocrat with the fado singing prostitute would cross several <b>sung</b> <b>poems</b> and even the cinema and the theatre or the visual arts - beginning with the novel A Severa, by Júlio Dantas, published in 1901 and transported to the silver screen in 1931 - the first Portuguese sound film, directed by Leitão de Barros.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins and}} {{development}} of Egyptian music {{is closely related to}} Egyptian religious song. There are four types of songs discussed in the religious concept, which are inchad, zikr, hadra, and mulid. The first occasion examined is the zikr - a practice that takes place during the Sufi hadra. This ritual focuses on rhythm and the united chanting of the names of God. This ceremony also includes the inchad (praise of God, the Prophet, and the Saints). The mulid (a [...] "folk celebration") celebrates the Muslim or Christian saint. The leader of this celebration is the munchid, who performs <b>sung</b> <b>poems</b> accompanied by a takht. [...] "Diverse communities" [...] are also explored in this text, suggesting that Egyptian minority groups' songs and folklore are presented and reinterpreted somewhat romantically in various contexts. These groups include [...] "the peasants from the banks of the Nile, nomads from the desert and mountains, Bachareyas, and Arab gypsies, Al Arbaane (50). She then introduces the mawal - an improvisatory sung form accompanied by a single instrument. She suggests that this is the origin of the Egyptian folk song genre (chaaby). She writes that until the twentieth century, scholars and musicians had to attend the kottab (religious school) and Al-Azhar (a university in Cairo). Reading religious texts and learning the art of recitation are argued to be fundamental to musical and poetic composition. The author then discusses how Egyptian music is based on the al-maqam scale, composed of whole tones, half tones, and micro tones. Egyptian musicologist, Dr. Mahmoud Ahmad el-Hefny, revolutionized the musical education system in Egypt through his extensive research. During the nineteenth century, Chehab Eldine and El-Masloub largely impacted the Egyptian musical soundscape of the time. However, the author suggests that Sheikh Mohamed Rif'at is one of the fathers of the contemporary music of Egypt. The poet, Sayid Darwiche, and singer Abdou Al-Hamouli were also largely influential in the development of Egyptian art music. Sayed Darwiche transformed musical forms, composing muwashah, oprettas, dour, national songs, taqtouqas, monologues, and qassida poems. Most notable is his nationalist song: Bilady. Sheikh Zakareya Ahmed was an influential composer from the 1920s-1960s. Most famously, he wrote for the legendary voice of Egypt, Oum Kalsoum. Oum Kalsoum greatly shaped contemporary Egyptian music, mastering the art of structured song and driving many popular musical developments. Briefly, the author then introduces multiple individuals and organizations that have worked to maintain and preserve Egyptian musical heritage. In conclusion, she introduces a discussion of Western musical influences and their impact on Egyptian music education.|$|E
