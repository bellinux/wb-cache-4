5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two {{teenagers}} {{from the city}} of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by stage fright and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they go to <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.|$|E
5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E
6000|$|To {{tell the}} truth, Hal did not <b>sleep</b> much <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> His mind {{seemed to be}} in a whirl. What was the plot Hardwick and Dick Ferris had hatched out against him? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{interrupted}} him, without ceremony. The {{places he}} had slept in, at sea, were of no earthly importance. The one question to consider, was the place he was to <b>sleep</b> in <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hemraj had {{apparently}} served himself {{dinner in a}} plate around 10:30 pm, but never ate it. His bed was still tidy in the morning, indicating that he didn't go to <b>sleep</b> on <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
25|$|Besides {{dealing with}} unexploded {{ordnance}} {{dropped from the}} air, since the Second World War 5131 have been deployed {{to most of the}} major theatres that the UK armed forces have been involved in (Falkland Islands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan). During the beach landings on the 27 May 1982 at San Carlos in the Falklands Conflict, one of the officers of 5131 (BD) Squadron, needed to assess some unexploded ordnance that was lodged in the walls of the field hospital, but had to wait until daylight to do so. To alleviate the worry for the patients who could not be moved to safer medical care, he opted to <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> alongside the unexploded ordnance. In the Afghanistan conflict, members of 5131 (BD) Squadron were part of the Joint Force Counter-IED Task Force alongside the British Army bomb disposal experts although 5131 themselves are keen to point out that it is not their primary task. Counter IED operations remain the mainstay of the Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal technicians.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham. Field {{was held in}} police custody for more than the {{lawfully}} prescribed 24 hours in order to assist the investigation. He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said he had seen a boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that he had picked him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat. He said when he finished he panicked and then strangled the boy with his own school tie, he kept the body in his car's boot for several days before dumping him in woodland.|$|E
25|$|In {{her junior}} year, Krieger made 20 {{appearances}} for Penn State, ten of those appearances being in conference matches. She made seven {{goals in the}} season, which tied for second in the season at Penn State. Three of those goals were game winning goals. Penn State was the 2004 Big Ten Conference regular season champion and was No.1 seed in the Big Ten Women's Soccer Tournament. They {{made it to the}} quarterfinals of the tournament, when they were defeated by Michigan on November 3. Penn State earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed ever. However, two days before the tournament, Krieger broke her leg while playing against a men's soccer team in preparation for the tournament. The injury required surgery, where they inserted a plate and five screws in her leg. A few months later in January, after traveling to visit her family, Krieger began experiencing shortness of breath and checked into the hospital as a precaution. As a result of her broken leg and subsequent plane rides, she had developed blood clots in her legs that traveled up to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism, affecting her blood flow and triggering multiple mini-heart attacks. The doctor informed her that if she had gone to <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> there as a high probability that she would not have woken up. She was required to do a series of self-injections of enoxaparin for several months, but eventually made a full recovery and joined the Nittany Lions for her senior season. At the end of her shortened 2004 season, Krieger was given NSCAA All-America First Team honors, NSCAA All-Mid-Atlantic Region First Team honors, All-Big Ten First Team honors, and Academic All-Big Ten honors.|$|E
60|$|She turned away, thus {{ending the}} conversation, but her manner {{had been so}} {{significant}} that Agatha, who did not <b>sleep</b> well <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> decided, if it was possible, {{to act on the}} well-meant advice.|$|R
50|$|The three Bone cousins {{are lost}} in the desert, where they find a {{hand-drawn}} map and are attacked by a swarm of locusts. Fone Bone escapes, but falls off a cliff; climbs the other side; and finds a trail of Smiley's cigars. When he <b>sleeps</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> two rat creatures attempt to eat him, and he is rescued by the Great Red Dragon. Soon after, he meets Ted (a treehopper-like insect), who suggests that Fone seek counsel from Thorn, before winter arrives; but Fone is soon isolated by the snow.|$|R
60|$|The {{reader can}} well imagine that Jerry did not <b>sleep</b> much <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> He could {{not forget that}} Alexander Slocum had the {{precious}} packet of papers. Bitterly he regretted not having taken better care of the documents.|$|R
500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] is {{categorised}} {{by three}} distinct moods written in what Yorke {{referred to as}} three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in {{with a number of}} themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as [...] "inhuman", and said [...] "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere.... Couldn't <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> because of it." [...] The woman inspired the line [...] "kicking squealing Gucci little piggy" [...] in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line [...] "With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all", said that [...] "Again, that's just a joke. It's actually the other way around– it's actually my opinion that is of no consequence at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Woolfolk {{was named}} the Most Valuable Player in both of Michigan's two bowl game {{appearances}} in 1981. [...] During the January 1981 Rose Bowl, he gained 182 yards against Washington, and during the December 1981 Bluebonnet Bowl, in which he gained 186 yards against UCLA. The hotel where the Wolverines team was staying was evacuated {{the night before the}} 1981 Rose Bowl game when a fire alarm was triggered at 2:30a.m., and Woolfolk only had three hours of <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> [...] He won the MVP award despite the lack of sleep, and after the game Woolfolk called the game his [...] "greatest thrill in football." [...] Commenting on the MVP trophy, Woolfolk said: [...] "If I could, I'd break this trophy into 95 pieces and hand it out to all the guys on the squad." [...] After winning his second MVP trophy in 1981's Bluebonnet Bowl, Woolfolk said: [...] "I might look back in later years and notice that, but right now all I can think about is that I've worn a Michigan uniform for the last time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rosen {{suggested}} they hire [...] "perhaps {{the best known}} (and most feared) litigation lawyer in Hollywood", Patty Glaser, to help grasp the situation. Following discussions on Leno's contract during a post-show conference, Glaser {{turned her attention to}} O'Brien for his opinion. He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant. O'Brien went without <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> crafting his statement obsessively. He returned to the studio the following morning, listening as the lawyers and Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication). According to The War for Late Night, Glaser found [...] "the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan’s point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations." ...|$|E
6000|$|He found <b>sleep</b> {{difficult}} <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Many {{times he}} composed himself {{and closed his}} eyes for slumber to overtake him; but his blood pounded with too strong desire, and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured wearily, [...] "Wisht it was sun-up." ...|$|R
50|$|While babysitting the Fry {{children}} together, Mitchell tells Weck {{his only}} {{interest in her}} is to liberate her from Linden. Myrtle comes home early, highly upset because she has all but proven that Rex is {{having an affair with}} his stenographer. Rex <b>sleeps</b> downstairs <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rachel obeyed, and Noie sat by her, {{holding her}} hand, till {{presently}} {{her eyes shut}} and she slept. But Noie did not <b>sleep.</b> All <b>that</b> <b>night</b> she sat there watching and listening, till at length the dawn came and she lay down also by the door and rested.|$|R

60|$|There was {{one among}} them, however, {{who did not}} <b>sleep</b> long <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Fred Martin was soon awakened by the pain of his wound, which had begun to inflame, and by a feeling of giddiness and intense uneasiness with {{which he had been}} troubled for several days past.|$|R
5000|$|... "There was {{an uproar}} and we opened our {{eyes from the}} eternal <b>sleep.</b> Saw <b>that</b> the <b>night</b> of wickedness endured, so we slept again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grettir {{answered}} {{that there were}} horses enough to be got, whatever might happen to this one.

60|$|The whimsy, for {{it could}} be nothing more, curtailed me of my <b>sleep</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and you may picture me trying {{both sides of the}} pillow.|$|E

60|$|Not much <b>sleep</b> visited me <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> In the morning, {{the young}} ladies not {{stirring}} and no prospects of duty for me, I rode down to town.|$|R
60|$|For I was {{so little}} {{inclined}} to <b>sleep</b> myself <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>that</b> I sat up working. It {{would not be}} worth mentioning for its own sake, but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited. I don't know why. At least I don't think I know why. At least, perhaps I do, but I don't think it matters.|$|R
2500|$|Orwell {{tells us}} of his various {{movements}} between hospitals in Siétamo, Barbastro, and Monzón while getting his discharge papers stamped, after being declared medically unfit. He returns to Barcelona {{only to find}} that the POUM had been [...] "suppressed": it had been declared illegal the very day he had left to obtain discharge papers and POUM members were being arrested without charge. [...] "The attack on Huesca was beginning ... there must have been numbers of men who were killed without ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This kind of thing is a little difficult to forgive." [...] He <b>sleeps</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in the ruins of a church; he cannot go back to his hotel because of the danger of arrest.|$|R

60|$|Ann Veronica had an {{impression}} {{that she did not}} <b>sleep</b> at all <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and at any rate she got through an immense amount of feverish feeling and thinking.|$|R
60|$|I did not <b>sleep</b> much <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> but 'twas of Dolly I thought {{rather than}} of Chartersea.
