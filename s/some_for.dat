5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation.

To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these.

At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell <b>some</b> <b>for</b> development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for <b>some.</b> <b>For</b> optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing <b>some</b> <b>for</b> his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E

His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, {{mentions}} Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but {{to the end of his}} life, he was proud of his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before Uranus was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting <b>some</b> <b>for</b> propaganda purposes.|$|E

This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum.

The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but <b>some</b> (<b>for</b> example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
