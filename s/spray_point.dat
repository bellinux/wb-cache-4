40|$|A {{literature}} and experimental study {{was done to}} create {{an overview of the}} behavior of gasoline combusted in a CI-engine. This paper creates a first overview of the work to be done before implementing this Gasoline Compression Ignition concept in a multi-cylinder engine. According to literature the gasoline blend will have advantages over diesel. First the shorter molecular chain of the gasoline makes it less prone to soot. Second the lower density gives the gasoline a higher nozzle exit speed resulting in better mixing capabilities. Third the lower density and higher volatility lets the spray length decrease. This lowers the chance of wall-impingement, but creates worse mixing conditions looking from a <b>spray</b> <b>point</b> of view. The CO and HC emissions tend to increase relative to operation with diesel fuel, NO x emissions largely depend on the choice of combustion strategy and could be influenced by the nitrogen bound to the EHN molecule that is used as an ignition improver. Tests on a standard 2. 4 l 5 -cylinder Euro 4 compression ignition engine showed it was fully capable of running on the chosen gasoline blend 95 RON + 5 vol% 2 -EHN in every selected load-point. Load-points varied from idle to 10. 5 bar BMEP at 1850 RPM. The standard injection strategy was not adjusted for the characteristics of gasoline. Emission measurements showed a decrease in soot and efficiency, and increases in NO x and CO 2. At low load points the HC and CO emissions increased, at higher load points the difference was smaller or negligible...|$|E
40|$|Millions {{are spent}} {{managing}} invasive weeds {{on public lands}} each year. Wildland invasive weed treatment bids are based primarily on acreage or hours but can be influenced by variables that increase treatment time and cost. Often neither the agency contracting the treatment nor the contractor has {{a clear idea of}} {{the amount of time that}} will be involved based on these variables. This makes it difficult to develop an accurate budget or bid for invasive weed control projects. It also limits managers in seeking funding and justifying treatment costs. A model has been developed that can predict herbicide application time due to four variables, weed canopy cover, slope, land cover, and weed visibility. Other variables were explored. The “smart” spray wand (SSW) is a new precision tool used to develop this model. The SSW is a spray wand with an integrated GPS and a flow meter for use with any type of spray system. The wand records the GPS location, herbicide flow,application time, and associated data of each treatment <b>spray</b> <b>point.</b> This information provided necessary data for the treatment time model. Weed control total treatment time (TTot) was hypothesized to include both treatment time (Tt) and rest time (Rt). The development and benefits of a wildland weed treatment time model are discussed. An accurate treatment time model could 1) establish an accurate standard for contractors and land managers, 2) assist in planning and managing limited treatment resources, and 3) justify funding requests and expenditures. The primary influence of the model is due to weed canopy cover (p= 3 ̆c 2. 2 e- 16, R 2 = 0. 5607), with smaller impacts by other variables. If canopy cover, slope, land cover, and weed visibility can be obtained for a weed control project, the model can be used...|$|E
40|$|Although {{electrostatic}} spray {{technology has}} enjoyed phenomenal success in automotive painting and agricultural spray applications, many spray applications remain untouched by this technology due to technical and/or time constraint. One such high potential spray application {{is in the}} medical coating industry with strict requirements of high precision, high consistency, and considerable drug cost. Focusing further on medical stent coating, existing ultrasonic spray nozzles are wasteful and time-consuming in addition to added complexity of reclaiming the drug overspray. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that pressurized air and/or ultrasonic vibration which introduces much turbulence to spray droplets in flight. To further improve transfer efficiency and consistency of existing spray nozzles, SSCo has developed a new airless Electrostatic spray nozzle which relies solely on electrostatic charges accumulated in a unique spray tube design to gently applied coating material in a consistent and efficient manner. An added benefit is to have steady spray at flow rates ranging from 3 cc/hr- 10 cc/hr. An analysis of various spray tube tips is performed, each having different geometry making full use of Gauss' Law to concentrate electrostatic charge and maximizing electric field strength at terminal <b>spray</b> <b>point.</b> A particular point of interest will be how the droplet shape, distribution, and size are affected by the different designs. Lab testing indicated that the larger sharp edge areas where electric charge accumulates, the smaller the droplet size while droplet shape sphericity stays relatively constant. This is concluded from results showing that a spray tip with a circumferential corner area produces smaller droplets than that with 4 points. Furthermore, a spray tip with 4 points produces smaller droplets than that with 1 point. The results lead us to believe that some spray tip designs sufficiently charge the droplets reaching Rayleigh limit more efficiently...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of agricultural yield is a challenging and essential task for every farmer. In most countries worldwide, above 70 % {{of the population}} practice and depend upon agriculture for their lives and livehoods. In attempts to increase agricultural productivity, farmers often apply pesticides excessively. This practice has led to problems with spray drift, along with many others, a process by which liquid sprays are transported and cause harm to adjacent crops and other non-target areas. Although investigation has also been directed toward pesticide drift caused by agents such as wind, boom height, and driving speed, this effort has thus been insufficient. Therefore, our research focuses on modelling to account for these factors to create buffer zones around crops to spray drift during pesticide application. We employed a GIS model to capture <b>spray</b> area <b>points.</b> <b>Spray</b> drift distances calculated with values representing the aforementioned agents are appended to these geographic points of the farm to establish a buffer zone area...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{fabrication}} and analytical evaluation {{of two new}} electrospray emitters utilized for mass spectrometry analysis is presented. The emitters {{are based on a}} new concept, where the spray orifice can be varied in size. The thesis is based on two papers. All present-day nanoelectrospray emitters have fixed dimensions. The range of the applicable flow rate for such an emitter is therefore rather limited and exchange of emitters may be necessary from one experiment to another. Optimization of the signal of the analyte ions is also limited to adjustments of the applied voltage or the distance between the emitter and the mass spectrometer inlet. Furthermore, clogging can occur in emitters with fixed dimensions of narrow orifice sizes. In this thesis, electrospray emitters with a variable size of the spray orifice are proposed. An open gap between two thin substrates is filled with sample solution via a liquid bridge from a capillary. Electrospray is generated at the end point of the gap, which can be varied in width. In Paper I, electrospray emitters fabricated in polyethylene terephthalate have been evaluated. Triangular tips are manually cut from the polymer film. The tips are mounted to form a gap between the edges of the tips. The gap wall surfaces are subjected to a hydrophilic surface treatment to increase the wetting of the gap walls. In Paper II, silicon electrospray chips with high precision are fabricated and evaluated. A thin beam, elevated from the bulk silicon chip is fabricated by means of deep reactive ion etching. The top surfaces of the beams of two chips act as a sample conduit when mounted in the electrospray setup. An anisotropic etching step with KOH of the intersecting crystal planes results in a very sharp <b>spray</b> <b>point.</b> The emitters were given a hydrophobic surface treatment except for the hydrophilic gap walls. For both emitter designs, the gap width has been adjusted during the experiments without any interruption of the electrospray. For a continuously applied peptide mixture, a shift towards higher charge states and increased signal to noise ratios could be observed when decreasing the gap width. The limit of detection has been investigated and the silicon chips have been interfaced with capillary electrophoresis. QC 2010110...|$|E
40|$|Ridge {{conservation}} tillage systems are receiving increased attention {{as an alternative}} to flat no-till systems for row crop production. A recently-developed fertilizer applicator, the spoke-wheel injector has potential to improve fertilizer-use efficiency in ridge-till systems, but little work has been done to identify efficient N placements for ridges. A field study to investigate corn (Zea mays L.) response to ridge-till N placement methods and to examine the inorganic N distribution resulting from point-injected N fertilizer was conducted within a corn-soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) rotation at two central Iowa locations on poorly-drained till-derived soils. Urea-ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) treatments consisted of combinations of three placements (surface broadcast <b>spray,</b> <b>point</b> injection between rows, or point injection in rows) and five rates from 0 to 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1. To determine fertilizer-N recovery, [superscript] 15 N-depleted NH[subscript] 4 NO[subscript] 3 (99. 99 % [superscript] 14 N) was substituted for UAN on one-row microplots from within the main plots of the 67 - and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments. Nitrogen recovery was estimated from plant samples taken at four growth stages from [superscript] 15 N-depleted microplots. Nitrate- and NH[subscript] 4 -N were determined on soil samples taken late in the growing season at five positions perpendicular to the plant row and at several depth intervals from 0 -, 67 -, and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 injection treatments;Generally, 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments resulted in soil NO[subscript] 3 -N and NH[subscript] 4 -N levels greater than other rates. The greatest N accumulations were measured around the injection point and in the ridge surface soil. Injected N resulted in significantly greater corn yields, percentage N derived from fertilizer, and percentage of fertilizer N recovered than broadcast, but differences between injection positions were generally not significant;A portion of the study area was used to compare the sufficiency of one- and three-row microplots for studying N uptake from in-row N applications. Nitrogen recoveries did not differ significantly between the two microplot types. One-row microplots seem to have potential to decrease the amount of labeled-N required under some experimental conditions...|$|E

In the present study, phase Doppler interferometry (PDI) was used in a backscatter mode to characterize, in situ, the droplet size and velocity distributions during linear spray atomization and deposition of a 3003 aluminum alloy. The PDI measurements were obtained along axes corresponding to the direction parallel to the nozzle slit and to the direction perpendicular to the slit. The PDI results delineate the temporal and spatial distribution of the droplet size and velocity during the metal <b>spray.</b> Both <b>point</b> and "line" measurements were obtained and are reported. The line measurements resulted from the integration of measurement made along a line scan obtained in real time (i. e., not ensemble averaged). Postrun analysis of the droplet size distribution using laser diffraction and sieving techniques is also reported. The PDI point measurements revealed that droplet size and velocity distribution were relatively invariant with time. The line measurements of droplet velocity showed that the droplet axial velocity exhibits a bimodal behavior, which becomes more apparent with incr easing atomizing gas pressure, a result of droplet recirculation inside the spray chamber. In addition, the peak in the droplet axial velocity distribution increased as atomizing gas pressure increased. The line characterization also showed that the droplet size distribution became more homogeneous with increasing gas pressure, and that the distribution characteristic diameters of droplets decreased consistently with increasing gas pressure.

Yet, another sample from a high ice concentration area shows larger and more elongated grain structure.

Study Design/Materials and Methods: A theoretical model of skin cool-ing is presented for two different regimens: “soft ” cooling in which freezing of the skin is not permitted and “hard ” cooling in which the skin can be frozen to a given depth. Spray and contact cooling were also compared experimentally using an in vitro model. Results: For a fixed skin surface temperature, spray and contact cool-ing theoretically produce the same cooling profile in the skin. Anatomic depth of cooling depends on the time for which either the spray or contact is applied. In vitro experiments caused temperature at the simulated basal layer to be between − 5 and + 5 °C for both <b>spray</b> (tetra-fluoroethane, boiling <b>point</b> − 26 °C) and contact (− 27 °C sapphire plate) cooling. The theoretical precooling analysis shows hard mode to be faster and more selective than soft mode; however, cooling time for hard mode must be carefully controlled to prevent irreversible epider-mal damage caused by freezing. Conclusions: Both spray and contact cooling provide efficient skin cool-ing. The choice of cooling method depends on other factors such as the target depth, cost, safety, and ergonomic factors.

40|$|Spray/wall {{interactions}} significantly influence air/fuel {{mixing and}} emissions in modern spark-ignited, direct injection engines. Yet, the complex phenomena are hardly understood - especially not {{with respect to}} the large number of parameters and the associated wide ranges occuring in an engine. Modelling spray/wall interactions thus presents a major drawback in numerical simulations done in engine development. This thesis focuses on the impact of dense, high-pressure hollow cone sprays for which existing wall interaction models are evaluated in detail and shown to fail. To the best of the author's knowledge no model adapted to the considered spray type was available which was furthermore accompanied by a severe lack of quantitative experimental data. Therefore, Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) is used to gather data on the normal impact of an isooctane spray with 50 bar injection pressure on a hemispherical copper target. The latter can be heated and wall temperatures up to 200 °C are studied. Moreover, an additional oil film can be applied on the surface to simulate the oil film on a cylinder liner lubricating the piston motion. Variations in the particle Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 on impact are achieved in changing the distance between injector and target. As the question how PDA data concerning spray/wall interaction have to be evaluated has not been studied thoroughly yet, a fundamental analysis was carried out and is presented in this thesis. The results are not limited to dense and high-pressure, hollow cone sprays but may serve as general guidelines for future data evaluation. Based on the measurements, the impact mechanisms of dense, high-pressure sprays are discussed where film fluctuations leading to ligament breakup are found to be decisive. For the considered high Reynolds numbers, inertial forces dominate all other forces which results in negligible parameter influence of the mean Reynolds number and the wall temperature. The oil film is observed to be quickly removed by the impacting <b>spray</b> which <b>points</b> out that spray/wall interactions on a cylinder liner may seriously endanger the operability of an engine. Finally, empirical correlations describing the secondary spray on wall interaction are developed from the gathered data and an extrapolation to oblique impact is proposed. This first empirical model adapted to dense, high-pressure hollow cone sprays is implemented in numerical code in a Lagrangian approach. Details of the implementation are given. The model is validated in several cases for impact angles between 30 ° and 90 ° measured relative to the wall and for injection pressures of 50 bar and 200 bar with very good results...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the European TOPPS project (Train the Operator to prevent Pollution from Point Sources), 200 on farm audits and 300 tele {{interviews}} were performed in the Yser catchment area. The objective was to determine the critical points for point source pollution within the spraying process and to inform advisors, intermediaries and farmers on practical measures and achievable solutions to reduce the contamination of the surface water by Plant Protection Products (PPP) due to point source pollution. For the on farm auditing, the Aquasite tool (Arvalis-France) was used. This audit was performed on 100 farms in the Flemish Yser catchment and on 100 farms at the French side. This audit reveals the weak points in infrastructure and technology on the farm in relation to the spraying process. Next, 150 tele interviews were held in the respective catchment areas. These interviews assess the awareness and behaviour of the farmers on point source pollution. The strength of these studies is in giving a view on the real situation on the farms with respect to <b>spraying.</b> The critical <b>points</b> and risks for point source pollution were similar for both regions. Especially the filling and mixing of the sprayer, internal and external cleaning of the sprayer and the management of the waste fraction need specific training, demonstration and advice. However, there is a large difference in the risk perception of point source pollution between farmers {{on both sides of the}} border. The transgressing approach of the Yser catchment allows to make a comparison between both regions and allows to assess in which way the legislation had part in explaining the differences between the regions as the agriculture in both regions is similar. Also, the results stress the importance of trainings and sensibilisation at a regional scale. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} apple tree {{spraying}} experiments {{was conducted to}} identify factors affecting agrichemical deposits from airblast sprayers and to relate deposit observations to biological responses in selected pest, disease and physiological systems. Factors addressed included tree canopy form, application volume, travel speed and sprayer type. Several tracers were evaluated and deposits quantified by wash-off removal from bulked leaf or fruit samples drawn from 10 - 15 spatially consistent 1. 5 m 3 zones per tree. Deposit data were expressed on a tissue area basis and/or {{as a proportion of}} the spray emitted (retention). Spray deposits were compared across 11 canopy forms to identify interactions with tree size, leaf area and canopy density and volume. A two-fold difference in deposits between canopies occurred when sprays were applied at a constant chemical rate per hectare. This variability was approximately halved when chemical rates per hectare were adjusted {{on the basis of the}} canopy Tree-Row-Volume (TRV). The best TRV measurement system identified used across-row canopy spread measurements at half metre height intervals, rather than just a single measurement of canopy spread. Deposits were better correlated with TRV data than with any of the other canopy descriptors used. Canopy density was identified as an important covariate, but light penetration proved an unsuitable indicator of canopy density as it was strongly correlated with TRV. Deposit variations between zones within trees were consistent between all but the smallest canopy sprayed. Increasing the distance from the sprayer and/or increasing canopy penetration requirements reduced spray deposits. Spray retention across these canopies in full leaf ranged from 25 - 90 %, but tended to increase with decreased application volume. There was a ca. 10 - 15 % increase in deposits when spray volumes were reduced 4 - 5 times below those used in typical dilute spray volumes (ca. 2, 000 1 ha- 1). At high volumes with significant run-off, retention could ca. 50 % of that at lower volumes. Run-off losses could be related to TRV, with significant run-off occurring once application volumes exceeded one litre per 7. 5 - 11 m 3 of TRV. Surprisingly, average deposits on 5 m tail slender pyramid trees increased with increased travel speed over the range 1. 9 - 8. 8 km h- 1. Within-tree spray deposit distributions were not markedly affected by the travel speeds tested with air assistance volumes of ca. 30, 000 or 44, 000 m 3 h- 1. High, but relatively consistent within-tree deposit variability was a feature of deposits from axial fan, airblast sprayers, especially when used in intensive 4 - 6 m tall, single leader tree plantings. Within-tree deposit variability decreased with increased application volumes. Tower sprayers provided a more even vertical distribution of <b>spray</b> emission <b>points</b> and achieved different, but not necessarily more even, within-tree deposit distributions than airblast machines. Experiments on chemical thinning, mealybug (Pseudococcus viburni) and black spot (Venturia inaequalis) control, showed the biological responses could not have been predicted from the spray deposit measurements. However, combined assessment of spray deposits and biological effects greatly facilitated interpretation of both sets of data. ...|$|R
40|$|Fine solid particles, {{especially}} nano-particles, are {{of great}} interest for the synthesis of new materials. There is also a strong demand for newer and more precise contact technologies of electronic components due to the higher getting integration of electronic devices. These new technologies may be based on submicron conducting particles, e. g. for producing solder pastes. In the present thesis a process was developed {{for the production of}} micron and submicron conducting particles by the use of electrostatic atomisation of liquid metals. The atomization process is based on the instability of conducting liquids in a strong inhomogenous electric field. The free liquid surface is transformed into a cone shape, from where a thin liquid jet is emitted. This jet breaks up into a spray of fine unipolary charged droplets immediately after the emission. Under defined circumstances the droplets have a narrow size distribution and can be extracted for other applications without additional classification methods. The rapid solidification leads to defined spherical particles, depending on the used metal, and the unipolar charge to a low agglomeration. The high electrical field, which is necessary for the atomization, causes electrical discharges of the ambient gas and disturbes the atomization process. To reduce these discharges a special pressure chamber was constructed, which is filled with quenching gas as SF 6 with over-pressures of up to 12 bar. The electrostatic atomisation was applicated for liquid metals only in an ultra high vacuum up to now. The production of aerosol particles may have advantages not only due to available cheaper online measurement techniques. By the use of aerosol measurement techniques a direct statement about the particle size, the particle number concentration and the mean charge on the particles is possible. The atomization was investigated for metals as well as for eutectic alloys with a low melting point and a low surface tension. The results show, that spherical particles with a diameter down to a few hundred nanometer could be produced. In addition the production of thin and homogenous granular films was possible. To compare and verify the experimental results a simplified numerical model of the spraying process with respect to the space charge was developed. By calculating the particle trajectories from the emission source to the collector plate an estimation of the spray cloud geometry and the emitted electrical current was possible. An interesting observation was the self induced size segregation of the particles, which occurred in the experiments and in the numerical simulations. This effect can be used for a defined expansion or focussing of the deposition area on the target. Here there may be found some interesting applications for the <b>point</b> <b>spraying...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{revolution has}} driven {{the need for}} faster microprocessors. In order to fabricate faster microprocessors the trend has been {{to increase the amount}} of transistors and increase the clock speed. Microprocessor clock speed reached a point of saturation in 2006 because of the thermal challenges related to the transistors. As microprocessor power densities are increasing beyond air cooling limits, liquid cooling will become necessary. Spray cooling turn out to be the best candidate. Spray cooling have shown the ability to remove large amounts of energy due to latent heat of evaporation in addition to single-phase convection effects at low operational temperatures. A fundamental drawback with spray cooling is the limit of operation temperature due to the Leidenfrost effect, a vapour cushion forming in between the liquid and the solid and hence a spontaneous reduction in heat transfer. It is therefore essential to understand how to control at which temperature the Leidenfrost effect occur. Engineered micro-nano structures have shown the capability to manipulate the Leidenfrost point. The main objective in this work is to identify and fabricate structures for enhancing the Leidenfrost point. The secondary objective is to design and fabricate a test facility for studying impacting droplet over a micro-nano structure surface. In this work optimal structures for enhancing the Leidenfrost point have been identified from the literature. Techniques for fabricating the selected structures have been carried out and the structures have been characterized by available equipment at the NTNU Nanolab. Micro pillars, micro cones, Carbon nanowires and a hierarchical combination of small and big scale structures of the same type have been developed. In addition, a hierarchical combination of Carbon nanowires and micro cones. Furthermore, design and fabrication of a test section for studying impacting droplets over a micro-nano structure surface has been completed. Important results uncovered in this work are the following. Helium flow rate has been identified as an essential tool for post fabrication analysis of the etching process and the height limit of the cone fabrication has been revealed. Anomalous wetting characteristics has been identified for a sample with hierarchical structures consisting of two cones of different scale. This work has shown that lithography and deep reactive ion etching have the ability to fabricate surfaces with controllable structures to enhance the characteristics of the surface. Such structures will help to improve the understanding of how surface structures can enhance the Leidenfrost <b>point.</b> <b>Spray</b> cooling as a possible candidate for liquid cooling of microprocessors and other devices with high heat flux and restrictions on operational temperature is strengthened...|$|R
40|$|Pesticides {{are used}} to control diseases, {{undesired}} vegetation and insects in forestry, gardening and agriculture. In the environment, pesticides are generally believed to originate from a diffuse source, such as spray drift of pesticides during application, or a point source, such as spills during refill and cleaning of <b>spraying</b> equipment. <b>Point</b> sources are easier to eliminate than diffuse sources and one method to reduce the leaching from point sources is to use biobeds as bioprophylaxis. The Swedish biobed was developed by Torstensson and Castillo in 199 X (KB) and is constructed with locally available constituents, such as peat, wheat straw and soil. The main advantages of the biobed {{is that it is}} very simple and cheap, but still very effective. On sites where vegetable oil have been spilled on the biobed, e. g on farms producing rapeseed oil, both increased activity of lignin degrading microorganisms and increased pesticide degradation have been observed. The lignin degrading microorganisms produce unspecific extracellular enzymes, which also are able to degrade recalcitrant molecules such as organic pollutants. The most important ligninolytic enzymes, currently known, are lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase. Pure MnP {{have been found to be}} able to initiate lipid peroxidation. Due to recent findings that vegetable oil, which has high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, is increasing the effect of lignin degrading microorganisms, addition of oil is proposed to further increase the biobed efficiency. Since the crop is determining which pesticide to be used, pesticides are often encountered in mixtures in the environment. For this purpose five selected pesticides will represent the mixture of pesticides. The selected pesticides are bentazone (BZ), metabenzthiazuron (MBTZ), isoproturon (IP), terbutylazine (TBA) and chlorpyrifos (CLP). The main objectives of this study were: I. To investigate whether the addition of rapeseed oil to the biomix (mixture of peat, soil and straw used in a biobed) enhanced the degradation rate of pesticides (BZ, MBTZ, IP, TBA and CLP). II. To investigate whether a potential increase in degradation, of the same pesticide mixture, was explained by a MnP-mediated lipid peroxidation process. The experiment was set up to study whether the addition of oil can have a positive effect on degradation of a mixture of pesticides in a biomix and in soil. Enzymatic activity and microbial respiration were followed during the incubation period. The degradation of the pesticides by pure MnP in the presence of oil was tested in vitro. The experiment was prepared for each pesticide separate and a control without any pesticide added, in total six experimental setups. The main results from these studies are summarized below: • The effect from the addition of oil varies from promoting degradation to inhibiting degradation depending on pesticide. The lack of correlation with phenoloxidase activity could indicate that degradation mechanisms other than ligninolytic enzymes were prevailing or even dominant in this study. • The microbial respiration was higher in biomix than in soils. The addition of oil had an inhibitory effect in the biomix. • The phenoloxidase activity was higher in the biomix compared to the soil. The addition of oil did not increase the enzymatic activity. • In the in vitro experiments the addition of oil enhanced the degradation of IP by MnP, but no positive effect was observed for CLP, TBA, BZ and MBTZ. However, no enhancement of IP degradation was obtained in the biomix in the presence of rapeseed oil. • The initial method for the HPLC analysis was developed so all five pesticides could be detected within a reasonable time frame. However, with the oil-fractions peaking around MTBZ and BZ, and the fact that CLP had to be analysed separately, a new method also for the other four pesticides need to be developed for further studies. The new method for the four pesticides should separate the peaks around BZ and MBTZ further and not take CLP into account. • The interference peak in the chromatograms which increased over the incubation time could a product from vegetable oil being degraded in presence of of MnP could possibly indicate lipid. ...|$|R
40|$|Thresholds ? {{knowing when}} to act Cue: For farmers, {{chemical}} pesticides are a valuable weapon {{in the fight against}} damaging insects. But chemicals can be expensive, and if used incorrectly they can not only damage the environment but lead to problems of resistance in the insects they are intended to control. Effective use of chemicals depends on farmers knowing at what point they should be used. For example, there may be insects in the field, but are they pest species, and are there enough of them to justify using a chemical <b>spray?</b> The <b>point</b> at which <b>spraying</b> becomes a good idea is known as a threshold. To find out more about these thresholds, and why they are so important, Adu Domfeh visited the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana, and spoke to Senior Lecturer Dr Jakpasu Afun. Dr Afun began by explaining that not all insects should be seen as enemies. IN:	?All the insects we see are not pests? OUT:	?will also be able to apply this threshold. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Jakpasu Afun, explaining to Adu Domfeh why farmers need accurate information on exactly when to take action against pest species, the point known as the action threshold. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Afun	All the insects we see are not pests. A whole lot of them are beneficial to the farmer and it is not every quantity or amount of pests that warrant a control. Domfeh	So specifically, how does the farmer know there is a problem or likely problem of pest infestation or damage? Afun	The farmers themselves, not until they are trained, they find it difficult to determine which is the pest and which is not a pest. So we take them through a whole season of planting, right from land preparation through to harvest, pointing out to them which of them are the pests, what numbers they should expect before taking action, what quantity of damage those things should do before they should take any action. This is where we are coming to this word of ?threshold?. And we have two forms of threshold: one we call the ?action threshold?. That is where you see some given amount of damage before you go in to do your control. And another which we call the ?economic injury level?. That is the level beyond which, if there should be damage beyond that level then there is no justification because even if you try to do some remedial action you might not break even. It will lead to a loss to the farmer, loss of income. So you realise we are dealing with two thresholds, the action threshold is below the economic injury level. So the pest that the farmer is concerned about is the quantity of pest or damage between these two levels. If the farmer can take care of the pest within these two threshold levels then the farmer is in good business. Domfeh	And in these instances what basic scouting methods can the farmers adopt or use when they want to take action against destructive pests? Afun	We teach them to do site counting. So they go in, they look out for the pest on the crop. Then they count, because they see and count and then they look at some distance. Ok, if I see for example one or two pests within maybe two steps then I need to control. Or they can do what we call ?sweeping?, and then they {{look at the number of}} pests within what you have collected and you look at the number and compare with the scale. And what we do, what we call a scale ranges from zero to nine. Zero means where you do not have any pest problem at all, where nine means there is almost total damage. So on that scale, we call a point three on the scale. That point of three on that scale of nine is what we are calling the action threshold now. So if your damage is below that score of three on the scale of nine then you do not have any trouble, but if it is at the three or beyond then you need to take some action. Domfeh	Are there some examples of the action they could take to control these pests? Afun	If, for example, we look at the crop like cowpea which takes a lot of insecticide, almost all farmers will apply all sorts of chemicals onto their cowpea crop. We have four main pests that attack the crop right from seedling to maturity and even in store. So we teach them for example if you go into your field and you see what we call aphids or what we call plant lice, if you see them scattered in your crop - because these insects can be very prolific they can produce between five and fifteen children, let me call them children, in a day. So if you go and you see a cluster of say three or four scattered among your crop then you need to take action immediately because if you did not by the time you go back the next day that has increased into a very large colony. Then there is another one called ?maruka?. That one is very devastating because it will destroy the flower, it will destroy the pod. So we teach them to open these flowers to the centre of it. If they see the pest or the seed is damaged then that flower is considered as damaged. So if they count, they take twenty and maybe out of that twenty, five of them show damage symptoms then quickly you need to spray that very day. You do not wait until the next day. So these are some of the specific things we teach them to do. Domfeh	How then do we get the threshold right? Afun	It is all education. The problem is even now we have the threshold for a few pests on a few crops. So the first thing is that we researchers will have to double up. We need support to be able to determine these thresholds which we can then communicate to the farmers. Then they will also be able to apply this threshold.
