Including the strength of the analyst's justifications, reduces, and in some models eliminates, the significance of the information available in earnings forecasts and recommendation revisions. By controlling for the simultaneous release of other information, we show that analyst reports do not merely repeat firm releases of information, but also provide both new information and/or interpretation of previously released information to the market. By examining whether the market's reaction differs by report type (i. e. upgrade, reiteration, or downgrade), we demonstrate that information in a report is most important for downgrades and that target prices and the strength of the justifications are the only elements that matter for reiterations. Finally, we find no correlation between the valuation methodology used by analysts and either the market's reaction to a report's release or the analyst's accuracy.

40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} revising {{the legal framework}} for the processing and free movement of personal data. The revision is motivated by a need to reduce legal fragmentation among Member States and thus to improve {{the right to privacy}} accorded to EU citizens, without impeding the functioning of the internal market. The European Commission (EC) issued its proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation (DPR) 1 in January 2012. The EC proposes a Regulation rather than a Directive, meaning a single piece of legislation directly applicable at national level. The EC proposal contains a number of provisions and exemptions crucial to facilitating vital medical and health research, thus reconciling the social right to better health within a framework of protection of individual rights to privacy. The rapporteur of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee of the European Parliament (EP) produced in January 2013 his draft report on the DPR (the Albrecht Report) 2 with amendments that disturb this balance and dramatically weaken the provisions and exemptions applicable for medical and health research. The Scientifi c Committee for Medical Sciences of Science Europe (MED Committee) wishes to alert the EU institutions to the devastating implications of such amendments, if passed. Our position is in line with many public statements and position papers elaborated by prominent stakeholders from the European medical and health research community 3 on the crucial need to structure a legal framework for data protection which continues to promote medical research in Europe for the benefi t of individuals in society, while ensuring a proportionate requirement for patient privacy. 3 <b>Summary</b> <b>Opinion</b> and Recommendations of the MED Committe...|$|E

Wyżej zakreślone zadanie zamierzono osiągnąć na dwóch płaszczyznach. Po pierwsze, na płaszczyźnie teoretyczno-prawnej, poprzez wykazanie wzajemnej relacji pomiędzy interpretacyjnymi dyrektywami językowymi a pozajęzykowymi (systemowymi, a w szczególności funkcjonalnymi) w głównych polskich koncepcjach wykładni prawa. Po drugie, na płaszczyźnie dogmatyczno-prawnej, poprzez ukazanie funkcjonowania interpretacyjnych dyrektyw pozajęzykowych w korespondencji do dyrektyw językowych w ramach tzw. wykładni operatywnej, dokonywanej przez Sąd Najwyższy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej w sprawach cywilnych i karnych. W Rozdziale I wskazano na problem miejsca i roli dyrektyw funkcjonalnych w głównych koncepcjach wykładni prawa w polskiej kulturze prawnej. Celem takiej prezentacji poszczególnych koncepcji wykładni prawa jest nie tylko ukazanie różnorodności poglądów i stanowisk doktryny na istotę i funkcjonowanie dyrektyw funkcjonalnych w procesie wykładni prawa, lecz przede wszystkim wskazanie na doniosłość i znaczenie tego zagadnienia. W Rozdziale II wskazano na następujące zagadnienia: 1. Zasady clara non sunt interpretanda i interpretatio cessat in claris jako wyznaczniki stosowania dyrektyw funkcjonalnych 2. Rola funkcjonalnych dyrektyw wykładni prawa, 3. Wykładnia rozszerzająca (interpretatio extensiva) a wykładnia zawężająca (interpretatio restrictiva). W Rozdziale III wskazałem na następujące problemy i zagadnienia teoretyczno-prawne: 1. Pojęcie tranzycji systemu prawa, 2. Model tzw. tranzycji miękkiej, 3. Model tzw. tranzycji twardej, 4. Wpływ tranzycji systemu prawa na rolę, znaczenie i treść dyrektyw funkcjonalnych wykładni prawa, 5. Pojęcie paradygmatu interpretacyjnego, 6. Zjawisko wielości paradygmatów interpretacyjnych, 7. Zmiana paradygmatu interpretacyjnego a dyrektywy funkcjonalne wykładni prawa. Zasadniczym celem Rozdziału IV jest zilustrowanie za pomocą orzeczeń Sądu Najwyższego w sprawach cywilnych i karnych tez postawionych w Rozdziale I, II i III niniejszej pracy. W dokonano podsumowania rozprawy doktorskiej. Wskazałem na własne główne wnioski, spostrzeżenia i uwagi, wypracowane na podstawie przedstawionych w rozprawie zagadnień. The aim {{problem of}} this disertation is to schow {{importance}} {{and meaning of}} functional interpreting rules and their place and role {{during the process of}} decoding of legal texts. Firstly, from the theoretical point of view, the problem enables to present common immamency between semantical (linguistic) and out-semantical (out-linguistic) interpreting rules in the main Polish interpreting paradigms. Secondly, from the legal-dogmatic point of view, the problem exists in the activity of The Supreme Court Republic of Poland. Especially, it is possible during functioning out-semantical interpreting rules in the area of operational interpretation in civil and penal cases (made by courts; especially made by The Supreme Court). The First Chapter of the disertation presents place and role of functional interpreting rules in particular Polish interpreting paradigms (as well as pre-war and post-war interpreting paradigms). Especially, the aim of the considerations presented {{in this part of the}} disertation is to present the place and role of functional interpreting rules in two ground interpreting paradigms, firstly, in the semantical-intensional interpreting paradigm (created and formulated by Jerzy Wroblewski), and secondly, in the derevative interpreting paradigm (created and formulated by Zygmunt Ziembinski and Maciej Zielinski). According to the semantical-intensional interpreting paradigm, the place and role of the functional interpreting rules is restrictively terminated by semantical (linguistic) and comprehensive. It means that interpretator of legal texts is obliged, firstly, to pay attention to a text or to particular legal expression for this purpose to settle whether there is or there is not a situation of the isomorphy (the situation of the isomorphy means that a legal text or a particular legal expression is “clear” and then the interpretation of law is not important), and secondly, when the situation of isomprphy does not exist, interpretator is obliged to make an interpretation, applying successively linguistic, comprehensive and functional interpreting rules to create a legal text or to make a particular expression “clear”. On the other hand, according to the derevative interpreting paradigm, interpretator is obliged to make interpretation, applying every time successively linguistic, comprehensive and functional interpreting rules. This paradigms exludes the situation of isomorphy (as it was formulated above). In the Chapter II the disertation formulates place and role of functional interpreting rules as one of the most important problem in the theory of law. Firstly, functional interpreting rules determinate the process of decoding of legal texts through paying attention to: the aim of law (ratio iuris), the aim of particular legal bill (ratio legis), the social-political context of law, the social cultures of particular social groups, and values as well as legislator and particular recipients of law (eg. especially particular persons or social group). The Chapter III of the disertation presents the question of transition (transformation) of the Polish legal system after 1989 and its influence exerted on interpreting paradigms. It means that the transformation of the Polish political system made the importance of change in the Polish legal system. The semantical (linguistic) and comprehensive interpretation is not enough to create the corect understanding of law. The main role of transition of the Polish legal system is to pay attention to functional interpreting rules more, than it was up to now. Thus this role may be formulated as a demand called “more functional interpreting rules in the interpretation of law”. The Chapter IV includes particular judical decisions, made by The Polish Supreme Court in civil and penal cases. They are presented, as an illustration of standpoints formulated in Chapters I-III. In the last part of this disertation are formulated summary opinions. The main <b>summary</b> <b>opinion</b> refers to activity of The Polish Supreme Court, especially to its operative interpretation. We are able to put hard standpoint, that the most important judical authority in the Republic of Poland does not have common and integrated model for the interpretation of modern Polish legal text, firstly, which would correspond to the actual characteristics of the language in which the text is formulated, and secondly, which would correspond to “the polish legal reality” (as eg. context of law interpretation, or axiological aspects of law interpretation). The second main <b>summary</b> <b>opinion</b> refers to the postulate formulated above – “more functional interpreting rules in the interpretation of law”. The Supreme Court does not pay attention to those types of interpreting rules, interpreting legal texts according to semantical (linguistic) or comprehensive rules. The disertation formulates an opinion, that The Supreme Court will be obliged to adopt the postulate “more functional interpreting rules in the interpretation of law”, because it will be exorted by post-transitional Polish legal texts...|$|E

However, few studies have investigated the effect of AOS characteristics on audience reactions. This study used the theory of justice to empirically validate the effect of AOS adoption on such elements of justice perceptions, content quality, trust, satisfaction, and on such audience reactions as continuous viewing, purchase, word-of-mouth, and reciprocal participation. We conducted a laboratory experi-ment that used three types of virtual broadcasting content (a <b>summary</b> of majority <b>opinion</b> in SNS, a <b>summary</b> of majority <b>opinion</b> in SNS and its detailed comments, and, third, two majority and minority <b>opinion</b> <b>summaries</b> in SNS and their detailed comments).
