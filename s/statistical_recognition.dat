40|$|The wide {{availability}} of visual data via social {{media and the}} internet, coupled {{with the demands of}} the security community have led to an increased interest in visual recognition. Recent research has focused on improving the accuracy of recognition techniques in environments where variability is well controlled. However, applications such as identity verification often operate in unconstrained environments. Therefore {{there is a need for}} more robust recognition techniques that can operate on data with considerable noise. Many <b>statistical</b> <b>recognition</b> techniques rely on principal component analysis (PCA). However, PCA suffers from the presence of outliers due to occlusions and noise often encountered in unconstrained settings. In this thesis we address this problem by using L 1 -PCA to minimize the effect of outliers in data. L 1 -PCA is applied to several <b>statistical</b> <b>recognition</b> techniques including eigenfaces and Grassmannian learning. Several popular face databases are used to show that L 1 -Grassmann manifolds not only outperform, but are also more robust to noise and occlusions than traditional L 2 -Grassmann manifolds for face and facial expression recognition. Additionally a high performance GPU implementation of L 1 -PCA is developed using CUDA that is several times faster than CPU implementations...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>statistical</b> <b>recognition</b> is considered, as it arises in immunobiology, namely, the {{discrimination}} of foreign antigens {{against a background}} of the body's own molecules. The precise mechanism of this foreign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system, continues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den Berg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the probabilistic nature of the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random sample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random receptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown previously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing important aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the basis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained {{with the help of a}} refined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations have, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach, which does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed questions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an importance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the relevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the mechanism of <b>statistical</b> <b>recognition</b> in some depth. In particular, we illustrate how a foreign antigen can stand out against the self background if it is present in sufficiently many copies, although no a priori difference between self and nonself is built into the model.

Second, we measure the performance of STL TSB-HMM and MTL TSB-HMM with spectrogram feature, where in MTL TSB-HMM, the multiple tasks are linked by different target-aspects. Finally, we introduce power transformation metric to improve the recognition performance of spectrogram feature. It is shown that using spectrogram feature not only have a better ROC, but also obtain a better recognition performance than using HRRP time domain feature. MTL shares the underlying state information among different target-aspects, and can provide a better recognition performance compared to STL. In addition, the power transformation metric can enhance both average recognition rate and ROC.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a methodology for automated recognition of complex human activities. The paper proposes a general framework which reliably recognizes high-level human actions and human-human interactions. Our {{approach is a}} description-based approach, which enables a user to encode {{the structure of a}} high-level human activity as a formal representation. Recognition of human activities is done by semantically matching constructed representations with actual observations. The methodology uses a context-free grammar (CFG) based representation scheme as a formal syntax for representing composite activities. Our CFG-based representation enables us to define complex human activities based on simpler activities or movements. Our system takes advantage of both <b>statistical</b> <b>recognition</b> techniques from computer vision and knowledge representation concepts from traditional artificial intelligence. In the low-level of the system, image sequences are processed to extract poses and gestures. Based on the recognition of gestures, the high-level of the system hierarchically recognizes composite actions and interactions occurring in a sequence of image frames. The concept of hallucinations and a probabilistic semantic-level recognition algorithm is introduced to cope with imperfect lower-layers. As a result, the system recognizes human activities including ‘fighting ’ and ‘assault’, which are high-level activities that previous systems had difficulties. The experimental results show that our system reliably recognizes sequences of complex human activities with a high recognition rate. ...|$|E

Supposing that HRRP samples are independent and jointly Gaussian distributed, a recent work [Du L, Liu H W, Bao Z. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2008, 56 (5) : 1931 – 1944] applied factor analysis (FA) to model HRRP data with a two-phase approach for model selection, which achieved satisfactory recognition performance. The theoretical analysis and experimental results reveal that there exists high temporal correlation among adjacent HRRPs. This paper is thus motivated to model the spatial and temporal structure of HRRP data simultaneously by employing temporal factor analysis (TFA) model. For a limited size of high-dimensional HRRP data, the two-phase approach for parameter learning and model selection suffers from intensive computation burden and deteriorated evaluation. To tackle these problems, this work adopts the Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) harmony learning that has automatic model selection ability during parameter learning. Experimental results show stepwise improved recognition and rejection performances from the twophase learning based FA, to the two-phase learning based TFA and to the BYY harmony learning based TFA with automatic model selection. In addition, adding many extra free parameters to the classic FA model and thus becoming even worse in identifiability, the model of...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) {{is to determine}} whether a structure is performing as expected or there is any anomaly in its behavior as compared to the normal condition.
