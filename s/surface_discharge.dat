The insulators were treated in the following three ways, (A) the insulator was soaked in distilled water for about 55 hours, (B) the insulator was dried in a drying oven for about 15 hours and (C) the insulator was dehydrated at 0. 93 mPa lower pressure after being dried in a drying oven for 45 days. Differences of V-I characteristic curves between the insulators treated by the three methods under 10 ^ A appeared clearly.

50|$|The depth {{compensating}} systems discharge {{a portion}} of the diver's tidal volume which varies in inverse proportion to the absolute pressure. At the surface they generally discharge between 20% (1/5) and 33% (1/3)of each breath, but that decreases with depth, to keep the oxygen fraction in the loop approximately constant and reduce gas consumption. A fully depth compensated system will discharge a volume of gas, inversely proportional to pressure, so that the volume discharged at 90m depth (10 bar absolute pressure) will be 10% of the <b>surface</b> <b>discharge.</b> This system will provide an approximately fixed oxygen fraction regardless of depth, when used with the same make-up gas, because the effective mass discharge remains constant.|$|E
50|$|Sprytrons {{are often}} {{designed}} similar to trigatrons, with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization {{on the inner}} surface of an alumina tube. The trigger pulse causes surface flashover, which liberates electrons and vaporized <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a vacuum arc, closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding secondary electrons knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the jitter can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by outgassing from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the hermetic seals; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life {{can be done by}} storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 &deg;C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piston engine}} has {{a part of}} the {{combustion}} chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located. A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the tip seals. Clearly, if a spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel's combustion chamber it would foul the rotating tip; and if the plug were recessed to avoid this, the sunken spark might lead to poor combustion. So a new type of [...] "surface discharge" [...] plug was developed for the Wankel. Such a plug presents an almost flat face to the combustion chamber. A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly; and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode. The advantage is that the plug sits just beneath the tip-seal that sweeps over it, keeping the spark accessible to the fuel/air mixture. The [...] "plug gap" [...] remains constant throughout its life; and the spark path will continually vary (instead of darting from the centre to the side electrode as in a conventional plug). Whereas a conventional side electrode will (admittedly, rarely) come adrift in use and potentially cause engine damage, this is impossible with a <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> plug, as there is nothing to break off. Surface-discharge spark plugs have been produced by inter alia, Denso, NGK, Champion and Bosch.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for electrical power energy {{comes with a}} challenge to design power transformers with optimised dimensions {{at the same time}} meeting the energy requirements. The dimension of a power transformer is influence by the insulation system. The use of composite insulation comprising of transformer oil and cellulose (paper and pressboard) is still currently the most economical insulation technology allowing for dimension reduction. Although over the years, there have been developments of alternative insulation systems; the conventional insulation type is still predominant due to various reasons. The main disadvantage with the conventional composite insulation system is relative permittivity mismatch of the different material, which leads to localised electrical stresses at their interface. The localised electrical stress causes <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> on solid insulation material at normal operating voltage thereby slowly developing into a permanent conduction path, which leads to dielectric failure. It is known that about 25 % to 30 % of major dielectric failures of power transformers are due to switching and lightning impulses associated with solid insulation ageing and contamination. The objective of this dissertation is to study the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> on the lightning impulse (LI) breakdown voltage of oil-impregnated pressboard used in power transformers. Needles placed at an acute angle on the surface of an oil-impregnated pressboard sample to plane electrode geometry were used to age 24 pressboard samples with <b>surface</b> <b>discharge.</b> The electrode gap distance was set at an optimised distance of 45 mm. The test samples were continuously aged by <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> at a constant supply voltage of 30 kV. The ageing experiment was performed in an array of 12 test samples set simultaneously aged for a period of 3 hours and another set for 7 hours. A set of 6 out of the 12 aged samples were tested for positive and another set for negative LI breakdown voltage. The experimental findings are that <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> reduces the LI breakdown voltage of oil-impregnated pressboard and this is a function of exposure period to <b>surface</b> <b>discharge.</b> Furthermore, although negative LI breakdown voltage of pressboard is higher than positive LI breakdown voltage, the former is affected relatively more by <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> ageing.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> behaviour at the oil-pressboard interface. For large transformers this is classified as a serious failure mode because it can lead to catastrophic failure under normal AC voltage operating conditions. To increase understanding on this failure mode, a <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> experiment at the oil-pressboard interface has been conducted on different moisture levels in pressboard by applying a long period of AC voltage stress. The processes in the <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> at the oil-pressboard interface until the appearance of a first full discharge have been recognised and correlated with the measured data. The results show that the different moisture levels within the pressboard play an important role on the partial discharge (PD) activity of certain processes. The decreasing trend in the PD data during the surface discharges cannot be treated as a reliable condition monitoring measure of health because it is the key indicator of white marks propagation toward the earth point. The characteristics of full discharge events have been analysed to develop knowledge for condition monitoring of <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> at the oil-pressboard interface. Full discharges are corona-like events in which their random occurrences are dominated by accumulated charges on the pressboard surface along the white marks rather than the polarity of applied AC voltage. A 2 -D axial symmetry <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> model has also been developed using COMSOL Multiphysics, a finite element analysis (FEA) software package. The model considers the pressboard region near the interface (a transition region) as porous, whilst in the bulk region of pressboard as a perfect insulator. The model is developed using continuity equations and coupled with the Poisson’s equation to study the problem in terms of charge transport mechanisms and electric field distributions. The thermal conduction equation is included to study the thermal effects of <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> activity at the oil-pressboard interface. The behaviour of <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> is studied by validating the simulated <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> current pulse with the measured current. The simulation results show that a field dependent molecular ionisation mechanism {{plays an important role in}} the streamer propagation during the period of the rising front of the current pulse, whilst during the period of decaying tail of the current pulse, the contribution of an electron attachment process is dominant. The modelling results suggest that degradation marks (white and black marks) are due to high energy over long periods of partial discharge events that lead to thermal degradation at the oil-pressboard interface...|$|E
40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>discharge</b> at the oil-pressboard {{interface}} {{leads to}} the development of a conducting path that is generally accepted as white marks due to localized heating. The visible white marks are believed to be due to partial discharge (PD) energy that is high enough to dry out the pressboard through vaporizing the moisture and breaking oil molecules to generate gases in the pressboard pores. A long period of electrical stress applied to a <b>surface</b> <b>discharge</b> experiment using a needle-bar electrode configuration has led to the formation of full-gap white marks on the pressboard surface that bridged the needle tip and earth bar. During the <b>surface</b> <b>discharge,</b> leakage current may occur intermittently that sometimes is visible in the form of full discharge of arcing at the oil-pressboard interface bridging the needle tip and earth bar.
