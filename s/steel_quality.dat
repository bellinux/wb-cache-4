5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a <b>steel</b> <b>quality</b> substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E

2500|$|The Husqvarna Model 40 or m/40 was {{manufactured}} 1940 to 1946 {{and was a}} Swedish copy of the Finnish Lahti pistol. The Swedish army {{realized there}} would be a shortage of pistols in the event of large scale military mobilization in Europe. Originally adopting the Walther P38 in 1939, Germany's entry into World War II stopped the export of P38s to Sweden. To compensate, Sweden adopted the Lahti pistol but was unable to import L-35-type guns because of Finland's conflicts with the USSR. Production was licensed to Svenska Automatvapen AB but the immediate collapse of the company passed the contract to Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. The first m/40s were delivered to the Swedish military by 1942 with slight differences from the Finnish L-35 Lahtis. The grips of the m/40 have the Husqvarna [...] "crown H" [...] motif engraved and the front sight was slightly larger. The barrel is also slightly longer on the m/40 than the Finnish Lahti with the m/40's trigger guard being heavier, and the pistol does not have the loaded chamber indicator and lock-retaining spring of the Finnish Lahti. Other modifications included a change in the gun <b>steel</b> <b>quality</b> specifications that were not successful in the m/40s and led to cracks in the frame. Cracking in the frame became more aggravated as the m/39B-ammunition developed for use in the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun were used in the pistols.

40|$|Ths {{strain rate}} {{behavior}} of mild-steel and high strength <b>steel</b> <b>qualities</b> has been investigated. The hardening {{as a function}} of the strain rate of a set of <b>steel</b> <b>qualities</b> was determined, and it was found that the gain in strength for high-strength steels is not in proportion to the static yield-strength. The absolute increase in strength for high-strength steels is often less than for mild steel (although this fact depends on the microstructure of the steel). This fact is reflected in the absorption of energy for square crash-columns that were tested on a sled-impact facility. Downgauging parts from mild-steel to high-strength steel must be therefore be done carefully to maintain its crashworthiness properties. Special attention should be given to the strain rate sensitivity of the next generation of high strength steel. Moreover we have tested and simulated spotwelded columns to test the failure criterion for spotwelds. It appeared that using a failure criterion with standard tensile- and cross-tension forces for rupture of spot-welded specimens gives quite satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} a {{punching}} process using the ABAQUS/Explicit FE- code. A damage model based on equivalent plastic strain {{has been used to}} describe crack initiation and propagation in the blank. An axisymmetric model created in ABAQUS/CAE was used throughout the study. The model consists of a punch, blank holder, die and blank. In this work the punch, blank holder and die are modelled as rigid bodies while the blank is considered elastic-plastic. The materials used in simulations are DC 04, Docol 350 YP, Docol 800 DP and DC 1400 M. This selection of <b>steel</b> <b>qualities</b> has a wide span in mechanical properties and fields of application. Material characterisation for simulation purposes has been done by conducting uniaxial tensile tests. The data from these tests have been extrapolated beyond the necking strain by double Voce extrapolation. Punching experiments have been performed in an excenter driven press equipped with position and force measurement devices. The experiments result in load curves for the different <b>steel</b> <b>qualities</b> and gives information about the characteristic zones of the sheet edges. The results from simulations have been evaluated by comparisons with experiments concerning load curves, characteristic zones of the sheet edge, work done during the operation, maximum forces and stroke to failure.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of plastic}} components, like {{a majority of}} other mass produced discrete parts, require well designed dies and moulds. Complex geometries and increasing demands on final surface appearance, which is strongly connected to the quality impression, are pushing for high demands on mould-makers and polishers as well as steel producers. Moulds for production of shiny plastic components require tool steels with low defect levels to achieve highly gloss and very smooth mould surfaces (roughness levels in the nm-range). It {{is the ability to}} achieve those mirror-like surfaces, the polishability of tool steels, that is the central part in this study. To increase the understanding of how material properties and different surface preparation techniques impact the polishability, a selection of high gloss polished tool <b>steel</b> <b>qualities</b> were characterised using non-contact 3 D-surface texture analysis. A first step towards a grading system of the polishablility was made based on a classification of surface defects detected on included steel samples. 3 D surface parameters based on interferometer measurements seemed to be useful for a characterisation, even though further studies (involving different filters and segmentation methods) are needed to find less and more precise parameter values to grade tool <b>steel</b> <b>qualities.</b> Future work will include analysis of surface measurements of test moulds and plastic parts, as well as studies of how quantitative parameters can be linked to qualitative estimations in order to better understand how surface features on the mould are transferred into the surface of plastic components...|$|R
