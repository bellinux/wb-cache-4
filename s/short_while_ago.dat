6000|$|Stainville's {{expressive}} lips {{curled into}} a smile. [...] "Be kind to me!"--the same pathetic prayer spoken to him by Lydie a very <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago.</b> Bah! how little women understood ambition! Even Lydie! Even Irène! ...|$|E

60|$|Marie {{appeared}} again, with {{no signs}} now that so <b>short</b> a <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> romance {{had played a}} game with her, and brought the dishes that had been ordered. Susie seized once more upon Arthur Burdon's attention.|$|R
6000|$|I haven't time to work. Life is so {{much too}} <b>short.</b> A little <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> it {{occurred}} to me that I was nearly forty. [To MRS. CROWLEY.] D'you know the feeling? ...|$|R
60|$|Conversation {{amongst the}} younger {{members of the}} house-party at Devenham Castle was a little disjointed that evening. Perhaps Penelope, who came down in a {{wonderful}} black velveteen gown, {{with a bunch of}} scarlet roses in her corsage, {{was the only one who}} seemed successfully to ignore the passage of arms which had taken place so <b>short</b> a <b>while</b> <b>ago.</b> She talked pleasantly to Somerfield, who tried to be dignified and succeeded only in remaining sulky. Chance had placed her at some distance from the Prince, to whom Lady Grace was talking with a subdued softness in her manner which puzzled Captain Wilmot, her neighbor on the other side.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{come from}} Mossvale. My name is Richard Dare. My father died from an {{accident}} a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> and, as there didn't {{seem to be}} anything in our village for me to work at, I {{made up my mind}} to try New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think if}} you wish to keep out of trouble you had best aid us all you can. The young man we are after came in here a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> and has utterly disappeared. I am afraid he has met with foul play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be grieved, old friend," [...] said Edward. [...] "I haven't failed. I've succeeded. You can't {{think with}} what zest I {{look forward to}} life, how full {{it seems to me}} and how significant. Sometimes, when you are married to Isabel, you will think of me. I shall build myself a house on my coral island and I shall live there, looking after my trees--getting the fruit out of the nuts in the same old way that they have done for {{unnumbered}} years--I shall grow all sorts of things in my garden, and I shall fish. There will be enough work to keep me busy and not enough to make me dull. I shall have my books and Eva, children, I hope, and above all, the infinite variety of the sea and the sky, the freshness of the dawn and the beauty of the sunset, and the rich magnificence of the night. I shall make a garden out of what so <b>short</b> a <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> was a wilderness. I shall have created something. The years will pass insensibly, and when I am an old man I hope that I shall be able to look back on a happy, simple, peaceful life. In my small way I too shall have lived in beauty. Do you think it is so little to have enjoyed contentment? We know that it will profit a man little if he gain the whole world and lose his soul. I think I have won mine." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} less consistent, although he qualified for all tournaments except the Malta Cup, {{and his best}} result was a quarter-final loss to Ding Junhui at the China Open. He finished the season ranked 25, falling seven places. The 2005/2006 season did not look better either, a series of first round defeats saw him provisionally {{drop out of the}} top 32. However, he had a good run at the 2006 World Championship, beating three seeded players – Alan McManus 10–3, Stephen Maguire 13–4, and Ken Doherty 13–10 – to reach the semi-finals, where he lost to world no.7 and 2002 World Champion Peter Ebdon 16–17. In that match, Fu was 9–15 down with only one session left to play, but won seven out of the next eight frames to send the match into the deciding frame, which Ebdon eventually won. Fu's success in this tournament can be largely attributed to working with coach Terry Griffiths. Fu had used Griffiths for a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> some years <b>ago</b> – but did not commit to the necessary changes in technique. This run enable him to stay in the world top 32 for next season, ranked 22.|$|R

60|$|He {{smiled and}} stood by her side, looking downwards. The village lay almost at their feet, and away beyond spread the mist-wreathed country, still and silent in the November afternoon. The wind had fallen, the birds were songless, nothing {{remained}} of the busy chorus of summer sounds. They stood {{on the edge of}} a plantation--the peculiar fragrance of freshly turned earth from the ploughed fields opposite, and of the carpet of wet leaves beneath their feet, had taken the place of all those sweeter perfumes which a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> had seemed to belong naturally to the place.|$|E
60|$|The mare {{was showing}} signs of delicately-hinted impatience; the paddock, with its teasing insects and very {{indifferent}} grazing, had not thrust out {{the image of her}} own comfortable well-foddered loose-box. Elaine divested her habit of some remaining crumbs of bun-loaf and jumped lightly on to her saddle. As she rode slowly down the lane, with Keriway escorting her as far as its gate, she looked round at what had seemed to her, a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> just a picturesque old farmstead, a place of bee-hives and hollyhocks and gabled cart-sheds; now it was in her eyes a magic city, with an undercurrent of reality beneath its magic.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I get there, {{let me have}} a line {{waiting to}} tell me where I can see you. While I am on the train you will find Von Behrling almost inaccessible. Directly I have gone it will be different. Play with him carefully. He should not be difficult. To tell you the truth, I am rather {{surprised}} that he has been trusted upon a mission like this. He was in disgrace with the Chancellor a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> and I know that he was hurt at not being allowed to attend the conference. The others will watch him closely, but they cannot overhear everything that passes between you two. Von Behrling is a poor man. You will know how to make him wish he were rich." ...|$|E

Hugh Price Hughes is {{authority}} for the statement that beds are let on the three-relay system--that is, three tenants to a bed, each occupying it eight hours, so that it never grows cold; while the floor space underneath the bed is likewise let on the three-relay system. Health officers {{are not at all}} unused to finding such cases as the following: in one room having a cubic capacity of 1000 feet, three adult females in the bed, and two adult females under the bed; and in one room of 1650 cubic feet, one adult male and two children in the bed, and two adult females under the bed.|$|E
60|$|Surprise brought Jimmy {{back from}} his dreams to the hard world --surprise and a certain exasperation. It was ridiculous to be incognito in a city which he had not visited in five years and to be {{instantly}} recognised in this way by every second man he met. He looked sourly at the man. The other was a sturdy, square-shouldered, battered young man, who wore on his homely face a grin of recognition and regard. Jimmy was not particularly good at remembering faces, but this person's was of a kind which the poorest memory might have recalled. It was, as the advertisements say, distinctively individual. The broken nose, the exiguous forehead, and the enlarged ears all clamoured for recognition. The last time Jimmy had seen Jerry Mitchell had been two years before at the National Sporting Club in London, and, placing him at once, he braced himself, as a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> he had braced himself to confound immaculate Reggie.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems but a <b>short</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> {{when the}} trees met overhead--magnificent trees they were. The asphalt and the soot killed them. And there were fruit trees in that yard"--he pointed with his {{stick to a}} {{littered}} sun parched plot adjoining a battered mansion--"all pink and white with blossoms in the spring. Mr. Hadley lived there--one of our forgotten citizens. He is dead and gone now and his family scattered. That other house, where the boy lies, belonged to Mr. Villars, a relation of the Atterbury family, and I can recall very well a little girl with a pink sash and a white dress who used to come running out to meet me with flowers in her hands. Incredible as it may seem, she picked them in that yard. I thought of her as I went in, how fresh and happy she used to be, and what a different place this was for children then. She must have some of her own by this time." ...|$|E
