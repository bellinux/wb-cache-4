40|$|Local network {{alignment}} is {{an important}} component of the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks that may lead to the identification of evolutionary related complexes. We present AlignNemo, a new algorithm that, given the networks of two organisms, uncovers subnetworks of proteins that relate in biological function and topology of interactions. The discovered conserved subnetworks have a general topology and need not to correspond to specific interaction patterns, so that they more closely fit the models of functional complexes proposed in the literature. The algorithm is able to handle sparse interaction data with an expansion process that at each step explores the local topology of the networks beyond the proteins directly interacting with the current solution. To assess the performance of AlignNemo, we ran a series of benchmarks using statistical measures as well as biological knowledge. Based on reference datasets of protein complexes, AlignNemo shows better performance than other methods in terms of both precision and recall.

We use these form factors along with Standard Model determinations of Wilson coefficients to give Standard Model predictions for several observables [arXiv: 1310. 3887].

40|$|<b>Supplementary</b> <b>details</b> {{about our}} methods HMM model and EST-data Some EST {{sequences}} match the HERV sequence in reverse orientation because the reverse complement of the mRNA is sequenced {{instead of the}} forward copy. To account for this phenomenon, when computing the likelihood of such an EST sequence with the HMM model, the HERV sequence corresponding to the match states is also reversed in each sub-HMM. That is, the first match state in a sub-HMM has a high probability of generating an EST nucleotide matching the last nucleotide of the HERV sequence associated with the sub-HMM, the second match state has a high probability of generating a match to the second-to-last HERV nucleotide, and so on. This way, the HMM structure mimics the EST generation even for the reverse orientation ESTs; in particular, the low quality end part {{is used for the}} correct end of the EST sequences. In addition, the sequence is reverse complemented in the EST before it is given to the HMM (A→T, T→A, C→G, G→C).

The objectives of this research were to study and explore Object Oriented Design, as applied in software design, and identify those principles and concepts that could be applied in engineering design to make it more efficient. An examination of the object oriented software design philosophy, methodology and programming approach was therefore carried out. The Object Oriented Design features of Functions, Properties and Inheritance were identified as having potential value in reformatting engineering classification charts, so as to make them more useful to both neophyte and experienced engineering designers. Engineering components have evolved from their basic forms into families of components and sub-components. Classification charts are often used to represent these families.

40|$|We {{consider}} a nonlinear inverse problem {{that occurs in}} γ-spectroscopy. A radioactive source randomly emits photons that interact with a detector. An acquisition system then converts each interaction into a pulse of short duration whose shape {{is proportional to the}} deposited energy. In this paper, we model this signal using a shot-noise process and assume the shape of the electric current is known. Based on low frequency observations of the shot-noise process, we then introduce a new nonparametric procedure in order to estimate both the intensity and the probability density function of the underlying marked point process. The algorithm developed in this article is time-efficient and suited for large datasets commonly used in nuclear science. We illustrate the performance of our method on simulated and real datasets. 1. Introduction. We {{consider a}} nonlinear inverse problem that arises in nuclear science. In the specific context of γ-spectroscopy, a photon beam stemming from a radioactive source hits a scintillator detector. Assuming that the nuclear reactions at the origin of the emitted photons are independent, the arrival times of interaction between particles and matter can be modeled by a homogeneous Poisson point process. Each interaction between a particle and the detector generates an electric current called impulse response whose amplitude depends on the partial or total transfer of the incident photon energy. Indeed, photons interact with matter following three different phenomena: the Compton scattering, the photoelectric absorption and the pair production (for <b>supplementary</b> <b>details,</b> see Knoll (1989)). We particularly focus our attention on shot-noise processes that produce pileup, which is the phenomenon that occurs when two or more electric currents generated by different photons overlap. For instance, this is the case when the mean inter-arrival time between two photons is shorter than the suppor...|$|E

We briefly introduced the self-healing materials in chapter 1, covering classification and basic self-healing mechanism.

Additionally, we provided the long existing recipe with exclusive <b>supplementary</b> <b>details,</b> such as reaction kinetics, structural refinement and characterization, mechanical performance, glass transition temperature, etc. We have denoted the refined PBS, in which the end groups of PBS primarily exhibit in the well-defined borono structure (B(OH) 2), rPBS. In chapter 3, the molecular interaction of PBS molecules {{that leads to the}} self-healing behavior was investigated with modern techniques. Besides the well-known physically cross-linked H-bonds, PBS molecules also cross-link via forming reversible covalent boroxane structures (B-O-B). Chapter 4 and 5 focus on the reinforcing effects of rigid nanoclay particles (Cloisite 20 A) and flexible graphene oxide (GO), respectively. As PBS molecules bear the hydrophilic borono end groups, the incorporation of natural clay and graphene oxide leads to softened nanocomposites due to their hydrophilic surfaces. GO platelets efficiently drive the GO/rPBS nanocomposite into thixotropic material readily at a mass fraction of 0. 001. However, natural clay surface is not as hydrophilic as GO. The softening effect is not only less pronounced, but also quickly compensated due to the formation of the particle network. Nevertheless, it results in a paste-like thixotrope when the mass fraction of natural clay reaches 0. 6. Cloisite 20 A and OMGO are surface modified natural clay and GO, with almost the same alkyl modifier. They behave as ordinary reinforcement additives and may efficiently enhance the rheological properties of the nanocomposites. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|E
