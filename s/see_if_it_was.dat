In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

A two-hour test flight, using a 50-50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 feeding a Rolls Royce RB-211 engine {{of one of the}} airline's 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found. The use of jatropha has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.|$|E

The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version, as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired. For example, the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch. Wohlwend {{has said that the}} number tiles grow in character with their size. The idea for character faces beneath the cards remained from previous theme iterations, and the character voices were provided by indie game developers. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it [...] "tough and frustrating and sometimes hard to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth it".

500|$|British record {{producer}} Ken Nelson and {{the band}} produced [...] "Trouble" [...] for their debut album, Parachutes.

They, however, decided that the first three versions were not [...] "working". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin on the piano which they recorded in a little wooden room. After Guy Berryman's bass was recorded, guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones—one was brighter-sounding and the other had a fuller sound. Nelson, who {{wanted to keep the}} song simple, chose the fuller sound microphone for the mixing.|$|E

500|$|Suganami {{was deeply}} {{invested}} in Alien Soldier and devoted {{a lot of}} personal time to developing it. He began developing the game himself as the sole designer and programmer. At the time, Mega Drive games typically required two designers and two programmers, but Suganami wanted to challenge himself and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to create the game himself. He originally had ambitious plans for a large backstory, but in order to make their deadline of 3 January 1995, the majority of it was cut from the game. As the deadline approached, he came to realize {{he would not be able}} to complete Alien Soldier himself, and so additional staff were added to provide him support. He worked overtime during the New Years holidays in order to complete the game while the market for the Mega Drive was quickly shrinking. Only about half of the team's original ideas were completed in time for release. They originally planned to create 100 bosses, but this was cut much shorter due to the time constraints. One of the bosses that was included, [...] "Seven Force", was originally featured in Gunstar Heroes.|$|E
500|$|When Elizabeth I became queen, {{she ordered}} {{a survey of}} her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles {{in the north of}} her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 {{reported}} that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen {{was on the verge of}} collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth £1,000, and could be repaired for £100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed [...] "imperfect at every corner". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard [...] "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.|$|E

So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant.

2500|$|Two {{weeks before}} the film's premiere, the Daily Telegraph erroneously {{reported}} that Luhrmann gave in to studio pressure after [...] "intense" [...] talks with executives and re-wrote and then re-shot the ending of Australia for a happier conclusion after [...] "disastrous reviews" [...] from test screenings. To counter these negative reports, the studio had Jackman and Kidman promoting Australia on The Oprah Winfrey Show, which dedicated an entire episode of the program to the film, and Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman spoke to the Los Angeles Times where he described the Telegraph article as [...] "patently nonsensical. It's all too typical {{of the way the}} world works today that everybody picked up an unsourced, anonymous quote-filled story in a tabloid from Sydney and nobody ever bothered to check to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accurate". Rothman also said that Luhrmann had final cut on his film. The director admitted that he wrote six endings in the drafts he authored, and shot three of them.|$|E

A [...] "foreign" [...] photographer accompanying him suddenly said, [...] "I am not gonna die for your country," [...] and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of canoeing from Devizes to Westminster {{was first}} {{suggested}} by Roy Cooke, {{who had been}} part of a team who had attempted to canoe along the River Avon from Pewsey, near Devizes, to the sea at Christchurch in 1947. He then planned to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to reach Westminster from Devizes in under 100 hours. At the time, much of the Kennet and Avon Canal was derelict, but still in water. He was unable to attempt the course, but a number of locals offered some money for Scout funds if the Devizes Scouts could succeed in [...] "taking a boat from Devizes to Westminster in under 100 hours, all food and camping kit to be carried in the boats". Four of the scouts, Peter Brown, Laurie Jones, Brian Smith and Brian Walters, all aged 17, attempted the route at Easter 1948. The event generated much interest, with some national press coverage, and a large crowd gathering at Westminster Bridge to see the end of the feat, which was completed in 89 hours 50 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all right to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and hung up the phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E

One known incident, causing great amusement among the public, took place when she played Susanna in Figaro in 1821.

She declined the offer and left, which made him much disappointed. The next day she did not know her part, and du Puy then reported her to the director, who placed her on house arrest in her rooms for delaying the rehearsals.
