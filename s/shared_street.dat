50|$|The {{town was}} {{surveyed}} by Thomas F. Norton, deputy surveyor of Livingston County. The railroad {{had been granted}} a 100 ft swath of land extending diagonally through the town. This presented a problem in town design, which was solved at Odell by aligning the entire Original Town with the tracks. A similar problem was presented by several towns along this railroad.

Lots sold from twenty to thirty dollars, with twenty being more common. Where the tracks passed through the town, the land used by the railroad was widened an additional 100 yards on both sides of the tracks, to create railroad grounds, although at Odell they were not labeled as such. This kind of widening of railroad property at townsites was a common feature of railroad towns built in the 1850s and may be seen at places like Dwight, Towanda, McLean, Fairbury and Chatsworth; it became less common with later railroad towns. The depot at Odell was on the north side of the tracks and the two early elevators on the south side. The Original Town included twenty-four numbered blocks, each of which contained up to twenty lots. There was no central public square designated on the plat. The original town plan remains substantially unaltered to this day.|$|E

40|$|Streets {{represent}} {{the majority of}} the publicly owned space in our cities, but most of the street space is dominated by the movement of motor vehicles with little attention paid to other street users or functions. An alternative approach to vehicle-dominated streets are Shared Streets that intentionally mix vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles in one continuous street surface, without any curb separation. This design approach has emerged to revitalize the broader social and play functions of our streets, as well as to democratize the allocation of space to allow for greater non-motorized safety and access. This thesis investigates how people behave in shared spaces to learn whether they improve access for non-motorized users and whether they expand the use of the street as a public space. This study had a multifaceted approach to analyzing shared streets including an extensive literature review of current research and studies, as well as site visits to observe and record behavior at two recent <b>shared</b> <b>street</b> projects in Europe: Exhibition Road in London, England and the Mariahilferstrasse in Vienna, Austria. Results show that shared spaces are successful in promoting sharing between different users and creating a sense of public space, but only under the right conditions. Vehicular speed and traffic volumes have the greatest effect on the success of a <b>shared</b> <b>street,</b> but pedestrian volumes, the surrounding building use, and the streetscape design all affect human behavior. However, if the critical qualities and conditions aren’t present, shared streets will not function as shared or public spaces and will instead perform as conventional streets...|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{complexity}} theory {{to examine the}} space of the street. In a morpho-ecological city, process creates form just as form creates process. The process of movement is a critical form generator within the urban system. In this thesis, the urban system comprising streets/ car/pedestrian is examined. If this collection of urban modes of mobility is a complex system capable of selforganising behaviour, what effect does the ordering imposed by traffic engineering have on this system? I look at the driving body and the walking body as co-creating the city by their movement through urban space. I suggest that, through attention to the fragments of interactions enacted during these movements, we can, through design, allow for the emergence of selforganising behaviour. Urban <b>shared</b> <b>streets,</b> descendants of the ‘woonerf’, appear to function more efficiently than engineered streets, without the usual traffic ordering. The counterintuitive success of these streets implies a self-organising behaviour that is generated by the density of interaction between the inhabitants of the street. These designs potentially work as a change agent, a catalyst, operating within a complex system. This has the potential to move systems from one attractor state to another. A city built with these spaces becomes a city of enfilades; an open system of spaces that are adaptable to uses that fluctuate with time and avoid thickening the palimpsest of traffic engineering. I look at siting <b>shared</b> <b>streets</b> in Wellington, based on jaywalking, a transgressive use of the streetspace that prefigures a shared space, and changes to urban networks associated with such designs. Interaction within the city is a creative force with a structure. City design needs to consider and address this infrastructure and design for it. The infrastructure of interaction has been subsumed by the infrastructure of movement. <b>Shared</b> <b>streets</b> indicate there may not be a need for this – they can be integrated. The process of movement creates instances of interaction; therefore designing spaces of/for movement must be designed to enhance the infrastructure of interaction. The result of such interaction is not just somewhat better; it may be a phase change - catalytically better...|$|R

40|$|Shared space, or shared streets, is {{an urban}} design {{approach}} encouraging pedestrians and drivers {{to share a}} common surface by minimizing segregation features. Advocates contend that the concept generates extensive social, cultural and economic benefits. Scholarship investigating schemes and purported benefits have been limited primarily to European and New Zealand applications. Identifying the need to study shared space operations in the Canadian context, this research offers a quantitative evaluation of road user behaviour and <b>shared</b> <b>street</b> performance on Granville Island in Vancouver, Canada. Utilizing video survey, data was collected at three diverse sample sites between December 2015 and February 2016. Data was analyzed using univariate and bivariate statistical analysis and overall shared space performance was quantified using the Karndacharuk (2014) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) index. The behavioural analysis revealed {{that the majority of}} pedestrian movements transpired outside the vehicle path and road space. Contiguous land uses were an important predictor of road user behaviour, as higher frequencies of pedestrians crossing the vehicle path were positively correlated with higher densities of commercial uses. Regression analysis calculated that vehicle path crossings were also a statistically significant predictor of vehicle speeds and interaction occurrences with vehicles. During interaction occurrences with vehicles, pedestrians were deemed to have priority. Regarding shared space performance, Granville Island managed both pedestrian and driver mobility effectively. Calculated performance in the Place function was substandard, as shared space design failed to inspire pedestrian reclamation of the street space. A key finding, the AHP index was recalibrated, enabling a custom, quantitative evaluation of pedestrian reclamation of road space on Granville Island. Results corroborated the importance of local traffic conditions noted in shared space literature. Future research should be undertaken to study the qualitative aspects of shared space on Granville Island, as well as an appraisal of street performance and road user behaviour under disparate conditions...|$|E
40|$|Walking is {{the main}} mode of {{transportation}} {{for many of the}} world’s people, particularly those in cities of the majority world. In the metropolitan region of Jakarta, walking in the public realm constitutes the main transportation mode for almost 40 percent of trips—a massive contribution to urban mobility. On the other hand, there is no comprehensive planning for pedestrians in an analogous manner to other modes of transportation. Pedestrian facilities are often dilapidated, damaged, dangerous, or missing completely. Additionally, there is no process for assessing the inventory of pedestrian facilities, planning pedestrian facilities at a region-wide level, or even identifying the location of vernacular pedestrian routes in low-income and informal areas. Provincial pedestrian planning focuses on piecemeal, symbolic spaces such as monumental plazas that serve the nation-building project, but overlooks the functional network of routes that address the daily needs of the city’s residents. This dissertation examines the issue of walkability planning in Jakarta by investigating what matters to pedestrians and how pedestrian space is produced. The research employs mixed methods, including pedestrian network groundtruthing, structured streetscape observations, multimodal traffic counts, pedestrian activity mapping, pedestrian surveys and interviews with policy-makers. Data is analyzed through a combination of in-depth qualitative analysis as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Based on this research, six key elements of walkability planning are proposed for Jakarta: multidisciplinarity, ethnography, accessibility, legibility, integrated activity, and shared streets. A literature review of walkability metrics reveals that walking is a highly multidisciplinary activity, with very different metrics emerging from different fields. In order to effectively encourage pedestrian activity, new multidisciplinary metrics should integrate the perspectives of all of these related disciplines and pedestrian planning should occur through inter-agency coordination. In Jakarta, interviews with policy-makers suggested that pedestrian planning is hindered by {{the fact that there is}} no lead agency for pedestrian planning, and there is a lack of cooperation between the different agencies that plan and produce urban public space. Pedestrian planning is also hindered by a discursive framework that is both modally and geographically biased—favoring motorized, long-distance modes of transportation and employing method derived from a Western research and planning norms. In order to overcome this discursive bias, ethnography should become a standard part of urban research, planning and design. The need for ethnography and qualitative analysis was made visible by the mismatch between standard transportation terminology, and prevailing practices observed in pedestrian mapping exercises and raised by pedestrians in on-the street interviews. For example, standard survey categories do not account for informal or integrated activity patterns like mobile street vending. From surveys conducted with mobile street vendors, it was difficult to separate their pedestrian activities into categories of travel from home to work, business-related travel, and visiting friends and relatives. In fact, it was difficult to even separate their travel from their activities since many vendors carried out business as they made their way through the neighborhood. With a large portion of the population engaged in the informal sector, the discrepancy between assumed and actual behavior severely compromises the quality of transportation-related research that is conducted in Jakarta and many other majority world cities. Ethnographic and qualitative research methods may therefore assist in producing more context-sensitive planning data and outcomes. These context-sensitive methods could include new analytical methods that focus on integrated activity, rather than trip-based or activity-based analysis. In relation to pedestrian activity, context-sensitive planning encompasses new approaches to accessibility that combine the notion of transportation accessibility with disabled access and universal access standards. The need for such an approach was revealed during interviews with policy-makers, who described accessibility in terms of market goods rather than human rights. Within the market for urban public space, ordinary pedestrians were unable to compete with other modes of transportation; within the market for urban impressions, ordinary pedestrian spaces were outcompeted by prominent, symbolic spaces; and within the market for cultural capital, ordinary pedestrians were excluded from planning processes because even the discourse of pedestrian planning was inaccessible to regular residents. In response to this problem of exclusion, integrated accessibility may facilitate inclusion in both planning processes and urban spaces within the city. In particular, integrated accessibility would aim to provide comprehensive routes of travel for all pedestrians, rather than isolated pockets of so-called accessible (yet unreachable) facilities. More context sensitive planning would also be facilitated through greater legibility of fine-grained and vernacular pedestrian networks that were missing from standard planning maps. These fine-grained networks represent highly connected facilities that serve much of Jakarta’s pedestrian transportation task. While the current synoptic illegibility of these areas may conveniently allow some communities to avoid state intrusion, it also means that low-income populations are chronically under-served with respect to basic urban planning and services. Increased legibility therefore allows for improvement and maintenance of urban systems like safe, functional pedestrian networks, and it may also play a role in increasing tenure security for Jakarta’s significant floating population. In many of these vernacular spaces, new street design approaches would also benefit pedestrians, who tend to use the streets as shared spaces, rather than spaces that are rigidly segregated by mode. Pedestrian activity mapping revealed that only an overwhelming majority of pedestrians used streets as hybrid spaces, with activity types falling into the categories of surface sensitive, risk-averse, distance-minimizing and stationary pedestrians. More realistic <b>shared</b> <b>street</b> designs would therefore accommodate —rather than ignore—the types of activities that occur along Jakartan streets. Design standards for “great streets” in Jakarta would also emphasize the safe sharing of streets through self-enforcing approaches to speed limits, and the integration of various urban elements like drainage, mobility and public-private interaction. While walkability planning in Jakarta displays many “wicked problem” features, there is much that can be done to improve, if not resolve, conditions for pedestrians within the region. Recommended strategies for walkability planning in Jakarta include a regional walkability plan and environmental policy developed using participatory planning, reformed governance and institutional arrangements, and a constituency building approach. The strategies also include expansion of road designations and an integrated accessibility strategy that draws upon new data sources from a WikiPlaces network map, an integrated activity study and pedestrian network cost-benefit analysis. In addition to Jakarta specific proposals, a number of proposals are made to advance discourse on walkability more generally. These approaches include decentered analysis of integrated activity, informal economic activity analysis, vernacular placemaking and Asian <b>shared</b> <b>street</b> design. Pedestrians and pedestrian plans traverse diverse physical, administrative and disciplinary spaces in cities of the world. Integrated and multidisciplinary approaches are therefore required to understand and accommodate these key users of public space. In Jakarta, walkability planning has potential to improve urban transportation efficiency while contributing to traffic safety, economic vitality, environmental quality and democratic governance. Successful walkability planning in Jakarta may also provide a model for planning in other cities where Western models of planning are unrealistic, inequitable and inappropriate. Jakartan lessons on walkability planning are particularly relevant, and improvements in walkability are particularly powerful, for cities characterized by relatively low median incomes, high land use densities, a substantial informal sector, rapid urbanization and rapid motorization. By improving walkability planning in Jakarta and other cities of the majority world, policy-makers and planners can move toward more sustainable, socially equitable and efficient cities...|$|E
40|$|Through {{government}} policy and contextual circumstances, traffic engineers {{are given the}} sole responsibility in street design. Their priority on safe and efficient automotive transportation has, however, ignored the equally important pedestrian priority. Recognizing the disconnect transportation planners are working towards experimental methods to reduce traffic fatalities and be sensitive to community concerns and needs. Studies show, though, that over many years traffic fatalities are leveling off, signaling a realization that fatalities will not continue to decrease without completely separating the pedestrian from the street. Streets, as the primary public space to the built form, also serve our collective memories as social, political, psychological, and environmental anchors that support and sustain our culture and society. Hence, a fully segregated vehicular and pedestrian system {{will be unable to}} serve these equally important functions. Shared Space serves as a viable solution to this dilemma. By creating pedestrian-priority streets, Shared Space will improve the ills that broad stroke transportation engineering and planning has created and fulfill the psychological and physical needs of the community. Also known as Naked Streets, Home Zones, Living Streets, and Woonerf Streets Shared Space is successfully used in Europe, Israel, and Japan, just to name a few. Shared Space is a public space where people, bicycles, and automobiles share a common right-ofway. Elements of pedestrian-vehicular separation are removed and features such as landscape and paving are introduced to psychologically calm the speed of vehicular traffic. The result Abstract 10 is a significant reduction of pedestrian injuries and fatalities therefore encouraging a sustained civic, social, and economic presence on the public street. Shared Space functions by employing a psychological theory called “risk compensation” or “risk homeostasis”. Risk compensation occurs when humans – or animals – change their behavior when there is a perceived change in risk. Designing Shared Spaces in important public right-of-ways will give Honolulu a new vision for urban street life. The project is conducted in three parts. The first part is background and precedent analysis research. Looking at six precedents of Shared Space streets in North America and Europe, the case studies, which varied in location, time, and size, reveals seven commonalities, or principles, that establish the makings of a successful Shared Space. These principles became the comparative framework of evaluating land use and transportation infrastructure for ten neighborhood centers in Honolulu’s central and eastern primary urban core, the best candidate of which would be used to create a Shared Space urban design concept. As a source of numerous cultural and physical opportunities, Pauahi Street in Chinatown Honolulu was chosen. The second part of the research creates a visual design framework to form an ideal Shared Space environment {{based on the premise that}} all pedestrian activities take place only when the conditions for looking, walking, crossing, standing, and talking are good. The framework, therefore, establishes a rationale, priority, and suggestion for preferred street design solutions to make Pauahi Street a successful Shared Space and neighborhood center. The third part is a conceptual Shared Space design proposal for Pauahi Street. To support the design the research analysis was undertaken which analyzed existing street life, transportation, and conducted interviews with stakeholders. The design proposes an urban design framework that creates seven shared space street and intersection typologies that support the strengths and address the challenges of Pauahi Street’s unique context. The concept and ideas are supported by <b>shared</b> <b>street</b> activity pattern diagrams, street sections, and vignettes to give the reader an idea of what a Shared Space life would be like on Pauahi Street. The result is an urban design framework for designing a Shared Space and an urban design concept for Pauahi Street. The intended audiences for this research reach a large number of people from a variety of backgrounds. Anyone who has an interest in supporting, designing, or planning future and existing communities and their centers in Chinatown, Honolulu, or the United States can gain from this work. Although the research and framework focuses on Honolulu, its concepts and design framework can be applied to many communities, streets, and urban centers looking to redefine street design and its beneficial properties to their community...|$|E
