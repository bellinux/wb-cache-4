40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{laboratory}} study was to evaluate the properties of high performance porous concrete. It required no special vibration equipment and curing. The optimum mixture proportions {{were used in the}} preparation of high performance porous concretes containing three sizes of coarse aggregates with appropriate amount of high water-reducing and thickening (cohesive) agents. Tests carried out on this concrete were: slump, slump-flow, void ratio, and coefficient of permeability, compressive and flexural strengths, and strength development rate. Furthermore, a test was proposed {{to determine the effects of}} high water-reducing and thickening (cohesive) agents on <b>self-compaction</b> of high performance porous concrete. It was meant to evaluate its hardened properties from the viewpoint of practical application. Its strength development rate was also examined at curing age of 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days at 20 °C and 60 % relative humidity (R. H.). Consequently, high performance porous concrete exhibited good workability and cohesiveness with no segregation or bleeding, and developed high strength compared to conventional porous concrete. The results of proposed <b>self-compaction</b> test for this porous concrete also showed good workability and cohesiveness without any special compaction or vibration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter {{observations}} of the topography and mass of layered deposits in the north polar region of Mars suggest a density of about 1 gm/cu cm. Consideration of the <b>self-compaction</b> of these deposits further suggests that this low density cannot be explained by a high porosity sediment. Rather, a significant component of ice is probably required {{to account for the}} low value. The density further implies that the silicate fraction, regardless of its density (i. e., its composition), represents a volumetrically almost negligible component of the deposit. The most likely values, 5 percent silicate dust and 95 percent ice, agree well with a theoretical model for the formation of the deposits through cyclic incorporation of the perennial polar ice cap. Additional tests of this model may be posed in advance of future spacecraft missions to Mars...|$|E
40|$|Cold and Half warm mixes (HWMA) using asphalt {{emulsions}} assure significant benefits because {{mixing and}} placement are completed at lower temperatures thus implying energy savings, reduced {{aging of the}} asphalt binder, fumes and odors. Notwithstanding the professed environmental benefits, cold and half-warm mixes using asphalt emulsions have exhibited unsuccessful practices generally showing poor mechanical performance and relatively short fatigue life. The present study aimed to improve the mechanical characteristics and durability of cold and half-warm mixes evaluating the benefits eventually provided by reinforced fibers. In particular, the study evaluated the influence of reinforced fibers on <b>self-compaction</b> and workability, volumetric properties, and mechanical (elastic stiffness at several testing temperatures, and indirect tensile stress) characteristics on bituminous emulsions-based mixes containing up to 75 % by weight of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material. Results showed that the tested enhanced material could be a valuable and sustainable material to be adopted in road construction sites, especially as a pavement base layer...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} aerated lightweight concrete (FALC) {{was developed}} to reduce concrete's density and to improve its fire resistance, thermal conductivity, and energy absorption. Compression tests were performed to determine basic properties of FALC. The primary independent variables were the types and volume fraction of fibers, {{and the amount of}} air in the concrete. Polypropylene and carbon fibers were investigated at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 % volume ratios. The lightweight aggregate used was made of expanded clay. A <b>self-compaction</b> agent was used to reduce the water-cement ratio and keep good workability. A surfactant was also added to introduce air into the concrete. This study provides basic information regarding the mechanical properties of FALC and compares FALC with fiber reinforced lightweight concrete. The properties investigated include the unit weight, uniaxial compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and toughness index. Based on the properties, a stress-strain prediction model was proposed. It was demonstrated that the proposed model accurately predicts the stress-strain behavior of FALC...|$|E
40|$|Self-compacting {{concrete}} (SCC), which flows {{under its}} own weight and doesn’t require any external vibration for compaction, has revolutionized concrete placement. Such concrete should have relatively low yield value to ensure high flow ability, a moderate viscosity to resists segregation and bleeding and must maintain its homogeneity during transportation, placing and curing to ensure adequate structural performance and long term durability. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) {{can be defined as}} a fresh concrete which possesses superior flow ability under maintained stability (i. e. no segregation) thus allowing <b>self-compaction</b> that is, material consolidation without addition of energy. Self-compacting concrete is a fluid mixture suitable for placing in structures with Congested reinforcement without vibration and it helps in achieving higher quality of surface finishes.

40|$|Over the centuries, {{concrete}} {{is commonly}} {{been used in}} construction world due to its properties. From the conventional concrete until the concrete that has been diversify with innovations, the usefulness is still the same, which is as building materials. One of the innovations called <b>Self-Compaction</b> Concrete (SCC). SCC {{is a type of}} concrete that does not require any mechanical compaction at all. This type of concrete will leveled and compacted under its selfweight. Such concrete will accelerate the placement, reduce the labor requirements needed for consolidation, finishing and eliminate environmental pollution. In terms of sustainability, previous researchers have recycled so many waste in SCC for example coal ash, silica fume, hydraulic lime, rice husk ash and fine limestone powder. Recently, recycling fly ash and bottom ash in SCC has grasped the attention of researchers as it demonstrated promising results. Furthermore, previous investigations already confirmed the potential of fly ash and bottom ash in replacing aggregates in SCC represents a better option than landfill {{and at the same time}} will decrease pollution problem especially in coal combustion area.

40|$|As {{structures}} become larger, taller, {{and more}} diverse, {{a high degree}} of technology and expertise are required in the construction industry. However, it has been becoming difficult to construct under severe conditions and to fulfill the high performance needs of structures {{due to a lack of}} skilled construction engineers. To compensate for these weak points, high-performance concrete and performance specifications have been developed. The application of reliable high-fluidity concrete, which is one of these efforts, is expected to be effective in terms of overcoming severe conditions, reducing the number of workers required, and shortening the construction period. In order to apply high fluidity concrete in the field, practical mock-up tests were carried out to estimate whether <b>self-compaction</b> concrete could satisfy constructability needs. From the results, it was verified that the multi-component high fluidity concrete has excellent flowability in practical structures. In addition, it was shown that the temperature distribution in the concrete due to hydration heat is satisfactory. As a result, it is judged that multi-component high fluidity concrete can be utilized as an effective building material for various structures, including structures related to the electric powe...|$|E
40|$|Controlled Low-Strength Materials (CLSMs), are {{cementitious}} mortars used {{in several}} civil engineering applications. In Italy, they are mainly used for utility bedding and trench filling under road pavements. They are self-compacting cement mixtures capable of reaching a bearing capacity and strength {{comparable to that}} of soils and granular materials currently used for the same applications. In the paper, the authors show the results obtained from an experimental investigation aimed at the generation of new CLSM formulations to replace those currently used. These mixtures displayed the following properties: (a) <b>self-compaction,</b> (b) ability to quickly develop the required mechanical performance, (c) easy removability and possibility of re-use, (d) physical-chemical compatibility with materials derived from the recycling of industrial waste granular materials. The mixtures were tested at different intervals of the curing process in order to investigate their mechanical properties in the short, medium and long term. In particular, static triaxial tests were used to verify mechanical strength, while dynamic triaxial tests were e used to assess the stress strain response under moving traffic loads.

40|$|AbstractAs known, with {{addition}} of fibers to concrete, {{the properties of}} concrete are altered. Steel fiber {{is one of the}} common fiber used in concrete. Using lightweight concrete is extremely important for reducing the self-weight of structures, especially in heavy ones, like high rise buildings. It enables to decrease additional loads in case of renovation or/strengthening of existing structures. Moreover, <b>self-compaction</b> avoids using vibrations for compaction of concrete in existing structures. Therefore the present study is aimed at investigating the effect of change in micro steel fiber content on the properties of high strength steel fiber reinforced lightweight self-compacting (HSLSCC). For this reason slump flow test was conducted to find workability of the fresh concrete mixture. Further compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and flexural strength of the hardened concrete were tested. Four concrete mixes of HSLSCC with different fiber contents were prepared to study the change in its fresh and hardened properties. Results show that there is strong influence on workability of SCC with steel fiber content of 1 % or more. There is around 7 % reduction in compressive strength, 18 % and 70 % increase in splitting tensile strength and flexural strength respectively, with increase of steel fiber content from 0. 5 % to 1. 25 %, while the modulus of elasticity remains almost the same...|$|E
40|$|Construction waste {{contributes}} 40 % {{of waste}} sent to landfill. This {{will cause the}} lack of land to be as landfill. Moreover, the lack of natural resource also can cause environmental problems. As solutions, this experiment was conducted to reuse and recycle the construction waste as materials in grouting. The experiment was conducted by crushing the concrete waste, sieving and use only the Crushed Concrete Waste Aggregate (CCwA) debris only as fine aggregate replacement. The 36 of cubes and 24 beams were prepared to be tested on 7 days and 28 days under compression and flexural load. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the optimum workability, compressive strength and flexural strength of grouting and compared it with control sample which used Natural Sand. The research was conducted by using 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 and 0. 9 water cement ratio to find the optimum workability, compressive and flexural strength. Then, 0. 7 water cement ratio samples were compared with control sample. As a result, the workability of the CCwA debris has greater <b>self-compaction</b> and better fluidity. Despite, the compressive and flexural strength of CCwA debris has slightly lesser than control sample. However, the different was not significant since the difference was 4. 5 % and 1. 49 % only for compressive and flexural strength respectively. So, the CCwA debris can replace natural sand to solve environmental problems but it must be modified first such as add up admixture or super plasticizers so that it can increase the strength. Last but not least, the objective to get grade 30 grouting by using CCwA debris does not achieve...|$|E
40|$|Subject: {{nowadays}} self-compacting concretes (SCC), the use {{of which}} requires no additional compaction, have become widespread for use in densely-reinforced structures and hard-to-reach places. In self-compacting concretes, finely-ground admixtures-microfillers are widely used for controlling technological properties. Their introduction into the concrete mix allows us to obtain more dense structure of concrete. The influence of micro-fillers on water consumption and plasticity of concrete mix, on kinetics of strength gain rate, heat release and corrosion resistance is also noticeable. Research objectives: the work focuses {{on the development of}} composition of self-compacting concrete with assigned properties with {{the use of}} fly ash based on coal burning waste, optimized with the help of experimental design method in order to clarify the influence of ash and cement quantity, sand size on strength properties. Materials and methods: pure Portland cement CEM I 42. 5 N was used as a binder. Crushed granite of fraction 5 … 20 mm was used as coarse aggregate, coarse quartz sand with the fineness modulus of 2. 6 and fine sand with the fineness modulus of 1. 4 were used as fillers. A superplasticizer BASF-Master Glenium 115 was used as a plasticizing admixture. The fly ash from Cherepetskaya thermal power plant was used as a filler. The study of strength and technological properties of self-compacting concrete was performed by using standard methods. Results: we obtained three-factor quadratic dependence of strength properties on the content of ash, cement and fraction of fine filler in the mix of fine fillers. Conclusions: introduction of micro-filler admixture based on the fly ash allowed us to obtain a concrete mix with high mobility, fluidity and <b>self-compaction</b> property. The obtained concrete has high strength characteristics, delayed strength gain rate due to replacement of part of the binder with ash. Introduction of the fly ash increases degree of hydration of Portland cement due to the greater water retention capacity, and also contributes to reduction in total capillary porosity of SCC structure...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of carboxylic corrosion inhibitor in fly ash and silica fume (respectively FM and SM) samples and nitrite-based corrosion inhibitors in fly ash (FGC) sample. The findings from this research show that {{the addition of the}} carboxylic inhibitor altered the hydration of fly ash and silica fume <b>self-compaction</b> concretes (SCCs) by delaying the formation of ettrngite and the production of portlandite in the FM and SM samples and ultimately causing the calcium aluminate hydrates to surround the fly ash and cement particles. It was shown that this resulted in slight setting retardation in the silica fume particles but significant delay in the hydration of the fly ash SCC. Further, this development brought about by the use of the carboxylic inhibitor contributed bleeding of different levels in the fly ash and silica fume samples and this condition was shown to increase the heterogeneity of the FM and SM SCCs. Although addition of the nitrite-based inhibitor retarded the setting of paste of the fly ash SCC, no noticeable delay in the hardening of the concrete was manifested. When the nitrite-based inhibitor was included in the fly ash SCC, the physical structure of the interfacial transition zone and the bulk of the mortar were found to be less porous and hence the concrete displayed a higher level of homogeneity. The incorporation of the carboxylic inhibitor increased the corrosion resistance of the silica fume concrete to chloride -induced corrosion but the corrosion resistance of the fly ash SCC was only improved when exposed to low concentration of chloride ions. The reduction in the inhibiting capacity of the FM SCC to high chloride load {{was the result of the}} elevated degree of porosity and higher propensity to chloride migration resulting from the use of the carboxylic compound. On the other hand, when the nitrite compound was used in the fly ash SCC, the current density was reduced which is ascribed to the effectiveness of the inhibitor and the reduction in the porosity and chloride migration that resulted from the incorporation of the inorganic compound. However, as the concentration of the corrosion inhibitors increased, the corrosion resistance of the inhibited SSCs reduced. The study also shows that the nitrite fly ash see showed the ability to undergo self-healing of corroded reinforced concrete but the carboxylic inhibited types of SCCs (FM and SM) could only prevent further corrosion after the corrosive environment is removed. Comparative testing showed that, in all three types of inhibited SCCs, there is a high probability that the inhibiting capacity will become depleted under certain conditions of chloride exposure. Using the nitrite inhibitor in the fly ash SCC also imparted moderate to significant improvement to the 7 - 60 -day compressive strengths but the long term strength of the concrete was slightly lower than that of the traditional fly ash SCC. When the carboxylic compound was used in the fly ash SCC, the 7 - 28 -day compressive strengths were marginally lowered and the 60 - 90 -day compressive strengths were profoundly reduced. The addition of the carboxylic inhibitor to the silica fume SCC also significantly reduced the 28 - 90 -day compressive strengths of the concrete...|$|E
