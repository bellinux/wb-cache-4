40|$|It {{is assumed}} that heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) is the recording technique of the future. For pure hard magnetic grains in high density media with an average diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm the switching probability is not sufficiently high for the use in bit-patterned media. Using a bilayer structure with 50 % hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with low Curie temperature and 50 % <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with high Curie temperature to obtain more than 99. 2 % switching probability, leads to very large jitter. We propose an optimized material composition to reach a switching probability of P_switch> 99. 2 % and simultaneously achieve the narrow transition jitter of pure hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>material.</b> Simulations with a continuous laser spot were performed with the atomistic simulation program VAMPIRE for a single cylindrical recording grain with a diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm. Different configurations of <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> and different amounts of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> were tested and discussed. Within our analysis, a composition with 20 % <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> and 80 % hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> reaches the best results with a switching probability P_switch> 99. 2 %, an off-track jitter parameter σ_off, 80 / 20 = 14. 2 K and a down-track jitter parameter σ_down, 80 / 20 = 0. 49 nm.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> field {{samples were}} placed into the {{homogenous}} magnetic field of an imager based on nuclear magnetic resonance. Several samples {{made of a}} <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> (cut from a data disc) were tested. Theoretical computations on a magnetic double layer were performed. For experimental verification an MRI 0. 178 Testa ESAOTE Opera imager was used. For our experiments a homogeneous circular holder (reference medium) - a container filled with doped water- was designed. The resultant image corresponds to the magnetic field variations {{in the vicinity of}} the samples. For data detection classical gradient-echo and spin-echo imaging methods, susceptible to magnetic field inhomogeneities, were used. Experiments proved that the proposed method is perspective for <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> testing using <b>magnetic</b> resonance imaging methods (MRI) ...|$|R
40|$|Implantable biosensors were {{developed}} for real-time monitoring of pressure and strain {{in the human}} body. The sensors, which are wireless and passive, consisted of a <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> and a permanent magnet. When exposed to a low frequency AC <b>magnetic</b> field, the <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> generated secondary <b>magnetic</b> fields that also included the higher-order harmonic modes. Parameters of interest were determined by measuring {{the changes in the}} pattern of these higher-order harmonic fields, which was achieved by changing the intensity of a DC magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. The DC magnetic field, or the biasing field, was altered by changing the separation distance between the <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> and the permanent magnet. For pressure monitoring, the permanent magnet was placed on the membrane of an airtight chamber. Changes in the ambient pressure deflected the membrane, altering the separation distance between the two magnetic elements and thus the higher-order harmonic fields. Similarly, the <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> and the permanent magnet were separated by a flexible substrate in the stress/strain sensor. Compressive and tensile forces flexed the substrate, changing the separation distance between the two elements and the higher-order harmonic fields. In the current study, both stress/strain and pressure sensors were fabricated and characterized. Good stability, linearity and repeatability of the sensors were demonstrated. This passive and wireless sensor technology may be useful for long term detection of physical quantities within the human body as a part of treatment assessment, disease diagnosis, or detection of biomedical implant failures...|$|R

40|$|In a {{conventional}} radial magnetic bearing, the rotor (<b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material)</b> {{can only have}} attraction force {{from one of the}} electromagnets in the stator. The stator electromagnets consist of small copper windings with a <b>soft</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> iron yoke. The maximum pressure obtainable is about 200 N/sq cm. It is shown that replacing the stator copper winding by a superconducting winding in the above configuration can increase the pressure to about 1000 N/sq cm. It is also shown that replacing the iron in the rotor by a group of superconducting windings in persistent mode and using a group of saddle coils in the stator can produce a pressure in excess of 2000 N/sq cm...|$|R
