The paper is laid out in sections. Firstly a general section deals with all common aspects relating to the activities of EFPRAmembers. Secondly, specific issues are discussed with regard to a) fat processing, b) animal by-products not intended for human consumption. Finally, a summary is given, which concludes that given the state of science today; a) the activities of EFPRAmembers are vital to the sustainable operation of the animal livestock-food chain and to the environment; b) the products from the industry may be regarded as safe if the following standards are applied  <b>safe</b> <b>sourcing,</b> safe processing, safe use; c) the application of these principles will allow the re-entry of certain products manufactured by EFPRA members into the food chain...|$|E

50|$|The {{proportion}} of carotenoids absorbed decreases as dietary intake increases. Within the intestinal wall (mucosa), β-carotene is partially converted into vitamin A (retinol) by an enzyme, dioxygenase. This mechanism is {{regulated by the}} individual's vitamin A status. If the body has enough vitamin A, the conversion of β-carotene decreases. Therefore, β-carotene is considered a <b>safe</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin A and high intakes will not lead to hypervitaminosis A.|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} has shown that {{irrespective}} of tissue type, the average depth and width of tissue damage with the application of PlasmaJetTM coagulator for 5  s at a low power of 20 % is 0.62 and 4.24  mm, respectively. It therefore appears to be a safe method of coagulation at 20 % power on gynaecological tissues. This implies an ideal <b>safe</b> <b>source</b> of energy for dealing with endometriotic deposits and adhesions. However, further research into different power settings at different duration of application is warranted in order to ensure its effective use in the treatment of deeper endometriotic nodules and tumour debulking procedures.|$|R

As global population increases the opportunities to increase seafood harvest are limited, therefore new alternate sources are required. Emerging sources include microalgae and under-utilized resources such as Southern Ocean krill. Prospects for new land plant sources of these unique and health-benefiting oils are also particularly promising, offering hope for alternate and sustainable supplies of these key oils, with resulting health, social, economic and environmental benefits...|$|R

The isolated collagenous materials were morphologically, physicochemically, and biophysically characterized. Using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy the fibrous morphology of the isolated collagens was confirmed, whereas the amino acid analysis, in conjunction with infrared spectroscopy studies, verified the characteristic for the collagen amino acid profile and its secondary structure.
