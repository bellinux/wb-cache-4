5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is {{the branch}} of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> and the raising of livestock.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{theorized that}} species {{flourish}} or die when {{subjected to the}} processes of natural selection or <b>selective</b> <b>breeding.</b> Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by <b>selective</b> <b>breeding.</b> This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Selective</b> plant <b>breeding</b> is {{also used}} in {{research}} to produce transgenic animals that breed [...] "true" [...] (i.e., are homozygous) for artificially inserted or deleted genes.|$|R
50|$|In <b>selective</b> {{livestock}} <b>breeding</b> cross-fostering {{can be used}} {{to combine}} desirable genetic qualities such as weight, fat distribution or appearance with environmentally influenced ones such as temperament.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{played a}} major role in the development of the breed, as large numbers of horses died from lack of food and exposure to the elements. Between 874 and 1300AD, during the more favorable climatic conditions of the medieval warm period, Icelandic breeders selectively bred horses according to special rules of color and conformation. From 1300 to 1900, <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> became less of a priority; the climate was often severe and many horses and people died. Between 1783 and 1784, around 70% of the horses in Iceland were killed by volcanic ash poisoning and starvation after the 1783 eruption of Lakagígar. The eruption lasted eight months, covered hundreds of square miles of land with lava, and rerouted or dried up several rivers. The population slowly recovered during the next hundred years, and from the beginning of the 20th century <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> again became important. The first Icelandic breed societies were established in 1904, and the first breed registry in Iceland was established in 1923.|$|E
5|$|OCD also {{is found}} in animals, and is of {{particular}} concern in horses, as {{there may be a}} hereditary component in some horse breeds. Feeding for forced growth and <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the German Shepherd—where it is a common primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium-large breeds.|$|E
5|$|Rare colours {{can appear}} {{unexpectedly}} in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> of very light golden strains, {{they can still}} appear very uncommonly to parents who are dark colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.|$|E
40|$|The {{antibody}} {{responsiveness to}} {{and the specific}} vaccination effect of rabies virus infection were investigated in high- and low-responder lines of mice produced by two-way <b>selective</b> <b>breedings</b> for quantitative production of antibodies to flagellar (H/f and L/f lines) or somatic (H/s and L/s lines) antigens of salmonellae. After specific immunization, both high lines were more resistant to rabies virus infection than were the low lines, and the protector effect {{was related to the}} level of antibody produced, as demonstrated by neutralizing serum activity. The present findings confirm the nonspecific genetic modification of the general antibody responsiveness induced in high- and low-responder lines selected for quantitative antibody production...|$|R
50|$|In the wild, ram fights occurs {{naturally}} as a bovine behaviour {{to settle}} dominance hierarchy — a contest for alpha male status among virile rams, by ramming their heads into others. Traditionally, the male aggressiveness {{is not a}} desirable quality among sheep husbandry, as the sheep farmers prefer a docile sheep and eliminate the aggressive ones through series of <b>selective</b> <b>breedings.</b> This is the main practice of sheep domestication over time. However, farmers and shepherds traditionally may take ram fighting as an occasional pastime or entertainment, and look for this behaviour as the sign of virility, health, and also good gene and immune system.|$|R

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.|$|E
5|$|Vinkeniers use {{a variety}} of methods to {{increase}} the number of calls in their birds. Techniques to develop singing aptitude include <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> programs, high-protein diets, and stimulating them with music and recordings of bird song. As wild finches generally begin singing during the spring mating season, keepers may also use artificial lights placed in aviaries to encourage increased song.|$|E
5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{very low}} {{prevalence}} and {{high standards of}} the breed organizations, kennels, and owners having {{a strong commitment to}} the health of the breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very <b>selective</b> in <b>breeding</b> dogs and are required to maintain OFA/Penn Hip, CERF, and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low.|$|R
50|$|According to C.W. Leadbeater, {{a colony}} will be {{established}} in Baja California by the Theosophical Society {{under the guidance of}} the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in the 28th century for the intensive <b>selective</b> eugenic <b>breeding</b> of the sixth root race. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu ("progenitor") of this new root race.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} grains {{goes back to}} the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago, when prehistoric {{communities}} started to make the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer. Modern varieties of grains have been developed over time through mutation, <b>selective</b> cropping, <b>breeding</b> and research in biotechnology. Ancient grains, however, are said to be largely unchanged from their initial domesticated varieties.|$|R
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and <b>selective</b> <b>breeding.</b> The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
5000|$|When the Chinese {{imported}} military {{horses and}} chariots from foreign [...] "horse riders", they concurrently introduced a complex equestrian culture, {{which resulted in}} new professions in fields such as horse domestication, <b>selective</b> horse <b>breeding</b> (as early as the 14th century BCE, Creel 1965:654), horse training, horse riding, horse tack, horse care, veterinary medicine, and horse shamanism.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selective</b> crop <b>breeding</b> {{was also}} employed. Corn is a {{domestic}} plant and cannot grow on its own. The first corn grown by Native Americans had small ears, and only produced a few kernels per ear. By 2,000 years ago, single stalks with large ears were being produced (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 55). Native Americans created over 700 varieties of corn by 1500 AD.|$|R
25|$|Dominance versus overdominance. In applied {{genetics}} (<b>selective</b> {{and agricultural}} <b>breeding),</b> this controversy has reflected the century-long {{debate over whether}} dominance or overdominance provides the best explanation for heterosis (hybrid vigor).|$|R
5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. <b>Selective</b> <b>breeding</b> for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} spaniel in Russia {{was a black}} Cocker Spaniel owned by hunting enthusiast Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. Because of its noble connections, spaniels of various breeds were imported to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Some were used for hunting, but the smaller spaniels were not of much use in Russian bird hunting due to the weather and terrain conditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> began for longer legged spaniels; specifically importing Springer Spaniels to create a rather mixed Russian Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The word spanyell {{is thought}} to date from the late 12th century when {{it was used to}} name a type of dog {{imported}} into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.|$|E
50|$|Black telescopes are {{descendants}} of type of wild carp known as Silver Prussian Carp or Gibel Carp, this fish {{is believed to}} originate from China in 1400s. In 1500s they were traded in Japan and lastly in 1800s {{they made their way}} to USA. It is widely accepted they were a result of <b>selective</b> fish <b>breeding</b> by Chinese who first called the Dragon Fish or Dragon Eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Plants grow well in sunny or {{partially}} sunny {{positions in}} well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals {{because of their}} leggy growth. The first year plant produces greenery, and bears flowers and seeds in its second year of growth. Afterwards, the plant dies like an annual. Because of <b>selective</b> human <b>breeding,</b> most garden pansies bloom the first year, some {{in as little as}} nine weeks after sowing.|$|R
50|$|The {{first steps}} toward the {{creation}} of CIMMYT were taken in 1943 when cooperative efforts of the Mexican government and the Rockefeller Foundation led to {{the founding of the}} Office of Special Studies, an organization within the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture, now known as the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food. SAGARPA website The goal of the office was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through <b>selective</b> plant <b>breeding</b> and crop improvement.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and standardized physical changes applied to rats through <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat, which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in <b>selective</b> <b>breeding,</b> with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} <b>selective</b> <b>breeding</b> by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the world}} of <b>selective</b> animal <b>breeding,</b> to [...] "breed true" [...] means that {{specimens}} of an animal breed will breed true-to-type when mated like-to-like; that is, that the progeny of any two individuals in the same breed will show consistent, replicable and predictable characteristics. A puppy from two purebred dogs of the same breed, for example, will exhibit the traits of its parents, and not the traits of all breeds in the subject breed's ancestry.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the breed}} organizations, {{responsible}} kennels, and owners having {{a strong commitment}} {{to the health of the}} breed, breed programs are overwhelmingly very <b>selective</b> in <b>breeding</b> dogs that are OFA/Penn Hip, CERF, and temperament clear. As a result, instances of congenital diseases and conditions are extremely low and any dog clearly showing physical or behavioral abnormalities shall be disqualified from the breeding program. The breed is robustly healthy with rare issues save dry skin in colder climates and water in its ears after swimming.|$|R
25|$|By the Song dynasty (960–1279), the <b>selective</b> {{domestic}} <b>breeding</b> of goldfish {{was firmly}} established. In 1162, the empress of the Song Dynasty ordered {{the construction of}} a pond to collect the red and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being the imperial colour. This is probably the reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed. The occurrence of other colours (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276.|$|R
