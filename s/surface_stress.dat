There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

Silver, zinc, and aluminum are known to grow whiskers under the influence of an electric field. Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow [...] "whiskers" [...] due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-Lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by the percentage Tin replaced.

40|$|International audienceBelow {{we discuss}} the {{derivation}} of the governing nonlinear shell equations {{taking into account the}} <b>surface</b> <b>stresses.</b> The <b>surface</b> effects are significant for the modeling of some structures as nanofilms, nanoporous materials and other nano-size structures. In particular, the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> are responsible for the size effect, i. e. dependence of the material properties on the specimen size. The theory of elasticity with <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> is applied to the modeling of shells with nano-scaled thickness. It will be shown that the resultant stress and couple stress tensors can be represented as a sum of two terms. The first term in the sum depends on the stress distribution in the bulk material while the second one relates to the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses.</b> Hence, the resultant stress and couple stress tensors are linear functions with respect to the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses.</b> As an example the effective stiffness properties of a linear elastic Cosserat shells taking into account the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|Many {{immersed}} boundary methods {{solve for}} <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> that impose the velocity boundary conditions on an immersed body. These <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> may contain spurious oscillations {{that make them}} ill-suited for representing the physical <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> on the body. Moreover, these inaccurate stresses often lead to unphysical oscillations {{in the history of}} integrated surface forces such as the coefficient of lift. While the errors in the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> and forces do not necessarily affect the convergence of the velocity field, it is desirable, especially in fluid-structure interaction problems, to obtain smooth and convergent stress distributions on the surface. To this end, we show that the equation for the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> is an integral equation of the first kind whose ill-posedness is the source of spurious oscillations in the stresses. We also demonstrate that for sufficiently smooth delta functions, the oscillations may be filtered out to obtain physically accurate <b>surface</b> <b>stresses.</b> The filtering is applied as a post-processing procedure, so that the convergence of the velocity field is unaffected. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by computing stresses and forces that converge to the physical stresses and forces for several test problems...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} the {{variation of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> according to uniaxial and biaxial strains in face-centered cubic (FCC) metals. In our study, three mainly observed free surfaces of seven representative FCC metals are considered. Employed method is molecular mechanics, in which the interaction of atoms is described by empirical interatomic potentials. As uniaxial strain increases to tensile direction, the <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> on { 100 } and { 110 } free surfaces decrease monotonously, while those on { 111 } surface increase. These tendencies are the same regardless of the species of metals and interatomic potentials employed. However, when the system is under biaxial strain, <b>surface</b> <b>stresses</b> change different according to the surface directions, the species of metals, and even interatomic potentials. On { 100) and { 111 } surfaces, heavy metals (Pt, Au) show the opposite variation to light metals (Ni, Cu).

50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>stress</b> {{was first}} defined by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) {{as the amount}} of the {{reversible}} work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface. A suggestion is <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> define as association with the amount of the reversible work per unit area needed to elastically stretch a pre-existing surface instead of up definition. A similar term called “surface free energy”, which represents the excess free energy per unit area needed to create a new surface, is easily confused with “surface stress”. Although <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> and surface free energy of liquid-gas or liquid-liquid interface are the same, they are very different in solid-gas or solid-solid interface, which will be discussed in details later. Since both terms represent a force per unit length, they have been referred to as “surface tension”, which contributes further to the confusion in the literature.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} time, several {{experimental}} techniques to measure <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> of materials had been proposed. One was determining <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> by measuring curvature of a thin membrane {{of the material}} as it bends by gravitation through its own weight. This method {{turned out to be}} difficult since it requires a complete homogeneous single crystal surface. An alternative way to measure [...] <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> is to measure the elastic extension of the length of the thin wire under an applied force. However, this method had many limitations itself and wasn’t used popularly. While determination of the absolute <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> is still a challenge, the experimental technique to measure changes in the <b>surface</b> <b>stress</b> due to external interaction is well established using “cantilever bending method”. The principle of the measurement is shown in figure 2. In this case, stress of one surface is changed upon deposition of material which results the bending of the cantilever. The surface wants to expand creating a compressive stress. The radius of curvature R is measured as the change of the gap of a capacitor by [...] Figure 2b shows the two electrodes of the capacitor formed by the sample and a capacitor electrode c. The capacitor electrode is surrounded by a guard electrode in order to minimize the effects of stray capacitances. The sample b is clamped on one end in the sample holder a. The bending can also be measured with high sensitivity by deflection of the beam of a laser using a position sensitive detector. To use this method, it requires that the sample is thin enough.
