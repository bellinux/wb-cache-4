5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E
5|$|The work {{purchased}} by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
50|$|Unweighted <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> {{those where}} half of one's {{bodyweight}} is on each foot. Forward-weighted or backward-weighted stances place most {{of body weight}} on either the rear or the lead foot, respectively. Forward-weighted <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> more aggressive, allowing stronger punches and kicks because one's weight is already forward. Alternatively, backward-weighted <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> more defensive, allowing one to fall back more easily.|$|R
50|$|This {{refers to}} the bend in the knees and height {{relative}} to a normal standing position. Low <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> very powerful and assist delivery of power through the body to either the arms or the legs. High <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> more mobile and allow one to reposition rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> the two-point, three-point, and four-point.|$|R
5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

25|$|The {{popular media}} in New Zealand often give equal weight to those {{supporting}} {{anthropogenic climate change}} and those who deny it. This <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> {{out of step with}} the findings of the scientific community where the vast majority support the climate change scenarios.|$|E
50|$|One {{feature of}} <b>stances</b> <b>is</b> that <b>stances</b> {{which have the}} same {{equipment}} requirements can be swapped on the fly using the F5-F8 keys (alternatively, using the number keys 4-7). The musketeer's Standing Shot and Kneeling Shot <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> examples of this, {{as well as the}} fighter's Back Guard and High Guard stances.|$|R
50|$|This {{refers to}} the {{distance}} from the lead foot to the rear foot. Short stances make the user very agile, but can <b>be</b> unstable. Long <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> very stable, but this is at the expense of agility. Most <b>stances</b> <b>are</b> approximately as wide as the shoulders, though there is significant variation between styles.|$|R

25|$|The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada has {{permitted}} {{the blessing of}} same-sex unions since July 2011. The Lutheran Church–Canada does not permit the blessing of same-sex unions. The LC-C <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> consonant with that of its American sister church, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.|$|E
25|$|Searle briefly critiques one {{particular}} set of these rules: those of mathematical decision theory. He points out that its axioms require that anyone who valued a quarter and their life would, at some odds, bet their life for a quarter. Searle insists he would never take such a bet and believes that this <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> perfectly rational.|$|E
25|$|On the {{question}} of European integration, different views exist within the party. On the one hand, President Viktor Yanukovych, {{who is a member}} of the party, has repeatedly underlined his pro-European stances. On the other hand, experts have described the Party of Regions as eurosceptic. The Party's official <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> for increased European integration, but within a framework that is favorable to Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|Its <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> one of {{immediate}} peace, irrespective of national boundaries or other such outcomes. Party speakers do emphasise, though, that the SPGB {{is not a}} pacifist party, and would countenance force being used to defend a socialist revolution. They have been critical, also, of opponents of nuclear weapons such as CND {{on the grounds that}} opposing one type of weapon is insufficient compared to opposing the system that causes war.|$|E
25|$|Obama later {{referred}} to the Libya intervention when questioned about his worst mistake. Obama asserted {{that he had been}} reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice. Obama cited the lack of preparation the Administration had made for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya. However, Clinton's <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E

25|$|Their militant <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> {{increasingly}} {{coming under}} criticism from pupils, {{parents and the}} public alike. The number of pupils receiving ethnic education from Chongryon-affiliated schools has declined sharply in recent years, down to about 10,000 in 2009 {{from a high of}} 46,000 in the early 1970s, with many, if not most, Zainichi now opting {{to send their children to}} mainstream Japanese schools. As of March 2010, there were 12 Chosen high schools with an enrollment of about 2,000 students.|$|E
25|$|An {{anonymous}} EU official {{claimed that}} the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites {{in the event of}} a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces. The EU's <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> that Galileo is a neutral technology, available to all countries and everyone. At first, EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo, but have since reached the compromise that Galileo is to use a different frequency. This allowed the blocking or jamming of either GNSS without affecting the other.|$|E
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety as if he knows that he should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E

25|$|The taller {{of the two}} Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally {{over the}} figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay {{that was used to}} anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.|$|E
25|$|She was {{associated}} with young women and girls and biological maturation, and both Piraeus Artemis statues show the goddess as a curvaceous woman, not a wild young girl. The anger of the goddess was also feared and recounted in legends, {{and part of the}} worship consisted of appeasing the goddess. The statues convey this aspect; though in both depictions Artemis's <b>stance</b> <b>is</b> approachable, she carries her weapon, showing her ability to quickly withdraw favor. Often worshipped close to territorial frontiers and a little aways from settlements, female worshippers of Artemis were frequently in danger; a necessary aspect that came with worshipping the goddess.|$|E
25|$|It is vaguely quadrupedal, though {{capable of}} {{standing}} upright over short distances. The limbs are comparatively long and thin {{compared with the}} body core, and according to creator Neville Page, this, coupled with its quadrupedal <b>stance,</b> <b>is</b> meant to imply {{that it is a}} newborn: he speculates that the adults may be bipedal. The forelimbs are large in proportion to the body, and the hind legs stubby. The creature's head at first glance appears to be a solid sphere; but it can open its mouth extremely wide. Above the eyes {{on either side of the}} head are fleshy pouches which it inflates when agitated.|$|E
