40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} extended stochastic Petri nets {{to model}} wetlab experiments. The extentions include read and inhibitor arcs, stochastic transitions with freestyle rate functions {{as well as}} several deterministically timed transition types: immediate firing, determinis-tic <b>firing</b> delay, and <b>scheduled</b> <b>firing.</b> The extensions result into non-Markovian behaviour, which precludes analytical analysis approaches. But there are adapted stochastic simulation analysis (SSA) methods, ready to deal with the extended behaviour. Having the simulation traces, we apply simulative model checking of PLTL, a linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in a probabilistic setting. We present some typical model components, demonstrating the suit-ability of the introduced Petri net class for the envisaged application sce-nario. We conclude by looking briefly at a classical example of prokaryotic gene regulation, the lac operon case. ...|$|R

After a successful midcourse correction on 4 December, this spacecraft headed toward the Moon without any apparent problems.

50|$|The K9 Thunder saw {{the first}} combat during the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong on November 23, 2010. Six ROKMC howitzers engaged against the {{surprise}} attack from the North Korean artillery. Prior to the battle, the howitzers returned from a <b>scheduled</b> <b>firing</b> exercise, using most of the shells stored within the howitzer. In addition, one howitzer experienced a problem during the exercise that a shell became stuck in the barrel, disabling it. Two units received slight damage to their firing control systems during the initial North Korean attack, meaning only three out of the six units were able to counterattack. Eventually, the howitzer that had barrel problems joined the second counterattack after receiving field repairs. The K9s fought back in the ratio of shooting one shell every one minute and 30 seconds, because the marines had to carry the shells from the armory and manually load the howitzer under heavy fire after exhausting B/L rounds.|$|R

We present a branch and bound algorithm for the FSP with the objective of minimizing total threat of the targets, which is expressed as a function of the destruction probabilities of the targets. Results of computational tests show that the suggested algorithm solves problems of a medium size in a reasonable amount of computation time. Military Scheduling Branch and bound algorithm...|$|R

40|$|A {{low cost}} Cook-Off {{experimental}} facility {{has been established}} to provide a convenient method of ranking explosives in their response to Cook-Off by the time to event under two widely different heating rates and at two different scales. This thesis describes the literature review undertaken as preparation for the purposed study and all the experimental work developed comprising {{the design of the}} trials vehicles, the demonstration of their suitability for Fast and Slow Cook-Off trials with confined explosive systems, the preparation of the samples and test vehicles to be trialled as well as the set-up of adequate facilities to undertake the <b>scheduled</b> <b>firing</b> programme. Results are reported for Cook-Off tests on TNT, RDX, and their mixtures. The emphasis of the study is on time to event, and temperature at event, and in addition a qualitative assessment of the violence of the event was made by examination of the fragments of the vehicles, although it is accepted that the relatively light and low cost design of the vehicle may lead to variable confinement {{in the early stages of}} the explosive event, and hence to a wider spread of responses than would be obtained from a more heavily confined and more costly vehicle. The test vehicles give results, which differentiate between the various explosives and explosive mixtures trialled and between the scales. More experiments are required to establish the reproducibility of the measurements. The design of the equipment makes this a relatively inexpensive undertaking. The experiment was modelled using published kinetic data, but the calculated time to event differed from that observed to different extents at the two scales. It is hypothesised that the mechanism may change over the prolonged heat soaks and that quantitative scaling is not possible with the available information. Further work is also suggested using a different type of Cook-Off test vehicle, which will in our opinion reduce even further the cost of Cook-Off testing, due to reduction in man-hours of preparation involved and manufacture cost of the Cook-Off test vehicles, and consequently of ranking of explosives...|$|R

This paper continues a theme explored at the Boston 2005 conference, where a paper was presented that identified a common simulation problem, and presented solutions using both discrete event simulation and system dynamics. The benefit of this approach is that it can provide modellers from different methodological worldviews insights into how common problems may be addressed. The problem approached here is a one-actor model of the Beer Game. Two models are developed, detailed experimentation is performed, and overall results and conclusions presented. ...|$|R
