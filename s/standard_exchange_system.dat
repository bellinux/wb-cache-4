5000|$|The {{telex network}} is a {{switched}} network of teleprinters {{similar to a}} telephone network, {{for the purposes of}} sending text-based messages. The term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were formed starting in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from telegraph systems, and, like the telegraph, they used {{the presence or absence of}} a pre-defined level of current to represent the mark or space symbols. This is as opposed to the analog telephone system, which used differing voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling <b>standards,</b> <b>exchanges</b> and <b>system</b> of [...] "telex numbers" [...] (the counterpart of a telephone number). When telephone and telex exchange equipment was co-located, which was not uncommon, the different signalling systems would sometimes cause interference.|$|R

To evaluate our model, we calculate trading strategies in which an investor goes long or short in the currency depending on whether crash probabilities are low or high. When we estimate the model on part of the data and then use the parameter estimates to generate predictions {{for the remainder of the}} sample, we find that substantial profits may be made. Furthermore, the model correctly forecasts major crashes even on an out-of-sample basis.

40|$|Data {{interchange}} in {{the form}} of a <b>standard</b> <b>exchange</b> format(SEF) is only a first step towards tool interoperability. Inter-tool communication using files is slow and cumbersome; a better approach would be an application program interface, or API, that allowed tools to communicate with each other directly.

It presents high-level descriptions of three approaches to tool-totool APIs and illustrates how requirements for the SEF also apply to the API.
