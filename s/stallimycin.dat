40|$|Two {{potentially}} hydrophilic platinum (II) complexes 10 and 11 {{bound to}} the minor groove binder <b>stallimycin</b> (distamycin A, CAS 636 - 47 - 5) by L-cysteine and D,L- 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid have been synthesized. The in vitro cytotoxicity of both these complexes was evaluated against several cell lines. None of the synthesized platinum complexes showed greater activity than that of cisplatin (cis-DDP, 1) (CAS 15663 - 27 - 1). Interestingly, the free ligands 6 and 9 were more active than the related platinum complexes 10 and 11, resp., with respect to RAJI, CCRF-CEM and MOLT- 4 human leukemia cell line...|$|E
40|$|Derivs. I [R = H, X = NCN (3) or NOH (4); X = O, R = H (5) or Me (6) ] of <b>stallimycin</b> (distamycin A) {{modified}} at the C-terminal amidine moiety and {{tethered to}} a bis-epoxyethyl moiety (as DNA alkylating unit) at the N-terminal position have been prepd. and tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against two different leukemic cell lines, K 562 and L 1210. None of the compds. without epoxide was active. A {{comparison of the}} biol. activity related to the diepoxy compds. 3 - 6 with different non-basic amidine modified moieties, showed low activity for the carbamoyl and N-Me carbamoyl derivs. (compds. 5 and 6, resp.), moderate activity for the amidoxime analog 4, and good activity for the cyanamidine deriv. 3...|$|E
