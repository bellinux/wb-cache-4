40|$|Abridged) We {{conducted}} a Chandra ACIS {{observation of the}} nearby <b>Sculptor</b> Group <b>Sd</b> galaxy NGC 7793. At the assumed distance to NGC 7793 of 3. 91 Mpc, the limiting unabsorbed luminosity of the detected discrete X-ray sources (0. 2 - 10. 0 keV) is approximately 3 x 10 ^ 36 ergs s^- 1. A total of 22 discrete sources were detected at the 3 -sigma level or greater including one ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX). Based on multiwavelength comparisons, we identify X-ray sources coincident with one SNR, the candidate microquasar N 7793 -S 26, one HII region and two foreground Galactic stars. We also find that the X-ray counterpart to the candidate radio SNR R 3 is time-variable in its X-ray emission: we therefore {{rule out the possibility}} that this source is a single SNR. A marked asymmetry is seen in the distribution of the discrete sources with the majority lying in the eastern half of this galaxy. All of the sources were analyzed using quantiles to estimate spectral properties and spectra of the four brightest sources (including the ULX) were extracted and analyzed. We searched for time-variability in the X-ray emission of the detected discrete sources using our measured fluxes along with fluxes measured from prior Einstein and ROSAT observations. From this study, three discrete X-ray sources are established to be significantly variable. A spectral analysis of the galaxy's diffuse emission is characterized by a temperature of kT = 0. 19 - 0. 25 keV. The luminosity function of the discrete sources shows a slope with an absolute value of Gamma = - 0. 65 +/- 0. 11 if we exclude the ULX. If the ULX is included, the luminosity function has a long tail to high L_X with a poor-fitting slope of Gamma = - 0. 62 +/- 0. 2. The ULX-less slope is comparable to the slopes measured for the distributions of NGC 6946 and NGC 2403 but much shallower than the slopes measured for the distributions of IC 5332 and M 83.

N 7793 -S 26 's radio luminosity exceeds that of the Galactic SNR Cas A, and based on equipartition calculations we determine that an energy of at least 1052 ergs is required to maintain this source. Such a result argues for the source being created by multiple supernova explosions rather than by a single supernova event. A second optically identified SNR, N 7793 -S 11, has detectable radio emission but no detectable X-ray emission. A radio-selected sample of candidate SNRs has also been prepared by searching for coincidences between nonthermal radio sources and regions of Ha emission in this galaxy. This search has produced five new candidate radio SNRs {{to be added to the}} 28 SNRs that have already been detected by optical methods. A complementary search for new candidate X-ray SNRs has also been conducted by searching for soft-spectrum sources (kT < 1 keV) that are coincident with regions of Ha emission. That search has yielded a candidate X-ray SNR that is coincident with one (and possibly two) of the candidate radio SNRs, but considerable diffuse X-ray emission throughout the disk of NGC 7793 reduces the efficacy of the search. Like NGC 300, very little overlap in identifications is seen between the SNRs found through X-ray, optical, and radio methods, and such a result argues for the role played by distance-dependent selection effects in determining the detectability of SNRs. In addition, we find that the density of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding SNRs significantly impacts the spectral characteristics of the SNRs in this galaxy, consistent with surveys of the SNR populations in other galaxies...|$|R
40|$|This current {{research}} {{is focused on}} the mineralogical and petrographic characterisation of mortar-based materials from Villa San Marco in the ancient Stabiae (modern Castellammare di Stabia, Napoli), an outstanding example of Roman otium villae, and aims at recognising the technology used by the ancient skilled workers. Several analytical techniques were used such as digital videomicroscopy, optical microscopy, digital image analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS analysis and Quantitative Powder X-ray Diffraction. A multi-layer technology characterised the plasters; the scratch coat was made with lime mortars mixed with a pozzolanic lightweight aggregate and cocciopesto, required ingredients providing a quick-setting and a better adhesion with the support. As far as the arriccio layer is concerned, the mix-design is a lime mortar with volcanic sand as the aggregate and a minor content of pozzolan and/or cocciopesto to enhance the workability of the mortar in order to correct any error due to the roughness of the scratch coat. The <b>plaster</b> <b>s.</b> s. was the removable support in case of mistakes, and gave a lighter colour to the preparation layer of the frescoes. The last thin layer, prepared with lime mortars and a carbonate aggregate, is characterised by low porosity in order to avoid pigment adsorption. The painting technique was a fresco with encaustication. In contrast, the mortars of the building structures were made with lime added to a pozzolanic aggregate (volcanics and cocciopesto), giving a quick setting during the implementation of the yellow tuff opus reticulatum. The rudera and nuclei of the mosaics were built with abundant volcanic sand and cocciopesto mixed with the lime, producing a more resistant surface, and finally the tesserae were fixed exclusively with lime. The white and black colours of the mosaics were produced by local limestone and tephritic lava. The results permitted an evaluation of the high level of specialization of both the workers and the artists that built and decorated these maritime villas. Moreover, the collected data highlighted the wide potentiality of the materials cropping out in the environs of the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. This research aims at furnishing a useful reference for future restoration action in Villa San Marco and the other Roman villas in this area...|$|R
