5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} material used for ab anbars were very tough and extensively used a special mortar called sarooj {{which was made}} of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, depending on location and climate of the city. This mixture {{was thought to be}} completely water impenetrable. The walls of the storage were often 2 meters thick, and special bricks had to be used. These bricks were especially baked for ab anbars and were called Ajor Ab anbari. Some ab anbars were <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> they would be built underneath caravanserais such as the ab anbar of Haj Agha Ali in Kerman.

25|$|In less {{developed}} countries, some traditional fishing villages persist {{in ways that}} have changed little from earlier times. In more developed countries, traditional fishing villages are changing due to socioeconomic factors like industrial fishing and urbanization. Over time, some fishing villages outgrow their original function as artisanal fishing villages. Seven hundred years ago, Shanghai, beside the Yangtze River delta, was a small fishing village. In recent times, fishing villages have been increasingly targeted for tourist and leisure enterprises. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits can be big business these days, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned {{to take advantage of}} this. For example, Destin on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power. In 2004 China reported it had 8,048 fishing villages.|$|E

Ivar was killed on an campaign with King Harald Finehair, {{which resulted in the}} Norðreyar being gifted to his family as compensation. Hrólfr [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> no horse could carry him", hence his byname of [...] "Göngu-Hrólf" [...] ("Hrólf the Walker"), and he is identified by the saga writers with Rollo, ancestor of the Dukes of Normandy.

Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.|$|E

When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego is <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{said that}} he [...] "brought [...] back to a more story-oriented" [...] {{approach}} and increased the character and emotion focus, while [...] "at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird". During his tenure, Mirkin moved the show's focus towards Homer, and developed some of the secondary characters, such as Apu. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference. Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans, but the writing staff were divided on his style of humor, which saw the show move away from more [...] "realistic" [...] emotional and character based stories to [...] "pure comedy" [...] and [...] "surreal" [...] humor. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was controversial when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] of an idea and Groening felt that the idea was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go".|$|E

Pitchfork's Carrie Battam stated that the track's hook and production make the lyrics [...] "sound gracefully sad instead of tragic". In her review of Queen of the Clouds, Battam called it [...] "a big, sticky song, but not <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it stuns your senses or numbs you into enjoyment". [...] Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is [...] "so fun to listen to" [...] despite its sad themes. AllMusic's Heather Phares called it [...] "the Queen of the Cloudss standout track, while Sam Lansky of Idolator stated that it [...] "has {{a little of the}} texture of Kesha's no-fucks-given party-girl pop but with the languorous sadness of Robyn" [...] and that [...] "It'll get stuck in your head, which is right where it deserves to be."

500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{started off}} with [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] which {{was chosen as the}} season premiere because it guest starred George Harrison. The Fox {{executives}} had wanted to premiere with [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] because it was a National Lampoon's Animal House parody, but the writers felt [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] would be a better episode because of Harrison's involvement. Even though the episode aired during the beginning of the fifth season, [...] "Cape Feare" [...] was the last episode written by the original team of writers and guest starred Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob. Compared to previously produced episodes, the episode featured several elements that could be described as cartoonish. This was a result of the staff's careless attitude towards the end of season four as the majority of them were leaving which, combined with the shortness of the episode, {{led to the creation of}} the rake sequence, became a memorable moment for this episode. [...] "Cape Feare" [...] and [...] "Rosebud" [...] were both broadcast early in the season and are amongst the series' most acclaimed episodes, both having placed highly on Entertainment Weeklys list of the top 25 episodes. The episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] was the only episode to be written by David Mirkin and was controversial amongst the show's writing staff when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] of an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". As a result, every aspect of the show was worked on to make the concept work. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero. [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] was the series' 100th episode. It was chosen because it heavily featured Bart and was promoted as [...] "Bart's biggest prank ever," [...] even though Bart did not actually pull any pranks in the episode; rather, Bart accidentally let his dog loose, eventually resulting in Principal Skinner's firing. Cletus Spuckler and the Rich Texan were the only recurring characters to be introduced this season, first appearing in [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant", and [...] "$pringfield" [...] respectively. Other minor characters who first appeared this season were Luigi and Baby Gerald. Two more episodes, [...] "Bart of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] were produced as part of the season five (1F) production run, but both aired the following season.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>that</b> you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?
