5|$|Teller became {{controversial}} in 1954 when he testified against Oppenheimer at Oppenheimer's <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial {{he was the}} only member of the scientific community to state that Oppenheimer should not be granted <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|Strauss and Senator Brien McMahon, {{author of}} the 1946 McMahon Act, pushed Eisenhower to revoke Oppenheimer's <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b> On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> had been suspended, pending {{resolution}} {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, General Manager of the AEC. The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was initially confidential and not made public, focused on Oppenheimer's past Communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or Communist scientists. The US Department of Energy made public the full text of the transcript in October 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{loss of his}} <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> ended Oppenheimer's role in {{government}} and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first child}} Peter {{was born in}} May 1941, and their second child, Katherine ("Toni"), was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7, 1944.

Later their continued contact became an issue in his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> hearings because of Tatlock's Communist associations. Many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s. They included his brother Frank, Frank's wife Jackie, Kitty, Jean Tatlock, his landlady Mary Ellen Washburn, {{and several of his}} graduate students at Berkeley.|$|E

50|$|Breaches of <b>security</b> {{involving}} <b>security</b> <b>clearances</b> {{are often}} punished by specific statutory law, {{particularly if they}} occur {{in the context of}} deliberate espionage, whereas most other counterfeiting and misuse of credentials is punished by law only when used with deliberate intent to defraud in specific contexts. <b>Security</b> <b>clearances</b> are regularly withdrawn when they are no longer justified, or when the person holding them is determined to be too great a security risk.|$|R
40|$|As an {{essential}} part of a nation's financial sector infrastructure, <b>securities</b> <b>clearance,</b> and settlement systems must be closely integrated with national payment systems, so that safety, soundness, certainty, and efficiency can be achieved at a cost acceptable to all participants. Central banks have paid considerable attention to payment systems, but <b>securities</b> <b>clearance,</b> and settlement systems have only recently been subjected to rigorous assessment. The Western Hemisphere Payments and <b>Securities</b> <b>Clearance</b> and Settlement Initiative (WHI), led by the World Bank, and in cooperation with the Centro de Estudios Monetarios Latinoamericanos (CEMLA), gave the authors a unique opportunity to observe how various countries in Latin America, and the Caribbean undertake <b>securities</b> <b>clearance,</b> and settlement. To do so, the authors developed a practical, and implementable assessment methodology, covering key issues that affect the quality of such systems. In this paper they discuss the objectives, scope, and content of a typical securities system, identify the elements that influence the system's quality, and show how their assessment methodology works. They focus on the development of core principles, and minimum standards for integrated systems of payments, and <b>securities</b> <b>clearance</b> and settlement. Their paper fills a gap by providing an evaluation tool for assessors of such systems, especially those who must assess evolving systems in developing, and transition economies. Essentially, an assessment involves a structured analysis to answer four related questions: 1) What are the objective, and scope of a <b>securities</b> <b>clearance</b> and settlement system? 2) Who are the participants, what roles do they play, and what expectations do they have? 3) What procedures are required to satisfy the participants'needs? 4) What inherent risks are involved, and how can they be mitigated at an acceptable cost?Environmental Economics&Policies,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Financial Intermediation,International Terrorism&Counterterrorism,Securities Markets Policy&Regulation,Financial Intermediation,Environmental Economics&Policies,Settlement of Investment Disputes,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Insurance&Risk Mitigation...|$|R

5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his <b>security</b> <b>clearance</b> revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of the latter's <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b> Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greenglass married Ruth Printz in 1942, {{when she}} was 18 years old. The two joined the Young Communist League shortly before Greenglass entered the U.S. Army in April 1943. They had {{a son and a}} daughter. He worked as a {{machinist}} at Fort Ord, California, and then at the Mississippi Ordnance Plant in Jackson, Mississippi. In July 1944, Greenglass was assigned to the secret Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop the first atomic weapons. He was first stationed at the Clinton Engineer Works uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but was there for less than two weeks. In August 1944 he was sent to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico.

5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's <b>security</b> <b>clearance.</b> While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E
