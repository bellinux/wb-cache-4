5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis are a <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> fever of greater than , tonsillar exudates (pus on the tonsils), and large cervical lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{have experienced the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} an infection in the 3–6 weeks prior to the onset of the neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper respiratory tract infection (rhinitis, <b>sore</b> <b>throat)</b> or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a runny nose, nasal congestion and a <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E
25|$|The strict {{criteria}} are that children should have experienced 7 documented <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> {{in the previous}} year, or 5 {{each year in the}} two previous years, or 3 each year in the three previous years and that those documented <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> should in addition either have documented evidence of enlarged lymph glands, raised temperature, positive throat swabs (demonstrating Streptococcal infection) or pus seen on the tonsils. Children with undocumented <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> or <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> that are not as severe do not appear to suffer from as many <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> in subsequent years and therefore tonsillectomy is not worthwhile.|$|R
25|$|In {{children}} {{meeting the}} strict criteria for surgery, short term benefit means that without tonsillectomy {{a child who}} meets these strict criteria will probably have 6 <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> {{in the next two}} years while one who has surgery will probably have 3 <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b> After two years there is little difference in the frequency of <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{evidence indicates that}} tonsillectomy is on average only modestly effective at reducing the frequency and severity of <b>sore</b> <b>throats,</b> and does not get rid of <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> altogether. Benefits also appear to only last for a year after surgery.|$|R
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a microbial culture, whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E
5|$|Some advise {{to avoid}} {{physical}} exercise {{if there are}} symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E
40|$|From a {{retrospective}} study of hospital records, it is {{calculated that the}} present incidence of rheumatic fever in Scottish children is 0. 6 per 100 000 per year. This {{is in keeping with}} recent research from other developed communities. An attempt is made to assess the relative risk of developing rheumatic fever after antibiotic-treated streptococcal <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> and non-antibiotic-treated streptococcal <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b> The risk in both cases is low (probably in the order of 1 : 30 000) and {{there is no evidence that}} prescribing antibiotics for prodromal <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> confers benefit...|$|R
5000|$|From 1921 {{until the}} mid-1970s, Listerine was also marketed as {{preventive}} and remedy for colds and <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b> In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that Listerine had [...] "no efficacy" [...] at either preventing or alleviating {{the symptoms of}} <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and {{to include in the}} next $10.2 million worth of Listerine ads specific mention that [...] "Listerine will not help prevent colds or <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> or lessen their severity." [...] The advertisement run by Listerine added the preamble [...] "contrary to prior advertising".|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, Aborigines {{have used}} Phellinus fruit bodies medicinally. The smoke from burning fruit bodies was inhaled {{by those with}} <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b> Scrapings from {{slightly}} charred fruit bodies were drunk with water to treat coughing, <b>sore</b> <b>throats,</b> [...] "bad chests", fevers and diarrhoea. There is some uncertainty about which species of Phellinus were used.|$|R
5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups in}} the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have {{emphasized}} the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. <b>Sore</b> <b>Throat</b> cites Discharge, Disorder, {{and a variety of}} European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, Throbbing Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.|$|E

5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. Even {{in the absence of a}} local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E
5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace {{that had been}} used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from a <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E

5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, <b>sore</b> <b>throat,</b> hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

40|$|Pharyngeal {{micro-organisms}} of 131 Australian and Malaysian {{children and}} adults were compared by analysis of aerobic culture of throat swab specimens. Enteric Gram-negative bacilli were commonly isolated in small numbers from Malaysian adults whether they had <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> (28 %) or not (36 %), but were detected in only 9 % of Australian adults without <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> and in only 12 % and 4 % of Malaysian children with and without <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> respectively. In other respects microbiological findings were similar in the different groups of subjects studied. It is concluded that the pharyngeal carriage rate of enteric Gram-negative bacilli may differ substantially between different groups of normal individuals. Our findings also suggest that these micro-organisms {{do not have a}} pathogenic role in pharyngitis...|$|R

5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time Cochet {{was struggling with}} a shoulder injury. For the 50th anniversary of the Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a <b>sore</b> <b>throat</b> in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a <b>sore</b> <b>throat.</b> Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

To perform a comprehensive narrative {{review of the}} literature to provide {{a better understanding of the}} indi-cations, outcomes, and efficacy of tonsillectomy for recur-rent <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> in children. This article explores the reasons why there is a lack of robust clinical evidence for its efficacy despite good evidence of positive reported out-comes from parents of children who undergo the procedure. Data Sources. Articles published between 1960 and July 2013 were searched in PubMed and Cochrane databases. Review Methods. A narrative review method was adopted to provide a comprehensive overview of articles. Only individ-ual, interventional studies on children (0 - 16 years old) undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for recur-rent <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> with greater than 1 month of follow-up were included. Conclusions. The inclusion criteria and outcome measures in the studies were varied, but most investigated changes in symptoms related to <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> or illness episodes. Quality-of-life tools validated for measuring pediatric out-comes were used in a number of more recent studies. None of the outcome measures were specific for recurrent <b>sore</b> <b>throats</b> in children. No qualitative method designed studies were identified. Implications for Practice. The disparity between parental satis-faction rates and published clinical efficacy can be explained by a lack of parent/child outcome measures specific to ton-sillectomy for recurrent <b>sore</b> <b>throats.</b> A more parent/child-centered approach may establish what tonsillectomy could offer this group of children...|$|R
