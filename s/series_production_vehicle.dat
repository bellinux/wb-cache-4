50|$|In 1957, the VBZ {{received}} its first articulated trolleybus prototype, fleet no. 101. The VBZ's subsequent procurement of <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicles</b> between 1959 and 1964 included fleet nos. 102 to 133. Its second series of articulated vehicles, delivered in 1974/1975, consisted of fleet numbers 70-100, and was manufactured by FBW.|$|R
50|$|The {{articulated}} vehicles {{from the}} 1950s were replaced about 40 years {{later by the}} first series of the Mercedes-Benz O405 GTZ. These included the prototype, fleet no. 1 (built 1986), and the <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicles</b> nos. 2 to 36 (model years 1988 to 1989), {{all of which have}} since been retired and replaced by Hess low-floor vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1935 this vehicle was {{refitted}} with heavier armour and a standard APX turret, attached by the Atelier de Rueil between 18 and 25 April. The prototype was still being tested when international tensions increased due to German re-armament. This prompted an urgent demand for swifter modernisation of the French tank fleet. The ZM was {{to be put into}} production immediately. On 29 April 1935 an order of 300 was made, even before the final model could be finished, at a price of 190,000 French franc per hull (unarmed, without the engine and turret, the overall export price was ca. 1,400,000 francs in 1939, that is ca. 32,000 dollars by 1939 standards). The first <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> was delivered on 4 June 1936 and had to be extensively tested again as it was different from the prototype.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicle</b> was {{unveiled}} on September 29, 2015. It has a panoramic windshield.

50|$|Jagdtiger ("Hunting Tiger") is {{the common}} name of a German heavy tank {{destroyer}} of World War II. The official German designation was Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B as {{it was based on}} a lengthened Tiger II chassis. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd. Kfz. 186. The 71-tonne Jagdtiger was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle used operationally during World War II and is the heaviest armored vehicle of any type to achieve <b>series</b> <b>production.</b> The <b>vehicle</b> carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, capable of out-ranging and defeating any Allied tank. It saw service in small numbers from late 1944 {{to the end of the}} war on both the Western and Eastern Front. Although 150 were ordered, only between 70 and 88 were produced. Due to an excessive weight, the Jagdtiger was continuously plagued with mechanical problems. Today, three Jagdtigers survive in museums.|$|R

40|$|Particle filters {{have emerged}} as a {{powerful}} method for solving multi-hypothesis state estimation problems, which originate from non-linear, non-Gaussian dynamic systems. Two applications of particle filters {{in the fields of}} remote sensing and vehicle navigation are addressed in this work. The first application in remote sensing is given by tracking vehicles in airborne images for traffic Monitoring and surveillance. The second application is related to vehicle ego-localization on a digital map for navigation and driving assistance systems. For airborne vehicle tracking, the low image resolution and the small frame-rate of industrial airborne camera systems impede clear discrimination of individual vehicles and precise motion prediction. Existing particle filter approaches for airborne vehicle tracking lack advanced strategies to achieve robustness against errors from low-cost systems and fail to address issues in real-world situations. Previous work on airborne vehicle tracking assumes continuous vehicle motion and clear discrimination of individual vehicles with unvarying appearance, which is not given in urban traffic scenarios. In this work, adaptive particle sampling and weighting approaches are proposed to ensure that particles explore the search space more efficiently and appearance changes can be tolerated without target losses. An update strategy for the appearance template model of each tracked vehicle further increases the rate of successfully tracked vehicles. Information about the context of multiple tracked vehicles is integrated by an online map learning approach. Experiments were conducted on low frame-rate, low- resolution image sequences taken from an airplane and a UAV of dense urban traffic scenarios with up to 151 simultaneously tracked vehicles. The results demonstrate the robustness of the developed tracker against discontinuous vehicle motion, appearance changes and difficult discrimination of similar close vehicles. For vehicle ego-localization, the standard automotive positioning sensors of <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the abstracted representation of the road geometries in commercial digital maps complicate the computation of the correct map-matched position. Recent particle filter methods for map-matching rely {{on the quality of the}} map and the absolute positioning systems and ignore to examine the performance at ambiguous situations where correct map-matching is most critical for navigation functions. This work includes advanced models for lane-level particle sampling constrained to the digital map and particle weighting with measurements from the onboard lane detection camera system. A new medoid-shift clustering method is proposed to extract multiple hypotheses from the weighted particles in the road map space. A functional prototype of the map-matching system is implemented in a test vehicle using commercial map data and a low-cost absolute positioning system. The results of various tests including ambiguous situations like road bifurcations demonstrate the ability of the map-matcher to maintain multiple hypotheses until the situation becomes decidable. This investigation has revealed that the lane matching together with the lane topology-aware particle sampling supports the decision for the correct road segment. Overall the developed map-matcher proves its suitability for automotive applications, because of its good performance under the proposed quality criteria derived from requirements of navigation and advanced driving assistance systems. Both particle filter methods achieve robust results on experimental real-world datasets, which were obtained from low-cost sensor systems. Therefore, they prove as suitable candidates for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|As {{the concern}} for {{environmental}} changes and diminishing oil resources grows more and more, the trend of new vehicle concepts now includes full electric or partly electric propulsion systems. The introduction of electric power sources enables more advanced motion control systems due to electrification of the vehicle's actuators, such as individual wheel steering and in wheel hub motors. This can enable a control methodology that uses different chassis control strategies into a system that {{will be able to}} fully utilise the vehicle. Due to this, future vehicles can be more optimised with respect to energy consumption, performance and active safety. Force allocation control is a method that distributes the wheel forces to produce the desired response of the vehicle. In order to evaluate if this methodology can be implemented in future <b>series</b> <b>production</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the aim of this work is to explore how force allocation control can be utilised in a real vehicle to improve vehicle dynamics and safety. In order to evaluate different approaches for generic vehicle motion control by optimization, modelling and simulation in combination with real vehicle experiments will be needed to fully understand the more complex system, especially when actuator dynamics and limitations are considered. The use of a scale prototype vehicle represents a compromise between development cost, efficiency and accuracy, as it allows realistic experiments without the cost and complexity of full vehicle test. Moreover since the vehicle is unmanned it allows studies of at-the-limit situations, without the safety risks in full vehicle experiments. A small scale prototype vehicle (Hjulia) has been built and equipped with autonomous corner module functionality that enables individual control of all wheels. A cost effective force allocation control approach has been implemented and evaluated on the prototype vehicle, as well as in vehicle simulation. Results show improvement of stopping distance and vehicle stability of a vehicle during split-m braking. The aspects of vehicle dynamic scaling are also discussed and evaluated, as {{it is important to know}} how the control implementation of small scale prototype vehicles compares with full size vehicles. It is shown that there is good comparison between vehicles of different scales, if the vertical gravitational acceleration is adjusted for. In Hjulia, gravity compensation is solved by adding a specific lifting rig. Studies of vehicles considering optimal path tracking and available actuators are also made to evaluate control solutions of evasive manoeuvres at low and high friction surfaces. Results show differences in how the forces are distributed among the wheels, even though the resulting global forces on the vehicle are approximated to be scaled by friction. Also it is shown that actuator limitations are critical in at-the-limit situations, such as an obstacle avoidance manoeuvre. As a consequence these results will provide good insights to what type of control approach to choose to handle a safety critical situation, depending on available actuators. The built prototype vehicle with implemented force allocation control has shown to be a useful tool to investigate the potential of control approaches, and it will be used for future research in exploring the benefits of force allocation control.
