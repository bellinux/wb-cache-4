Scientific core of this research lies in the integration of noise mapping with interoperable data sources, where the European Union’s INSPIRE (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe) Directive is nowadays one of the main. Principles of noise mapping according to the END (European Noise Directive), OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) CityGML specification, X 3 D (Extensible 3 D) and application schemas in INSPIRE are depicted at the beginning. Special attention is then paid to the specifics of INSPIRE <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> <b>theme</b> called buildings, including its extension possibilities. Motivations for 3 D application schema of INSPIRE buildings are discussed while only 2 D application schema is the legally binding one. On the other hand, 3 D application schema is recommended by the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. We also deal with OGC CityGML specification {{since it is the}} basis for the 3 D application schema. We took a step forward to publish the results of noise mapping based on INSPIRE application schema through X 3 D technology on the Web. This enables to disseminate information on noise mapping to wide audience through next generation Web applications. The paper proposes formalised methodology on X 3 D-based application development through the XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). Noise mapping was taken as a use case. There are discussions on benefits and limitations of X 3 D visualization as well as differences between the X 3 D presentation and storage of 3 D geospatial data according to INSPIRE application schema on buildings at the end...|$|E

40|$|In Europe a major recent {{development}} has been the entering in force of the INSPIRE Directive in May 2007, establishing an {{infrastructure for spatial information}} in Europe to support Community environmental policies, and policies or activities which may {{have an impact on the}} environment. INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by the 27 Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> <b>themes</b> needed for environmental applications, with key components specified through technical implementing rules. This makes INSPIRE a unique example of a legislative ¿regional¿ approach. One of the requirements of the INSPIRE Directive is to make existing <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> sets with relevance for one of the <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> <b>themes</b> available in an interoperable way, i. e. where the <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> from different sources in Europe can be combined to a coherent result. Since INSPIRE covers a wide range of <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> <b>themes,</b> the first step has been the development of a modelling framework that provides a common foundation for all themes. This framework is largely based on the ISO 19100 series of standards. The use of common generic spatial modelling concepts across all themes is an important enabler for interoperability. As a second step, data specifications for the first set of themes has been developed based on the modelling framework. The themes include addresses, transport networks, protected sites, hydrography, administrative areas and others. The data specifications were developed by selected experts nominated by stakeholders from all over Europe. For each theme a working group was established in early 2008 working on their specific theme and collaborating with the other working groups on cross-theme issues. After a public review of the draft specifications starting in December 2008, an open testing process and thorough comment resolution process, the draft technical implementing rules for these themes have been approved by the INSPIRE Committee. After they enter into force they become part of the legal framework and European Member States have to implement these rules. The next step is the development of the remaining 25 <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> <b>themes,</b> which include many themes of interest for the Earth Sciences including geology, meteorological and oceanographic geographic features, atmospheric conditions, habitats and biotopes, species distribution, environmental monitoring facilities, and land cover to name a few. The process will follow in general the same steps as for the first themes and the working groups are expected to start their work in March/April 2010. The first draft specifications for public comment are expected at the end of 2010 and the work is scheduled to be completed in 2012. JRC. DDG. H. 6 -Spatial data infrastructure...|$|R

This version is now available for the public consultation. Based {{on the results of}} the consultation (received comments and the testing reports), the final version 3. 0 will be prepared by the TWGs. The data specification is based on a common template used for all data specifications and has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I data specifications. This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the draft Implementing Rule for <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on Natural Risk Zones in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first. The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of Natural Risk Zones. The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

Starting with a definition of the <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> primitive and associated conventions, <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> of various types are added to beginning control point values to build a 3 -D database. Using the global <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> model (GSDM), the unique location of each point is stored as geocentric X/Y/Z coordinates and the stochastic information for each point is stored in a covariance matrix. Conventional latitude/ longitude, UTM, and map projection coordinates (plus other geometrical elements such as heights, areas, and volumes) are derived from the stored values. The standard deviation of each derived quantity is readily available from the stored stochastic information using conventional error propagation techniques.

40|$|So far, {{thousand}} {{kinds of}} <b>Spatial</b> <b>Data</b> were acquired, produced, published {{and used for}} specialized applications. Heterogeneity is obviously one key problem for <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> {{in the process of}} its creating, structuring or managing. The heterogeneity keeps the complete and variety of <b>spatial</b> <b>data,</b> but induces the difficulty of describing, publishing, sharing, interoperability or metadata harvesting. Decentralized, multi-organization and synchronization are the major features of the next generation <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> service infrastructure. Standard research on geospatial metadata harvesting and data service is becoming a research focus. More and more organizations and consortiums (e. g. ISO/TC 211, OGC) drafted and released their geospatial metadata and service standards. However, these standards are diverse in order to fit to different <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> format and research fields, which makes <b>spatial</b> <b>data</b> owner hard to choose standard. The paper focuses on analyzing metadata harvesting from multi-organizations archives, including <b>Spatial</b> <b>Data</b> description, publishing, sharing, and interoperability. Several of most widely used <b>Spatial</b> <b>Data</b> standards are introduced, and compared. Advices on how to choose the standards are given for <b>Spatial</b> <b>Data</b> owner...|$|R
