500|$|... is {{the leader}} of Team 8, a skilled user of genjutsu who is shown to be {{particularly}} skilled with illusions involving plants. Of all her students, Kurenai is closest with Hinata, acting as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>parent</b> in the absence of Hinata's father and helping Hinata overcome her weaknesses. Whenever Kurenai appears in the series, she is usually accompanied by her childhood friend Asuma Sarutobi, and during Part II of the series, Kurenai is revealed to be pregnant with Asuma's child.

500|$|Nancy Drew is {{a fictional}} amateur sleuth. In the {{original}} {{versions of the}} series, she is a 16-year-old high school graduate, and in later versions, is rewritten and aged to be an 18-year-old high school graduate and detective. In the series, she lives in the fictional town of River Heights with her father, attorney Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen. As a child (age ten in the original versions and age three in the later version), she loses her mother. Her loss is reflected in her early independence—running a household {{since the age of}} ten with a clear-cut servant in early series and deferring to the servant as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>parent</b> in later ones. [...] As a teenager, she spends her time solving mysteries, some of which she stumbles upon and some of which begin as cases of her father's. Nancy is often assisted in solving mysteries by her two closest friends: cousins Bess Marvin and George Fayne. Bess is delicate and feminine, while George is a tomboy. Nancy is also occasionally joined by her boyfriend Ned Nickerson, a student at Emerson College.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} public policy {{doctrine}} relating to contracts generally and examines specific public policies set forth in state adoption statutes. The Article concludes that <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements are 1) incompatible with consent provisions of state adoption statutes, 2) inconsistent with state laws prohibiting baby-selling, and 3) inconsistent with state adoption provisions that provide for a thorough investigation of the adoptive parents {{in order to ensure}} that the adoption serves the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interests. Accordingly, this Article suggests that as state legislatures debate the best means of addressing the issue of <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting,</b> they should recognize that <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements must be restructured to avoid violation of adoption statutes. <b>Surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements that comply with adoption requirements in all respects except for failure to comply with adoption consent provisions should be voidable. <b>Surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements that violate baby-selling prohibitions or provisions requiring an investigation of the adoptive parents, however, should be void. Part I of this Article examines {{the public policy}} doctrine as it applies to traditional contract law. Part II explores the adoption process and the public policies underlying it. Part III examines the incompatibilities between <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements and the adoption statutes. Part IV describes the modifications required in the surrogate process in order to make <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> agreements enforceable and concludes by looking at surrogacy in the context of society at large...|$|R

It is augmented with photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. She singles out her [...] "near-feral" [...] childhood and her subsequent introduction to photography at Putney, her relationship to her husband of 40 years and his parent's mysterious death, and her maternal Welsh relative's nostalgia for land morphing into her love for her land in the Shenandoah Valley as some of her important influences.

This alternative statute will propose legislation in a way that can protect New York’s social policy interests while still permitting the enforceability of <b>surrogate</b> <b>parenting</b> contracts...|$|R
