The catalyst was reduced with hydrogen (15  mL/min) for 4  h at 300  °C. And then the model feed of THN was introduced by a micro-pump. The reaction conditions of the hydrogenation reaction were as follows: the temperature range of 200 – 350  °C, under H 2 atmosphere (pressure range of 2 – 6  MPa), a LHSV range of 1 – 4  h− 1 and a H 2 /THN volume ratio of 500 – 850.

Reaction products were detected on a gas chromatograph (GC) with FID detector and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). All the reaction products detected on the GC were grouped according to the number of carbon atoms of the products. The products were grouped as follows: (a) C 10 −: molecules containing less than 10 carbons.

The <b>selective</b> <b>ring</b> opening of naphthalene and alkylnaphthalenes (yielding C 4 H 6 and PhMe) is likely to occur via direct splitting of C-C bonds in the arom. nucleus.

Some significant differences in the activation steps of H and steam on Rh and Ni provide a reasonable explanation of these results. In the steam reforming of 1 -methylnaphthalene, acidic supports induce considerable isomerization of 1 -Me into 2 -methylnaphthalene and increased selectivity to PhMe.

40|$|During {{characterization}} of some peptides (linear precursors of the cyclic peptides showing {{potential to be}} anticancer drugs) in an ion trap, {{it was noted that}} many internal amino acid residues could be lost from singly charged b ions. The phenomenon was not obvious at the first stage of collisionally activated decomposition (CAD), but was apparent at multiple stages of CAD. The unique fragmentation consisting of multiple steps is induced by a cyclization reaction of b ions, the mechanism of which has been probed by experiments of N-acetylation, MSn, rearranged-ion design, and activation-time adjustment. The fragmentation of synthetic cyclic peptides demonstrates that a cyclic peptide intermediate (CPI) formed by b ion cyclization exhibits the same fragmentation pattern as a protonated cyclic peptide. Although no rules for the cyclization reaction were discerned in the experiments of peptide modification, the fragmentations of a number of b ions indicate that the “Pro and Asn/Gln effects” can influence ring openings of CPIs. In addition, large-scale losses of internal residues from different positions of a-type ions have been observed when pure helium was used as collision gas. The fragmentation is initiated by a cyclization reaction forming an a-type ion CPI. This CPI with a fixed-charge structure cannot be influenced by the “Pro effect”, causing a <b>selective</b> <b>ring</b> opening at the amide bond Pro-Xxx rather than Xxx-Pro.

The reactions lead to several products families, the dominant ones being ring-opening products (ROPs) and skeletal-isomerization products (SkIPs). First, it is shown that the ROP distribution can be characterized in terms of isomerization degree by using the cumulative distribution function of the GC × GC (GC Image) software. Second, in a more quantitative approach, the products families have been subdivided into chemical groups, according to the isomerization degrees of the individual compounds, which were almost all tentatively identified by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC × GC-MS) through the use of literature data. This allows us to thoroughly analyze the influence of the catalyst nature and the presence of H 2 S in the reactant feed on the products distribution, and thereby gain insight into the mechanism of decalin hydroconversion over bifunctional catalysts. In particular, it is shown that metal sulfidation suppresses the metal-catalyzed C–C hydrogenolysis pathway at the benefit of undesirable acid-catalyzed isomerization steps.

40|$|RAFFINAGE:SURFACES+LPI:SNA:MAO:CGEA {{series of}} Ir-Pd/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} has been prepared by incipient wetness co-impregnation of acetylacetonate precursors and treated by reductive thermal decomposition. The decomposition has {{been followed by}} combined thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis, and mass spectrometry, showing a marked difference between the bimetallic and monometallic cases. The catalysts characterization by transmission electron microscopy and single-nanoparticle energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the particles are bimetallic and exhibit a size-composition correlation. More generally, the enrichment of larger particles with the less cohesive element (Pd in the present case) via Ostwald ripening is here claimed to be inherent to the thermal activation treatments used {{in the preparation of}} bimetallic catalysts. The catalysts have been tested in the hydroconversion of tetralin, which is considered as a model molecule for gas oil upgrading by <b>selective</b> <b>ring</b> opening. At 350 degrees C, 4 MPa H- 2, and in the presence of ppm amounts of H 2 S, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and ring-opening/contraction products (ROCPs) are formed. While the activity increases with the Pd content, the selectivity to ROCPs reaches a maximum for the Ir 55 -Pd 45 composition and increases with the sulfur concentration. The structural and catalytic results are combined to propose a qualitative model relying on metal-acid bifunctionality and size-composition correlation. While the particle size drives the number of surface sites, the corresponding surface composition governs the hydrogenation efficiency of these sites. Therefore, by controlling the mean metal composition of the catalyst, it is possible to tune the activity-selectivity balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
