5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He {{found a new}} element in a mineral <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> {{had been sent to}} England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral columbite and the new element columbium after Columbia, the poetical name for the United States. The columbium discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum.|$|E

5|$|The only soundtrack album {{released}} for {{the game}} was Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of selections from the soundtrack rather {{than all of the}} tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position #50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> would only fill two discs.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be perfect for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E

5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin <b>sample</b> <b>that,</b> should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium's unique {{radioactive}} characteristics {{allowed it}} to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions, at first {{this was the only}} method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl, forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor. Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3millionyears (later revised to 2.144millionyears), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} stainless <b>samples</b> <b>that</b> {{were exposed}} to LBE in experiments conducted by the Russians, under contract to Los Alamos. We examined both corroded and uncorroded samples using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), the Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDAX) Spectroscopy, and the X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). We found that {{the surface of the}} corroded sample is covered by oxygen-containing compounds, presumably mostly iron oxide. In samples exposed for shorter times or lower temperatures, we found that some areas were covered by an oxide layer, and some areas was uncovered. We found that the level of Cr in the uncovered area is much higher than the level of Cr in the covered area. Oxygen is present in the spectra of both covered and uncovered areas. Using EDAX, we examined <b>samples</b> <b>that</b> had been exposed to LBE, and <b>samples</b> <b>that</b> had not been exposed. We found that oxygen was present with a strong signal in samples exposed to LBE, and absent from <b>samples</b> <b>that</b> were not exposed...|$|R
25|$|In medicine, LDH {{is often}} used as a marker of tissue {{breakdown}} as LDH is abundant in red blood cells and can function as a marker for hemolysis. A blood <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> has been handled incorrectly can show false-positively high levels of LDH due to erythrocyte damage.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{original}} ways of recognizing GPs, before SQL programming was involved, was because of a discrepancy about how the SDSS labels them within Skyserver. Out of the 251 of {{the original}} GP <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> were identified by the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline as having galaxy spectra, only 7 were targeted by the SDSS spectral fibre allocation as galaxies i.e. 244 were not.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, when Nicholas and all men {{involved}} in pressing the Constantine rouble were already dead, general Fyodor Schubert (1789–1865) {{broke the silence}} and published {{a brief description of}} a Constantine ruble from his private collection. Schubert wrote that his coin was a test <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> was sent to Constantine's approval during the interregnum, and that press dies were destroyed upon accession of Nicholas I.

25|$|A lip/salivary gland biopsy takes {{a tissue}} <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> can reveal {{lymphocytes}} clustered around salivary glands, and damage to these glands due to inflammation. This test involves removing {{a sample of}} tissue from a person’s inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a microscope. In addition, a sialogram, a special X-ray test, is performed {{to see if any}} blockage is present in the salivary gland ducts (i.e. parotid duct) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Ligand binding assays (LBA) is an assay, or an {{analytic}} procedure, whose procedure or method {{relies on}} the binding of ligand molecules to receptors, antibodies or other macromolecules. A detection method is {{used to determine the}} presence and extent of the ligand-receptor complexes formed, and this is usually determined electrochemically or through a fluorescence detection method. This type of analytic test can be used to test for the presence of target molecules in a <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> are known to bind to the receptor.|$|E
25|$|Samples can exhibit {{diffraction}} contrast, {{whereby the}} electron beam undergoes Bragg scattering, {{which in the}} case of a crystalline sample, disperses electrons into discrete locations in the back focal plane. By the placement of apertures in the back focal plane, i.e. the objective aperture, the desired Bragg reflections can be selected (or excluded), thus only parts of the <b>sample</b> <b>that</b> are causing the electrons to scatter to the selected reflections will end up projected onto the imaging apparatus.|$|E
