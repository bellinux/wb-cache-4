The then-advanced engine was designed by a German team of ex-Junkers prisoner-engineers under Ferdinand Brandner. In contrast, the fuselage was conventional: a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with 35 degrees of sweep, an angle which ensured that the main wing spar passed through the fuselage {{in front of the}} bomb bay. Retractable tricycle landing gear was fitted, with all three gear strut units retracting rearwards, with the main gear units retracting rearwards into extensions of the inner engine nacelles.|$|E

It is also fitted with a high-speed profile wing, rated for maneuvers up to 8 g, complete with hyraulically-assisted ailerons and spoilers which enable the execution of fighter-like rates of roll and other maneuvers. In order to make the aircraft easy to fly at low speeds, crucial to the advanced trainer role, the PC-21 is furnished with a digital power management system and the horizontal stabilizer is equipped with an automatic yaw compensator/suppression system to compensate for engine power and speed changes.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} several years, she made {{regularly}} scheduled trips between Italy, and Central and South America. In 1957, her funnel was modified yet again, by adding a pipe-like extension to help keep diesel fumes and smoke away from her open passenger decks, aft. In 1959 she was withdrawn from the trans-Atlantic trade and transformed into an all first class cruise ship, operating out of Genoa. An important part of her transformation was the addition of air conditioning throughout the 45-year-old vessel. As a one-class cruise ship, her number of passenger berths was reduced to 552, and all her passenger cabins were fitted with private baths. In addition, her original main mast was removed and a swimming pool installed in her aft-most cargo hold. Then, she was based in Miami {{during the winter months}} and marketed as the [...] "New M/S FRANCA C Happy-Go-Luxury Cruise to the West Indies". During the summer months, she returned to Europe to participate in the Mediterranean cruise trade. During the mid-1960s, she twice returned to her birthplace at Newport News for dry docking, underwater repair work and below waterline repainting. Franca C continued cruising until 1970. By then the ship was 56 years old, and her owners had begun to think seriously about taking her out of service and selling her for scrap. But her all-riveted hull was still in excellent condition and her first diesel engine had been replaced just a few years previously with a newer and larger diesel engine rated at 8,100 <b>Shaft</b> <b>Horse</b> <b>Power.</b> [...] A decision was made to keep Franca C in service, and during a brief overhaul many of her passenger spaces were refurbished internally. On 4 February 1971, she began a series of 14-day cruises in the Mediterranean. In 1974 she returned to the Caribbean and made a series of three and four-day cruises to Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao and Margarita. Franca C returned to Europe {{at the conclusion of the}} 1977 Mediterranean cruise season and her owners once again contemplated ending her career. Most ocean-going vessels remain in service for 30 to 40 years. At age 63, it was logically assumed by most maritime observers that she would be scrapped. However, certain passengers on the ship's very last cruise had other plans for the ship.|$|E

The accumulation of marine organisms causes decreasing of propulsive efficiency of the ships. In case of the Kagoshima-Maru, the propeller had to be cleaned by a diver three times a year. To prevent the accumulation of marine organisms, propeller boss and blades were coated by special paint, which is made of silicone resin. Observations were carried out for one year by measuring <b>shaft</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> and by photographing work using submersible video camera. The results were obtained as follows: 1) Coating propeller with silicone resin paint, was effective for the prevention of marine organism 2 ̆ 7 s accumulation, so that propeller cleaning work done by the diver can be neglected. 2) The cost of propeller coating was about a half of the wages paid for the diver. 3) It seems that the adhesion of the paint was not strong enough, because about a half area of the propeller coating was removed during the experiment.

The volume and area study includes {{the effects of}} technologies which manifest themselves in the parametric study through stack length requirements. Subsequently, the hull forms are studied using a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes analysis coupled with a vortex lattice propeller design code. Optimization is done through boundary layer control analysis and through studies {{on the effect of}} blade loading magnitudes and profiles. Several hull form afterbody shapes are studied to improve the powering characteristics of a full stern submarine. The hydrodynamic analysis includes the total contribution of the rotor, stator, duct, the body hull form and appendages on the submarine drag.
