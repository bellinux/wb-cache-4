By contrast, <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> normally deleted around the late T 2 stage of peripheral development were rescued from deletion, matured, and colonized the splenic follicle. Furthermore, <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> normally selectively deleted from the marginal zone repopulated this compartment when excess BAFF was present. <b>Self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> rescued by excess BAFF were not anergic.

Our laboratory and others have documented an in vitro interaction, which has been termed the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) (3, 4) in humans, and the syngeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (SMLR) in animals (5 - 8).

The thymus-produced <b>self-reactive</b> T <b>cells,</b> which become activated in the periphery via recognition of major histocompatibility complex/self-peptide complexes, stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to secrete IL- 6. APC-derived IL- 6, together with T cell–derived IL- 6, drives naive <b>self-reactive</b> T <b>cells</b> to differentiate into arthritogenic Th 17 cells. Deficiency of either IL- 17 or IL- 6 completely inhibits arthritis development, whereas interferon (IFN) -γ deficiency exacerbates it. The generation, differentiation, and persistence of arthritogenic Th 17 cells per se are, however, insufficient for producing overt autoimmune arthritis. Yet overt disease is precipitated by further expansion and activation of autoimmune Th 17 cells, for example, via IFN-γ deficiency, homeostatic proliferation, or stimulation of innate immunity by microbial products. Thus, a genetically determined T cell self-reactivity forms a cytokine milieu that facilitates preferential differentiation of <b>self-reactive</b> T <b>cells</b> into Th 17 cells.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is examining the mechanisms of peripheral B cell tolerance (Chapter 2). Generating a diverse repertoire of B cells reactive against foreign pathogens, yet tolerant to self-tissue, is imperative for an effective immune system. Random gene rearrangement at the immunoglobulin loci results {{in the majority of}} newly formed B <b>cells</b> being <b>self-reactive.</b> At an initial checkpoint in the bone marrow, a large portion of <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> are rendered unresponsive or are eliminated through apoptosis. A second, less well-defined checkpoint in B cell tolerance occurs in the periphery as developing transitional B cells mature in the spleen. Indeed, studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have a defect at this second crucial checkpoint. Within the follicle, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) retain immune complexes and opsonized foreign antigens by Fc and complement receptors, respectively, important for B cell selection during the germinal center response. However, the selection of <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> by self-antigen on FDCs has not been addressed. To this end, a mouse model (Cd 21 cremDELloxp mice) that expresses self-antigen membrane-bound Duck Egg Lysozyme (mDEL) on FDCs to study the fate of mDEL-binding B cells was generated. The results from this model show that self-antigen displayed on FDCs mediates effective elimination of <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> at the transitional stage.

40|$|The {{existence}} of autoreactive B cells was predicted by theoretical considerations and, recently, confirmed by direct experiments. The {{aim of the}} present work was to investigate if the capacity of <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> to be activated with different polyclonal B-cell activators (PBA) reflects the heterogeneity of the response as seen in all the Ig- positive cells. We injected mice with dextran sulfate, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 055 :B 5, and purified protein derivate of turbercle bacteria RT 32 and studied the complement- dependent cytotoxicity against syngeneic spleen cells caused by the sera from injected mice {{with regard to the}} different parameters used for characterization of B-cell subpopulations. It was found that the capacity of <b>self-reactive</b> B <b>cells</b> to secrete antibodies reflects the polyclonal-activating capacity of the PBA used. The implications of these findings for the understanding of the triggering mechanism of B lymphocytes and for self-nonself discrimination are discussed...|$|R
