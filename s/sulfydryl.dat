The manner in which DNFB, DNTB, and other dinitrobenzene compounds conjugated in vitro to soluble proteins, at physiologic pH, was examined. By measuring the free amino and <b>sulfydryl</b> radicals in the protein before and after conjugation, it was possible to determine to which groups the hapten was bound. It was found that although all the haptens bound to the free <b>sulfydryl</b> groups, DNTB {{was the only one that}} did not bind to amino groups. It is suggested that to be an epicutaenous tolerizer, as opposed to sensitizer, a hapten should bind to <b>sulfydryl</b> groups exclusively.

40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of riluzole on methylmercury- (MeHg-) induced oxidative stress, through promotion of glutathione (GSH) synthesis by activating of glutamate transporters (GluTs) in rat cerebral cortex. Methods. Eighty rats {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, control group, riluzole alone group, MeHg alone group, and riluzole + MeHg group. The neurotoxicity of MeHg was observed by measuring mercury (Hg) absorption, pathological changes, and cell apoptosis of cortex. Oxidative stress was evaluated via determining reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDAs), carbonyl, <b>sulfydryl,</b> and GSH in cortex. Glutamate (Glu) transport was studied by measuring Glu, glutamine (Gln), mRNA, and protein of glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter- 1 (GLT- 1). Result. (1) MeHg induced Hg accumulation, pathological injury, and apoptosis of cortex; (2) MeHg increased ROS, 8 -OHdG, MDA, and carbonyl, and inhibited <b>sulfydryl</b> and GSH; (3) MeHg elevated Glu, decreased Gln, and downregulated GLAST and GLT- 1 mRNA expression and protein levels; (4) riluzole antagonized MeHg-induced downregulation of GLAST and GLT- 1 function and expression, GSH depletion, oxidative stress, pathological injury, and apoptosis obviously. Conclusion. Data indicate that MeHg administration induced oxidative stress in cortex and that riluzole could antagonize this situation through elevation of GSH synthesis by activating of GluTs...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{ribulose}} bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) and proteolytic activity {{were followed}} in the flag leaf and second leaf of field-grown winter wheat (cv. Arthur). These changes were followed in relation to changes in leaf chlorophyll, protein, and photosynthesis, and seed development. Levels of RuBPCase were determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis as described previously (Wittenbach 1978 Plant Physiol 62 : 604 - 608). RuBPCase constituted 40 to 45 % of the total soluble protein in the flag leaf and an even higher percentage of the soluble protein in the second leaf. This ratio remained unchanged until senescence when RuBPCase protein was apparently lost {{at a faster rate}} than total soluble protein. No change in the specific activity of RuBPCase on either a milligram protein or RuBPCase basis was observed until senescence. A close correlation existed among the various indices of senescence in the field, namely, the decline in chlorophyll, protein, photosynthesis, and RuBPCase activity. In addition, proteinase activity increased with the onset of senescence. These enzymes readily degraded RuBPCase, exhibiting a pH optimum of 4. 8 to 5. 0 and a temperature optimum of 50 C.

40|$|Several inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme were also found to inhibit aminopeptidase P, whereas inhibitors of other mammalian aminopeptidases were ineffective. Aminopeptidase P purified from pig kidney cortex was found to contain one atom of zinc per polypeptide chain, confirming its metalloenzyme nature. The concentrations of converting enzyme inhibitors required to cause 50 % inhibition (I 50) of aminopeptidase P were in the low micromolar range. The most potent converting enzyme inhibitors toward aminopeptidase P were the carboxylalkyl compounds, cilazaprilat, enalaprilat, and ramiprilat (I 50 values of 3 - 12 /iM). The <b>sulfydryl</b> compounds captopril (l 50 110 /iM) and YS 980 (I 50 20 /iM) were slightly less potent at inhibiting aminopeptidase P. In contrast, the carboxylalkyl compounds benazeprilat, lisinopril, and pentoprilat; the <b>sulfydryl</b> compound rentiapril; and the phosphoryl compounds ceranopril and fosinoprilat had no inhibitory effect against aminopeptidase P. This compares with I 50 values in the 1 - 6 nM range for these inhibitors with {{angiotensin converting}} enzyme.

The purified enzyme is {{remarkably similar to}} mammalian leucine aminopeptidases (EC 3. 4. 1. 1) both in chemical and in enzymatic properties. It has a sedimentation constant of 12. 7 S and a molecular weight of about 260, 000.

This effect involves a gradual decrease in the respiratory control index and significant alterations in the state 4 /state 3 transition of membrane potential (ΔΨ). Melatonin, alone, does not affect the insulating properties of the inner membrane but, in the presence of supraphysiological Ca 2 +, induces a ΔΨ drop and colloid-osmotic mitochondrial swelling. These events are sensitive to cyclosporin A and the inhibitors of Ca 2 + transport, indicative of the induction or amplification of the mitochondrial permeability transition. This phenomenon is triggered by oxidative stress induced by melatonin and Ca 2 +, with the generation of hydrogen peroxide and the consequent oxidation of <b>sulfydryl</b> groups, glutathione and pyridine nucleotides.

Rates of efflux have been correlated with the extent of cell swelling in hyposmotic media. Hyposmolality accelerated the slow phase of cellular efflux of l-aspartate (+ 29 %), γ-aminoisobutyric acid (GABA) (+ 38 %), l-glutamate (+ 28 %) and glycine (+ 26 %). The anion transport inhibitor 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-sulfonic acid (DIDS, 25 or 100 μM) as well as trifluoperazine (TFP, 25 μM), an inhibitor of calmodulin activation, both retarded efflux in hyposmotic media, with associated cell swelling (increase in slice non-inulin space). The effects of DIDS and TFP were not additive. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM, 100 μM) significantly retarded the efflux of neutral amino acids, with cell swelling: these effects were less pronounced in cells loaded with acidic amino acids. It is concluded that the hyposmotically-activated efflux of carboxylic amino acids, and associated cell swelling limitation, requires calmodulin activation {{and the presence of}} free <b>sulfydryl</b> groups...|$|E

In the present study we first tested whether a decrease in the redox state of the cell per se and the resultant increase in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to stimulation of glucose transport. Clone 9 cells (expressing the Glut 1 isoform of facilitative glucose transporters) were exposed to azide, lactate, and ethanol for 1 h. While all three agents stimulated glucose transport and increased cell NADH/NAD + ratio and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 signifying increased ROS generation, the response to the stimuli was not blocked by N-acetylcysteine (an agent that counteracts ROS); moreover, the response to azide was not blocked by diamide (an intracellular <b>sulfydryl</b> oxidizing agent).

Thirtysix percent of the mugwort allergic patients tested displayed IgE antibodies against natural and recombinant profilin, and no significant differences were observed in the IgEbinding properties of the isoforms. One profilin isoform was purified to homogeneity and detailed structural analysis indicated that the protein exists in solution as dimers and tetramers stabilized by <b>sulfydryl</b> and/or ionic interactions. Profilin monomers were detectable only after exposure of multimers to harsh denaturing conditions. Dimers and tetramers did not significantly differ in their ability to bind serum IgE from mugwort pollenallergic patients. However, oligomeric forms might have a higher allergenic potential than monomers because larger molecules would have additional epitopes for IgEmediated histamine release. Profilin isolated from mugwort pollen also formed multimers. Thus, oligomerization is not an artifact resulting from the recombinant production of the allergen. Inhibition experiments showed extensive IgE crossreactivity of recombinant mugwort profilin and profilin from various pollen and food extracts...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} cardiac effects of iron {{with or without}} {{hydrogen}} peroxide, the isolated perfused rat heart and enzymatically isolated ventricular cardiomyocyte were used. It was shown that treatment with cell-permeable iron (Fe-HQ) for 10 min reduced the contractile amplitude and velocity and end diastolic cell length in the cardiomyocyte and increased the contents of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) in the coronary effluent and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the myocardium. The left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +/- dP/dtmax, and heart rate and coronary flow are showed a biphasic phase, an increase at first followed by a decline. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min following Fe-HQ augmented the effect of iron {{with an increase in}} coronary LDH and CK release and myocardial MDA content, and decrease in LVDP, +/- dP/dtmax and heart rate. Perfusion of reduced glutathione with hydrogen peroxide counteracted these effects of Fe-HQ and hydrogen peroxide while dimethyl sulfoxide had no effect on the injury induced by Fe-HQ and hydrogen peroxide in the isolated rat heart. This suggests that augmentation of myocardial injury {{as a result of an}} increase in intracellular iron by hydrogen peroxide might involve the dysfunction of <b>sulfydryl</b> group containing proteins but not the hydroxyl radicals.

40|$|The enzyme {{sphingomyelin}}ase (sphingomyelin phosphorylcholine phosphohydrolase, E. C. 3. 1. 4. 12) which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and phosphorylcholine {{was identified}} in the subcellular fractions of pig and human epidermis. The enzyme has an optimum pH of 4. 5 to 5 and is activated by Triton X- 100 (0. 1 % w/v). Approximately two-thirds of the enzyme activity in both the pig and human epidermal homogenates was in the soluble subcellular fraction {{and more than half}} of the enzyme activity in the subcellular particulate fraction was solubilized by freeze-thawing. The pH optimum suggests that epidermal sphingomyelinase is probably a lysozomal enzyme. The enzymes in both pig and human epidermis exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The soluble sphingomyelinase in pig epidermis had an apparent Km, 4. 5 × 10 - 5 M and that in human epidermis an apparent Km, 7. 7 × 10 - 5 M. The pig epidermal sphingomyelinase had no special requirement for either divalent or heavy metal ions and was not inhibited by <b>sulfydryl</b> group-blocking agents but it was moderately inhibited by dithiothreitol. No evidence was found in either pig or human epidermis for the presence of a phospholipase C (E. C. 3. 1. 4. 3) which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to diglyceride and phosphorylcholine but there was suggestive evidence of another catabolic pathway for phosphatidylcholine...|$|E
40|$|The leucine {{specific}} serine proteinase {{present in}} the soluble fraction of leaves from Spinacia oleracea L. (called Leu-proteinase) has been purified by acetone precipitation and a combination of gel-filtration, ion exchange, and adsorption chromatography. This enzyme shows a molecular weight of 60, 000 +/- 3, 000 daltons, an isoelectric point of 4. 8 +/- 0. 1, and a relative electrophoretic mobility of 0. 58 +/- 0. 03. The Leu-proteinase catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitroanilides of N-alpha-substituted(-l-) amino acids {{as well as of}} chromogenic macromolecular substrates has been investigated between pH 5 and 10 at 23 +/- 0. 5 degrees C and I = 0. 1 molar. The enzyme activity is characterized by a bell-shaped profile with an optimum pH value around 7. 5, reflecting the acid-base equilibrium of groups with pK(a) values of 6. 8 +/- 0. 1 and 8. 2 +/- 0. 1 (possibly the histidyl residue present at the active site of the enzyme and the N-terminus group). Among the substrates considered, N-alpha-benzoyl-l-leucine p-nitroanilide shows the most favorable catalytic parameters and allows to determine an enzyme concentration as low as 1 x 10 (- 9) molar. In agreement with the enzyme specificity, only N-alpha-tosyl-l-leucine chloromethyl ketone, di-isopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, among compounds considered specific for serine enzymes, strongly inhibit the Leu-proteinase. Accordingly, the enzyme activity is insensitive to cations, chelating agents, <b>sulfydryl</b> group reagents, and activators...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a waveguide-based optical biosensor for the sensitive and specific detection of biomarkers associated with disease. Our technology combines the superior optical properties of single-mode planar waveguides, the robust nature of functionalized self-assembled monolayer sensing films and the specificity of fluorescence sandwich immunoassays to detect biomarkers in complex biological samples such as serum, urine and sputum. We have previously reported the adaptation of our technology to the detection of biomarkers associated with breast cancer and anthrax. However, these approaches primarily used phospholipid bilayers as the functional film and organic dyes (ex: AlexaFluors) as the fluorescence reporter. Organic dyes are easily photodegraded and are not amenable to multiplexing because of their narrow Stokes' shift. Here we {{have developed}} strategies for conjugation of the detector antibodies with quantum dots {{for use in a}} multiplex detection platform. We have previously evaluated dihydroxylipoic acid quantum dots for the detection of a breast cancer biomarker. In this manuscript, we investigate the detection of the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen using antibodies conjugated with polymer-coated quantum dots. Kinetics of binding on the waveguide-based biosensor is reported. We compare the sensitivity of quantum dot labeled antibodies to those labeled with AlexaFluor and demonstrate the photostability of the former in our assay platform. In addition, we compare <b>sulfydryl</b> labeling of the antibody in the hinge region to that of nonspecific amine labeling. This is but the first step in developing a multiplex assay for such biomarkers on our waveguide platform...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxidizing}} {{species are}} {{implicated in the}} etiology {{of a range of}} inhalational pulmonary injuries. Consequently, various free radical scavengers have been tested as potential prophylactic agents. The <b>sulfydryl</b> compound, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the only such compound clinically available for use in realistic dosages, and it is well established as an effective antidote for the hepatic and renal toxicity of paracetamol. Another approach in pulmonary injury prophylaxis is methylprednisolone therapy. We evaluated NAC and methylprednisolone in two rat models of inhalational injury: 40 -hr exposure to greater than 97 % oxygen at 1. 1 bar and 15 -min exposure to acrolein vapor (210 ppm). For oxygen toxicity, NAC (80 mg) or methylprednisolone (10 mg) were given IP every 2 or 6 hr, respectively. For acrolein, single doses of NAC (1 g/kg) and methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) were given intravenously 15 min before exposure. In sham-exposed control animals, neither treatment favorably effected mortality, lung wet/dry weight ratios, or pulmonary histology. The increases in lung wet/dry weight ratios, seen with both oxygen and acrolein toxicity were reduced with both treatments. However, with oxygen, NAC therapy was associated with considerably increased mortality and histological changes. Furthermore, IP NAC administration resulted in large volumes of ascitic fluid. With acrolein, IV, NAC had no significant effect on mortality or pulmonary histological damage. Methylprednisolone had no beneficial effects on either the mortality or histological damage observed in either toxicity model. We caution against the ad hoc use of NAC in the management of inhalational pulmonary injury...|$|E
40|$|Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK 26 - 33) is metabolized by neural {{membranes}} with {{an initial}} cleavage to CCK 29 - 33 and subsequent breakdown to CCK 31 - 33 and CCK 32 - 33; this pattern of proteolysis occurs on incubation with either P 2 or purified lysed synaptosomal membranes. To determine whether the pattern of CCK 26 - 33 proteolysis is unique to the brain and whether regional brain differences in its pathway or rate exist, we analyzed the proteolysis of CCK by synaptic membranes of various brain areas and cellular membranes of peripheral tissue. The pattern of degradation in brain did not differ among the regions studied. The overall proteolysis rate, {{as measured by the}} formation of tryptophan, was higher in the striatum than in the cortex, although CCK 29 - 33 was formed at the same rate in both areas. In nonneural tissue, the rate of degradation was highest in liver membranes and lowest in pancreatic acinar cell preparations. Thus, it appears that degradative peptidases are not necessarily colocalized with CCK receptors. The pattern of product formation is the same in peripheral compared with CNS membranes; thus, the degradative pathway {{does not appear to be}} unique to brain tissue. The enzyme present in synaptic membranes that is responsible for CCK 29 - 33 formation requires a metal ion and <b>sulfydryl</b> groups for the catalysis and thus is a metalloendopeptidase. Furthermore, its activity is inhibited by Ac-Gly-Phe-Nle-al, a peptide aldehyde whose sequence bears some homology to the amino acid sequence in the region of CCK 26 - 33 that is cleaved by this enzyme...|$|E
