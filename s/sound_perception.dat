25|$|Hearing or {{audition}} (adjectival form: auditory) is {{the sense}} of <b>sound</b> <b>perception.</b> Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that {{is the sense}} of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the inner ear, which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000hertz, with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called deafness or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as vibrations conducted through the body by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.|$|E

There is little published research assessing the ability of CI users to identify environmental sounds, an important skill which also impacts upon a patient’s quality of life. This study compared adult CI users to normally hearing (NH) listeners {{in their ability to}} identify various environmental sounds. The Environmental <b>Sounds</b> <b>Perception</b> Test (ESPT) developed for this study was more difficult and more comprehensive than those used in current studies, {{in order to reduce the}} likelihood of any potential ceiling effect affecting the results.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies have investigated the diagnostic effectiveness of the Speech <b>Sounds</b> <b>Perception</b> Tests, few have investigated the qualities of the test make it effective. Different writers have suggested {{that it may be}} effective because of interference from earlier syllables and items, an inability to understand speech, fatigue or an inability to match letters and sounds. If the effectiveness is due to fatigue or interference, the lengh of the test (60 items) would contribute to its accuracy. Otherwise, a short form of the test could be as effective. Data from 37 brain-damaged and 21 normal individuals indicated that a 30 -item version of the test was slightly more accurate diagnostically than the 60 -item form. This suggests that a short form of the test could be used without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy, enabling the clinician to save time in assessing neuropsychological patients...|$|R

40|$|The full {{or partial}} {{recovery}} of cognitive functions following brain lesions {{is believed to}} rely on the recruitment of alternative neural networks. This has been shown anatomically for selective auditory cognitive functions (Adriani et al. 2003 b). We investigate here behavioral correlates that may accompany the use of alternative processing networks and in particular the resulting increase in response times. The performance of 5 patients with right or left unilateral hemispheric infarction and 6 normal control subjects in sound identification, asemantic sound recognition, sound localization, and <b>sound</b> motion <b>perception</b> was evaluated by the number of correct replies and response times for correct and wrong replies. Performance and response times were compared across patients and normal control subjects. Two patients with left lesions were deficient in sound identification and <b>sound</b> motion <b>perception</b> and normal in sound localization and asemantic sound recognition; one patient with right lesion was deficient in sound localization and <b>sound</b> motion <b>perception</b> and normal in sound identification and asemantic sound recognition; deficient performance was associated with increased response times. The remaining 2 patients (1 with left, 1 with right lesion) had normal performance in all 4 tasks but had significantly longer response times in some (but not all) tasks. Patients with normal or deficient performance tended more often than normal subjects to give faster correct than wrong replies. We propose that increased response time is an indication of processing within an alternative network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Weblogs are {{a popular}} form of easy-to-use {{personal}} publishing that has attracted millions of bloggers {{to share their}} personal thoughts, opinions, and knowledge on the web. The versatility of weblogs as a communication medium has attracted interests from educators. Educational applications of weblogs have so far included journals, e-portfolio, learning diaries, and logbooks. As {{in the case of}} other educational technologies, the perception of students is a determinant factor of whether weblogs are used in a way that elicits educational values. This paper investigates student perception towards the purposes of blogging. It reports an experience of introducing blogging tasks to third year computing students, and compares their perception with students not participating in the blogging tasks. A student perception model is proposed to explain the difference in the perception due to the experience in blogging. The paper concludes that mandatory use of weblogs in a course can gradually cultivate educationally <b>sound</b> <b>perceptions</b> in students despite of the observed misuse. Key words: weblog, blogging, educational blogging, student perception, feedback model. 1...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reports on}} an {{experiment}} designed to test American English speakers’ ability {{to discriminate between}} two pairs of sounds that are phonetically similar but characterized by different distributional constraints, namely, on the one hand, velar /l/ and /w/ in word-initial position and, on the other, alveolar /l/ and /n/ in word-final position. Twenty-three subjects participated in the study, who listened to sets of Italian and English real and made-up (and occasionally reversed) words exemplifying the above consonantal phonemes in various vocalic contexts. The study participants correctly identified word-initial alveolar /l/ and word-final velar /l/ as allophones of /l/. However, they tended to misunderstand word-initial velar /l/ as /w/. On the other hand, they misperceived word-final alveolar /l/ as /n/ only occasionally, that is, when it was preceded by front vowels (in the Italian stimuli) or high vowels (in the English stimuli). The study suggests that ascription of sounds to certain phonemic categories depends {{on a combination of}} (intuitive knowledge of) distributional information of <b>sounds,</b> <b>perception</b> of the intrinsic phonetic properties of sounds, and the effects of their surrounding environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} basic aspects of {{auditory}} processing that {{play a role}} in the perception of speech. The frequency selectivity of the auditory system, as measured using masking experiments, is described and used to derive the internal representation of the spectrum (the excitation pattern) of speech <b>sounds.</b> The <b>perception</b> of timbre and distinctions in quality between vowels are related to both static and dynamic aspects of the spectra of <b>sounds.</b> The <b>perception</b> of pitch and its role in speech perception are described. Measures of the temporal resolution of the auditory system are described and a model of temporal resolution based on a sliding temporal integrator is outlined. The combined effects of frequency and temporal resolution can be modelled by calculation of the spectro-temporal excitation pattern, which gives good insight into the internal representation of speech sounds. For speech presented in quiet, the resolution of the auditory system in frequency and time usually markedly exceeds the resolution necessary for the identification or discrimination of speech sounds, which partly accounts for the robust nature of speech perception. However, for people with impaired hearing, speech perception is often much less robust...|$|R
