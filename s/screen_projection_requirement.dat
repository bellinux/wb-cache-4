40|$|Lewis’s {{exhibition}} {{on view at}} the Canada Pavilion, titled “Cold Morning”, features {{several new}} films, including works that examine and foreground the legacy of rear projection. Pioneered in the early 1920 s, Lewis considers rear projection to be one of Hollywood’s most stunning visual inventions. Playing between illusion and visible montage, it is a part of a larger fascination with the history and techniques of film that have conceptually informed the artist’s work throughout his 15 -year career. By presenting rear-projection’s potential of containing two or more distinct places and durations within a given filmic image {{from the vantage point of}} digital cinema, Lewis’ project for the Canada Pavilion aptly reflects on the current critical juncture within contemporary filmmaking involving advancing technologies simultaneously eclipsing this modernist form of montage while re-inventing the archive of analog cinema.

40|$|The {{connecting}} rod is modeled from cloud points obtained by laser beam scanning. The points {{are joined by}} lines and then creating bounding areas and filling the volume. The laser beam scanning method for inspecting a reflective surface has been studied with analytical derivations and numerical modeling. Specular reflection off the surface was assumed and mathematical relations consistent with analytic geometry were used to trace the laser beam and predict its <b>screen</b> <b>projection.</b> It was found that deviation of the <b>screen</b> <b>projection</b> {{is proportional to the}} surface slope along the projection direction at the reflecting point and the distance from the point to the screen. The 3 -D modeling was validated with 2 -D analytical relationship as a special case and was tested with a profiled SMC (sheet molding compound) panel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{projection}} system, the projected image {{should be able}} to meet the normal visual needs of observer, so that the viewer can get the correct projection. When the <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface is the irregular free surface, {{the projection}} geometric correction of the projected image becomes the research focus. For the question of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface, this paper presents effective geometric correction method. The geometric correction method based on the geometry of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface and ideal location of viewport to calculate the points’ three-dimensional coordinate values. In this paper, the projection geometric correction method is widely applicable to various <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface environments...|$|R
