Steel Q 235 welded joint specimens, prefabricated with nonpenetration and <b>slag</b> <b>inclusion,</b> have been scanned by MMM testing instrument at 0 kN, 150 kN and 230 kN tension loads on tensile machinery.

40|$|Type, {{through-wall}} dimension (depth), {{and location}} {{are the most}} important flaw characteristics that need to be determined for the fracture-mechanics evaluation of a flawed component or part. In this paper, the three-step approach to the ultrasonic evaluation of flawed reactor pressure vessel components (i. e., flaw detection, identification, and sizing) are discussed in relation to fatigue cracks, slag inclusions, incomplete fusion flaws, and porosity clusters. The emphasis is on flaw identification (cracks vs. benign flaws) which must take place before estimating the depth of the flaw.

50|$|According to Smith, the {{different}} layers of steel are made visible during the polishing due {{to one or}} both of two reasons: 1.) Either the layers have a variation in carbon content, or 2.) they have variation in the content of <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions.</b> When the variation is due to <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> by themselves, {{there will not be a}} noticeable effect near the hamon, where the yakiba meets the hira. Likewise, there will be no appreciable difference in the local hardness of the individual layers. A difference in <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> generally appear as layers that are somewhat pitted while the adjacent layers are not. In one of the first metallurgical studies, Professor Kuni-ichi Tawara suggests that layers of high slag may have been added for practical as well as decorative reasons. Although slag has a weakening effect on the metal, layers of high slag may have been added to diffuse vibration and dampen recoil, allowing easier use without a significant loss in toughness.|$|R
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. <b>Slag</b> <b>inclusions,</b> undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by Liquid Penetrant Testing (Dye check). <b>Slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{variations}} in iron ore origin and iron manufacture, wrought iron can be inferior or superior in corrosion resistance compared to other iron alloys. There are many mechanisms behind that corrosion resistance. Chilton and Evans found that nickel enrichment bands reduce corrosion. They also found that in puddled, forged and piled iron, the working-over of the metal spread out copper, nickel and tin impurities, which produces electrochemical conditions that slow down corrosion. The <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{have been shown to}} disperse corrosion to an even film, enabling the iron to resist pitting. Another study has shown that <b>slag</b> <b>inclusions</b> are pathways to corrosion.

Class C fly ash with high ferrite (Fe) content {{was used as the}} primary material. The proportions of fly ash (FA) to slag (SL) are: 1 FA : 0 SL, 0. 9 FA : 0. 1 SL, 0. 7 FA : 0. 3 SL, and 0. 5 FA : 0. 5 SL. The workability and strength properties were determined by slump, vikat, and compressive strength tests. The result shows that the highest compressive strength was achieved by FASLG- 3 concrete with 30 % slag addition and exhibited a comparable strength to that normal concrete at 28 days. The 30 % slag addition also improve the workability and increase the setting time of FASLG concrete specimens.
