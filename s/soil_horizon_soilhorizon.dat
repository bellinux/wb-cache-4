40|$|Distilleries play a {{major role}} in polluting the water bodies and land by {{discharging}} a large amount of wastewater as effluent. As a result, higher amount of various elements get deposited in the soil and make them polluted. The study reveals the effect of distillery effluent on the physico-chemical characterisation of vertical <b>soil</b> <b>horizon</b> and from unaffected region to compare the soil characteristics. The lysimeter soil which was regularly treated with PTDE and its dilution with 50 % and 75 % of water showed higher value of all physico-chemical properties of the soil compared to unaffected <b>soil</b> <b>horizon.</b> The higher value was found in lysimeter “A”, in surface and sub surface <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> treated with PTDE as compared to unaffected soil. It may be concluded that the higher value and indiscriminate disposal of distillery waste on land affects the composition of the soil and groundwater quality due to leaching.

40|$|This article aims {{to propose}} an {{approach}} for estimating the three-dimensional (3 D) variability of denitrification. The concept of functional horizons {{is applied to}} the process of biological denitrification and 3 D <b>soil</b> <b>horizon</b> cartography is used to estimate its spatial variation. On one hand, detailed fieldwork (186 pedological auger holes) was undertaken to map 3 D horizon distribution within a 3 -ha riparian area using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). On the other hand, three classes of denitrifying capacities were defined according to the distribution of the denitrifying enzyme activity of 51 samples. The relationship between the process of denitrification and the cartography is assessed through soil characteristics, which both differentiate <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> and control the process of denitrification: organic carbon and textural fractions. This allows a class of denitrifying capacity to be attributed to each <b>soil</b> <b>horizon.</b> This information was inserted into the 3 D <b>soil</b> <b>horizon</b> cartography and the denitrifying functional horizons could be delimited. With this approach, field criteria are used and variations of the 3 D distribution of denitrification are considered in order to estimate the spatial variation of denitrification within the riparian area being studied...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{variability}} across landscapes is {{well known}} and results from the combination of geomorphologic and pedogenetic processes. Despite its importance, little quantitative information exists on the horizontal and vertical variation of soil profiles, especially in natural landscapes that are unaffected by soil erosion. This study aims at measuring the variation in <b>soil</b> <b>horizon</b> depth in loess-derived soils and relating it to surface characteristics. Several terrain variables and the variable soil type, as derived from existing soil maps, are considered in the prediction model. In total 399 augerings of up to 8. 7 m deep were made in natural forest areas in Central Belgium, where soil profiles were not affected by anthropogenic soil erosion. The variability of 5 different <b>soils</b> <b>horizons</b> was evaluated: eluvial (E) and illuvial clay (Bt) horizons, transition horizon (BC), decalcified loess material (C 1) and undisturbed calcareous loess material (C 2). All horizons exhibited significant variability. The top two <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> could not be linked significantly {{to any of the}} predictor variable. For the lower three <b>soil</b> <b>horizons</b> some weak, yet significant relations were found with the predictor variables slope gradient, plan curvature, wetness index, landform and soil type. Geostatistical analysis indicated a lack of spatial dependence for all horizons, except for the upper eluvial E horizon. This high spatial randomness resulted in poor predictions models for the depth of these <b>soil</b> <b>horizons,</b> with model efficiencies ranging between − 0. 14 and 0. 08, while for the E horizon, a simple ordinary kriging model provided a model efficiency of 0. 43. status: publishe...|$|R

Both forest type and <b>soil</b> <b>horizon</b> (O and A) strongly influenced bacterial catabolic activity and the number of substrates decayed on Biolog® ECO plates.
