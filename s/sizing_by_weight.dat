MethodsAfter approval by the institutional ethics board and written informed consent from parents, 197 children with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I–II who were scheduled for a routine genitourinary operation were included in the study.

ResultsInsertion and adequate ventilation were achieved in 185 patients at the first attempt, and 12 patients required a second attempt. Three patients had to be intubated.

In both species, body length distributions {{did not differ}} very much among sea areas. In spring (May), the <b>size</b> (<b>by</b> wet <b>weight)</b> of prey in L. herzensteini stomachs was independent of fish length. But in summer, the prey <b>size</b> ingested <b>by</b> L. herzensteini became larger sequentially with increase of fish length, indicating the existence of strong size selection for prey. The same was apparent for L. yokohamae. Intensity of size selection of both species was {{closely related to the}} food availability and the intensity of food requirement in relation to their annual life period. Namely, the size selection was found as high abundance of food and inactive feeding of fish. These results suggested that the intraspecific competition for food in L. herzensteini may possibly occur in spring but in summer it becomes weak because they ingested prey of different size with fish length. On the other hand, for L. yokohamae, considering that in spring the kind of prey ingested by them depended on fish length, it seems probable that there is less likelihood of intraspecific competition for food at least during spring and summer...|$|R

The formation studied for this paper is the Lissie formation of Pleistocene age, which crops out along the Gulf of Mexico in Texas in a band parallel to the present coast and 50 to 100 miles inland (Pig. 1). The writer hopes that the data presented in this study will prove valuable enough to the subsurface stratigrapher that he will use similar methods in the future In the study of the similar sand bodies at depth in the Gulf Coast region. Petrologic studies have been made on samples from 10 localities in and near Harris County, Texas. The samples range from siltstones to conglomeratic sandstones. Most are of Lissie age, but one locality (samples 1 - 7) may be a Beaumont (upper Pleistocene) levee deposit, while two others (samples 8 - 13) may be of upper Citronelie (Pliocene) age (Doering, 1956).
