50|$|A sink — {{also known}} by other names {{including}} sinker, washbowl, hand basin and wash basin — is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture used for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes. Sinks have taps (faucets) that supply {{hot and cold}} water and may include a spray feature {{to be used for}} faster rinsing. They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or <b>shut-off</b> <b>device</b> and an overflow-prevention device. Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser. Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry also {{revealed}} that overloading of tankers was common practice at ENPETROL refineries. The Tarragona facility lacked either a meter to measure the amount of gas dispensed or an automatic <b>shut-off</b> <b>device</b> to prevent overfilling, and consequently most tanks were consistently overloaded. The driver was neither informed of the overloading, nor about the type and class of the cargo, {{and there was no}} means for him to check the pressure level of the tank before he departed or to monitor it in transit. He had not attended the HAZMAT training program for drivers of dangerous goods, because the company considered his experience of 20 years as a truck driver to be sufficient. The inquiry also determined that, between 3 January and 7 July that year, 32 tanks left the Tarragona refinery overloaded, with drivers other than Imbernón.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Current {{scientific}} knowledge {{does not cover}} all aspects of designing fishways on large German Federal Waterways. Therefore, the German Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG) and the German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) together with the responsible German Water and Shipping Authority (WSV) address research questions in a R 2 ̆ 6 D program, focusing on the link between hydraulics and fish behavior. The extensive R 2 ̆ 6 D schedule includes the investigation of necessary auxiliary discharge, the optimum entrance location in the tail water and several other aspects of fishway entrance design (e. g. connection to river bed, design of <b>shut-off</b> <b>devices)</b> {{as well as the}} evaluation of different fishway types. The above questions are particularly important where fishways compete with hydro-power plants in terms of attraction flow and available discharge. They can only be addressed adequately by the in situ evaluation of hydraulic parameters and fish behavior. Therefore, six fishway pilot sites are planned at barrages with hydro-power on major Federal Waterways. Two aspects complicate the planning in particular: In order to investigate the effects of variable auxiliary discharge (from base flow up to 5...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{reliable}} and safe operation of piping systems {{depends on the}} precision of parameter regulation of the conducting medium with a minimum energy expenditure. The authors analyzed the use of gate and wedge shut-off valves by operating organizations {{in the mode of}} regulation of parameters of working media. The unintended use of pipe fittings causes its rapid failure. The authors have developed, manufactured and tested <b>shut-off</b> and regulating <b>devices</b> that have broad capabilities in the implementation of the throughput characteristics and requiring to control a drive of a smaller capacity. When the device opens or closes the opening in the gate, a closed controlled valve acts as a bypass, as in the flow of a working medium through an orifice the pressure is aligned in the inlet and outlet nozzles. After pressure equalization (reducing pressure drop), the gate is unloaded and its lifting and lowering require less power, while for the <b>shut-off</b> and regulating <b>device</b> with the electric drive, the latter step requires with lower power consumption. On the basis of the energy created by slide gate valves saving <b>shut-off</b> and regulating <b>device</b> with a wide implementation in the throughput characteristics, methods of its calculation and experimental research and rational parameters are defined...|$|R

40|$|Rain sensors [...] {{also called}} rain {{shut-off}} devices [...] {{are designed to}} interrupt the cycle of an automatic irrigation system controller when a specific amount of rainfall has occurred. They are small devices wired to the irrigation system controller and mounted in an open area where {{they are exposed to}} rainfall. Some of the new irrigation controllers have a special connection which allows a rain sensor to be attached directly. If such a <b>shut-off</b> <b>device</b> is not available, or the sensor doesn't work with a given controller, the sensor can always be "hard-wired " into the controller. This is done by wiring the rain sensor in series with the common wire. When a specific amount of rainfall has occurred, the rain sensor will interrupt the system's common wire, which disables the solenoid valves until the sensor dries. Florida is the only state in the nation with an overall rain sensor statute. Beginning in 1991, this statute applies to all new automatic sprinkler systems: "Any person who purchases and installs an automatic lawn sprinkler system after May 1, 1991, shall install, and must maintain and operate, a rain sensor device or switch that will override the irrigation cycle of the sprinkler system when adequate rainfall has occurred " (Florida Statute 373. 662).

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the development and thermal design of a fast discharge system for balls for the PR 3000 MW$-{th}$ process heat reactor. The term "fast discharge system for balls" denotes a very short-time discharge procedure of the entire core contents, i. e. the flowing out of the fuel elements due to gravity into a-receiver tank underneath the prestressed-concrete vessel. From a safety-engineering point of view, the fast discharge system for balls constitutes an additional possibility of active decay heat, removal, besides the multiply redundant and diversitary reactor protection system, serving to further reduce the remaining residual risk. A fast discharge system for balls, however, is to be used only in the event of all the other possibilities of active decay heat removal having failed and when the maximum permissible temperatures for particularly exposed primary circuit components have been reached. However, the application range of such a system is restricted exclusively to high-temperature reactors with spherical fuel elements; the procedure cannot be applied tp-other /reactor^systems because ofthe rigidly fixed position of the fuel elements inside the core and for reasons of fuel element geometry. Besides the purpose of application, the influence of in-core temperature development on the possible actuation of the fast discharge system is being described in particular detail. This is followed by a description of the structural and thermal design of three specific major components, i. e. the piping system, <b>shut-off</b> <b>devices</b> and fuel element receiver tank, which will have to be installed additionally for the implementation of a fast discharge system for balls as compared to previous plant concepts...|$|R
40|$|On May 4, 2005, a 42 -year-old Guatemalan tree-service worker {{died after}} he was caught and pulled into a brush chipper. The victim was a day laborer {{who had worked for}} the tree service for {{approximately}} two weeks. On the day of the incident, the victim and his employer, the tree service owner, were trimming trees behind a residence. The owner had climbed a tree and was cutting branches and passing them down to the victim; the victim then fed the limbs through the brush chipper. After passing a few limbs to the victim, the owner heard the victim yelling and saw that he was being pulled into the chipper. The owner climbed down, discovered that the brush chipper had shut off, and that only the victim’s hand was visible in the feed chute. The owner immediately contacted the homeowner; 911 was called and emergency medical services arrived within minutes. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, employers should: � Ensure that workers fully understand and strictly follow the safe operating, trouble shooting, and machine maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturers when operating brush chippers; � Train workers in safe and proper feeding technique to avoid the hazard of being pulled into an operating brush chipper; � Ensure that the safety instructions and training are provided in a language that workers are able to comprehend; � Designate another employee as a safety watch to assist the brush chipper operator and; � Ensure that the area in front of the infeed hopper is free of tripping hazards. Additionally: � Brush chipper manufacturers should install additional safety features including emergency <b>shut-off</b> <b>devices</b> on brush chippers...|$|R
5000|$|A drain {{is defined}} as {{plumbing}} fitting installed on the suction side of a pump in a pool, spa or hot tub. Drains are now required to be [...] "unblockable." [...] This term has previously been defined in the [...] "definitions" [...] section. Four main ways of keeping a drain from being blockable are outlined as: large aspect covers, long channels, large outlet grates and circulation designs that do not include fully submerged suction outlets. In the United States, if a pool or spa does not employ an unblockable drain, it must include, at a minimum, {{one of the following}} safety systems: a safety vacuum release system (SVRS) as defined in [...] "definitions,' a suction limiting vent system with a tamper resistant atmospheric opening, a gravity drainage system that utilizes a collector tank, an automatic pump <b>shut-off</b> system, a <b>device</b> or system that disables the drain or any other system certified by the consumer product safety commission.|$|R
