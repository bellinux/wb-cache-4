25|$|Males of V. maculifrons tend to form loose aggregations, {{resembling}} leks, during mating. In one area, hundreds {{to thousands}} of males patrol prominent trees and bushes by constantly flying around them. Males typically patrol large areas randomly, rather than limiting to a few trees. If a male sees a female while patrolling, he flies closer to the female in a zigzag fashion and stops on a nearby leaf. This then allows the male to climb onto the female’s gaster from behind. Other males {{do not try to}} approach an ongoing copulation, but a male might try to copulate immediately after. If a <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> occurs, sperm competition may favor the second male. As a result, males can prevent competition from another male by elongating copulation.|$|E
25|$|Snails are hermaphrodites. Although {{they have}} {{both male and}} female {{reproductive}} organs, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and fertilize each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of courtship. Sometimes there is a <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a H. aspersa from southern France may reject a H. aspersa from northern France.|$|E

50|$|The second {{hypothesis}} claims that deception from the male flycatcher explains a female's choice {{to mate with}} an already-mated male despite the relative decrease in reproductive success. The deception arises from the polyterritoriality of the males, meaning that the males are able to deceive the females {{through the use of}} separate territories. This hypothesis attempts to describe why males have developed polyterritorial behavior. The typical long distances between nest sites suggest that males acquire multiple nest sites to facilitate the deception of the secondary female. A study showed that females leave the male upon discovering that he is already mated, as long as she discovers this fact before laying season. However, another experiment with European pied flycatchers in Norway produced results that refute the deception hypothesis. The secondary female birds in their study raised larger clutches than primary females. The study also showed that deception is not an evolutionarily stable strategy for males, because secondary females would notice the frequent visits to the primary females and then elect to choose another mate. According to the deception hypothesis, already-mated males display polyterritorial behavior that increases their chances of acquiring another mate. Unmated males were shown to display mating behavior, consisting mostly of singing, at their nest site. On the other hand, already-mated males would need to disrupt their singing at their secondary territories in order to return to their primary nest. This can occur {{both before and after the}} time of their <b>second</b> <b>mating.</b> As a result, it decreases the chance that females would be deceived, leading to an evolutionarily unstable strategy.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the hypothesis that the spennathecae of spiders affects the sperm precedence patterns in a predictable way (Austad 1984). Spermathecae come in two varieties: cul-de-sac and conduit. Cul-de-sac spennathecae, according to the hypothesis, are supposed to lead to second male sperm priority and conduit to first male sperm priority. The hypothesis was evaluated both directly and indirectly. Direct measurements were made of paternity in two species, Pholcus phalangioides and Tetragnatha montana, both of which are cul-de-sac species. It was found that P. phalangioides complies with the predicted precedence pattern and thus does not disprove the hypothesis. This second male priority pattern was despite a much shorter mating time by <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> males. In T. montana no precedence pattern was found, with equal likelihood of first or <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> males of gaining paternity. There was in T. montana a possible influence of the duration of mating affecting the precedence pattern, with longer mating males gaining a higher paternity no matter what order they mated in. It is discussed {{whether or not this is}} due to sperm loading or genitalic stimulation (Eberhard 1985). Indirect evaluation of the hypothesis included an analysis of mating behaviour in Zygiella x-notata which is a conduit species and was chosen as a comparison to the two cul-de-sac species. In Z. x-notata it was found that there was no difference between mating duration in first and <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> males. Mating persistence is thus the same in first and <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> males, suggesting that the males cannot detect that the female is a denuded resource to <b>second</b> <b>mating</b> males. Hence first male priority may not be a factor in this species. Other indirect methods of evaluating the hypothesis involved charting the incidence of mate-guarding and mating-plugs. The expected pattern of mate-guarding was for conduit species to pre-mate guard and for cul-de-sac species to post-mate guard, because of the predicted sperm precedence patterns associated with the spermathecae. The predicted pattern was not found. In the case of mating-plugs it was predicted that these should be deployed by cul-de-sac species because it is in these species that second males are able to usurp paternity to a large extent. The opposite pattern was found with mating-plugs of various design being utilized by conduit species. It is postulated that mating-plugs are the mechanism by which first male priorities are established in conduit species, where this pattern is found. The absence of plugs in cul-de-sac species is possibly the reason that second males can cuckold. The additional data collected since 1984 reveal that patterns of paternity found in spiders seem to be more complex than was originally assumed by Austad (1984). Spermathecae are species-specific in character and this may reflect a species specificity in sperm precedence patterns. Thus the conduit I cul-de-sac dichotomy may not reflect a useful prediction of paternity patterns. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: In the Mediterranean {{fruit fly}} (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, a highly {{invasive}} agricultural pest species, polyandry, associated with sperm precedence, is a recurrent behaviour in the wild. The absence of tools for the unambiguous discrimination between competing sperm from different {{males in the}} complex female reproductive tract has strongly limited the understanding of mechanisms controlling sperm dynamics and use. Results: Here we use transgenic medfly lines expressing green or red fluorescent proteins in the spermatozoa, which can be easily observed and unambiguously differentiated within the female fertilization chamber. In twice-mated females, {{one day after the}} <b>second</b> <b>mating,</b> sperm from the first male appeared to be homogenously distributed all over the distal portion of each alveolus within the fertilization chamber, whereas sperm from the second male were clearly concentrated in the central portion of each alveolus. This distinct stratified sperm distribution was not maintained over time, as green and red sperm appeared homogeneously mixed seven days after the <b>second</b> <b>mating.</b> This dynamic sperm storage pattern is mirrored by the paternal contribution in the progeny of twice-mated females. Conclusions: Polyandrous medfly females, unlike Drosophila, conserve sperm from two different mates to fertilize their eggs. From an evolutionary point of view, the storage of sperm in a stratified pattern by medfly females may initially favour the fresher ejaculate from the second male. However, as the second male’s sperm gradually becomes depleted...|$|E
