500|$|The {{strain of}} {{this seems to}} have gotten to Phips {{in a way that}} so many {{previous}} seemingly insurmountable challenges had not. In January 1693, Phips was involved in an embarrassing and unseemly physical altercation with his subordinate captain in the royal navy, Richard Short. Their accusations against each other in letters to Whitehall follow the standard lines of the Tarpaulin vs. Gentleman. Short is called a drunk, corrupt, unwilling to withstand hardships or obey direct orders. His lieutenant captain is accused of cowardice. Phips, as usual, is accused of having only a carpenter's education, poor manners, disregarding standard procedure (reminiscent of the journal of Knepp). [...] Phips pick for a replacement captain, Dobbins, is accused of the same. Phips is also accused of corruption, which was a <b>standard</b> <b>charge,</b> and a standard problem for colonial leadership at this time, but Phips having traded silver for paper after the fiasco of Quebec, and building his own ship to chase pirates in Maine, seems to take the teeth out of this accusation.|$|E

In Asia the wild boar is one of 12 animal images comprising the Chinese zodiac, while in Europe the boar represents a <b>standard</b> <b>charge</b> in heraldry.

2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 1 Pf. in 1960, {{followed}} by the 10 Pf. in 1963, and the 5 Pf. in 1968, the old style coins were gradually replaced with new coins depicting the state name [...] "Deutsche Demokratische Republik." [...] Aluminium 1 Mark, 2 Mark and 50 Pfennig pieces were released for circulation in 1956, 1957 and 1958, respectively. In 1969, brass 20 Pfennig coins were introduced, with nickel-bronze (later cupro-nickel) 5 Mark coins issued from 1968. In 1973 and 1974, 1 and 2 Mark coins were redesigned dropping the former [...] "Deutsche Mark" [...] title. The brass 20 Pfennig coins were issued partly because pay telephones had a <b>standard</b> <b>charge</b> of 20 Pf. and were having problems with smaller aluminium coins jamming due to their light weight. Commemorative 5, 10, and 20 Mark coins of various types have also occasionally made it into circulation.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>charge</b> is £11.50 {{for each}} day, for each {{non-exempt}} vehicle that travels within the zone, with a penalty of between £65 and £195 levied for non-payment. Since 1 July 2013 the Greener Vehicle Discount {{was replaced by}} the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED), which introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any vehicle that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the [...] for air quality. The ULED scheme was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads, which since 24 June 2016 pay the full congestion charge.

40|$|We {{show that}} there exists a class of charged BTZ-like black hole {{solutions}} in Lifshitz spacetime with a hyperscaling violating factor. The charged BTZ {{is characterized by a}} charge-dependent logarithmic term in the metric function. As concrete examples, we give five such charged BTZ-like black hole solutions and the <b>standard</b> <b>charged</b> BTZ metric can be regarded as a special instance of them. In order to check the recent proposed universal relations between diffusivity and the butterfly velocity, we first compute the diffusion constants of the <b>standard</b> <b>charged</b> BTZ black holes and then extend our calculation to arbitrary dimension d, exponents z and θ. Remarkably, the case d=θ and z= 2 is a very special in that the charge diffusion D_c is a constant and the energy diffusion D_e might be ill-defined, but v^ 2 _Bτ diverges. We also compute the diffusion constants for the case that the DC conductivity is finite but in the absence of momentum relaxation. Comment: 30 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
