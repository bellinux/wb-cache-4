40|$|Fr The Morelia-Acambay Fault System (MAFS) {{consists}} of a sequence of E-W and NNE-SSW trending normal faults within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The fault system is associated to the Chapala, Zacapu, Cuitzeo, Maravatio and Acambay lacustrine depressions. The E-W faults of MAFS appear to be 7 - 9 million yr old while the NNW-SSE faults are older and were reactivated producing stepped east-west geometry with a transtensional-right hand deformation. Seismic magnitudes of the E-W structures in the Morelia-Cuitzeo region are estimated. Cartography, structural geology, and trench stratigraphy of these faults suggest Holocene activity. Historical earthquakes disrupted paleosols containing Pirinda-Purepecha shards. These Historical earthquakes are also imprinted in <b>seisms</b> along E-W faults at Los Azufres geothermal field. In the Patzcuaro region, the E-W structures are also linked to strong seismic events occurred during prehistoric and historical times.

I show that all strong (~M 6 +) earthquakes of 2010 occurred during Earth's long (t > 3 days) astronomical alignments within our solar system. I then {{show that the}} same holds true for all very strong (~M 8 +) earthquakes of the decade of 2000 's. Finally, strongest (M 8. 6 +) earthquakes of the past century are shown to have occurred during Earth's multiple long alignments, too, whereas half of the high-strongest (M 9 +) earthquakes occurred during Full Moon. To add robustness, I include alignments to comet C/ 2010 X 1 (Elenin) as the only heavenly body currently in our solar system besides planets, and show that it impacted very strong seismicity since 2007. I conclude my empirical demonstration with a six-month, 100 %-successful forecast of M 6 + magnification, performed online in near real-time from October 2011 until April 2012, and which shows always the same, fractal pattern of intensifying-peaking-diminishing of strong earthquakes' strength during long alignments, and the absence of the pattern outside alignments. Days without killer quake can now be known exactly, amounting to several months a year of exact seismic forecast (telling with certainty there will be no strong <b>seisms</b> on that-and-that date). Approximate forecast of strength and timing of strong earthquakes is feasible for the rest of the year, as well as of location once the alignment starts. I thus verified my hyperresonator concept too, arrived at earlier as a mathematical-physical solution to the most general extension of georesonator. As gravity can now be expressed in terms of speed of light, hyperresonance is akin to tuning forks triggering each other at a distance, inferring the existence of aether required for propagation of mutually tuning (interfering) oscillations in Space.

40|$|A Las estructuras de deformación (ED) en sedimentos blandos comprenden las alteraciones que se producen casi simultáneamente con la sedimentación. Estos procesos se hallan en relación directa con las características internas de los materiales sedimentarios y de los factores externos que actúan sobre ellos. Sus resultados incluyen deformaciones como inyecciones, fracturas, volcanes y laminaciones convolutas que afectan total o parcialmente la estratificación. Los sedimentos blandos deformados por sismos se incluyen bajo la denominación general de sismitas (seismites). Como objetivo de esta investigación se plantea reconocer, por primera vez, estructuras de deformación ubicadas en la Formación Río Negro presentes en el sector norte del Golfo San Matías, en inmediaciones del Faro Río Negro. La metodología empleada consistió en el reconocimiento y descripción de las estructuras, para lo cual se extrajeron muestras para determinar granulometría, mineralogía y contenido de materia orgánica. Se fotografiaron los distintos sectores con deformaciones con el fin de establecer modelos comparativos. El sector estudiado, de 4 km de extensión, se ubica entre el faro de Río Negro y el inicio del Banco Verde y morfológicamente corresponde a un frente acantilado con orientación ENE-OSO. En él se determinaron las siguientes ED: a- de carga simple, pseudonódulos contiguos y aislados, y estructuras complejas; b- de escape de fluidos y c- estructuras de deslizamiento basal y por presión dirigida. El origen de las deformaciones se debe a las características de las sedimentitas y a los procesos que las afectan tales como los efectos por carga, escapes de fluidos y las presiones dirigidas. Como origen de estos procesos se señalan: la presión de la columna litológica, las olas de tormentas y los terremotos. Por los rasgos hallados las deformaciones del litoral rionegrino tendrían un origen sísmico, proceso ocurrido en un único evento durante el ciclo Andino cuyos inicios se fijan hace aproximadamente 45 Ma. Por otra parte sus techos y bases no se hallan asociados a otros procesos de deformación y sus espesores no exceden el metro de potencia. Además se hallan acotadas a la zona de transición entre los miembros medio y {{superior}} de la Formación Río Negro descansando en algunos casos sobre arcilitas y en otros sobre limolitas, originadas en un paleorelieve de interdunas. Soft-sediment deformation structures (SSD) are alterations produced almost {{simultaneously with}} sedimentation. They {{are directly related}} to internal characteristics of sedimentary materials as well as to external factors acting on them. Results derived from such alterations are evidenced as injections, fractures, volcanoes and convolute laminations, among other forms, affecting stratification either totally or partially. Soft-sediment deformation structures resulting from <b>seisms</b> are known as seismites. The present study aims at determining {{for the first time the}} presence of SSD structures in the Río Negro Formation, located in the northern area of San Matías Gulf, near Río Negro Lighthouse, Argentina (Fig. 1). To this end, structures were firstly identified and further described. Samples were subsequently collected for the determination of grain-size, mineralogy and organic matter content. Photographs of the different sectors evidencing deformations were taken in order to determine further comparative models. Morphology in the study area is associated to cliffs with vertical, fractured fronts and with an average height of 70 m in whose base torn-down blocks are accumulated. The geological structure of the study area is related to the Cuenca del Colorado and the Comarca Nordpatagónica, whose basement is mainly composed of Paleozoic and Mesozoic crystalline rocks. The sedimentary tertiary cover from the Miocene-Pliocene is represented by light-blue sandstones of the Río Negro Formation (Andreis, 1965). This unit was formed in an aeolian environment with intercalations of clay-silt shallow lagoons and a marine episode located in the mid area of the Río Negro Formation. At the top of the Río Negro Formation there are Pleistocene-Holocene sedimentites having a thickness of up to 5 m. Within the local structural framework of our study area there are fractures with a NE-SW and a NW-SE direction, which are related with fractures N 55 º, N 90 º and N 350 º azimuth located in the abrasion platform. According to Dzulinsky and Walton (1965), Lowe (1975), Brencley and Newall (1977), Clauss (1993), van Loon (2002), Owen (2003), Neuwerth et al. (2006), Alfaro et al. (2006), Montenat et al. (2007), among others (Table 1), and, taking into account the geometry of deformations, laboratory reconstructions and field observations from our study area, it can be concluded that the classifications of SSD structures tend to establish morphologic and genetic systematizations. The following characteristics were identified in our study area: limited deformations among stratigraphic horizons; a lateral continuity of SSD structures at considerable distances; and a confinement between non-deformed strata and its lithological association with psamitic-pelitic sediments. The study area, which is 4 km long and is located between Río Negro Lighthouse and the beginning of Banco Verde, is from the morphological point of view, a cliffed front with an ENE-WSW orientation. Different types of SSD structures were identified in this area. For example, from the morphological point of view and according to the loading mechanisms observed, simple-load structures (Fig. 2), attached and detached pseudonodules (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) and complex structures (Fig. 6) were identified. Furthermore, from the genetic point of view and according to the intrusion processes observed in soft sediments, water-scape structures (Fig. 7) and plate- or fountain-like deformations (Fig. 8) were found. From the genetic point of view, and based on the collapse and pressure mechanisms observed, basal slumping (Fig. 9) and directed-pressure structures (Fig. 11) were also found. The above-mentioned SSD structures were analyzed and interpreted following Strachan´s model (2002) (Fig. 10) and Laird´s model (1968) (Fig. 12). The origin of SSD structures depends on the characteristics of sedimentites and on the mechanisms that produce them. In the study area, the materials susceptible to deformation come from an interdune environment that is characterized by granulometric variations derived from the fluctuating and restrictive climatic conditions (Cojan and Thiry, 1992) that typify the Río Negro Formation. Fine-grained materials having low cohesion and poor sorting such as the sediments of deformed strata (Fig. 13) produced SSD structures as a result of high pore pressure and liquefaction effects (Tsuchida and Hayashi, 1971; Obermeier, 1996). Grain packing with a porous value as that allows intercommunication among grains and saturated material, is also crucial to the formation of SSD structures. The mineralogic content of deformed levels is composed of i) quartz, chalcedony, orthose, plagioclase, pyroxenes and biotite, opaques (magnetite and ilmenite, autigenic pyrite) in crystalline aggregates; ii) undetermined Fe oxides; and iii) colorless and light-brown unaltered volcanic glass shards, clays identified as smectite-illite interstratified and scarce kaolinite. Grains are mainly subangular and, to a lesser extent, sub-round and round. The surface of the majority of grains in the study area was found clean and with some marks. The percentage of CaCO 3 was found to vary from 0. 5 to 3 % and that of total organic carbon (TOC) was found to reach 1. 5 %. Deformations may be produced as a result of load deformation mechanisms, fluid escape, basal slumping or pressure-directed displacements. Due to load deformation mechanisms, structures are linked to gravity-related movements occurring during the initial stages of deposition. For these deformations to occur, grain-size at the overlaying levels should be thicker than at the underlying levels, for example, sandstones rather than silstones or claystones. These deformations are related to water saturation at the deformed level (fluidization-liquefaction). Therefore, deformation mechanisms, which involve both expulsion and rotation of fragments as well as fluid escape, are characterized by the action of lithostatic pressure which produces movement (deformation) and by the action of the underlying sedimentary levels. Deformations may also result from a fluid escape mechanism, i. e., from a mechanism associated to i) the spatial arrangement of grains (packing), ii) their shape, iii) their tendency to inequigranularity, and iv) the communication among macro- and micro- pores as well as the high or low sinuosity connection among themselves (Net and Limarino, 2000). Further requirements for deformations to occur include particular thixotrophic conditions, especially the presence of colloids among grains. The rupture of unions of particles either by hitting or by shearing is, among others, a cause which produces an unbalance between hydrostatic pressure and lithostatic pressure. If the latter is altered, the energetic unbalance makes fine sediments flow among the weakly lithified sandstones whose extrusion will occur via both vertical and horizontal pore ducts (Lopez Gamundi, 1986; Clauss, 1993). Basal slumping produces deformations that are associated not only to soft sediments deposited in natural slopes but also to interbedded sand- and mud-levels. Layers tend to have a prismatic-shaped geometry whose materials are under ductile-to-fragile conditions, in which antique layers support younger ones. Once horizontality is affected, movement, which is marked by a rupture of the original slope, begins. The lower levels are expected to transport the upper ones without affecting the original succession of layers. At the delay of movement derived from the compressive effect of the displacement front, fluids extrude forming cones or cut dikes (Fig. 10). Several deformations of this type initiate movement as result of differences in the hydrostatic gradient (Strachan, 2002). Deformations may be also produced as a result of pressure-directed displacements which are conditioned by the compaction level, thickness and ability of materials to deform. Thus, deformations occur because the original level is saturated in water as a result of the ductile behavior of materials (Bracco et al., 2005). Laird (1968) claims that SSD structures should meet some of the following requirements to be considered of seismic origin: slightly curved strata walls and floors to follow the original stratification and interruption of continuity of the stratum that is marked by a scar in which the sedimentary fillings keep their characteristics both above and below stratification. There could be rotated sediment clasts below the discontinuity as a result of a thrust-induced drag of the upper sedimentary packing. These processes could be, in turn, triggered either by the charge or pressure of the lithologic column, storm waves and seismicity. Storm-wave impact may also produce deformation in soft sediments. Nonetheless, no high energy structures such as cross-beddings or tsunami-type chaotic sedimentation were observed in our study area. Noteworthingly, for stormwave-derived liquefaction to occur, waves should reach magnitudes higher than 6 m (Alfaro et al., 2002), this being a phenomenon that was not recorded in our study area. Taken together, findings from the present study indicate that SSD structures in our study area are seismic alterations that occurred in an event during the Andean cycle whose beginnings are traced approximately 45 My ago. The fact that i) both the roofs and bottoms of these structures are not associated to other processes of deformation, ii) their thickness does not exceed one meter, and iii) they are confined to a transitional area between the middle and top members of the Río Negro Formation, lying in some cases on claystones and in some other cases, on siltstones, originated in an interdune paleorelief, confirms their seismic origin...|$|R

In this way the introducing of <b>seism</b> tectonic deformation concept is very important. It {{is based on the}} submission that the earthquake is a result of elastic deformations release accumulated owing to slow earth's interior movements. So to the earthquake responds some contribution to this movement. For this contribution determining such source parameters as focal mechanism and value of displacement are used [Yunga, 1990]. The rate of <b>seism</b> tectonic deformation (ε*ij) is k = K ε*ij = 1 / (µ∆V∆T) ⋅Σ 〈mij〉(k) M 0 (k) ⋅N(k) (1) k= 1 Where µ is shift module, ∆V is containing volume, ∆T is time interval, M 0 (k) is scalar seismic of the earthquakes in volume ∆V for time interval ∆T in k-th magnitude range, N(k) is number o...|$|E

40|$|In {{the terrace}} Te, of Constitución, many {{fractures}} and associated deformations of its platform {{appeared in the}} street pavements after the earthquake of 02. 27. 2010. On this basis, this work deals with the co-seismic deformation in this terrace, observed by means of survey of fractures and associated superficial deformations. The principal undulated and irregular surface of the terrace shows {{no difference between the}} profiles surveyed before and after the 2010 <b>seism,</b> with exception of those that represent a minor part in the northward sector. In exchange, the flagstones or slabs of pavement show brittle micro-deformations or pop up like array structures associated to micro fractures produced during the <b>seism.</b> There is great dissimilarity of size order between principal irregularities of the terrace surface (undulations) and micro-deformations. The principal irregularities of the terrace Te indicate that its undulated form is inherited and older than the <b>seism</b> of 02. 27. 2010. Only a minor part represents a 2010 co-seismic deformation with gentle warping of the inherited undulation during the <b>seism.</b> In exchange, the flagstone dislocations or brittle deformations shown as pop-ups like array are co-seismic microforms. They appear only as small tectonic deformations in the epidermis of the inherited undulated surface. Their apparent random distribution is possibly the result of a complex interaction between the seismic waves and the inherited topography, producing strain structures...|$|E
