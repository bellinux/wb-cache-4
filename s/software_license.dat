5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Bell Labs' new owner Lucent Technologies dropped {{commercial}} {{support for the}} project and in 2000, a third release was distributed under an open source license. A fourth release under a new free <b>software</b> <b>license</b> occurred in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of Fourth edition on April 2002, the full source code of Plan 9 from Bell Labs was freely {{available}} under Lucent Public License 1.02, which is considered to be open source license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), free <b>software</b> <b>license</b> by the Free Software Foundation, and it passes the Debian Free Software Guidelines.|$|E
5|$|The Steam client {{includes}} a digital storefront called the Steam Store through which users can purchase computer games. Once {{the game is}} bought, a <b>software</b> <b>license</b> is permanently attached to the user's Steam account, allowing {{him or her to}} download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user's location. From December 2010, the client supports the Webmoney payment system, which is popular in many European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Starting in April 2016, Steam began accepting payments in Bitcoin, valued based on the user's geolocation, with transactions handled by BitPay. The Steam storefront validates the user's region; the purchase of titles may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the Steam Translation Server project offers Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client, storefront, and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-seven languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific game titles such as Team Fortress 2, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items. In February 2015, Steam began to open similar options for in-game item purchases for third-party games.|$|E

25|$|GNOME {{was started}} on August 15 1997 by Miguel de Icaza and Federico Mena {{as a free}} {{software}} project to develop a desktop environment and applications for it. It was founded in part because K Desktop Environment, which was growing in popularity, relied on the Qt widget toolkit which used a proprietary <b>software</b> <b>license</b> until version 2.0 (June 1999). In place of Qt, the GTK+ toolkit {{was chosen as the}} base of GNOME. GTK+ uses the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a free <b>software</b> <b>license</b> that allows software linking to it to use a much wider set of licenses, including proprietary software licenses. GNOME itself is licensed under the LGPL for its libraries, and the GNU General Public License (GPL) for its applications.|$|E

25|$|In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman {{has spent}} most of his time advocating for free {{software}}, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital restrictions management, and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included <b>software</b> <b>license</b> agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats and binary executables without source code.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{versions}} of BSD incorporated proprietary AT Unix code and were, therefore, subject to an AT <b>software</b> <b>license.</b> Source code licenses had become very expensive and several outside parties had {{expressed interest in}} a separate release of the networking code, which had been developed entirely outside AT {{and would not be}} subject to the licensing requirement. This led to Networking Release 1 (Net/1), which was made available to non-licensees of AT code and was freely redistributable {{under the terms of the}} BSD license. It was released in June 1989.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{difference}} between Linux {{and many other}} popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software. Linux {{is not the only}} such operating system, although it {{is by far the most}} widely used. Some free and open-source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft, a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free <b>software</b> <b>license,</b> the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU Project.|$|E
25|$|The {{license is}} {{in this case a}} <b>Software</b> <b>license</b> {{agreement}} in which is stated how the customer is permitted to use the product. For example it can state how many users are permitted to use the software product. In this situation the license agreement is a contract or a certificate which is the customers prove of its using permits. The software vendor has its own part of the agreement which in most cases is stored in a system. An elaboration of this part {{can be found at the}} receive feedback section of this article. The license agreement shipped to the customer can be a digital document as well as a physical document.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Apple relicensed Squeak twice. First, in May, Apple {{used its}} own Apple Public Source License, which {{satisfies}} the Free Software Foundation's {{concept of a}} Free <b>Software</b> <b>License</b> and has attained official approval from the Open Source Initiative as an Open Source License. The Apple Public Source License, as it turns out, fails to pass the third standard that Free and Open Source Software licenses are held to: the Debian Free Software Guidelines promulgated by the Debian project, an influential volunteer-run Linux distribution. To enable inclusion of Etoys in the One Laptop Per Child project, a second relicensing was undertaken using the Apache License. At this point, an effort was also made {{to address the issue}} of code contributed by members of the Squeak community, which it was not in Apple's power to unilaterally relicense.|$|E

This thesis looks into the aspect of legal awareness, and the impact it has on <b>software</b> <b>licensing</b> behavior. It also looks into the other factors which would affect <b>software</b> <b>licensing</b> behavior in Sri Lanka. It is an awareness study to see if any of the identified factors {{has an impact on}} the <b>software</b> <b>licensing</b> behavior of vendors (licensor) and users (licensee). The results indicate that though end users (corporate and home) and vendors are aware of the legalities with respect to <b>software</b> <b>licensing,</b> their knowledge has no bearing on the licensing behavior been used. Users tend to practice incorrect <b>software</b> <b>licensing</b> behavior. Socio-cultural aspects affect both user and vendor groups.

However, Wilson criticized the <b>software</b> <b>license</b> that only permits installation on three PCs, contrasting it with Iolo System Mechanic 10, a competing product that allows an unlimited number of installations in the same household.|$|E
500|$|FreeBSD is {{released}} under {{a variety of}} open source licenses. The kernel code and most newly created code {{is released}} under the two-clause BSD license which allows everyone to use and redistribute FreeBSD as they wish. This license was approved by Free Software Foundation and Open Source Initiative as a Free Software and Open Source license respectively. Free Software Foundation described this license as [...] "a lax, permissive non-copyleft free <b>software</b> <b>license,</b> compatible with the GNU GPL". There are parts released under three- and four-clause BSD licenses, as well as Beerware license. Some device drivers include a binary blob, such as the Atheros HAL of FreeBSD versions before 7.2. Some of the code contributed by other projects is licensed under GPL, LGPL, CDDL and ISC. All the code licensed under GPL and CDDL is clearly separated from the code under liberal licenses, to make it easy for users such as embedded device manufacturers to use only permissive free software licenses. ClangBSD aims to replace some GPL dependencies in the FreeBSD base system by replacing the GNU compiler collection with the BSD-licensed LLVM/Clang compiler. ClangBSD became self-hosting on 16 April 2010.|$|E
500|$|New machinima filmmakers often {{want to use}} game-provided digital assets, {{but doing}} so raises legal issues. As {{derivative}} works, their films could violate copyright or be controlled by the assets' copyright holder, an arrangement that can be complicated by separate publishing and licensing rights. The <b>software</b> <b>license</b> agreement for The Movies stipulates that Activision, the game's publisher, owns [...] "any and all content within... Game Movies that was either supplied with the Program or otherwise made available... by Activision or its licensors..." [...] Some game companies provide software to modify their own games, and machinima makers often cite fair use as a defense, but the issue has never been tested in court. A potential problem with this defense is that many works, such as Red vs. Blue, focus more on satire, which is not as explicitly protected by fair use as parody. Berkeley adds that, even if machinima artists use their own assets, their works could be ruled derivative if filmed in a proprietary engine. The risk inherent in a fair-use defense would cause most machinima artists simply to yield to a cease-and-desist order. The AMAS has attempted to negotiate solutions with video game companies, arguing that an open-source or reasonably priced alternative would emerge from an unfavorable situation. Unlike The Movies, some dedicated machinima software programs, such as Reallusion's iClone, have licenses that avoid claiming ownership of users' films featuring bundled assets.|$|E
