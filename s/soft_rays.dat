40|$|The {{exact nature}} of the solar flare process is still {{somewhat}} a mystery. A key element to understanding flares if {{the relationship between the}} hard x rays emitted by the most energetic portions of the flare and the <b>soft</b> x <b>rays</b> from other areas and times. This relationship was studied by comparing hard x ray light curved from the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) with the <b>soft</b> x <b>ray</b> light curve and its derivation from the Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) {{which is part of the}} X-Ray Polychrometer (XRP), these instruments being on the Solar Maximum Mission spacecraft (SMM). Data sample was taken from flares observed with the above instruments during 1980, the peak of the previous maximum of solar activity. Flares were chosen based on complete coverage of the event by several instruments. The HXRBS data covers the x ray spectrum from about 25 keV to about 440 keV in 15 spectral channels, while the BCS data used covers a region of the Spectrum around 3 angstroms including emission from the Ca XIX ion. Both sets of data were summed over their spectral ranges and plotted against time at a maximum time resolution of around 3 seconds. The most popular theory of flares holds that a beam of electrons produces the hard x rays by bremsstrahlung while the <b>soft</b> x <b>rays</b> are the thermal response to this energy deposition. The question is whether the rate of change of <b>soft</b> x <b>ray</b> emission might reflect the variability of the electron beam and hence the variability of the hard x rays. To address this, we took the time derivative of the <b>soft</b> x <b>ray</b> light curve and compared it to the hard flares, 12 of them showed very closed agreement between the <b>soft</b> x <b>ray</b> derivative and the hard x ray light curve. The other five did not show this behavior but were similar to each other in general <b>soft</b> x <b>ray</b> behavior. Efforts to determine basic differences between the two kinds of flares continue.

25|$|The dorsal and ventral {{profiles}} of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two lines intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of eight moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 22 to 25 <b>soft</b> <b>rays.</b> The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 18 to 21 <b>soft</b> <b>rays.</b> The terminal <b>soft</b> <b>rays</b> of both the anal and dorsal fins are nearly {{twice as long as}} the penultimate rays, forming distinctive finlet-like structures, although are still attached to the main fin structure by interradial membranes. The lateral line is slightly arched anteriorally, with the intersection of the curved and straight section occurring below the sixth to eighth dorsal soft ray. The curved section contains between 39 and 57 scales, while the straight section has no to 10 scales and 36 to 49 scutes. Another of the major distinguishing features of the species is an adipose eyelid which fully encloses the eye except for a small vertical slit over the pupil. This feature is only observable in individuals greater than 10cm, as juveniles below this length are still developing the eyelid. Both jaws have a single row of small teeth, although two or three rows of small canine teeth are present in older individuals. There are 37 to 44 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae. The yellowtail scad is a small species in comparison with many of the other fishes within the Carangidae, reaching a recorded maximum length of only 30cm, although is more often encountered around 20cm.|$|E

Its body shape is like the jacks of the genus Caranx, being more elongated and subcylindrical {{than most of the}} othe species of Carangoides. As a juvenile, the fish is more subovate, becoming more elongated with age, with the dorsal profile of the head and nape becoming steeper with age also. The dorsal fin is in two distinct parts, the first consisting of eight spines, while the second is composed of one spine and 25 to 30 <b>soft</b> <b>rays,</b> with the anterior lobe of this fin being shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine attached to 21 to 26 <b>soft</b> <b>rays</b> and the pelvic fin has one spine and 18 to 19 <b>soft</b> <b>rays.</b> The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch, which is slightly longer than the straight section of the lateral line, with the intersection below the 13th to 16th soft ray of the dorsal fin. The curved section contains 80 to 88 scales, while the straight section consists of 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is scaleless until the origin of the pelvic fins and up to the origin of the pectoral fins, although some individuals have a narrow band of scales separating the pectoral fins. In adults, the mouth cleft is directly beneath the eye, with the both jaws containing bands of villiform teeth. It has 22 to 27 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The fin anatomy {{is highly}} useful for {{identification}} purposes, with the species having 11 spines {{in the first}} dorsal fin, with one spine and 20 to 23 <b>soft</b> <b>rays</b> on the second dorsal fin.

Lateral line scales and cheek scales are also distinctive, with northern whiting possessing 66 to 72 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 3–4 rows, {{all of which are}} ctenoid. The amount of vertebrae are also diagnostic, having 34 in total. The swim bladder is the most accurate diagnostic feature, having two posterior extensions and two anterior extensions. The two anterior extensions extend forward and diverge to end {{on each side of the}} basioccipital above the auditory capsule. Two lateral extensions also commence anteriorly, each of them sending a blind tubule anterolaterally and then extending along the abdominal wall. The lateral extensions are normally convoluted and have blind tubules arising along their length. The two posterior tapering extensions project into the caudal region, with one usually longer than the other.|$|E
