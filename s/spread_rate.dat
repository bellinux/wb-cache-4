50|$|Fire {{can have}} {{negative}} effects such as presenting {{the opportunity for}} noxious and invasive plants to take over. Invasive plants can compete with native plants for water and soil causing {{the death of the}} native plants. The death of native plants leads to a loss of habitat and less food for native animals causing their populations to shrink. Invasive plants can affect the growth and <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> of wildfires based on the invasive plant’s moisture content, location, and type of fuel. An example of an invasive species {{in the area of the}} Beaver Creek Fire is cheat grass, Bromus tectorum. Cheat grass sprouts before Idaho’s native plants, thus taking growth area away from native plants and habitat away from native animals. Cheat grass affects fires in the area because it grows in a continuous bed of grass, unlike the local grasses that grow in patches, which can be burned through more rapidly than native grass causing faster moving fires.|$|E
50|$|Wheatgrass {{has also}} {{previously}} {{been shown to}} be beneficial for forage uses. This may be because it can be seeded with legumes in both warm and cool seasons. Elymus lanceolatus has specifically been used for animal foraging. Though E. lanceolatus does not produce a nut or berry product, it can be consumed by grazing animals. In the spring, it is a preferred food source for elk, horses, and cattle. It is additionally beneficial because it has a rapid vegetative <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> even though its rate of spreading seeds is slow. Humans have not eaten E. lanceolatus because studies suggest that it may inedible for human consumption. However, it has a medium protein nutritive potential. Its protein levels are highest in the spring, at around 20%. This protein content decreases to about 4% as the plant matures. The amount of carbohydrates that can be digested (in animals) are about 45% in the growth period of E. lanceolatus. The USDA Plants Profile page suggests that E. lanceolatus is not palatable to humans.|$|E
5000|$|P. pinaster is {{a popular}} topic in ecology because of its {{problematic}} growth and spread in South Africa for the past 150 years after being imported into the region {{at the end of}} the 17th century (1685-1693).

The pine tree species invades large areas and more specifically fynbos vegetation.

50|$|Wind {{speed and}} land slope, like a {{mountain}} where the Beaver Creek Fire took place, influences fire behavior, specifically {{the spread of}} the fire. Wind makes fire grow faster. As wind speed increase, {{the spread of the}} fire increases more quickly and can help increase the intensity of the fire. Fire can even create some of its own wind to disperse the heat downward from the heart of the flame to the unburnt fuel ahead of the fire, which helps in the rate of spread of the fire and increases the longevity of the fire. Some argue that the increase in the <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> of the fire from the windy conditions {{has to do with the}} increased oxygen supply in the fire. Others argue that this is not true because of the fact that fires need a sufficient amount of oxygen to even start. Without wind, it is easier to stop a fire due to the fire not being pushed forward. Slope of land increases the spread of fire only and not the intensity. The reason for this is gravity pushes the fire down so that the area in front of the fire is heated up quicker and able to burn faster allowing the fire to burn more area in a period of time up a slope, even without wind, than just on flat ground.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the tail}} of the Hindenburg crashed into the ground, a burst of flame came out of the nose, killing nine of the 12 crew members in the bow. There was still gas in the bow section of the ship, so it {{continued}} to point upward as the stern collapsed down. The cell behind the passenger decks ignited as the side collapsed inward, and the scarlet lettering reading [...] "Hindenburg" [...] was erased by flames as the bow descended. The airships gondola wheel touched the ground, causing the bow to bounce up slightly as one final gas cell burned away. At this point, most of the fabric on the hull had also burned away and the bow finally crashed to the ground. Although the hydrogen had finished burning, the Hindenburgs diesel fuel burned for several more hours.The time that it took from the first signs of disaster to the bow crashing to the ground is often reported as 32, 34 or 37 seconds. Since none of the newsreel cameras were filming the airship when the fire started, the time of the start can only be estimated from various eyewitness accounts and the duration of the longest footage of the crash. One careful analysis by NASAs Addison Bain gives the flame front <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> across the fabric skin as about 49 ft/s at some points during the crash, which would have resulted in a total destruction time of about 16 seconds (245m/15 m/s=16.3 s).|$|E

As per the data available to them, Hilde and Lee (1984) adopted the two-phase spreading model mainly because {{they believed that the}} roughness of the seafloor increases near the CBF rift. This was interpreted as a slower <b>spreading</b> <b>rate.</b> The area between approximately 14.5 ° and 15.5 ° N near 130 ° E is such an example; however, this may have been caused by the reorganization associated with slight changes in the spreading direction rather than a slower <b>spreading</b> <b>rate</b> (Deschamps et al. 2002, 2008). Okino and Fujioka (2003) described long-lasting discontinuities extending from the CBF rift to the northern and southern WPB along with pseudo-faults related to eastward ridge propagations. Furthermore, the CBF rift may have been reactivated after the cessation of spreading (Fujioka et al. 1999).
