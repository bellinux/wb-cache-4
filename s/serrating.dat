50|$|Yefim Alekseyevich Cherepanov (1774-1842), {{and his son}} Miron Yefimovich Cherepanov (1803-1849) were Russian inventors and {{industrial}} engineers. They were serfs of the Demidovs - a famous family of factory owners. In 1810s, Yefim built a progressive machine-building plant, equipped with {{a full range of}} innovative metal-cutting lathes (such as screw-cutters, gear-cutting <b>serrating</b> machines and others). From 1822 until his death, Yefim was chief mechanic for all the factories in the town of Nizhny Tagil. Miron was his apprentice and in 1819 was appointed his deputy. Miron became chief mechanic his father's death.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} to the problem of glare is a matte finish on the sights. <b>Serrating</b> or bead blasting the sight is a common solution for brightly finished sights, such as blued steel or stainless steel. Matte finishes such as parkerizing or matte black paint can also help. [...] "Smoking" [...] a sight by holding a match or cigarette lighter under the sight to deposit a fine layer of soot is a common technique used by many shooters, and in fact special soot producing cigarette type lighters are sold for use by competition shooters. Even a thin layer of mud or dirt applied to the sight will help kill the glare, as long as the coating is thin and consistent enough not to change the shape of the sights.|$|E
50|$|In service, {{some trouble}} was {{experienced}} with transmission shaft joints and with worn cams and rollers. If the valves were set {{with the engine}} cold, {{there appeared to be}} some distortion under working conditions due to the high temperature of superheated steam which caused deterioration of the valve events. Drivers also reported that, when the engines were standing or moving at very slow speed, it was difficult to reverse since the cam rollers were not readily able to climb over the inclined surfaces leading from one cam to another. Trouble was also experienced with steam leaking past the tappet spindles into the cam boxes where it boiled up the oil and caused it to overflow from the cam boxes. This was overcome by <b>serrating</b> the collars of the spindle bushes to allow the steam to escape and prevent entry into the cam boxes.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster is an {{excellent}} model system to identify genes involved in synaptic growth and function. In Drosophila, the <b>Serrate</b> (Ser) gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a ligand for Notch receptor. Several previous studies implicated a role for <b>Serrate</b> in normal wing development and patterning. In this study, I demonstrate that <b>Serrate</b> is required for normal synaptic growth and function. I characterized the phenotype of a <b>Serrate</b> mutation (serB 936) that was identified by an EMS-induced genetic screen aimed at identifying novel genes that {{play a role in}} synaptic growth and function. Co-localization studies show that <b>Serrate</b> protein is expressed at both the pre- and postsynaptic side of larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Mutations in ser impair synaptic transmission at larval NMJs. This defect is entirely presynaptic, as nerve-evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJP) and quantal content (QC) of neurotransmitter release are significantly reduced when compared to wild-type control. Further, mutations in ser also alter the growth of the NMJ and the underlying muscle. Mutations in ser significantly reduce the size of larval body wall muscles (length and surface area) as well as the number and size of synaptic boutons, and the number of secondary axonal branches. Ubiquitous or muscle-specific expression of normal <b>Serrate</b> in serB 936 mutants restores a normal muscle size but not a normal size and structure of the innervating NMJ. However, expression of normal <b>Serrate</b> in the motor axon restores a normal number of synaptic boutons and secondary branches at serB 936 mutant NMJs. In addition, it restores normal neurotransmitter release. These data suggest that <b>Serrate</b> protein is required presynaptically for normal synaptic growth and function. Interestingly, overexpression of <b>Serrate</b> in a wild type background resulted in similar phenotypes than to those of loss-of-function mutants. In conclusion, these data suggest a new functional role for <b>Serrate</b> in synaptic growth and function...|$|R

5000|$|The {{artifacts}} {{discovered in}} the deepest levels {{are associated with the}} Archaic period (ca. 10,500-4,400 B.C.); these consisted of microblade techniques and cobble stone tools, including gravers and scrapers [...] The origins of these stone tools are believed to have come from Siberia [...] and became popular throughout Alaska. Dating was conducted on different strata deposits and it suggested that the stone tools were found to date approximately 9500 B.C. The excavation yielded different artifacts which contained utilized and non-utilized flakes, scrapers, microcores and pebble choppers. These artifacts were radiocarbon dated at 9860 ± 75. Many of these tools were primarily used for cutting, <b>serrating,</b> or hunting, such as the pebble chopper. The pebble chopper consisted of a rounded stone that was repeatedly hit with another stone to create a serrated crest that was used to chop subsistence resources or used as a crude hunting tool. The microblade was a tradition used by people that were likely specialized in fishing and sea hunting.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three parts: I. The Surface Impregnation of Wood; II. Use Characteristics of Impregnated wood; and III. Investigations of Resin Adhesives. The {{material}} presented in Part I is a continuation of previous experimentation that had established general methods for producing a hardened surface wood product. The methods involved parting of the wood fibers on the surface by a special <b>serrating</b> tool, followed by a surface impregnation and final curing. This section presents work carried on to determine the optimum conditions for <b>serrating</b> and subsequent impregnation. The effect of species on impregnation. and the impregnation of unfinished lumber were also investigated. In Part II are presented the results of investigations of the commercially important properties of the surface impregnated wood products. These include surface hardness. sanding, moisture resistance, and gluing characteristics. Techniques for veneering this product are also given. The investigations of resin adhesives described in Part III were of two types: (1) the effect of various conditions of precure and final cure upon the strength and bond characteristics obtained with wood; and (2) the degree of cure as indicated by per cent extractables. The former study was carried out {{to determine whether or not}} the temperature and time of precure are critical in their effect upon adhesive bonds. and also to find whether pressure is necessary for the final cure. The latter was made to obtain recommendations for curing conditions now used in commercial production...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} {{of the theory of}} the synthesis of offset dual-shaped reflectors to the design of compact ranges is examined. The object of the compact range is to provide a uniform plane wave with minimum amplitude and phase ripple over as large a volume as possible for a given size reflector. Ripple can be lowered by reducing the edge diffraction from the reflector producing the plane wave. This has been done either by <b>serrating</b> or rolling the edge. An alternative approach is to use dual offset-shaped reflector synthesis techniques to produce a reflector aperture distribution that is uniform over most of the aperture, but with a Gaussian taper near the edge. This approach can be used together with rolling and/or serration if desirable. The amount of phase and amplitude ripple obtained with two different dual-shaped reflector designs is studied as a function of position in the plane wave zone and reflector size in wavelengths. The amount of both transverse and longitudinal (z-component) cross polarization is studied...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results on}} {{methods used to}} produce a hard surfaced wood product. The methods involve the parting of the wood fibers on the surface by a special <b>serrating</b> tool, followed by surface impregnation and final curing. The serrations on the wood surface produce an artificial grain upon curing. A preliminary investigation was made to improve the rot-resistance of wood by gaseous treatment. Results of such treatments show some limited success with formaldehyde on yellow poplar and warrant further study. An investigation was made to find a substitute for teak wood used on submarine decking. A number of combinations of woods and impregnating agents were prepared and tested under simulated ocean conditions. The results of those tests indicate that a maple-mahogany laminate, when treated with the proper agent, will compare favorably with teak. The optimum curing conditions of several phenolic resin adhesives are presented as determined by an acetone extracting procedure. The results are presented for an attempt to replace the acetone extraction procedure by an x-ray diffraction method. X-ray diffraction patterns are presented of wood, -cellulose, and a phenolic adhesive. The viscosity characteristics of mixed Cascophen LT- 67 phenolic adhesive are given.

40|$|In the beginner’s mind {{there are}} many possibilities; in the expert’s there are few. —Shunryu Suzuki Recently I moved to Las Cruces in the {{southern}} part of New Mexico. My new home lies in the Mesilla Valley of the Rio Grande, as it courses muddy through the Chihuahuan desert, North America’s largest but least celebrated arid land. The Organ Mountains rise to the east, <b>serrating</b> the dawn’s liminal blue. In the fi rst few weeks of my residence, I made some tentative contacts with the landscape on a series of short hikes, toting my 16 -month-old boy, Riley, in a backpack. The “beginner’s mind,” the elusive skill to look without preconceptions, to perceive originally, is an ideal in Zen and in haiku poetry. Moving to a new place, especially one so different from prior experiences, can nudge one toward that ideal. Of course I’ve read about this place, even passed through a time or two, so it is not entirely new, and I am certainly burdened with preconceptions, expectations, fears; but still, I am a neophyte, greenhorn, scurfed with innocence. Yet, while haiku poetry nurtures a beginner’s mind, it also does so in a landscape that is familiar, not exotic. Traditionally, the audience for Japanese haiku knew the look, sound, and scent of each plant named, each animal mentioned, each landscape traversed, and had read hundreds, thousands of haiku on the same subject. Can the allusive form work here? The intimate haiku of plum blossoms, bush warblers, crows, and crickets—will it get lost in the vastness of basin and range, the vocabulary of bajada and playa, piñon and nopale, ocotillo and arroyo, acacia and mesquite? Can it speak in the prickly dialect of desert words, so remote from the verdant Japanese diction...|$|E
