40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and empirical analysis of stable coexistence among the world's anchor currencies (G 3) : the dollar, euro and yen. The theoretical model {{presented in this paper}} builds on a model of spatial competition and rests on a set of assumptions related to the behavior of central banks, the working of exchange rate regimes, the geography of money, and international monetary arrangements. We show that stable coexistence {{in the sense of the}} pure-strategy equilibrium derived in our model is attainable in the case of two anchor currencies, but not in the case of three. The empirical evidence provides support for the assumptions and conclusions of the model.

40|$|The {{revival of}} a {{multilateral}} exchange rate system (ERS) with one single anchor currency and binding global rules for national exchange rate management {{is not a}} viable or realistic option. It is more realistic that the present 3 -polar ERS in the medium term could dynamically enlarge to a 4 -polar - {{in the long run}} even to a multipolar - system especially when taking China into account. In this view, the global ERS is likely to be extensively characterized by a small number of competing anchor currencies (currency oligopoly) which float vis- 0 -vis each other and to which pegs and managed floats are attached (<b>satellite</b> <b>currencies).</b> Globalisation contradicts international monopolies including monopoly currencies. Globalisation stimulates international competition including anchor currency competition. This paper underlines that this is why there is no way back to Bretton Woods or to any similar system based on only one single world anchor currency...|$|R
