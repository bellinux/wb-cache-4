25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of.

Love recalls that he [...] "was not happy" [...] when this would occur—except {{in the case of}} Roger Christian, whose special knowledge of motor jargon he says benefited the group's car songs. Cultural historian Kevin Starr explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: [...] "Cars and the beach, <b>surfing,</b> <b>the</b> California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound." [...] The group's [...] "California Sound" [...] grew to national prominence through the success of their 1963 album Surfin' U.S.A., which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image widely exploited by the film, television, and food industry.|$|E
