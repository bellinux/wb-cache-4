50|$|The first {{historic}} {{people to}} settle the upper-Bosphorus were Thracians and Greeks and the ancient name for the area was Amikos (Αμικός in Greek) or Amnicus (Αμνικός), named after a Thracian king. However, the area has changed hands many times since. As well as {{being one of the}} most strategically important crossing points in history, the Bosphorus itself has always been rich in fish and opportunities for plundering the even richer communities around the Marmara, and Beykoz has been <b>settled</b> by <b>wave</b> on wave of invaders from around and beyond the Black Sea: Thracians, Bithynians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and finally Turks.|$|R

50|$|Uromi, {{originally}} {{known as}} 'Uronmun', {{is the largest}} and most populated area in Esanland, <b>settled</b> by two <b>waves</b> of people. The first wave consisted of migrants from Benin and other outlying areas between 900 and 1400 AD. These early settlers formed a loose-knit community engaged mostly around farming and hunting and did not develop any stylized form of government; associations were instead based on kinship and occupation. Many of these early Bini settlers were fugitives fleeing persecution from the harsh rule of the Ogiso of Benin, and were wary of monarchical government.|$|R
50|$|From its inception, Gilo has {{provided}} housing to new Jewish immigrants {{from around the}} world. Many of those who spent their first months {{in the country at}} the immigrant hostel in Gilo, including those from Iran, Syria, France and South America, chose to remain in the neighborhood. Since the large influx of Soviet Jews in the 1990s, Gilo has absorbed 15% of all immigrants of that <b>wave</b> <b>settling</b> in Jerusalem. The immigrant hostel is now the site of an urban kibbutz, Beit Yisrael. Gilo is a mixed community of religious and secular Jews, although more Haredi families are moving in.|$|R
50|$|From the 16th to 20th centuries many Fulani {{communities}} {{settled in}} the highlands of the Jos Plateau, the Western High Plateau of Bamenda, and Adamawa Plateau of Nigeria and the Cameroons. These are the highest elevated places in West Africa, and their altitude can reach up to 8,700 feet above sea level. The highland plateaus have a more temperate climate conducive for cattle herding activities, which allowed Fulbe populations to <b>settle</b> there in <b>waves</b> of migrations from further west. Though most Fula now live in towns or villages, {{a large proportion of}} the population is still either fully nomadic, or semi-nomadic in nature.|$|R
50|$|Little Mexico is {{a former}} {{neighborhood}} in Dallas, Texas, encompassing the area bordered by Maple Avenue, McKinney Avenue and the MKT (Missouri, Kansas, Texas) Railroad.

50|$|<b>Settled</b> by {{successive}} <b>waves</b> of arrivals {{during the}} last 10,000 years, California {{was one of the}} most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. Various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000. The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.|$|R
50|$|Columbus Square was <b>settled</b> by {{successive}} <b>waves</b> of immigrants. The first wave, a {{group of}} German Catholics, settled {{in the vicinity of}} 11th and Biddle Streets. Later, the first Irish immigrants colonized the land around 6th and Biddle, an area that subsequently became St. Patrick's parish. After 1840, the area from the river west to 12th Street was built up with high-density tenement quarters, row houses of two and three stories high, for the newly arriving immigrant laborers. Many of these structures fell before the wave of commercial and industrial development that began after the Civil War. Regardless, of those that remained, most had deteriorated into decrepit, overcrowded slums as early as 1870.|$|R

The second group were refugees of First World War and sought new land to avoid the war. Many of the group desired to return to Paraná, but settled in the area permanently due to the difficulty of the voyage from Siberia. The German residents were unaccustomed to the food and climate of southern Brazil. Other settlers came to the area {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. In 1964 Caibi, a district of Palmitos, became a separate municipality.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century, this area was <b>settled</b> by new <b>waves</b> of {{immigrants}}, mostly from Germany and Poland. A 1940 article was written about the 59th wedding anniversary of Charles Schatzschneider and his wife; they had been immigrants who settled in this area. Charles Schatzschneider was born in Germany in 1859 and came at the age of 13 to the United States as a farm laborer. He settled in Rosedale, where he later married. He and his wife raised 15 children. During their lives they saw the area develop from a rather primitive rural community to one with gas and electric lighting, water and sewerage systems and paved streets. New electric trains passed rapidly through the community. When this couple had first come to the area, great three-masted schooners could sail all the way up Back River to the heading.|$|R

When people think of Australia they imagine open space and bush. But really most Australians inhabit or were born in suburban spaces, often with backyards with fences, big enough for fruit trees, lawns and clotheslines. I consider this a place of absence that speaks to many things that our culture avoids. The backyard as emblem of a White Australia that hit its highpoint in the 1950 s, for example. Australia is a migrant culture <b>settled</b> by <b>waves</b> of newcomers escaping, running away from somewhere else, leaving to forget. Another story concerns the continued invisibility of the indigenous people. When the British first planted the Union Jack on Australian soil and said "there is nothing here" {{they set up a}} tradition of denial as our founding principle. This still plagues us. What is festering in Australian backyards are these denials and erasures that I try to bring out in the soundtrack, that plays like the radio that meanders through a lazy Sunday afternoon. Such sounds try to tell stories of absence, of occupation, and of a nostalgia for an Australia that no longer exists, but still palpably reverberates around the suburban backyard...|$|R
