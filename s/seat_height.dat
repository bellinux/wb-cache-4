The proposed study will directly measure changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> for crewmembers in the Shuttle cockpit. An anthropometer will be used to record measurements to the top of the head of a seated subject, and an orthogonal photograph will be taken in order to measure <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> based on scaling references of known sizes as well as verify the posture and positioning remained consistent throughout the study.

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{physiological}} factors, such as spinal elongation, fluid shifts, bone atrophy, {{and muscle}} loss, occur during an {{exposure to a}} microgravity environment. Spinal elongation {{is just one of}} the factors that can also affect the safety and performance of a crewmember while in space. Spinal elongation occurs due to the lack of gravity/compression on the spinal column. This allows for the straightening of the natural spinal curve. There is a possible fluid shift in the inter-vertebral disks that may also result in changes in height. This study aims at collecting the overall change in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. During previous Programs, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) and Skylab, spinal elongation data was collected from a small number of subjects in a standing posture but were limited in scope. Data from these studies indicated a quick increase in stature during the first few days of weightlessness, after which stature growth reached a plateau resulting in up to a 3 % increase of the original measurement [1 - 5]. However, this data was collected only for crewmembers in standing posture and not in a <b>seated</b> posture. <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> may have a different effect than standing height due to a change in posture as well as due to a compounded effect of wearing restraints and a potential compression of the gluteal area. <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> was deemed as a critical measurement in the design of the Constellation Program s (CxP) Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), called Orion which is now the point-of-departure vehicle for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program; therefore a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> is necessary. Potential changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous Programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the Orion [...] The current and existing configuration is such that the four crewmembers are stacked two by two with the commander and pilot seats on the top and the two remaining seats underneath, thereby limiting the amount of clearance for the crewmembers seated in the bottom seat. The inner mold line of these types of vehicles are fixed due to other design constraints; therefore, it is essential that all seats incorporate additional clearance to account for adequate spinal growth thereby ensuring that the crew can safely ingress the seat and be strapped in prior to its return to earth. If there is not enough clearance to account for spinal growth deltas between seats then there is the potential that crewmembers will not be able to comfortably and safely fit into their seats. The crewmember in the bottom stacked seat may even have negative clearance with the seat above him or her which could lead to potential ingress/egress issues or potentially injury of the crewmember during landing. These impacts are specific to these types of vehicles with stacked seat configuration. Without proper knowledge of the amount of spinal elongation, or growth, which occurs due to microgravity and space flight, the design of future vehicle(s) or suits may cause injury, discomfort, and limit crew accommodation and crew complements. The experiment primarily aimed to collect <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, and feed new information regarding the effect of elongation of the spine forward into the design of the Orion. The data collected during the experiment included, two <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> measurement and two digital pictures of <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> pre-, in-, and post-flight. In addition to <b>seated</b> <b>height,</b> crewmembers had an optional task of collecting stature, standing <b>height.</b> <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> data was obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 ISS increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female, 20 males), and whose mean age was 48 years (4 years). This study utilized the last six Shuttle flights, STS- 128 to STS- 134. The results show that partipating crewmembers experienced growth up to 6 % in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> and up to 3 % in stature. Based on the worst case statistical analysis of the subject data, the recommended <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> growth of 6 % will be provided to the designers as the necessary <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> adjustment...|$|R
40|$|Within this {{experimental}} study, {{we compare}} the anchorage stability of 3 {{state of the}} art press-fit cups to a press-fit design with 6 additional radially arranged, curved fins called Ana. NovaÂ® cup. Method: The 4 types of press-fit cups (Ana. NovaÂ® [ImplanTec], AllofitÂ® [Zimmer], ReflectionÂ® [Smith & Nephew], Monoblock [Zimmer]) are pressed into rigid polyurethane foam, a test medium for human cancellous bone produced by SawbonesÂ®. The reaming of the cavity in the foam is performed using a common surgery reamer with required diameter. The cups are pressed into the cavity until they reach the desired <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> of 0 -, 2 - or 4 mm. Afterwards a force is applied vertically {{on the rim of the}} cups until loosening or outbreaking occurs. The required load is recorded and the results are statistically evaluated. Results: The highest primary stability for every tested cup is registered at <b>seating</b> <b>heights</b> of 0 mm and 2 mm. At insufficient <b>seating</b> <b>heights</b> of 4 mm, we find a strongly decreased stability in the process of loosening and outbreaking. The AllofitÂ®-, ReflectionÂ®- and Monoblock cups are showing similar patterns of behaviour for loosening at every <b>seating</b> <b>height.</b> The 6 -finned Ana. NovaÂ® cup requires more power for loosening and outbreaking than the regular press-fit cups at every <b>seating</b> <b>height.</b> The maximum difference between the Ana. NovaÂ® cup and the conventional cups occurs during outbreaking at insufficient <b>seating</b> <b>height</b> of 4 mm. The results of this experimental study indicate a high primary stability of the Ana. NovaÂ® cup at regular and insufficient <b>seating</b> <b>heights.</b> The empiric set-up restricts the possibility of statistical interpretation, however there is a potential of an explorative interpretation. Evaluation of results: The design of the Ana. NovaÂ® hybrid cup provides a higher anchorage stability. This may base upon the 6 additional fins. Most likely, these fins intrude the acetabular bone and hence influence the periacetabular structure more than the conventional press-fit cups. This might lead to increased bone loss in comparison to conventional press-fit cups, which is not further discussed throughout this study but could be of interest for future research. Recommendation: Itâs possible that the Ana. NovaÂ® cup shows a high primary stability and deep anchoring in the subchondral bone in vivo. Potentially the Ana. NovaÂ® cup offers an alternative in case of reduced bone quality, pathological configured acetabula, the revision of hip joint alloarthroplasty and osteoporotic bone conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{new vehicle}} for future space {{travel to the}} International Space Station (ISS) and beyond will be highly {{dependent}} on the seat layout. A primary concern with the seat layout design of the new vehicle {{is the amount of}} <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> growth that occurs in space; this could cause a major accommodation issue. The design of the seats, seat layout, suit fit, and crew accommodation are all critically affected due to the increase in height that occurs in microgravity. The increase in height due to spinal elongation caused by the absence of gravity could lead to inadequate clearances that would have implications for the ability of crewmembers to return safely or to conduct nominal operations during the mission. This study was designed {{to reduce the risk of}} inadequate design of the vehicle, environment, tools, equipment, etc. (SHFE risk 2. 3. 1. 1) and safely return crewmembers to earth from low-earth orbit travel, ISS, and beyond. In order to safely return the crewmembers, the design requirements must anticipate microgravity growth, elongation of the spine, bone and muscle loss, fluid shifts, etc. Thus, this study is to determine the amount of torso growth (spinal elongation) for a seated posture during Shuttle and ISS missions. Crewmembers <b>seated</b> <b>heights</b> were collected before, during, and after spaceflight to quantify the amount of growth that occurred as a result of microgravity. The changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> will provide the designers with a design requirement which allows for change in spinal growth for a seated posture.

40|$|The Constellation Program's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is {{required}} to accommodate the full population range of crewmembers according to the anthropometry requirements stated in the Human-Systems Integration Requirement (HSIR) document (CxP 70024). <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> {{is one of many}} critical dimensions of importance to the CEV designers in determining the optimum seat configuration in the vehicle. Changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> may have a large impact to the design, accommodation, and safety of the crewmembers. <b>Seated</b> <b>height</b> can change due to elongation of the spine when crewmembers are exposed to microgravity. Spinal elongation is the straightening of the natural curvature of the spine and the expansion of inter-vertebral disks. This straightening occurs due to fluid shifts in the body and the lack of compressive forces on the spinal vertebrae. Previous studies have shown that as the natural curvature of the spine straightens, an increase in overall height of 3 % of stature occurs which has been the basis of the current HSIR requirements. However due to variations in the torso/leg ratio and impact of soft tissue, data is nonexistent as to how spinal elongation specifically affects the measurement of <b>seated</b> <b>height.</b> In order to obtain this data, an experiment was designed to collect spinal elongation data while in a seated posture in microgravity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide quantitative data that represents the amount of change that occurs in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> due to spinal elongation in microgravity environments. Given the schedule and budget constraints of ISS and Shuttle missions and the uniqueness of the problem, a methodology had to be developed to ensure that the <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> measurements were accurately collected. Therefore, simulated microgravity evaluations were conducted to test the methodology and procedures of the experiment. This evaluation obtained seat pan pressure and <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> data to a) ensure that the lap restraint provided sufficient restraint to eliminate any gap between the subject s gluteal surface and the seat pan and b) to document any necessary design and procedural changes needed due to the microgravity environment. The methodology and setup used during the simulated microgravity evaluations was replicable to the proposed methodology and setup for in-space missions. A flight-like Shuttle seat, pressure sensors, anthropometer, and existing hardware was used to measure <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> and contact area while experiencing microgravity. The outlying buttock and thigh surface contact areas were collected to determine if the subjects were in contact with the seat pan, while a measurer recorded their <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> with an anthropometer. The Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) completed data collection from three microgravity flights to assess the restraint methods and techniques to be used for the in-flight procedures performed by the crewmembers in orbit. The first flight demonstrated that the restraint system on the seat, used in a nominal configuration, did not sufficiently restrain a person in the seat. The results showed the subjects were not in full contact with the seat pan, resulting in inaccurate sitting height data. Thus, a second flight was conducted to test different restraint system options. The results showed that by 1) changing the restraint system from the nominal 3 -points of the 5 -point harness, which is used for crewmembers when fully suited with emergency equipment, and 2) rerouting the lap straps around the joint of the backrest, where the backrest and seat pan are joined, resulted in the optimal method to restrain a subject. This rerouting method allowed for the anchor location to change and pull the subjects back into the seat instead of being anchored at the side of the subjects thighs. The results from the third flight validated the final restraint system, which resulted in a verified methodology for collecting seated anthropometry to ultimately determine the amount of spil elongation in a microgravity environment...|$|R

40|$|The Constellation Program is {{designing}} a new vehicle for future space {{travel to the}} International Space Station and to the Moon and beyond. One major accommodation and design issue {{that needs to be}} addressed with the current seat layout design is spinal elongation. Spinal elongation is the spinal growth that occurs due to straightening of the spinal curve and expansion of the inter-verbal discs in microgravity. Spinal elongation is critical to the design of the seats, seat layout, suit fit, and crew accommodation because of the implications it can have on the a safe return of the crewmembers or during the mission. Inadequate clearance between crewmembers and/or between crewmember hardware interfaces may potentially result in injury during the mission or upon returning to earth. Therefore, design requirements need to be determined that will allow for the elongation of the spine. The current requirement as specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirement (HSIR) document states that a 3 % increase in standing height must be accommodated. However, it cannot be assumed that the amount of standing height growth is equivalent to the amount of spinal elongation because of the variation in body proportions between the lower body and torso. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the amount of spinal elongation for a seated posture for 6 Shuttle and 7 ISS missions. Crewmembers <b>seated</b> <b>heights</b> were collected before, during, and after spaceflight to determine the change in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> and the amount of spinal growth that occurs due to microgravity. The changes in <b>seated</b> <b>height</b> will provide the designers with a design requirement that will allow for change in spinal growth for a seated posture.
