25|$|Inward opening {{doors are}} doors {{that can only}} be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a {{substantial}} fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards {{in the event of an}} emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a <b>switch</b> <b>mechanism,</b> disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.|$|E
500|$|Reich was {{influenced}} by the work of the Austrian internist Friedrich Kraus, who argued in his paper Allgemeine und Spezielle Pathologie der Person (1926) that the biosystem was a relay-like <b>switch</b> <b>mechanism</b> of electrical charge and discharge. Reich wrote in an essay, [...] "Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung" [...] ("The Orgasm as an Electrophysiological Discharge", 1934), that the orgasm is just such a bioelectrical discharge and proposed his [...] "orgasm formula": mechanical tension (filling of the organs with fluid; tumescence) → bioelectrical charge → bioelectrical discharge → mechanical relaxation (detumescence).|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} {{synthetic}} antiferromagnets (SAFs) can be efficiently switched by spin-orbit torques (SOTs) and the switching scheme does not obey the usual SOT switching rule. We show {{that both the}} positive and negative spin Hall angle (SHA) -like switching can be observed in Pt/SAF structures with only positive SHA, depending on the strength of applied in-plane fields. A new <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> directly arising from the asymmetric domain expansion is proposed to explain the anomalous switching behaviors. Contrary to the macrospin-based switching model that the SOT switching direction is determined by the sign of SHA, the new <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> suggests that the SOT switching direction is dominated by the field-modulated domain wall motion and can be reversed even with the same sign of SHA. The new <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> is further confirmed by the domain wall motion measurements. The anomalous switching behaviors provide important insights for understanding SOT <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and also offer novel features for applications.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{strategy}} for sensor fault tolerant control of rotor wound induction motors operating as stand alone generators. The strategy employs three <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that detect faults in, respectively, rotor current sensors, stator current sensors and stator voltage sensors. Each of the <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> receives measurements from the three phases and builds three residual quantities by combining these measurements pairwise. At each sampling time, the pair of measurements that yield the smallest value of the residual quantity are selected by the respective <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> to implement a vector control law. The switching selection is such that measurements from faulty sensors are automatically avoided and only healthy measurements are used for control.

2500|$|One {{possibility}} is that bilinguals initially {{make a decision about}} the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers found that bilinguals can comprehend passages composed of words entirely from only one language more quickly than passages composed of words from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the <b>switch</b> <b>mechanism</b> will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition in choosing which language information to use. The later lexical completion {{can also be used to}} explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages. [...] However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing. showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E. found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.|$|E

40|$|Bitstream {{switching}} is {{an effective}} way to deal with bandwidth variation in transmitting multimedia over time-varying channels. A number of bitstream <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been proposed to reduce the potential error drift introduced by bitstream switching, often without explicitly taking into account the impact of the switching on the bandwidth and delay requirements in their performance analysis. This paper studies the relative rate-distortion (R-D) performance of some of these bitstream streaming mechanisms by extending a delay-aware R-D optimized dynamic bitstream switching framework we previously proposed. By considering different <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> we show that the proposed extended R-D based framework can adaptively choose the right <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> and effectively <b>switch</b> at the right time to the right bitstream to achieve optimized rate-distortion performance...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{construction}} of many small switches, the spring that stores the mechanical energy necessary for the snap action of the <b>switch</b> <b>mechanism</b> is made of a beryllium copper alloy that is hardened to form a spring {{as part of the}} fabrication of the contact.

The switching between different redox states in both oxides is achieved without the need for physical electrical contact by controlling the magnitude and polarity of the applied voltage between the STM tip and the sample surface. We demonstrate for TaO[subscript x] films that two <b>switching</b> <b>mechanisms</b> operate. Reduced tantalum oxide shows resistive switching due to the formation of metallic Ta, but partial oxidation of the samples changes the <b>switching</b> <b>mechanism</b> to one mediated mainly by oxygen vacancies.
