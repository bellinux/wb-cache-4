5000|$|In 1954, the USAF {{started to}} develop the YTM-61C version which was {{equipped}} with the new <b>Shanicle</b> (Short Range Navigation Vehicle) guidance system. It became operational in 1957 and used ground-based microwave emitters to generate hyperbolic grids for range and azimuth, which were used by the missile guidance system to navigate. Now the guided range could be extended to the maximum flight range of the missile, about 620 mi. Anecdotal evidence indicated that the <b>Shanicle</b> system was very accurate, with stories of one missile flying into {{the ground in the}} same crater left by a previous missile during an early exercise in North Africa. These {{may or may not be}} true, but in any case the <b>Shanicle</b> system was soon discontinued on operational missiles. By the late 1950s, all were using the MSQ-1 (called [...] "MisCue-1" [...] by the crews) ground-based guidance system.|$|E
5000|$|A unique {{identifying}} {{feature of}} the TM-61C variant was the raised rear section of the fuselage above the jet exhaust, called the [...] "doghouse" [...] by those who {{were assigned to the}} missile squadrons. This had originally housed the <b>Shanicle</b> electronics, but was retained when those systems were removed. The [...] "doghouse" [...] had no access panels or doors and was an aerodynamic structural component added to TM-61C and TM-76A to prevent missile [...] "shudder" [...] and breakup during terminal dive. It contained no functional components. The operational Matadors were zinc chromate green in their final versions, but this doghouse was quite often left natural aluminum, as were the wings and tail group.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/MSQ-1A {{developed}} by the Reeves Instrument Corp. Missile was by the Glenn L. Martin Company, but was the MSQ-1A by the Reeves Instrument Corporation. Company included the AN/MPS-19 automatic tracking radar and an alternating current analog OA 626 plotting computer & board vice the DC computer of the preceding AN/MSQ-1 Close Support Control Set with MPS-9 & OA-132 manufactured for Korean War bombing (cf. AN/MSQ-2 also {{developed by}} Rome Air Development Center with MPS-9 & DC OA-215.) [...] The AN/MPS-19 was {{a variant of the}} radar used in the Western Electric M-33 Antiaircraft Fire Control System that achieved a longer MARC range via circuitry for receiving the beacon return from an airborne transponder. Instead of, or in addition to, Matador Automatic Radar Control, the last Matador variant (TM-61C) added <b>SHANICLE</b> passive radio guidance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expanse of}} Libyan desert was used {{first by the}} 701st TMW, then later its successor, the 38th Tactical Missile Wing, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), {{beginning}} in October 1954, with three separate live launch operations {{for all of the}} operational squadrons using the TM-61 Matador. Operations Suntan (October 1954), Sunburst (June 1955), and Sunflash (March 1956) became annual qualification firings for all Matador squadrons based in Europe. There were 36 Matador launches from Wheelus in 1957, while there were only 13 launches at Cape Canaveral and only 25 from Holloman AFB in Alamagordo, New Mexico during the same time. The 1958 exercise from October 6 through the 19th of November, called [...] "Operation Marblehead," [...] utilized 19 C-130 Hercules and seven C-124 Globemasters just to move the 339 personnel and equipment of the 71st TMS from Bitburg to Wheelus and back. C-47 twin engined transports carried personnel back and forth as well. Not only did the 71st take 13 missiles and the required launchers and checkout vans, but also two complete MSQ units, plus personnel to back up the two <b>Shanicle</b> base units that were permanently installed at Wheelus. The exercise was followed by similar deployments from Hahn Air Base, and later Sembach Air Base, all units of the newly formed 38th TMW. The exercises were moved to Patrick AFB, FL, in 1959 for launches at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
