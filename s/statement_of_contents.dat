40|$|The pourpose of this work, {{started with}} the Progetto Verde Milano in 2004, is the {{definition}} of the measuring procedure and of the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> to use to implement the topographic database of the green areas with the ones step by step acquired by the Administration of Milan. The data thus collected will respect the conditions that allow the correct updating of the GIS of the green areas. The statement has been edited at first to allow the conversion from CAD files, which cannot be used to implement a thematic GIS, into a shapefile, which is the proper file for a GIS. The document is divided in three parts: 1. technical statement for topographic measuring; 2. contents statement; 3. supplying and graphic reproduction of data. The first part defines the aspects concerning the topographic measuring, specifying the operative steps of the measure taking, the instruments to use, the metrical precision required for every different kind of objects and the positioning procedure in the correct coordinate system. The second part concerns the structure of the database and the definition of the thesaurus of the objects to be measured, {{in such a way that}} they correspond to those used in the GIS of the green areas. The third part defines the features of the measuring output, in order to test the conformity of the final data to the measuring and contents specificatios. The structure of this statement makes possible the creation of omogeneous files from different sources. In this way the implementation with new areas follows unique and standard procedure and can be easily managed, as well as correctly represented in the correspondent WebGIS. The format and the contents are conform to the indications IntesaGIS and to the Regional content statement...|$|E

In Chapter 1, I outline the reasons for my focus on this topic and discuss my personal viewpoints and background. A brief rationale for this topic is then suggested, followed by a review ofthe literature. Although a fmite definition of visual language is neither possible nor desirable, a working defmition is offered based on my work to this point. Relevance to classroom practice is crucial so a close examination of the Senior High English <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Content</b> (Revised 1981) and the Alberta Education Program of Studies for English Language Arts Kindergarten to Grade 9 is also undertaken.

The pragmatic outlook on update and support also allows us to escape from some of the objections that has been raised against first order analyses of natural languages connectives, notably that of conditionals as material implication. The adopted outlook furthermore provides inspiration for a plausible analysis of functional dependencies and of certain cases of what has been called quantificational and modal subordination. 1...|$|R

Great lengths were taken, including the posting of a reward for information, to ascertain whether gunpowder was stored in the warehouse; but all evidence pointed against it.

Variations in emphasis, fresh <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> and product <b>of</b> a liberal education, occurred in the five or six periods into which historians divide the epoch of European civilisation from ancient Greece to the modern period. In all cases the ideal never varied appreciably, although the means were at times mistaken for the end.

As it often happens after movements of reform have reached a certain intensity, there appeared a reaction, conflict and adjustment in thought and activity, particularly in the field of secondary education.

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} examine to which extent the media {{coverage}} of the Grimhøj Mosque fulfills the journalistic standards, as set forth by the Danish Press Council, and thereafter discuss the possible causes of these results. This <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>content</b> is explored through a comprehensive analysis of all articles regarding Grimhøj written by six major newspapers in Denmark; Politiken, Jyllands-Posten, Weekendavisen, Kristeligt Dagblad, Information and Berlingske Tidende between January 2014 and February 2015. Daniel C. Hallin’s theory regarding ‘media spheres’ is utilized and further developed in order to create the analytical framework for the quantitative content analysis, which serves as the project’s main method. This framework allows a categorization where the analyzed articles are either placed in the sphere of consensus, deviance or legitimate controversy, through which it is possible to evaluate to which extent the articles live up to the journalistic standards. A supplementary quantitative analysis of journalistic sources is also conducted in order to examine the usage of different sources in the coverage. The analytical results show that 58 percent of the articles are within the sphere of deviance, which indicates that Grimhøj is viewed journalistically as an actor which represents illegitimate values, wherefore they should (to a certain extent) be excluded from the public agenda. The articles within this sphere are characterized by criticized parties not getting the chance to respond, biased phrasing and an unclear distinction between facts and comments; All in all factors which are directly contrary to the journalistic standards. The remaining 42 percent of the articles are within the sphere of legitimate controversy. Additionally, the analysis illustrates that there is a preponderance of political sources compared to eg. sources of experience who are greatly underrepresented in the coverage under scrutiny. Moreover the results show that Grimhøj as a source in many cases is not contacted directly; instead their earlier statements are reused by journalists. This project does not conclusively state a final explanation to the causes of these results, however supplies a list of possible causes, including among others: 1. Grimhøj is conceived as a threat to Danish consensus values, wherefore the media has a responsibility to uphold them, 2. The media is largely influenced by political statements, which in this case often are negative by nature and 3. Practical circumstances such as tight deadlines and language barriers...|$|R
