5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming {{out in front of}} his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E
25|$|Westside is HISD's Magnet School for Integrated Technology. The program allows {{students}} to look at technology from one of five aspects: Fine Arts, Business, Media Relations, Applied Science/Health Science, and Computing Sciences. During the first year, all Magnet students take a technology survey course, a modular course that introduces them to the five strands of the program. The second year, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> choose {{one of the five}} strands on which to focus their elective courses.|$|E
25|$|In school, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} many {{tasks and}} activities, {{many of which}} involve handwriting. Many children with CP {{have the capacity to}} learn and write in the school environment. However, students with CP may find it difficult {{to keep up with the}} handwriting demands of school and their writing may be difficult to read. In addition, writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student's part. Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability, sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand, and writing tool pressure.|$|E

30|$|A {{total time}} period of 1  h was allotted to the {{students}} for learning the topic. At {{the end of the}} hour, a new physical phenomenon was presented to the student by means of a simulation depicting its microscopic explanation. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> interact with a simulation depicting the working of a PN junction diode in reverse biased conditions. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> answer post-test questions related to the new phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|Pimsleur {{language}} learning system {{is based on}} the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher Paul Pimsleur. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.|$|E
25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> answer all of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E
500|$|All {{students}} must sign a [...] "Statement of Faith" [...] before they enroll, affirming belief {{in what the}} college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge [...] "Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity.... Man is by nature sinful and is inherently in need of salvation, which is exclusively found by faith alone in Jesus Christ and His shed blood.... Christ's death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins." [...] The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs, informed by Evangelical Protestantism.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} each module, the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} a project that is then assessed by a mentor.|$|R
5000|$|The Challenge progressed in two stages. In {{the first}} stage, {{training}} dataset of simulated sensor data, {{along with the}} underlying ground-truth data, <b>was</b> provided to <b>students.</b> This allowed them to train their algorithm. In the next stage, a test dataset consisting of only sensor data <b>was</b> provided <b>to</b> <b>students.</b> <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> run their trained algorithm on this dataset & submit results. In addition, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> submit a description of their algorithm and code.|$|R

500|$|The program {{usually has}} 40–50 first-year students, 15 {{advanced}} students, and 15 counselors. Students are admitted by application—which includes {{a set of}} mathematical questions—or by showing [...] "a great eagerness to learn". First-year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars. They are encouraged to think like scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed, which occupies most of their free time. Ross designed the daily problem sets, and many questions contain his signature directions: [...] "Prove or disprove and salvage if possible." [...] Successful <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> return as students and counselors in future summers. Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first-years with their questions. They also can take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars. Student problem sets are graded daily by the live-in counselors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} {{developmental}} stage (14 {{years old and}} up), children in Waldorf programs are supposed to learn through their own thinking and judgment. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> understand abstract material and expected to have sufficient foundation and maturity to form conclusions using their own judgment. [...] The intention of the third stage is to [...] "imbue children with {{a sense that the}} world is true".|$|E
2500|$|Students {{sometimes}} resist critical pedagogy. Student {{resistance to}} critical pedagogy {{can be attributed}} to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} <b>was</b> to compre <b>student</b> 2 ̆ 7 s {{recognition}} of casemanager 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and functions that students felt appropriate under the ecomap condition and non-ecomap condition respectively. 　Under the former condition, the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read a case that needs casemanagement. Under the latter, the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read a case and to understand its ecomap. Under both conditions, the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate how much they felt appropriate about each of the items regarding casemanager 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives and functions. The results showed that the students under the ecomap condition recognized ecological perspective sand functions (such as meadiation, mobilization of resources, and connection) more appropriately than did they under the non-ecomap condition. 　That suggested that the ecomap of case helped students recognize casemanager 2 ̆ 7 s ecological perspectives and functions based on it...|$|R

2500|$|Although not a requirement, some {{students}} may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee {{in order to be}} considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP Undergraduate Research Journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the journal. [...] UROP is comparable to similar programs at other large universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, and the University of Michigan.|$|E
