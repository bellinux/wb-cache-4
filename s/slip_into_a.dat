He finished as runner-up three times, in 1953, 1954 and 1961, but perhaps his best chance of victory came in 1946, when he shot a final round 80 to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tie for 4th place.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{spent the}} rest of his time at Lichfield looking for a {{position}} at the other local schools, and, after being turned down for a position in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, he spent his time with his friend, Hector. Hector lived in the home of Thomas Warren, on High Street, Birmingham, and Johnson was invited to stay there as a guest in the autumn of 1732. Warren was at that time starting his Birmingham Journal, and he enlisted Johnson's help, although no copies of the essays he wrote for the paper now survive. His stay with Hector and Warren was not to last, and Johnson moved into the house of a man named Jarvis on 1 June 1733. During this time, Johnson started to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> [...] "state of 'absence and he began to treat his friends with [...] "abuse".|$|E

2500|$|Chappell {{was happy}} for brother Ian to captain the WSC Australian team, which {{allowed him to}} {{concentrate}} on his batting. In the first season of WSC, he returned to type with 661 runs {{at an average of}} 60. The Australians struggled against the array of talented players assembled to represent the West Indian and World teams, and the emphasis on fast bowling destroyed the confidence of many batsmen, who took to wearing helmets for safety. Chappell eventually opted for a helmet with temple guards only – he never wore one with a grile. [...] He never missed an opportunity to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cap when facing medium pace or spin.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare uses {{language}} {{to distinguish between}} different types of characters. The courtly scenes tend to be spoken in blank verse, whereas the commons tend to speak in prose, with fewer metaphors and less decorative language (Shakespeare uses this contrast in several plays, such as The Two Gentlemen of Verona, where prose marks the servants out from their masters). When power begins to go to Jack Cade's head, he begins to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more courtly way of speaking. This is most noticeable in his adoption of the 'royal we', using phrases such as [...] "our jurisdiction regal" [...] (4.7.24), and [...] "we charge and command" [...] (4.7.116).|$|E

With the aid of Cobra-La and the Dreadnoks, Serpentor escapes and gets his revenge during a second attempt to obtain the BET machine. Duke is critically wounded when Serpentor impales him in battle. We see Scarlett holding him as he asks his half brother Falcon to become a better soldier. His injuries cause him to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coma. This makes the second time that Duke has lapsed into a coma - the first being in [...] "The Traitor" [...] two-part story, where his condition prevents him from letting the other Joes in on Dusty's triple-agent status.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Kočić {{relocated}} to Skopje with his family, but {{was forced to}} return to Vienna after falling out with the local Serbian archimandrite. The following year, {{he and his family}} moved to Sarajevo, where Kočić became the general secretary of Prosveta (Enlightenment), a Serb cultural society. In 1906 and 1907, he led several demonstrations, including a general strike and a protest targeting a Croatian newspaper. The latter incident prompted the authorities to issue Kočić with an ultimatum, constraining him to leave Sarajevo or face arrest. He was arrested by the Austro-Hungarians in 1907 for publishing an anti-Habsburg tract in the newspaper Otadžbina (Fatherland), and sentenced to seven months' imprisonment. Further criticisms of the Austro-Hungarian administration in the newspaper resulted in his arrest and imprisonment on two subsequent occasions. He spent the majority of his imprisonment in solitary confinement, which caused him to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep depression.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, 1924, a coup {{led by the}} warlord Feng Yuxiang {{took control}} of Beijing. Feng, the latest of the warlords to take Beijing was seeking {{legitimacy}} and decided that abolishing the unpopular Articles of Favorable Settlement was {{an easy way to}} win the approval of the crowd. The [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment" [...] were unilaterally revised by Feng on November 5, 1924, abolishing Puyi's imperial title and privileges, and reducing him to a private citizen of the Republic of China. Puyi was expelled from the Forbidden City that same day. Puyi was given three hours to leave the Forbidden City. Puyi spent a few days at the house of his father Prince Chun, and then temporarily resided in the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Puyi left his father's house together with Johnston and his chief servant Big Li without informing Prince Chun's servants, who followed them in another car while two policemen joined on the sides of Puyi's car, leading to a wild car chase through Beijing as Puyi's chauffeur tried to lose the servants' car before Puyi was able to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> jewelry store and into a carriage that took him to the Japanese legation. Puyi had originally {{wanted to go to the}} British Legation, but the Japanophile Johnston had insisted that he would be safer with the Japanese. For Johnston, the Japanese system where the Japanese people worshiped their emperor as a living god was much closer to his ideal political system than the British system of a constitutional monarchy, and he constantly steered Puyi in a pro-Japanese direction. One of Puyi's advisers Lu Zongyu-who was secretly working for the Japanese-suggested that Puyi move to Tianjin, which he argued was safer than Beijing, through the real reason was that the Japanese felt that Puyi would be easier to control in Tianjin without the embarrassment of having him live in the Japanese Legation, which was straining relations with China. On 23 February 1925, Puyi left Beijing for Tianjin while wearing a simple Chinese gown and skullcap as he was afraid of being robbed on the train.|$|E

500|$|Ethnic {{characters}} were portrayed against stereotype in Massacre (1934). The protagonist (Richard Barthelmess) is a Native American who performs in a Wild West Show in full Indian garb, but then <b>slips</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> suit and speaks in American slang once {{the show is}} over. He has a black butler who is atypically intelligent; his character merely plays dumb by <b>slipping</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> stereotypical slow-witted [...] "negro" [...] character when it suits him, rather than being genuinely unintelligent.|$|R

60|$|One {{man is a}} sort of leader. He is very {{straight}} and solid, solid like a wall, with a dark, unblemished will.
