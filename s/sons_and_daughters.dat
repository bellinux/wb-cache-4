5|$|In West Africa, the <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} {{given in}} marriage to their fellow royals {{as a matter}} of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Smith fathered a child, Clarence Jowers, with Willieen Jowers. Although {{he married}} a woman named Dora Smith in 1950, he fathered another child, Otis Jowers, with Willieen in 1951; he also had several <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> with Dora. Smith joined the U.S. Army in the early 1950s and was {{stationed}} in Korea from 1952 to 1954, where he served as an infantryman in the Korean War. After returning to the U.S., he lived in Harlem and served in the United States Army Reserve until 1960. During his military service, he became skilled in karate.|$|E

5|$|King Caesar’s grandchildren, the <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> of Gershom B. Weston, then {{inherited}} the house which {{by that time}} was in disrepair. They soon sold it to Frederick Bradford Knapp, former Superintendent of Buildings at Harvard College, in 1886. Knapp established the Powder Point School for Boys, a preparatory school, and converted Ezra Weston’s farm into athletic fields and the outbuildings into classrooms and gymnasiums. The King Caesar House was designated as the headmaster's house. The Powder Point School for Boys ceased operation in 1926 and the Knapp family sold the property in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Gouldens {{included}} {{their children}} in social activism. As part of the movement to end slavery in the US, Goulden welcomed American abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher when he visited Manchester. Sophia Jane Goulden used the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin – written by Beecher's sister Harriet Beecher Stowe – as a regular source of bedtime stories for their <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters.</b> In her 1914 autobiography My Own Story, Pankhurst recalls visiting a bazaar {{at a young age}} to collect money for newly freed slaves in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

5|$|Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh {{was born}} on 6 August 1942, {{in the town of}} Jawi Folu, Eastern Province, Sierra Leone, the son of a farmer and chief of the village. He moved to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied {{chemistry}} and biology at Fourah Bay College and began teaching after receiving his BSc.

5|$|Resident {{killer whales}} {{in the eastern}} North Pacific have a {{particularly}} complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters,</b> and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, {{as many as four}} generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Time was {{intended}} to be matched by a sister fountain, Fountain of Creation, on {{the opposite end of the}} Midway. Work was begun but was never completed. The finished portions of Fountain of Creation, depicting figures from the Greek legend of the repopulation of earth after the great flood, are considered Taft's final work, and were given to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, his alma mater. The four surviving elements are figures ranging in height from , and are collectively named <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters</b> of Ducalion and Pyrrha. Two of these elements stand outside the entrance to the university's Main Library, and two others are located at the south side of Foellinger Auditorium.|$|E

5|$|Neighbours is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters,</b> which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.|$|E
25|$|A later Australian serial, <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters,</b> has {{inspired}} five remakes produced under license {{from the original}} producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are Verbotene Liebe (Germany, 1995–2015); Skilda världar (Sweden, 1996–2002); Apagorevmeni agapi (Greece, 1998); Cuori Rubati (Italy, 2002–2003) and Zabranjena ljubav (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both The Restless Years and <b>Sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daughters</b> were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.|$|E
