5|$|Due to an {{accidental}} {{killing of a}} teenage girl while trying to shoot a psychotic <b>suspect,</b> <b>the</b> Tainan City Police Bureau {{made a decision to}} develop a special kind of baton in 2006. When dealing with suspects without firearms, the police officers are expected to use the baton first in order to reduce accidents. To commemorate the girl who died, mayor Hsu named the baton after her.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim siege {{forces had}} been {{weakened}} by the withdrawal of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force. If the Byzantine garrison had sallied out against the Muslim army, historians <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> defenders would have broken through the Muslim lines and lifted the siege. Understanding {{the danger of the}} situation, Khalid hurriedly returned to Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The courier and a {{relative}} (who {{was either a}} brother or a cousin) {{were killed in the}} May 2, 2011 raid. Afterward, some locals identified the men as Pashtuns named Arshad and Tareq Khan. Arshad Khan was carrying an old, noncomputerized Pakistani identification card, which identified him as from Khat Kuruna, a village near Charsadda in northwestern Pakistan. Pakistani officials have found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> men were living under false identities.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, Castafiore's most {{valuable}} jewel, an emerald {{given to her}} by the fictional Maharajah of Gopal, goes missing. After initially questioning Irma and Nestor, the detectives Thomson and Thompson <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> Romani. Their suspicions are heightened when they find that a pair of golden scissors belonging to Irma in Miarka's possession, though she claims to have found them. After the Romani depart, the police start looking for them. Tintin also investigates Igor Wagner, whose behaviour Tintin finds suspicious, but finds out that the musician is simply sneaking out to indulge a horse-gambling habit.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery {{credit to}} Ortiz, but came to <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object.|$|E
5|$|Dilbeck's {{personal}} interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E

5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|Pattle was {{a fighter}} ace {{with a high}} score, and is {{sometimes}} noted as being the highest-scoring British Commonwealth pilot of the war. If all claims made for him are correct, his total {{could have been more}} than 51. It can be stated that his final total was at least 40 and could exceed this number. Log-books and semi-official records suggest this figure, while personnel attached to his squadron <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> figure to be closer to 60. A total of 26 of Pattle's victims were Italian; 15 were downed with Gloster Gladiators, the rest with Hawker Hurricanes. He is considered to be the highest-scoring ace on both Gladiator and Hurricane (35 victories) fighters.|$|E

5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México subjected the codex to non-destructive testing {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear and tear, are <b>suspect.</b> <b>The</b> researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{witnessing}} {{a young woman}} being robbed and murdered {{by a group of}} men, but she is too frozen in fear to protest. A black man walking down the alley also sees the incident and runs to help the woman, but the murderers flee just as the police arrive. The police mistakenly <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> black man of being the killer and arrest him. The real murderers give a threatening look towards Madonna and leave. She flees the crime scene and escapes to a church. There she sees a caged statue of saint who resembles the black man on the street. As the song starts, she utters a prayer in front of the statue which appears to be crying.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{reports of}} a sniper {{shooting}} cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25shootings had been linked to one <b>suspect.</b> <b>The</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{information}} on the Gregorian mission comes from Bede's narrative, and this reliance on one source necessarily leaves the picture of native missionary efforts skewed. First, Bede's information is mainly from the north and the east of Britain. The western areas, where the native clergy was strongest, was an area little covered by Bede's informants. In addition, although Bede presents the native church as one entity, in reality the native British were divided into a number of small political units, which makes Bede's generalisations <b>suspect.</b> <b>The</b> historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the Libellus points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity. Besides the text of the Libellus contained within Bede's work, other versions of the letter circulated, some of which included a question omitted from Bede's version. Wood argues that the question, which dealt with the cult of a native Christian saint, is only understandable if this cult impacted Augustine's mission, which would imply that Augustine had more relations with the local Christians than those related by Bede.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, David Rizzio, {{was murdered}} by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March {{returned}} with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his magnum opus, History of the Reformation in Scotland. When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided {{over what to do}} with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief <b>suspect,</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she had been forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. Other old friends of Knox's, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, {{even to the point of}} calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a <b>suspect.</b> <b>The</b> letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E

5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} <b>suspect.</b> <b>The</b> police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|Raju and his team, now {{disguised}} as Sabarimala pilgrims, rent a van {{hoping to catch}} Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is {{waiting for him in}} the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh go. It is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to <b>suspect</b> <b>the</b> slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok.
