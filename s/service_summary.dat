Although this disease has been investigated extensively in patients admitted to medical services, the incidence and risk factors {{for the development of}} this disease in patients admitted to a surgical service have not been studied. METHODS: Over a 5 -month period, 374 patients admitted to the general, vascular, thoracic, and urologic surgery services were monitored for the development of symptomatic CDC (defined as > 3 bowel movements per 24 hours and a positive cytotoxin assay or culture). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients developed CDC (incidence, 5. 6 %). Factors that independently predisposed to infection included admission from a skilled care facility, use of the antibiotic cefoxitin, and an operative procedure for bowel obstruction. Other factors associated with CDC included colectomy, treatment with any antibiotic, nasogastric tube suction, advanced age, and prior antibiotic treatment. Abdominal pain and fever were also more common in patients with CDC. Morbidity included prolonged hospitalization in all patients and urgent colectomy in one. CONCLUSIONS: CDC frequently affects surgical patients, producing morbidity ranging from mild diarrhea to life-threatening illness. A variety of factors, many of which are associated with intestinal stasis, predispose to the development of CDC...|$|E

Development managers are characterized as grassroots bureaucrats, then they are officers who are in the organization, but also has a direct contact with the elderly applicants for municipal assistance. I wanted to explore how these policies relate to the older people's autonomy and their implications for officer assistance in their daily work. As a theoretical starting point I have used out of a närbyråkratiskt perspective, and a negotiation perspective. Study was conducted using a qualitative approach. The material for analysis were collected from six interviews with the assistance officer from six different municipalities, and an analysis of these municipalities' municipal guidelines for needs assessments. For the result shows that there are three main methods used for needs assessment. These are needs assessment calls, home visits and care planning. Something else that govern aid administrators needs assessment is the investigation finished templates available in the various municipalities. The results also showed that aid administrators are faced with a number of considerations in its work. This could depend on how the local guidelines were formulated and the elderly did not receive municipal assistance. Aid managers agreed that the autonomy of the elderly, it is applicable to a needs assessment, yet there are only a certain range of actions which they transformed into mature through negotiations and "coaxes"...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mental {{health is}} {{neglected}} {{in most parts}} of the world. For the Indigenous Peoples of Latin America, the plight is even more severe as there are no specific mental health services designed for them altogether. Given the high importance of mental health for general health, the status quo is unacceptable. Lack of research on the subject of Indigenous Peoples' mental health means that statistics are virtually unavailable. To illustrate their mental health status, one can nonetheless point to the high rates of poverty and extreme poverty in their communities, overcrowded housing, illiteracy, and lack of basic sanitary services such as water, electricity and sewage. At the dawn of the XXI century, they remain poor, powerless, and voiceless. They remain severely excluded from mainstream society despite being the first inhabitants of this continent and being an estimated of 48 million people. This paper comments, specifically, on the limited impact of the Pan American Health Organization's mental health initiative on the Indigenous Peoples of Latin America. Discussion The Pan American Health Organization's sponsored workshop "Programas y Servicios de Salud Mental en Communidades Indígenas" [Mental Health Programs and Services for the Indigenous Communities] in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia on July 16 - 18, 1998, appeared promising. However, eleven years later, no specific mental health program has been designed nor developed for the Indigenous Peoples in Latin America. This paper makes four specific recommendations for improvements in the approach of the Pan American Health Organization: (1) focus activities on what can be done; (2) build partnerships with the Indigenous Peoples; (3) consider traditional healers as essential partners in any mental health effort; and (4) conduct basic research on the mental health status of the Indigenous Peoples prior to the programming of any mental health <b>service.</b> <b>Summary</b> The persistent neglect of the Indigenous Peoples' mental health in Latin America raises serious concerns of moral and human rights violations. Since the Pan American Health Organization' Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative 16 years ago, no mental health service designed for them has yet been created. </p...|$|E
40|$|STUDY QUESTION: What are the {{experiences}} of donor-conceived adults and donors who are searching for a genetic link {{through the use of}} a DNA-based voluntary register <b>service?</b> <b>SUMMARY</b> ANSWER: Donor-conceived adults and donors held positive beliefs about their search and although some concerns in relation to finding a genetically linked relative were reported, these were not a barrier to searching. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Research with donor-conceived people has consistently identified their interest in learning about-and in some cases making contact with-their donor and other genetic relatives. However, donor-conceived individuals or donors rarely have the opportunity to act on these desires. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, AND DURATION: A questionnaire was administered for online completion using Bristol Online Surveys. The survey was live for 3 months and responses were collected anonymously. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS: The survey was completed by 65 donor-conceived adults, 21 sperm donors and 5 oocyte donors who had registered with a DNA-based voluntary contact register in the UK. The questionnaire included socio-demographic questions, questions specifically developed for the purposes of this study and the standardized Aspects of Identity Questionnaire (AIQ). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Motivations for searching for genetic relatives were varied, with the most common reasons being curiosity and passing on information. Overall, participants who were already linked and those awaiting a link were positive about being linked and valued access to a DNA-based register. Collective identity (reflecting self-defining feelings of continuity and uniqueness), as assessed by the AIQ, was significantly lower for donor-conceived adults when compared with the donor groups (P 0. 05) for donor-conceived adults. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Participants were members of a UK DNA-based registry which is unique. It was therefore not possible to determine how representative participants were of those who did not register for the service, those in other countries or of those who do not seek information exchange or contact. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first survey exploring {{the experiences}} of donor-conceived adults and donors using a DNA-based voluntary register to seek information about and contact with genetic relatives and the first to measure aspects of identity using standardized measures. Findings provide valuable information about patterns of expectations and experiences of searching through DNA linking, identity and of having contact in the context of donor conception that will inform future research, practice and policy development...|$|E

N 1 in the 6 th edition means 16 regional lymph nodes involvement, while the N 1 seventh edition – only 1 - 2 of regional lymph nodes involvement. This means that T 1 N 1 Mo 6 th and T 1 N 1 Mo 7 th - not quite the same, and the survival of the two groups will be different. The study, made on the abdominal oncosurgical department of Odessa Regional Oncology Center, included 188 patients operated for gastric cancer in the period 2007 - 2011. The study included only radically treated patients. Comparison of survival in patients with gastric cancer between 6 th revision groups of 7 th has been reviewed. The classification mission is to provide differences in the survival rates between the groups.

40|$|This {{publication}} is {{the third}} annual report of fish kills caused by pollution occurring in the United States. The reporting of pollution-caused fish kills was begun by the Public Health Service in the Spring of 1960 {{in an effort to}} secure additional information on the effects of pollution in the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s waters, to elicit the cooperation and assistance of conservation groups in the States to help determine causes of fish kills and assist in their abatement, and to place responsibility for fish kills where it belonged. The Surgeon General asked all State conservation and fish and game agencies to assist him by reporting instances of fish kills attributable to pollutants entering the streams or lakes of the Nation. A self-addressed postcard reporting form was devised in cooperation with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the various independent conservation organizations. The form, shown in this publication as figure 1, was furnished to the State agencies to be completed as occasions arose and mailed to the Public Health <b>Service.</b> <b>Summary</b> totals and statistical evaluations and conclusions are based upon the information contained in these reporting forms. The fish kill activity has just completed its third year of operation. As it matures and as the reporting authorities in the States become accustomed to furnishing more complete information about each kill, the resulting publications will undoubtedly become more meaningful, and serve as a more useful tool in helping to identify and abate pollution. In 1962, a semi-annual report was published listing reported fish kills for the period January-June, 1962. This present report includes all fish kills in 1962 which were reported by the various State agencies. Even though the resulting totals of fish killed are large, they probably represent only a fraction of fish actually killed throughout the United States by man-made pollution. In an effort to make the reporting of these fish kills more accurate and hence the published summaries more useful and effective, it was found desirable to revise portions of the postcard reporting form. Beginning in January 1963, the revised form was put into use throughout the States and future summaries will indicate more accurately the source of pollution believed to have killed the fish. Most pollution-caused fish kills are attributable to operational activities. The revised reporting form on which next year 2 ̆ 7 s publication will be based indicates four principal operations causing the majority of fish kills: agricultural, industrial, municipal, and transportation operations, with appropriate subheadings. When classified in this manner, the responsibility for causing fish kills can be more accurately defined. As the reporting forms are received from the States, copies are furnished to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Reports were excluded from the listing if it was apparent that the kill was not related to pollution. Lack of sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water from natural biological activity will kill fish, but is not necessarily related to man-made pollution. Some reports indicated kills had occurred too far in the past to determine the cause or extent. Other reports stated that pollution occurred but no fish were killed, and some referred to shellfish which died of causes not related to pollution. Of the total reports received, however, only a small number are excluded from the summary. Acceptable reports are coded for machine punch card tabulation so that various statistical tables can be obtained. The punch card method permits the insertion of late reports in the sequence in which they occurred...|$|E

In principle rationing of services by ability to benet is fair. In practice there are many difculties. The evidence to allow selection of patients for rehabilitation does not exist and probably the best criterion of ability to benet from rehabilitation (not ‘likely {{to have a good}} outcome’) is demonstration of benet within a rehabilitation programme. Basic consid-erations of epidemiological statistical facts also show that criteria are likely to select too many inappropriate patients into services or exclude too many appropriate patients from services. The solution is for purchasers and providers to develop mutual trust and, in the UK at least, to ensure that patients who do not need rehabilita-tion can be discharged quickly into appropriate support services...|$|R
