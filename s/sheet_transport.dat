Specifically, they are flux tubes that have lower values of pV(exp 5 / 3) than their neighbors, where p is the thermal pressure of the particles and V is the volume of a tube containing one unit of magnetic flux. Whether they are created by reconnection or some other mechanism, the bubbles are propelled earthward by a magnetic buoyancy force, which {{is related to the}} interchange instability. Most of the major observed characteristics of the bursty bulk flows can be interpreted naturally in terms of the bubble picture.

Model 2 is based upon the petrographic examination of an 8 m ice core from the Allan Hills Icefield and suggests a local origin of ice from the catchment basin. The third model is presented by Whillans and Cassidy who infer, by using conventional ice flow concepts, a path length as long as 1, 000 km from the sites of fall to recovery for Allan Hills specimens.

40|$|Treating the {{dynamics}} of sediment transport as two-dimensional on interrill-areas and as one-dimensional in rill sections, areally averaged <b>sheet</b> sediment <b>transport</b> equations are developed. The two-dimensional <b>sheet</b> sediment <b>transport</b> equation is averaged over an individual interrill-area width and then along the interrill-area length to obtain local-scale areally averaged interrill-area <b>sheet</b> sediment <b>transport</b> equation (local-scale areal averaging). Similarly, the cross-sectionally-averaged rill sediment transport equation is averaged along an individual rill length to obtain local-scale areally averaged rill sediment transport equation (local-scale areal averaging). In order to minimize computational effort and economize {{on the number of}} model parameters, the local-scale areally averaged equations are then averaged over a whole hillslope section (large-scale areal averaging). These equations constitute the areally averaged model. The expectations of the terms containing more than one variable are obtained by the method of regular perturbation. In the large-scale areal averaging it is assumed that all the randomness in the state variable is due to the randomness in the parameters of the process. Comparison of the results obtained from the areally averaged model with those of the point-scale model indicates that the areally averaged model uses far less data and yet it performs as well as the point-scale model. The results of the developed model indicate that on a rilled-surface most of the sediment loads comes from rill sections.

40|$|Outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice <b>Sheet</b> <b>transport</b> {{ice from}} the {{interior}} to the ocean and contribute directly to sea level rise because because discharge and ablation often exceed the accumulation. To develop {{a better understanding of}} these fast flowing glaciers, we investigate the basal conditions of Store Glacier, a large outlet glacier flowing into Uummannaq Fjord in West Greenland. We use two crossing seismic profiles acquired near the centreline, 30 km upstream of the calving front, to interpret the physical nature of the ice and bed. We identify one notably englacial and two notably subglacial seismic reflections on both profiles. The englacial reflection represents a change in crystal orientation fabric, interpreted to be the Holocene?Wisconsin transition. From Amplitude Versus Angle (AVA) analysis we infer that the deepest ? 80 m of ice of the parallel-flow profile below this reflection is anisotropic with an enhancement of simple shear of ? 2. The ice is underlain by ? 45 m of unconsolidated sediments, below which there is a strong reflection caused by the transition to consolidated sediments. In the across-flow profile subglacial properties vary over small scale and the polarity of the ice?bed reflection switches from positive to negative. We interpret these as patches of different basal slipperiness associated with variable amounts of water. Our results illustrate variability in basal properties, and hence ice-bed coupling, at a spatial scale of ? 100 m, highlighting the need for direct observations of the bed to improve the basal boundary conditions in ice-dynamic modelsPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Localized {{reductions}} in the magnetic field associated with plasma pressure in Mercury's magnetospheric cusp and nightside plasma sheet have been routinely observed by the Magnetometer on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. We present a statistical analysis of near-equatorial magnetic depressions to derive the structure of Mercury's plasma sheet pressure. Because the plasma pressure in the magnetosphere correlates with solar wind density, the pressures were normalized to a Mercury heliocentric distance of 0. 39 AU. A model magnetic field was used to map observations obtained on the ascending and descending orbit nodes to the magnetic equator and revealed the presence of plasma in a toroidal section extending on the nightside from dusk to dawn. Mapping the data to invariant magnetic latitude shows that the pressure is symmetric about the magnetic equator. The average pressure normalized for heliocentric distance is 1. 45 nPa and exhibits a weak, 0. 05 nPa/h, dusk-to-dawn gradient with local time. The plasma sheet pressure can vary between successive orbits by an order of magnitude. Unlike the predictions of some global simulations of Mercury's magnetosphere, the plasma enhancements do not form a closed distribution around the planet. This difference may arise from the idealized solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions used in the simulations, which maximize the size and stability of the magnetosphere, thus promoting the formation of drift paths that close around the planet.

(1) A large data set allowed us to obtain the average values of the plasma sheet magnetic flux transfer rate (E y and directly compare it with the dayside transfer rate (E mod for different magnetospheric states. The results confirm the magnetic flux imbalance model suggested by Russell and McPherron (1973), namely: during SMC periods the day-to-night flux transport rate equals the global Earthward plasma sheet convection; during the substorm growth phase the plasma sheet convection is suppressed on the average by 40 %, whereas during the substorm expansion phase it twice exceeds the day-to-night global flux transfer rate. (2) Different types of substorms were revealed. About 1 / 3 of all substorms considered displayed very weak growth in the tail lobe magnetic field before the onset. For these events the plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>transport</b> {{was found to be}} in a balance with the day-to-night flux transfer, as in the SMC events. However, the lobe magnetic field value in these cases was as large as that in the substorms with a classic growth phase just before the onset (both values exceed the average level of the lobe field during the SMC). Also, in both groups similar configurational changes (magnetic field stretching and plasma sheet thinning) were observed before the substorm onset. (3) Superimposed epoch analysis showed that the plasma sheet during the late substorm recovery phase has the characteristics similar to those found during SMC events, the SMC could be a natural magnetospheric state following the substorm...|$|E

This study investigates the potential activity and community shifts of glacial microbiota deposited and buried under layers of sediments within the river delta. A long-term (12 -month) incubation experiment was established using Watson River delta sediment under anaerobic conditions, with and without CO 2 /H 2 enrichment. Within CO 2 /H 2 -amended incubations, sulphate depletion and a shift in the microbial community to a 52 % predominance of Desulfosporosinus meridiei by day 371 provides evidence for sulphate reduction. We found evidence of methanogenesis in CO 2 /H 2 -amended incubations within the first 5 months, with production rates of ~ 4 pmol g? 1 d? 1, which was likely performed by methanogenic Methanomicrobiales- and Methanosarcinales-related organisms. Later, a reduction in methane was observed to be paired with the depletion of sulphate, and we hypothesise that sulphate reduction out competed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The structure and diversity of the original CO 2 /H 2 -amended incubation communities changed dramatically with a major shift in predominant community members and a decline in diversity and cell abundance.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that suggests {{there is a}} significant self-organized criticality (SOC) component in the dynamics of substorms in the magnetosphere. Observations of BBFs, fast flows, localized dipolarizations, plasma turbulence, etc. are taken to show that multiple localized reconnection sites provide the basic avalanche phenomenon in the establishment of SOC in the plasma sheet. First results are presented from a continuing plasma physical study of this avalanche process. A one-dimensional resistive MHD model of a magnetic field reversal is discussed. Resistivity, in this model, is self-consistently generated in response to the excitation of an idealized current-driven instability. When forced by convection of magnetic flux into the field reversal region, the model yields rapid magnetic field annihilation through a dynamic behavior that is shown to exhibit many of the characteristics of SOC. Over a large range of forcing strengths, the annihilation rate is shown to self-adjust to balance the rate at which flux is convected into the reversal region. Several analogies to magnetotail dynamics are discussed: (1) It is shown that the presence of a localized criticality in the model produces a remarkable stability in the global configuration of the field reversal while simultaneously exciting extraordinarily dynamic internal evolution. (2) Under steady forcing, it is shown that a loading-unloading cycle may arise that, {{as a consequence of the}} global stability, is quasi-periodic and, therefore, predictable despite the presence of internal turbulence in the field distribution. Indeed, it is shown that the global loading-unloading cycle is a consequence of the internal turbulence. (3) It is shown that, under steady, strong forcing the loading-unloading cycle vanishes. Instead, a recovery from a single unloading persists indefinitely. The field reversal is globally very steady while internally it is very dynamic as field annihilation goes on at the rate necessary to match the strong forcing. From this result we speculate that steady magnetospheric convection events result when the plasma sheet has been driven close to criticality over an extended spatial domain. During these events, we would expect to find localized reconnection sites distributed over the spatial domain of near criticality and we would expect to find plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>transport</b> in that domain to be closely related to that of BBF and fast flow events...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional large-scale convection, nightside plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>transport</b> involves {{a significant amount of}} meso-scale fast flows that carry a large amount of magnetic flux. Those flows are coupled to the ionosphere, and auroral manifestations of such fast flows include auroral streamers and substorm onset. Sub-auroral polarization streams (SAPS) are another fast-flow phenomenon occurring just equatorward of the electron auroral oval. While in-situ measurements can only detect these mesoscale transient phenomena at a limited number of points or can characterize them statistically, measuring flows and aurora in the ionosphere allows us to evaluate the instantaneous two-dimensional evolution. In this thesis we first investigate the structure of these flow bursts using two-dimensional line-of-sight flow observations from the SuperDARN radars and auroral images from the THEMIS ground-based all-sky imager (ASI) array. Radar echoes captured at horizontal distances <~ 500 km from the radars were mainly used to detect small-scale flow structures that would otherwise be missed or poorly resolved in long-range radar echoes. After identifying 135 auroral streamers in the ASI images near radar echoes, we examined the flow evolution and properties of flow channels. Flow bursts and streamers are invariably correlated in all events. The flow bursts are often directed equatorward and appear simultaneously with the streamers. Equatorward flows are located just to the east of the streamers. Less frequently (~ 10 % of the time), a poleward flow enhancement was detected even when a streamer propagated equatorward, the poleward flow enhancement being located {{to the west of the}} auroral streamer, or to the east of the equatorward flow enhancement, consistent with the expected spatial relationship between flow shear and upward field-aligned currents in plasma sheet flow bursts. The azimuthal width of the flow channel is on average ~ 75 km, and the azimuthal offset of the equatorward flow channel relative to the auroral streamer is ~ 57 km eastward. This study demonstrates the capability of radar-imager pairs for identifying the 2 -D structure of localized flows associated with plasma sheet flow bursts. In the second part of this thesis, we investigated ionospheric flow patterns associated with auroral onset beads using line-of-sight flow observations from the SuperDARN and auroral images from the THEMIS ground-based ASI array. We selected events that occurred when the SuperDARN radars operated in a high temporal resolution THEMIS mode (6 seconds) along northward looking beams, a time resolution comparable to that of the imagers, providing a unique tool to detect properties of flows associated with auroral onset beads. We have found very fast oscillating flows (~ 1000 m/s) that are correlated with the onset beads propagating across the THEMIS-mode beam meridian. 2 -d radar measurements also show a wavy pattern in the azimuthal direction with a wavelength of ~ 78 km, which is close to the azimuthal separation of individual beads. We also used an imager and SuperDARN in Iceland and identified weak but significant azimuthal flow modulations associated with beads. These strong correlations (in time and space) between auroral beading and the fast ionospheric flows suggest that substorm onset occurs via an instability in the inner plasma sheet and is associated with intense flow shears. The flow shear is clockwise around auroral beads, consistent with converging electric fields associated with upward field-aligned currents in the shear center. Finally, we present simultaneous measurements from the THEMIS ASI array and the 2 -d SuperDARN radar measurements that share fields of view with the imagers to investigate the association between SAPS flow enhancements and auroral streamers. We first identified auroral streamers in the ASI images to analyze the ionospheric flow variations at subauroral latitudes. We also performed a reverse study starting with flow variations and then analyzed the auroral condition from the ASI. In this study we analyzed a total of 104 events. For the case of streamers observed near the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval, we find average westward flow enhancements of ~ 700 m/s slightly equatorward of the streamers. Our statistical results show that for the first part of this study (forward study, starting from streamers) 98 % of the streamers that reach close to the equatorward boundary lead to SAPS westward flow enhancements. For the reverse study (starting from flow enhancements), we have found that streamers and enhanced convection nearly equally contribute to SAPS flow enhancements. We also characterize the SAPS flow channel width and timing relative to streamers reaching radar echo meridians. The strong influence of auroral streamers on the rapid evolution of SAPS flows suggests that transient fast earthward plasma sheet flows can lead to westward SAPS flow enhancements in the subauroral region, and that such enhancements are far more commonly occurring than during substorms alone, based on the frequent occurrences of streamers under various geomagnetic conditions...|$|E

A palaeomagnetic study of the thick sequence of shallow marine syn-extensional carbonates filling the Cotiella Basin reveals the presence of a widespread secondary magnetization of both normal and reversed polarities.

Best clustering of palaeomagnetic vectors is obtained after unfolding into a post-extensional precompressional stage, coherent with an acquisition age between Santonian and Paleocene. Strong magnetic enhancement and very distinct magnetic properties with depth suggest a link with burial diagenesis of organic matter, precipitation of iron sulphides and subsequent oxidation to SD finegrained magnetite.

30|$|Graphene can be {{prepared}} by the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) [16 – 18], epitaxial growth on metal surfaces [19], or mechanical exfoliation [20]. The chemical reduction of GO has been frequently applied for large-scale production of graphene sheets. The electrical conductivity and dispersibility of graphene is probably due to chemical reduction [16, 17, 21]. The electrochemical performance of an electrode material deeply depends on the electrical conductivity, surface area, wetting of the electrode, and permeability of the electrolyte solution [5, 11, 22]. The permeability of an electrolyte solution can be increased considerably due to its porous nature or faster wetting induced by the residual functional groups of the graphene sheets [5]. Active spaces and pores present in the graphene <b>sheets</b> <b>transport</b> the electrolyte ions efficiently between the interfaces and improve the specific capacitance [22]. The aggregated graphene sheets of thermally annealed graphene perform like graphite and decrease the effective electrolyte diffusion. However, the presence of hydrophilic functional groups on the graphene sheets efficiently improves the wetting between graphene and polar electrolytes, and also inhibits the aggregation of graphene sheets. Additionally, this oxygen functional group has a pseudocapacitance effect with the double-layer capacitor [23]. A few solution-based approaches have been reported for applying graphene in supercapacitors such as reduction of surfactant-stabilized GO [5], solvothermally reduced graphene [23], poly(ionic liquid)-modified graphene [24], and partially reduced GO [11]. To enhance the energy storage capacitance of graphene, {{the introduction of the}} pseudocapacitance property is essential. The pseudocapacitance property supports a synergistic effect on both double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance [24, 25]. In fact, the presence of the residual oxygen groups on the graphene sheets induces the pseudocapacitive effects (electrochemical reduction and oxidation) and promotes good wettability of the electrodes [5, 11, 26]. To increase the energy storage capacitance of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO), they must have some residual oxygen functional groups for pseudocapacitance and faster electrolyte permeability.|$|R
40|$|The western {{ablation}} {{zone of the}} Greenland {{ice sheet}} contains a region that is darker than the surrounding ice. This region is several tens of kilometres wide and stretched parallel to {{the margin of the}} ice sheet for more than 350 kilometres. The dark appearance implies low radiance and therefore low spectral albedos, leading to enhanced melting. An estimation of the influence of this dark region with a simple model shows that it can increase the local melt rate in this area by several tens per cent. Therefore, this dark region can significantly affect the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. Satellite images reveal that the dark region is caused by outcropping layers of ice that contain more dust than the brighter surrounding ice. This dust was initially deposited in the accumulation zone of the Greenland ice <b>sheet,</b> <b>transported</b> through the ice sheet towards the margin and released in the ablation zone. Geochemical analyses of dust from the dark region and dust from brighter reference ice confirm this hypothesis and indicate a local source for the dust, probably the nearby tundra. In addition, abundant microorganisms were observed in the dark region. Part of these organisms formed granules together with the mineral dust. As the organic matter in the dust is known to have a high light absorbency, the dark region is not only caused by dust from the outcropping ice, but biological processes also contribute to the darkening of the surface. Finally, carbonaceous particles in the ice from the dark region reveal that the material is not modern, and settled on the accumulation zone during the Holocene, during periods of enhanced eolian activity. Therefore, dust fluxes towards the ice sheet in the past contribute to albedo variations in the ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet at present and can enhance the melting of the Greenland ice sheet without external forcing...|$|R

Furthermore, the sediment size effect for pick-up flux function over starved bed is shown to be quite different from that containing sufficient sediment in oscillatory flows...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{transport}} in graphene is {{along the}} sheet but junction devices are often made by stacking different sheets {{together in a}} "side-contact" geometry which causes the current to flow perpendicular to the sheets within the device. Such geometry presents a challenge to first-principles transport methods. We solve this problem by implementing a plane-wave based multiple scattering theory for electron transport. This implementation improves the computational efficiency over the existing plane-wave transport code, scales better for parallelization over large number of nodes, and {{does not require the}} current direction to be along a lattice axis. As a first application, we calculate the tunneling current through a side-contact graphene junction formed by two separate graphene sheets with the edges overlapping each other. We find that transport properties of this junction depend strongly on the AA or AB stacking within the overlapping region as well as the vacuum gap between two graphene <b>sheets.</b> Such <b>transport</b> behaviors are explained in terms of carbon orbital orientation, hybridization, and delocalization as the geometry is varied.

500|$|Birmingham {{had long}} been a centre of the ironworking industry. In the early 18th century the town entered a period of {{expansion}} as iron working became easier and cheaper with the transition (beginning in 1709) from charcoal to coke {{as a means of}} smelting iron. [...] Scarcity of wood in increasingly deforested England and discoveries of large quantities of coal in Birmingham's county of Warwickshire and the adjacent county of Staffordshire speeded the transition. Much of the iron was forged in small foundries near Birmingham, especially in the Black Country, including nearby towns such as Smethwick and West Bromwich. [...] The resultant thin iron <b>sheets</b> were <b>transported</b> to factories in and around Birmingham. [...] With the town far from the sea and great rivers and with canals not yet built, metalworkers concentrated on producing small, relatively valuable pieces, especially buttons and buckles. [...] Frenchman Alexander [...] wrote that while he had seen excellent cane heads, snuff boxes and other metal objects in Milan, [...] "the same can be had cheaper and better in Birmingham". [...] These small objects {{came to be known as}} [...] "toys", and their manufacturers as [...] "toymakers".|$|R

5000|$|There are 2 {{types of}} feeding systems used by folders, pile and continuous.. The first is flat pile, {{in which the}} paper is placed on a feeding table and each <b>sheet</b> is then <b>transported</b> into the machine by {{friction}} or an air-controlled suction-wheel. A variation of this is palletized feeding, in which an entire pallet full of paper may {{be placed on the}} feeding table. The second type is called [...] "continuous"; this involves the sheets being placed onto a belt, on a table or rollers, that takes it around the end of the machine, then each sheet is individually pushed into the machine by an air-controlled suction-wheel. The sheets of paper will be separated by blowing air between them.|$|R
40|$|The physics-based {{sediment}} transport equations {{are derived from}} {{the assumption that the}} {{sediment transport}} rate can be determined by a dominant variable such as flow discharge, flow velocity, slope, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power. In modeling of <b>sheet</b> erosion/sediment <b>transport,</b> many models that determine the transport capacity by one of these dominant variables have been developed. The developed models mostly simulate steady-state sheet erosion. Few models that are based on the shear-stress approach attempt to simulate nonsteady state sheet erosion. This study qualitatively investigates the applicability of the transport capacity models that are based on one of the commonly employed dominant variables-unit stream power, stream power, and shear stress-to simulate nonsteady state sediment loads from steep slopes under different rainfall intensities. The test of the calibrated models with observed data sets shows that the unit stream power model gives better simulation of sediment loads from mild slopes. The stream power and the shear stress models, on the other hand, simulate sediment loads from steep slopes more satisfactorily. The exponent (ki) in the sediment transport capacity formula is found to be 1. 2, 1. 9, and 1. 6 for the stream power model, the shear stress model, and the unit stream power model, respectively...|$|R
