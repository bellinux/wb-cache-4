40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} analyse the erosion-inhibiting {{potential}} of a single application of <b>stannous</b> chloride-containing <b>fluoride</b> solution on pellicle-covered enamel and dentine under constant acid flow conditions in vitro. DESIGN: Bovine enamel (n= 60) and dentine (n= 60) samples were exposed 1 h to the oral cavity of 4 healthy volunteers to allow for in situ pellicle formation. Pellicle-covered samples {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups (each n= 20 enamel and n= 20 dentine samples; 5 enamel and 5 dentine samples/volunteer) and treated once with a SnCl 2 /AmF/NaF (800 ppm Sn(II), 500 ppm F, pH 4. 5) or a NaF solution (500 ppm F, pH 4. 5) for 2 min or remained untreated (controls). Samples were eroded with hydrochloric acid (pH 2. 6) in a small erosion chamber at 60 microl/min for 25 min. Calcium release into the acid was monitored in consecutive 30 s intervals for 5 min, then at 1 min intervals up to a total erosion time of 25 min using the Arsenazo III procedure. Data were statistically analysed by random-effects linear models (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The <b>stannous</b> chloride-containing <b>fluoride</b> solution reduced calcium loss of enamel and dentine to up to 6 min and 3. 5 min, respectively. Calcium loss (% of control) amounted from 24 +/- 7 (30 s) up to 93 +/- 14 (6 min) in enamel and from 38 +/- 13 (30 s) to 87 +/- 15 (3. 5 min) in dentine. The sodium fluoride solution was unable to reduce enamel and dentine erosion at any time point.

40|$|Synopsis [...] In {{addition}} to the usual physical and chemical laboratory tests applied to cleansing toothpastes, analyses for the water-soluble anticaries species are required for evaluation of an anticaries toothpaste. Methods to determine <b>stannous</b> and <b>fluoride</b> ions in the toothpaste are described and discussed.

In ad-dition, the abrasive and other agents present in the formulation and the tube must be compatible with the anticaries agent. In order to achieve these aims, knowledge of the physical and chemical character-istics of the anticaries agent is required. Specific analytical procedures for the agent and the products of its decomposition are necessary to de-fine its stability {{in the presence of}} the other ingredients in the formula-tion. A thorough knowledge of the anticaries agent should be coupled with comparable information and analytical procedures for the other ingredients in the formulation, such as abrasives, humectants, binders, and foaming and flavoring agents.

However, uncertainty exists towards fluoride’s efficacy relatively to the concentration {{and the type}} of chemical compound used. This in vitro study evaluated the relative efficacy of toothpastes containing sodium fluoride in different concentrations or a stabilized <b>stannous</b> fluoride/sodium <b>fluoride</b> system on root dentine erosion. Bovine dentin specimens were allocated into four groups (n= 10) : control (no F), 1450 ppm F (as NaF), 5000 ppm F (as NaF) and 1450 ppm F (1100 ppm as stabilized SnF 2 and 350 ppm as NaF) /sodium hexamethaphosphate. The specimens were submitted to 6 daily cycles of erosion (0. 3 % v/v citric acid, pH= 3. 2, 20 min) and remineralization (~ 22 h), interspersed by 2 -min immersions in 1 : 3 w/v of dentifrice/distilled water slurries. Subsequently, they were subjected to a 24 -h acid resistance test (0. 3 % v/v citric acid, pH= 3. 2) without any further treatments. Surface loss was quantified by contact profilometry. Data were analysed through one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s tests (p≤ 0. 05). In both experiments, all fluoride groups, showed significantly less tissue loss compared to the control (p< 0. 001 -p= 0. 018). During erosion cycling, {{no significant differences were found}} among the fluoride groups. During the acid resistance test, the 5000 ppm F toothpaste produced significantly superior effect than both 1450 ppm F products (p= 0. 010, (p< 0. 001), which performed similarly. Under less aggressive erosive conditions, fluoride toothpastes did not differ in their ability to protect dentine surfaces.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{protective}} effects of solutions containing <b>stannous</b> (Sn), <b>fluoride</b> (F) and their combination in the prevention of dentin erosion. Forty bovine root dentin specimens (4 &# 8217; 4 &# 8217; 2 mm 3) were prepared and randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 10) : SnCl 2 (800 ppm/ 6. 7 mM Sn), NaF (250 ppm/ 13 mM F), NaF/SnCl 2 (800 ppm/ 6. 7 mM Sn; 250 ppm/ 13 mM F), and deionized water (DIW) as a negative control. An acquired pellicle was formed on dentin samples by incubation in clarified, pooled, stimulated human saliva for 24 hours. The specimens were subjected to 5 daily cycles, each consisting of 5 of min demineralization (0. 3 %/ 15. 6 mM citric acid, pH 2. 6, 6 &# 8217;/day) and 60 min of re-mineralization in clarified human saliva. Thirty minutes after the 1 st, 3 rd and 5 th demineralization episodes of each day, the specimens were treated with one of the test solutions for 2 min. Surface loss was measured via optical profilometry. Mixed-model ANOVA followed by Tukey&# 8217;s test were used for the statistical analysis. Sn, F, and their combination significantly reduced the dentin surface loss by 23 %, 36 %, and 60 % compared with DIW, respectively. All groups were significantly different (p < 0. 05). The combination of Sn and F significantly reduced the amount of dentin surface loss compared with all other groups. The F group also significantly reduced surface loss compared with Sn and DIW, followed by the Sn group, which showed significantly greater protection compared with the DIW control.

Methods In each phase, 12 volunteers wore appliances containing 4 enamel specimens, which were {{submitted to a}} 5 -day erosion-remineralization phase that consisted of 2 h of salivary pellicle formation with the appliance in situ, followed by 2 min extra-oral immersion in 1 % citric acid (pH 2. 4), 6 x/day, with 90 min of exposure to saliva in situ between the challenges. Treatment with the test solutions was performed extra-orally for 2 [*]min, 2 x/day. At {{the end of the}} experiment, surface loss (SL, in μm) was evaluated by optical profilometry. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05). The surface of additional specimens was evaluated by x-ray diffraction after treatments (n = 3). Results C (mean SL ± standard-deviation: 5. 97 ± 1. 70) and F (5. 36 ± 1. 59) showed the highest SL, with no significant difference between them (p > 0. 05). F + Sn (2. 68 ± 1. 62) and F + Sn + LPP (2. 10 ± 0. 95) did not differ from each other (p > 0. 05), but presented lower SL than the other groups (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} {{is simply}} {{defined as a}} short sharply painful reaction of the exposed and innervated pulp-dentin complex in response to stimuli being typically thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic, or chemical and which reaction cannot be attributed to any dental defect or pathology. To be hypersensitive, dentin must be exposed and the exposed tubules must be open and patent to both the oral cavity and the pulp. Exposure of dentin through the loss of gingival and periodontal tissue {{may be caused by}} either too meticulous or by neglected oral hygiene. Exposure of dentin by the loss of the protecting enamel is mainly caused by erosion, abrasion, and abfraction or a combination thereof. Clinical examination for dentin hypersensitivity would include a pain provocation test by a tactile stimulus, an evaporative air stimulus, or a cold stimulus. A number of other dental conditions can give rise to pain symptoms, which may mimic those of dentin hypersensitivity. Therefore, careful examination is necessary to exclude the conditions, which need different treatment options. When the patients do suffer from dentin hypersensitivity, there is broad range of treatment options comprising home-use and professional approaches. It is advised to start with the less invasive home-use therapies and only expand to professional in-office treatments when the home-use treatments are not effective. When decided to continue with in-office treatments, again one should start with the least invasive ones. The working mechanisms fall under two basic categories being nerve desensitization (potassium salts and guanethidine) and occlusion of exposed dental tubules (chemically: strontium, <b>fluoride,</b> <b>stannous,</b> oxalate, calcium phospho silicate, arginine calcium carbonate, nano-hydroxyapatite, and glutaraldehyde; mechanically: pumice paste, glassionomers, dentin bondings, and resins; laser therapy).

The difference between Gleem and Crest is Gleem was strictly a 'toothpaste' and originally contained no fluoride. Fluoride was later introduced into Gleem after Crest was first sold in 1955, as a form of consumer competition. While Gleem remained a toothpaste, Crest advanced into flavored 'pastes,' 'gels,' and so on. Until its discontinuance, the Gleem toothpaste package stated 'CONTAINS NO SUGAR' in bold print.

Methods: HGFs cultured from a sample of clinically non-inflamed gingival connective tissues were incubated with <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and sodium fluoride to determine their effects on cell proliferation. HGFs were then incubated with or without <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> or <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> at the highest concentrations that did not affect cell proliferation and analyzed for MMP expression.

Two hundred ninety deciduous and permanent teeth were restored in 34 children, ages six to nine years. Cavity preparations were treated with either stable 30 per cent <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution or a placebo solution (double blind technique) prior to the placement of amalgam restorations. A comprehensive coded system was used to record the description and position of conditions associated with recurrent caries after a one-year period. Children receiving the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> treatment experienced a 58. 9 per cent reduction in recurrent caries when compared to the control children. The children receiving the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> treatment showed a 60. 7 and 46. 7 per cent reduction in recurrent carious lesions in permanent and deciduous teeth, respectively, when compared to the control children. The reduction in recurrent caries was attributed to the anticariogenic effect of the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> treatment. Conditions associated with recurrent caries were mainly inadequate extension in fissures and grooves, overextension of the cavity preparation, marginal fractures of enamel and amalgam, marginal excess, and deterioration of the amalgam margin. Recurrent caries around the margins of restorations appeared to depend on (1) the caries susceptibility of the adjacent tooth structure,(2) the extension of the cavity preparation, and (3) the condition of the amalgam-enamel margin...|$|E
40|$|Dentine {{hypersensitivity}} still {{represent a}} major clinical problem only partially solved. The presence of exposed opened dentinal tubules {{has been demonstrated}} increase the dentine permeability {{and it is the}} responsible for pain and sensitivity. <b>Stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution has been recently proposed to reduce dentine hypersensitivity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the dentinal permeability of a new <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> gel proposed for the therapy of dentine hypersensitivity. Human extracted teeth have been used and mounted and connected with a hydraulic pressure apparatus working at 1 psi (70 cm of water pressure). It was calculated the permeability of untreated smear layer, treated smear layer (after gel application) and after acidic treatment. It was observed that gel treatment was able to reduce dentine permeability. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous smear layer after treatment with gel. This in vitro study confirms that <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> treatment has the capacity to modify dentine permeability of sensitive dentine...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: A double blind, controlled, {{parallel}} group trial {{utilizing the}} experimental gingivitis model {{was performed on}} thirty young adults to evaluate the clinical effects of a 0. 45 % <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice used as a slurry on dental biofilm formation {{and the development of}} gingivitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following a thorough examination and oral prophylaxis procedures, subjects were randomly assigned to apply one of the following dentifrices twice daily over a three-week period: A) dentifrice slurry without active ingredients; B) 0. 45 % <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> gel; and C) Colgate Total dentifrice slurry (0. 30 % triclosan, 0. 24 % sodium fluoride, 2 % copolymer). RESULTS: After three weeks, the <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced gingivitis compared with the Colgate Total group by 39. 7 %. Gingival bleeding was also reduced relative to the Colgate Total group. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). During the experimental period, the mean PII scores increased almost linearly in all three groups without yielding any statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this clinical trial demonstrated that, over a three-week period, the application of a 0. 45 % SnF 2 gel significantly inhibited the onset of gingivitis compared to Triclosan/sodium fluoride/copolymer (Colgate Total). However, neither <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> nor Triclosan/sodium fluoride/ copolymer (Colgate Total) possessed sufficient antimicrobial activity to suppress biofilm formation in the absence of regular oral hygiene practices. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} {{dental caries}} {{study was conducted}} to compare the anticariogenic properties of topically applied sodium fluoride and stan-nous fluoride in schoolchildren in a non-fluoridated region. The results of this study after two years indicate that all treatments resulted in a significant reduction in the in-cidence of dental caries and that <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> was significantly more effective than sodium fluoride. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> (SnF 2) is more useful than any other topical compound that has been adequately tested under clinical condi-tions. A single four minute application of an 8 % solution of <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> signifi-cantly reduces the incidence of dental caries in deciduous teeth of children,' 2 permanent teeth of children, 3 - 6 and permanent teeth of adults 7 - 9 in regions where the water con-tains the optimum amount of fluoride. ' 0 Collectively, these studies present evidence that indicates the clinical effectiveness of the single application technique with stan-nous fluoride. The use of this technique has been an important stimulus to the use and acceptance of topical fluoride therapy in the dental office and in community dental health pro-grams. Because four separate treatments were required for administration of sodium fluoride (NaF), four patient visits were re-quired. This often resulted in inconvenience to the dentist and the patient, and poor attitude toward topical applications of fluoride by both. The single topical treatment with <b>stannous</b> <b>fluoride</b> has enabled the use of topical fluoride at the recall appointment This study {{was supported in part by}} a grant from th...|$|E
