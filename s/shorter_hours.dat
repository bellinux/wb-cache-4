5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> accurately.|$|E

25|$|The United Mine Workers was {{successful}} in its strike against soft coal (bituminous) mines in the Midwest in 1900, but its strike against the hard coal (anthracite) mines of Pennsylvania turned into a national political crisis in 1902. President Theodore Roosevelt brokered a compromise solution that kept the flow of coal going, and higher wages and <b>shorter</b> <b>hours,</b> but did not include recognition of the union as a bargaining agent.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{developed}} baby H. pomatia snails hatch about 3 to 4 {{weeks after}} the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as , and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This {{is a response to}} both decreasing temperature and <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, a {{group of}} Teamsters in Chicago, Illinois, broke from the TDIU and formed the Teamsters National Union. The new union {{permitted}} only employees, teamster helpers, and owner-operators owning only a single team to join, unlike the TDIU (which permitted large employers to be members), and was very aggressive in advocating higher wages and <b>shorter</b> <b>hours.</b> Claiming more than 28,000 members in 47 locals, its president, Albert Young, applied {{for membership in the}} AFL. The AFL asked the TDIU to merge with Young's union to form a new, AFL-affiliated union. The two groups did so in 1903, creating the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). Shea was elected the new union's first president.|$|E
25|$|Miners {{had long}} {{believed}} that they were treated poorly. For example, in 1894 a Leadville mine owner instructed the superintendent of the mine to delay a payday for the miners so that a dividend could be paid to stockholders. The WFM had advocated the eight-hour day since its founding convention in 1893. Some miners had the <b>shorter</b> <b>hours,</b> and public employees and building trades workers in Denver had won the eight-hour day as early as 1890. Yet in 1896, hoisting engineers in Leadville were required to work twelve-hour shifts. Mines were more dangerous as they were dug deeper; it was increasingly recognized that poor working conditions as well as longer hours could be correlated with poor health. In 1889 two Leadville workmen were sent to Denver to testify in favor of a mine inspection bill. Although it passed, it made no difference that year because the legislature failed to fund it.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) {{had helped}} form local unions of teamsters since 1887. In November 1898, the AFL {{organized}} the Team Drivers' International Union (TDIU). In 1901, {{a group of}} Teamsters in Chicago, Illinois, broke from the TDIU and formed the Teamsters National Union. Unlike the TDIU, which permitted large employers to be members, the new Teamsters National Union permitted only employees, teamster helpers, and owner-operators owning only a single team to join, and advocated higher wages and <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> more aggressively than the TDIU. Claiming more than 28,000 members in 47 locals, its president, Albert Young, applied {{for membership in the}} AFL. The AFL asked the TDIU to merge with Young's union to form a new, AFL-affiliated union and the two groups did so in 1903, forming the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and electing Cornelius Shea as the new union's first president. The election process proved tumultuous. Shea effectively controlled the convention because the Chicago locals—representing nearly half the IBT's membership—supported his candidacy en bloc. Shea was opposed by John Sheridan, president of the Ice Drivers' Union of Chicago. Sheridan and George Innes, president of the TDIU, accused Shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election. Shea won the election on August 8, 1903, by a vote of 605 to 480. The new grouping elected Edward L. Turley of Chicago as secretary-treasurer and Albert Young as general organizer.|$|E
500|$|According to Marc and Claire Headley, two Scientologists {{who left}} the Church in 2005, {{residents}} at the base {{are not permitted to}} leave without the permission of a supervisor and have to work at least 16 hours a day, from 8 am to past midnight, with <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> on Sundays and little time for socialising. Communications with the outside world are effectively cut off; cellphones and Internet access are generally banned, mail is censored and passports are kept in a locked filing cabinet. The perimeter of the base is closely guarded around the clock. It is ringed with high fences that are topped with spikes and razor wire and monitored by inward-facing motion sensors to detect anyone trying to climb out of the compound. The Tampa Bay Times reported that dozens of workers tried to escape from the base– some of them repeatedly– but were caught and returned by Sea Org [...] "pursuit teams". The escapees are said to have been subjected to isolation, interrogation and punishment on their return to the compound.|$|E
500|$|Whenever {{there is}} talk about new {{policies}} regarding new work time policies, there is often the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and {{relatively}} low pay, Barham's 1841 {{investigation into the}} Cornish mining industry found that bal maidens generally enjoyed their work, and that {{those who had been}} in other jobs tended to prefer work at the mines. Mining had <b>shorter</b> <b>hours</b> than domestic service and was less affected by seasonal variations than farm working, the other two jobs employing significant numbers of women, and it was far easier for workers to live at home and travel to work each day, rather than lodging in their master's house or on a remote farm. Outdoor work was considered healthier than work in enclosed and smoky mines and factories, and it was sometimes believed that women who had worked as bal maidens from a young age were healthier than they would otherwise have been. From the 1780s onwards Cornwall suffered severe unemployment and poverty, and there were always large numbers of women and girls volunteering for work at the mines. The practice of giving preference to the wives, widows and children of dead or invalid miners allowed families to remain in their local area and to avoid destitution following the loss of the family's main breadwinner; work as a bal maiden also provided an opportunity for girls and young women to escape workhouses and gain financial independence. (As well as the benefits to the community of giving work to the families of invalid or dead miners, recruitment from within mining families benefited the mine owners also. The wives and children of miners could be expected to understand mining terminology and techniques, and would generally have been regular visitors to the mines delivering food to their husbands and thus be familiar with the mine's layout.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Gompers's {{philosophy}} of labor unions centered on economic ends for workers, such as higher wages, <b>shorter</b> <b>hours,</b> and safe working conditions {{so that they}} could enjoy an [...] "American" [...] standard of living—a decent home, decent food and clothing, and money enough to educate their children. He thought economic organization was the most direct way to achieve these improvements, but he did encourage union members to participate in politics and to vote with their economic interests in mind.|$|E

2500|$|The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 had {{authorized}} {{the establishment of}} [...] "industry codes" [...] to regulate wages, hours and working conditions in every industry in the United States.

The code led to few improvements in the textile industry. For example, when workers won <b>shorter</b> <b>hours,</b> employers made an end-run around the restriction by speeding up work.|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 1960, Landrith came to {{contract}} {{terms with the}} Giants for the upcoming season, reportedly earning between $10,500 and $15,000.

Landrith joked that he won with a platform of, [...] "more pay, <b>shorter</b> <b>hours,</b> fewer umpires and more base-hits." [...] In mid-March, Giants manager Bill Rigney brought in former all-star hitter Lefty O'Doul for hitting drills and learning sessions with some of the team's lighter hitters, including Landrith. Landrith responded the next day by hitting a game-winning home run in the 11th inning of a spring training game off rookie Jim Brewer to help the Giants beat the Chicago Cubs 7-6.|$|E
2500|$|Others in the community, and in {{particular}} in the ILGWU, drew a different lesson from events.
