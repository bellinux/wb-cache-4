5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E
5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such.

A series of game-character action figures and a working, life-size grapnel-gun replica were released in October 2013 by DC Collectibles and NECA, respectively. In December 2013, a digital comic {{book of the}} same name was released by digital studio Madefire with a prequel to the game. The comic is the first in DC Comics' DC Multiverse initiative, featuring dynamic artwork and sound and the ability to choose while reading how the story progresses (with <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> outcomes).

5|$|In 1976 Amtrak {{announced}} <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> {{changes to}} the Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and combined operation west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) WashingtonDenver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its sleeping car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the sleeping car.|$|E
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} significant correlation with clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. <b>Several</b> <b>possible</b> mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E

5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Several</b> <b>possible</b> routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A {{bridleway}} winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>several</b> <b>possible</b> {{explanations}} for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
