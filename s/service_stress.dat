50|$|Creep and {{shrinkage}} {{of concrete}} are two physical properties of concrete. The creep of concrete, which originates from the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) in the hardened Portland cement paste (which is the binder of mineral aggregates), is {{fundamentally different from}} the creep of metals and polymers. Unlike the creep of metals, it occurs at all stress levels and, within the <b>service</b> <b>stress</b> range, is linearly dependent on the stress if the pore water content is constant. Unlike the creep of polymers and metals, it exhibits multi-months aging, caused by chemical hardening due to hydration which stiffens the microstructure, and multi-year aging, caused by long-term relaxation of self-equilibrated micro-stresses in the nano-porous microstructure of the C-S-H. If concrete is fully dried, it does not creep, but it is next to impossible to dry concrete fully without severe cracking.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{corrosion}} on a smooth-specimen S-N diagram is shown schematically on the right. Curve A shows the fatigue {{behavior of a}} material tested in air. A fatigue threshold (or limit) is seen in curve A, corresponding to the horizontal part of the curve. Curves B and C represent the fatigue behavior of the same material in two corrosive environments. In curve B, the fatigue failure at high stress levels is retarded, and the fatigue limit is eliminated. In curve C, the whole curve is shifted to the left; this indicates a general lowering in fatigue strength, accelerated initiation at higher stresses and elimination of the fatigue limit. To {{meet the needs of}} advancing technology, higher-strength materials are developed through heat treatment or alloying. Such high-strength materials generally exhibit higher fatigue limits, and can be used at higher <b>service</b> <b>stress</b> levels even under fatigue loading. However, the presence of a corrosive environment during fatigue loading eliminates this stress advantage, since the fatigue limit becomes almost insensitive to the strength level for a particular group of alloys. This effect is schematically shown for several steels in the diagram on the left, which illustrates the debilitating effect of a corrosive environment on the functionality of high-strength materials under fatigue.Corrosion fatigue in aqueous media is an electrochemical behavior. Fractures are initiated either by pitting or persistent slip bands. Corrosion fatigue may be reduced by alloy additions, inhibition and cathodic protection, all of which reduce pitting. Since corrosion-fatigue cracks initiate at a metal's surface, surface treatments like plating, cladding, nitriding and shot peening were found to improve the materials' resistance to this phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|Since {{geotextiles}} {{have been}} progressively incorporated into coastal protection structures, {{the influence of}} installation damage on them has been the primary concern. During installation/construction, geotextiles are repeatedly subjected to high mechanical stresses which often exceed <b>service</b> <b>stress.</b> It is therefore vital to evaluate the mechanical and hydraulic damage and determine the consequences of these damages to better develop criteria for selection of suitable products. As these damages could reduce the material's mechanical strength and hydraulic efficiency, or in the severest form of damage, puncturing, would end the separation function. The properties investigated in this paper include the permittivity and apparent opening size (AOS) of geotextiles. Generally, the greater the drop energy of armour units applied to geotextiles, the greater the potential for damage. Findings show that the residual permittivity could increase significantly, 45 % during installation. The preliminary design of coastal structures will be optimised as engineers and designers can better estimate the amount of damage on geotextiles upon installation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{tentative}} experiment {{has been}} conducted on polymer modified cement concrete now widely used. By filtering through 297 kinds of traces of polymer modified cement concrete samples tentatively mixed, we acquire a proper mix proportion, according to which, a total of 75 groups of 225 polymer modified cement concrete specimens are produced. After further selective preference of these specimens, ultrasonic test is done on the selected ones under different loading conditions. Afterwards, signal processing is accomplished by using wavelet transformation and we preliminarily find a kind of acousto-elastic sensitive concrete material which is comparatively sensitive to stress. This kind of material is produced by mixing epoxy resin, styrene-acrylic emulsion, acrylic emulsion, auxiliaries and iron powder into cement concrete together. The sensitivity of ultrasound and stress {{of this kind of}} modified concrete behaves preferably well as follows: at the low stress stage, not only the correlativity curve of ultrasound velocity and stress but also the correlativity curve of weighted spectrum area and stress arises apparently.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{and analysis of}} failure accidents of Wind-lens turbine blades was presented. Due {{to the failure of}} the electric loading device, Wind-lens turbine was running under non-loading conditions for some minutes. Then, the wind velocity U around Wind-lens turbine reached U_ = 19 m/s and the tip velocity V_ of blades reached V_ 152 m/s. Fatigue crack was easily initiated at the corner of fillets of joints connecting blades to hub where stress concentration was caused. The bolts were subjected to a large load by application of vibrational stress and torsional moment. The clearance between the head of bolts and hub was expanded. To investigate the fracture surface, the beach marks and striations characteristic of fatigue fracture were obviously observed. The number of cycles from crack initiation to final failure was calculated on the basis of fracture mechanics by observing the fatigue striation in the vicinity of fracture origin. Vibrational <b>service</b> <b>stress</b> amplitudes applied at the joint of blades and hub were much larger than the inherent fatigue strength of blade 2 ̆ 7 s material, ABS resin.

40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{spectrum}} of controls which are required to be in place to ensure the maintenance of quality in castings. Most of these are well known, and are not therefore considered in this paper. The parameters which are often overlooked, and thus not controlled, are (i) the rate of flow of liquid metal in the mould to avoid surface turbulence and the generation of macroscopic crack-like defects as a result of folded-in surface films; and (ii) the rate of quench following solution heat treatment. As a result of failure to control these critical parameters castings traditionally exhibit random failure from leakage, and mechanical failure, especially fatigue. Mechanical failure is enhanced by internal stress which is superimposed on <b>service</b> <b>stress</b> to promote premature failure. It is considered that these are the main reasons why in the past castings {{have been found to be}} unreliable, compared to other production techniques such as forging. Techniques to control both surface turbulence and internal stresses include respectively (i) the limiting of flow velocities in moulds to less than 0. 5 m/s, and (ii) eliminating the water quench from casting heat treatments. These actions are expected to revolutionise the concept of castings as totally reliable products...|$|E

The specimens tightly fit into a cylindrical cavity in a pressure vessel and are loaded axially by a hard piston. The pressure vessel is very stiff, forcing the lateral expansion of specimens to be so small that the strain is almost uniaxial. Sophisticated analysis is used to evaluate material proper ties from measurements of force and displacement on the loading piston outside the test cavity.

40|$|A {{consistent}} {{theory for}} the analysis of curvature and deflections of reinforced concrete beams in the cracking stage is presented. The theory assumes concrete to have a nonzero tensile carrying capacity, characterized by a uniaxial stress-strain diagram which characterizes progressive microcracking due to strain softening. The tensile stress-strain properties are the same as those which are obtained in direct tensile tests and those which have recently been used with success in modeling fracture test results for concrete. The theory agrees well with the simpler formula of Branson within the range for which his formula is intended. The value of the proposed theory is its much broader applicability. Aside from demonstrating a good agreement with available test data for short-time deformations up to the ulti-mate load, it is shown that the theory also correctly predicts the longtime creep deformations of cracked beams. To this end, the av-erage creep coefficient for tensile response including peak stress and strain softening needs to be taken about three times larger than that for compression states. The theory also predicts the reduction of creep deflections achieved by the use of compression reinforcement, and a comparison of modeling this effect is made with an ACI for-mula. As a simplified version of the model, it is proposed to replace the tensile strain-softening behavior by the use of an equivalent ten-sile area of concrete at the level of tensile steel, behaving linearly. Assuming this area to be a constant, realistic predictions for short-time as well as longtime deformations in the <b>service</b> <b>stress</b> range can still be obtained...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 An {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of factors contributing to the service failure of a 12 inch diameter cast iron water pipe in Pendleton, Oregon. The quality of the pipe {{was found to be}} acceptable when compared to the acceptance limits established by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. However it exhibited numerous casting defects such as blowholes, gas porosity, lapping zone discontinuities and poor casting surface indicating a poorly cast product. Metallurgical study also revealed a discontinuous solidification pattern which produced a thin separated metal layer at the pipe's outer wall. The cause of the failure, however, was not attributed to any of these defects. Between 71 and 88 inches on the fracture surface, an unusual black surface appearance was observed. Microscopic examination and electron microprobe analysis of the corrosion deposit in this area revealed a very thick adherent layer of corrosion products, found nowhere else on the fracture surface, and a penetrating type corrosive attack.
