This paper presents methods for <b>scheduling</b> a single job on a dedicated parallel machine. 1 Introduction There are two basic <b>scheduling</b> strategies: static <b>scheduling</b> and dynamic <b>scheduling.</b> Static <b>scheduling</b> distributes the workload at compile time. Dynamic <b>scheduling</b> performs <b>scheduling</b> activities at runtime. Static <b>scheduling</b> applies to problems with a predictable structure, which are called static problems.
