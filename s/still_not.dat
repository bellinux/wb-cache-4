5|$|At {{the time}} of the capitulation, Imperos hull was 88% {{complete}} and the engines were 76% complete, but overall the ship was only 28% complete; it would have required about eighteen more months of full work to be finished.

5|$|Yet most American movie theaters, {{especially}} {{outside of}} urban areas, were <b>still</b> <b>not</b> equipped for sound: {{while the number}} of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were <b>still</b> <b>not</b> entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. Points West, a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.|$|E
