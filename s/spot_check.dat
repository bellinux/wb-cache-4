While in jail at the Castellania, Vassalli read in Arabic, and vocally {{translated}} to Maltese, passages of the Quran to other inmates among him. The Quran, with a leather cover, was discovered when Vassalli had a <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> by the British in the whereabouts of Porta Reale.|$|E
25|$|The age {{required}} {{to have the right}} to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age {{required to}} stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to postal balloting and had lengthened the legislative term from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. Postal balloting was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would not be known until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). Postal ballots had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> in Salzburg, 20% of postal ballots were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested postal ballots, which meant that postal ballots could decisively change the election outcome.|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E

40|$|One {{method of}} privacy-preserving {{accounting}} or billing in cyber-physical systems, such as {{electronic toll collection}} or public transportation ticketing, {{is to have the}} user present an encrypted record of transactions and perform the accounting or billing computation securely on them. Honesty of the user is ensured by <b>spot</b> <b>checking</b> the record for some selected surveyed transactions. But how much privacy does that give the user, i. e. how many transactions need to be surveyed? It turns out that due to collusion in mass surveillance all transactions need to be observed, i. e. this method of <b>spot</b> <b>checking</b> provides no privacy at all. In this paper we present a cryptographic solution to the <b>spot</b> <b>checking</b> problem in cyber-physical systems. Users carry an authentication device that authenticates only based on fair random coins. The probability can be set high enough to allow for <b>spot</b> <b>checking,</b> but in all other cases privacy is perfectly preserved. We analyze our protocol for computational efficiency and show that it can be efficiently implemented even on plat- forms with limited computing resources, such as smart cards and smart phones...|$|R

50|$|Preventing {{accidents}} in rebreathers from cell failures {{is possible in}} most cases by accurately testing the cells before use. Some divers carry out in-water checks by pushing the oxygen content in the loop to a pressure that is above that of pure oxygen at sea level to indicate if the cell is capable of high outputs. This test is only a <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> and does not accurately assess the quality of prediction of failure of that cell. The only way to accurately test a cell is with a calibrated test chamber which can hold a static pressure without deviation {{and the ability to}} log the results and graph them.|$|E

5000|$|If 10 {{candidates}} run {{for governor}} in a Condorcet race, ballot counters may need to count 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45 head to head runoffs to find the winner. While this is doable, {{it might be more}} practical to still use ballot access laws or primaries, defeating some of the original intent of the Condorcet method. Computers can be used to speed up the counts, though some voters fear computers can be hacked and used for ballot counting fraud. Another option would be to allow several independent scanner owners count the ballots and compare results. Volunteer hand counters could then <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> various candidates and ranks to make sure they match the subtotals reported by the scanners ...|$|E
50|$|After a {{successful}} Maltese uprising against French rule, in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming {{known as the}} Gran Corte della Valletta. At {{the request of the}} Maltese National Congress, the law was once again reformed to the ancient rights and the Code De Rohan. Vassalli was imprisoned again during the siege, and was kept at the Castellania from 16 September 1800 until he was exiled during the British Protectorate on 15 January 1801. While in jail at the Castellania, Vassalli read in Arabic, and vocally translated to Maltese, passages of the Quran to other inmates among him.

Six months later, the same gang reappears in Hong Kong, injuring a group of policemen, two critically, during a <b>spot</b> <b>check.</b> The dead woman in the jewellery shop is CID detective Chan Chun's fiancée, while the injured policemen are led by Trainee Inspector Carson Fong Yik-wai.

The man had then run onto the train. A <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> on ticket sales that evening revealed that four further tickets to travel to Belfast via Heysham had also been issued. Within three hours of the bombings, each man had been detained at Heysham Port and taken to Morecambe police station to undergo forensic tests to eliminate them as suspects in the bombings. Each man expressed their willingness to assist in these inquiries, having informed the officers of a half-truth as to the reason they had been travelling to Belfast: that they intended to visit their families, although they also intended to attend McDade's funeral.|$|E

Creed engineers the transfer of blame from himself to a paper mill manager, for whom he procures a card and farewell money collected from all the workers; on his way out, he pockets the money and tosses the card. In a deleted scene, after a newspaper reporter recognizes him and claims to have written his obituary—and he thanks the man for such a complimentary portrait—it was revealed that Creed faked his own death 10 years ago [...] "for tax reasons", and admits that he draws benefits as his own widow.|$|E
50|$|Driving licences, {{particularly}} the photocard driving licence introduced in 1998, and passports {{are now the}} most widely used ID documents in the United Kingdom, but the former cannot be used as travel documents, except within the Common Travel Area. However, driving licences from the UK and other EU countries are usually accepted within other EEA countries for identity verification. Given that passports do not fit in a typical wallet or purse, most people do not carry their passports in public without an advance {{that they are going to}} need them. For people from the UK and other countries where national ID cards are not used or not common, this leaves driving licences as the only valid form of ID to be presented, if requested by an authority for a legitimately-given reason, but unlike a travel document, they do not show the holder's nationality or immigration status. Colloquially, in day-to-day life, most authorities do not ask for identification from individuals in a sudden, <b>spot</b> <b>check</b> type manner, such as by police or security guards, although this may become a concern in instances of stop and search.|$|E
