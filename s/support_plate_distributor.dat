40|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> {{effects on}} the {{hydrodynamic}} characteristics of turbulent fluidized beds are investigated by obtaining measurements of pressure and radial voidage profiles in a column diameter of 0. 29 m with Group A particles using bubble bubble-cap or perforated <b>plate</b> <b>distributors.</b> Distributor pressure drop measurements between the two distributors are compared with the theoretical estimations while {{the influence of the}} mass inventory is studied. Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the distributor on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the <b>distributor.</b> The <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics. Owing to the jetting caused by the perforated <b>plate</b> <b>distributor,</b> earlier onset of the transition to the turbulent fluidization flow regime was observed. Moreover, increased carry over for the perforated plate compared with the bubble caps has been confirmed. The results have highlighted the influence of the <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> on the fluidized bed hydrodynamics which has consequences in terms of comparing experimental and simulation results between different distributor platesPublicad...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, has {{sponsored}} {{the development of}} a Fluidized Bed Waste Heat Recovery System (FBWHRS) and a higher temperature variant, the Ceramic Tubular <b>Distributor</b> <b>Plate</b> (CTDP) Fluidized Bed Heat Exchanger (FBHX) system. Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?F to protect the fluidized bed <b>distributor</b> <b>plate.</b> In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> with a Ceramic Tubular <b>Distributor</b> <b>Plate</b> (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods.

Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages. The fluidized bed particles enhance heat transfer and continually clean the finned tubes in the fluidized beds. Also, only the <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> is exposed to the hot fouling and corrosive flue gases since the fluidized bed quickly cools these gases to a uniform 500 ?F...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCorrosion product {{deposits}} {{in the secondary}} side of nuclear power plant Steam Generators may result in Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage, and tube fouling. Tube fouling is a deposit on the tube surfaces which is penalizing for the heat exchanges between the primary and the secondary circuits. Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage is a deposit at the inlet of Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow holes which can induce high velocity zones and transverse velocities in the secondary flow, then flow induced vibrations and tube cracks in some cases. Indeed three significant primary to secondary leaks occurred at one nuclear plant in France between 2004 and 2006. The thermal-hydraulic and vibration studies confirmed a cracking mechanism caused by flow induced vibrations resulting in a circumferential crack. Those studies pointed out {{the role of an}} important flow blockage distribution at the upper Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> as an aggravating factor. In order to simulate those two phenomena in the whole Steam Generator, a solid deposit growth model on the sec- ondary side of Steam Generators has been developed by the EDF R&D Division. This model is implemented in the frame of THYC, which is the EDF’s reference code for the modelling of two-phase thermal-hydraulic phenomena at the subchannel scale. A subchannel scale is a mesoscale which has the advantage to calculate thermal-hydraulic flows and deposition in whole nuclear components with reasonable CPU times. The deposit model aims to predict the localization and the growth rate of {{deposits in}} order to simulate tube fouling as well as Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage at this scale. This work specifically describes the efforts performed by the EDF R&D Division to develop and implement models for Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage. A new deposit process, based on Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage studies, has been developed and implemented in the model, and is presented in this work. It can be defined by two main steps : particle deposition, and strengthening process called “flashing” due to soluble species precipitation in the pores of the particle deposit. This process is calibrated on blockage rates observed in Steam Generators by using an inverse method also developed in this work. The relevance of this process is tested by comparing the simulation results to the actual levels of flow blockage observed in some nuclear plants. Two dominant trends are showed in this work : the flow blockage is more important on the hot leg than on the cold leg and at the top than at the bottom of Steam Generators. Moreover the flow blockage distribution at the upper Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> has the special feature to be more important at the periphery than at the center. These results are in agreement with observed data in some nuclear plants. A sensitivity analysis of soluble species solubility, and more specifically magnetite solubility, has been performed. The “flashing” phenomenon allows one to underline the magnetite solubility dependence of flow blockage phenomenon. A reduction of magnetite solubility in Steam Generators seems to be an interesting remedy for reducing the Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage phenomenon, and more specifically for Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plates</b> at the top of Steam Generators. Ac- cording to the deposit process developed in this work, this reduction would be more effective in cold leg than in hot leg. In practice, such a magnetite solubility reduction could be obtained by increasing the pH of the secondary circuit. This pH elevation is one of the remedy considered at short term on EDF fleet for its potential benefit on both tube fouling and Tube <b>Support</b> <b>Plate</b> flow blockage. Indeed the operational pH of secondary circuits were planned to raise at certain nuclear plants. This remedy is in agreement with the results obtained in this work...|$|R

40|$|A {{data bank}} of field {{experiences}} with heat exchanger tube vibration reveals numerous cases of tube failures at, or near, the baffle. The {{objective of this}} study is to provide qualitative impact/fretting wear information for heat exchanger tubes through the performance of a series of tests involving the pertinent parameters: impact force level, between the tube and its support; tube to <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> hole clearance; tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> thickness; and tube vibration frequency. The characteristics of impact/fretting wear relative to tube motion pattern, material combination and surrounding fluid were also investigated. The test apparatus consists of a cantilevered tube with a simulated tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> at the ''free end''. Tube vibration is induced by an electromagnetic exciter to simulate the flow-induced tube motion occurring in a real heat exchanger at the tube/tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> interface.

Wear rate increases significantly with the magnitude of the impact force between the tube and its support plate; the degree and trend of the wear rates are highly dependent on the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the tube/support material combination; the rate of impact/fretting wear decreases with increasing frequency. An empirical formula is proposed to correlate the experimental impact/fretting wear results...|$|R
