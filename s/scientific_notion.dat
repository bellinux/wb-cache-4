5000|$|In science, {{there are}} [...] {{a number of}} {{approaches}} to characterizing complexity; this article reflects many of these. Neil Johnson states that [...] "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity - and the <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."

50|$|Predeterminism is {{difficult}} to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead {{to a variety of}} similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in metaphysics, theology, and the philosophy of free will. The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term predetermination are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the physicalist (and often <b>scientific)</b> <b>notion</b> of causal determinism to even the theological (and often religious) notion of predestination.|$|E
5000|$|Atomism {{or social}} atomism is a sociological theory {{arising from the}} <b>{{scientific}}</b> <b>notion</b> atomic theory, coined by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus and the Roman philosopher Lucretius. In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers {{to the notion that}} all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or atoms. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the individual as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life. This theory refers to [...] "the tendecy for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms". Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society. The individual is the ‘atom’ of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis.|$|E

[...] However, Ebert said that the <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> of the butterfly effect is used inconsistently: Evan's changes should have wider reverberations. Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it a [...] "metaphysical mess", criticizing the film's mechanics for being [...] "fuzzy at best and just plain sloppy {{the rest of the}} time". Mike Clark of USA Today also gave the film a negative review, stating, [...] "Normally, such a premise comes off as either intriguing or silly, but the morbid subplots (there's prison sex, too) prevent Effect from becoming the unintentional howler it might otherwise be." [...] Additionally, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe went as far as saying, [...] "whatever train-wreck pleasures you might locate here are spoiled by the vile acts the characters commit." ...|$|E

However, in all cases but one, these theoretical changes did not translate into changes in the operationalization of the notion of concept learning. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Since the planet is outside of the Commonwealth territory their mission is deemed minor and unimportant. The team’s four scientists—two human males, one human female and one male thranx—initially discover four separate, unique sentient species. Combined with Quofum’s nine percent alcohol oceans, its unstable appearance is seemingly part {{of the nature of}} Quofum: every species on Quofum is seemingly unrelated—casting well-established <b>scientific</b> <b>notions</b> of evolution into doubt.|$|R
30|$|The early {{definition}} of industrial district (Table  1) well represents the basic {{components of the}} <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> in the spatial, business and social dimensions. It {{is limited to the}} industrial sector and only thanks to the formulation of the local production system notion did it pave the way for the extension of the district into different areas, such as rural, agro-food and fisheries. Similarly, in that period, negotiated planning instruments were being extended to cover agriculture and fisheries, services and tourism. The concept of negotiated planning explains the purpose of the first tools used by the DAs and allows us to appreciate the coherence of the two approaches.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{asserts that}} social or {{collective}} thought build the thinking structures {{in which they}} take their own shape as it happens, for example, in historicity. In the same way, social thought builds structures that are "prior to history". These make possible to explain their own appearance, in notions like that of "causality". Myths are presented here as the widest of such structures, and mythical structures are certain shapes, orientations, numerations and paths within a space typically taken as "heterogeneous", which {{is different from the}} <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> of an "homogenous" space. It is claimed, finally, that everyday understanding thoroughly uses mythical structures of thinking...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{engages with}} the recent {{computer-mediated}} video installations of Australian media artist Tina Gonsalves. Gonsalves' interactive video Chameleon (2008 - 2010) explores the <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> of 'emotional contagion', the dynamics of how emotions spread {{from one person to}} another in social contexts. An ambitious work at the interface of media art, neuroscience and advanced 'affective computing' being developed at the MIT Media Lab, Chameleon interprets the notion of empathy as a kind of code that can be simulated in an installation context. The work continues and expands upon the artist's interest in the intimacies and vulnerabilities of human emotions. It is a genuinely interdisciplinary work that breaks new ground in terms of the dialogue between art, science and technology...|$|E

To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom.

40|$|Nina Azari in her {{commentary}} on our {{article in this}} issue “Spirituality: The Legacy of Parapsychology” has {{raised the issue of}} what it actually takes for something to be called science. Does causality come into the picture? If so, how does causality relate to our non-local model that seems to explicitly eschew the question of causality? The answer lies in what one is willing to accept as causality. If causality can be conceived broader than just efficient-mechanistic causality then certainly our model is causal. If one insists on efficient-mechanistic causality as the only and truly <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> of causality, it is not. But then, I would argue, this is a very restricted and also short sighted view which should be questioned, and eventually, disregarded. This is what we have set out to do...|$|E
40|$|The system {{dynamics}} concept of `generic structure' is dividable into three sub-types. This paper analyses {{the validity of}} these three, using both practical and theoretical perspectives. Firstly, {{a new set of}} measures is developed for generating validity-`confidence'-amongst a group using generic structures in a practical modelling situation. It is concluded that different confidence criteria are implicitly employed; there is an argument for trading-off model precision and analytical quality for simplicity and ease of use and future research is needed to combine these `process' and `content' aspects of confidence. From a theoretical stance it is shown that with two of the sub-types a <b>scientific</b> <b>notion</b> of confidence is achievable whereas the third (`archetypes') involves merely metaphorical thinking. It is concluded that the theoretical status of archetypes requires further development, whilst ensuring that its benefits are retained...|$|E
40|$|Multiply realizable {{properties}} are those whose realizers are physically diverse. It is often argued that theories which contain them are ipso facto irreducible. These arguments assume that physical explanations {{are restricted to}} the most specific descriptions possible of physical entities. This assumption is descriptively false, and philosophically unmotivated. I {{argue that it is}} a holdover from the late positivist axiomatic view of theories. A semantic view of theories, by contrast, correctly allows scientific explanations to be couched in the most perspicuous, powerful language available. On a semantic view, traditional notions of multiple realizability are thus very hard to motivate. At best, one must abandon either the idea that multiple realizability is an interesting <b>scientific</b> <b>notion,</b> or else admit that multiply realizable properties do not automatically block scientific reductions. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Modernism in {{religion}} or modernist approach to religion involves demythologisation {{in one or}} the other form, to a lesser or greater degree. Iqbal’s approach to Islam can be considered as modernist and his attempt at demythologising the Qur´ānic myths is in line with this approach. A detailed critique of his interpretation (demythologisation) of the Qur´ānic narrative of genesis is attempted from the traditionalist viewpoint. Islam’s incompatibility with modern scientific project and sensibility that informs demythologisation movement is foregrounded. Iqbal does not take full cognisance of the metaphysical dimensions of the Qur´ānic narrative and appropriates certain modern <b>scientific</b> <b>notions</b> in his interpretation of the legend. </p...|$|R
