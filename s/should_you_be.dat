25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their {{excellent}} {{performance in}} a number of engagements as artillery, the much-reduced San Patricios were ordered to muster a larger infantry battalion in mid-1847 by personal order of Santa Anna. It was renamed The Foreign Legion of Patricios and consisted of volunteers from many European countries, commanded by Col. Francisco R. Moreno, with Riley in charge of 1st company and Santiago O'Leary heading up the second. Desertion handbills were produced, specially targeting Catholic Irish, French and German immigrants in the invading U.S. army and stating that [...] "You must not fight against a religious people, nor <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> seen in the ranks of those who proclaim slavery of mankind as a constitutive principle ... liberty is not {{on the part of those}} who desire to be lords of the world, robbing properties and territories which do not belong to them and shedding so much blood in order to accomplish their views, views in open war to the principles of our holy religion".|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the stark prohibitions and warnings against adultery, marital relations were expected and considered a right. A newly married soldier in Israel {{did not have to}} go to war for a year, so that he could bring happiness to his bride. Proverbs encourages the enjoyment of sexual relations within marriage: [...] "Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth...Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sages read [...] {{to teach}} that Jacob warned his sons against {{appearing}} well fed when others around them were without food. The Sages taught {{that if one}} fasted on account of some trouble and it passed, or for a sick person and the sick person recovered, then the one fasting should nevertheless complete the fast. If one journeyed from {{a place where they}} were not fasting to a place where they were, then one should fast with the people of the new place. If one journeyed from a place where they were fasting to a place where they were not, then one should nevertheless complete the fast. If one forgot and ate and drank, then one should not make it apparent in public nor indulge in luxuries. For the Sages read [...] to say, [...] "And Jacob said to his sons: ‘Why should you show yourself?'" [...] Thus, the Sages taught, Jacob conveyed to his sons: [...] "When you are fully sated, do not show yourselves either before Esau or before Ishmael, so that they should not envy you." [...] Similarly, a Midrash read [...] to say, [...] "And Jacob said to his sons: ‘Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> conspicuous?'" [...] The Midrash interpreted [...] to mean that Jacob told his sons that they were all strong and brotherly; they were not to enter through one gate and all stand in the same place, so that they should not tempt the evil eye.|$|E

2500|$|In uncharacteristically bold discussions {{after dinner}} Darwin asked his guests [...] "Why {{do you call}} yourselves Atheists?" [...] When they responded that they [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and Büchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E
