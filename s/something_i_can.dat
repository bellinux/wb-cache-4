I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much {{discipline}} and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's not <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see myself listening to, he isn't a great singer, but I can see how his vocals change the track." [...] German portal Mix1 awarded [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] with seven out of eight stars when reporting about its release.|$|E

Jessica Letkemann of Billboard points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn's solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work would be surprised, insisting that [...] "Gone are the more overtly '80s top 40 flourishes". Bud Scoppa writes in Uncut Magazine that the album's extremes are portrayed in its first two songs, [...] "Nobody Wants To", which he describes as [...] " [...] the prevailing melancholy mood, as Finn's slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret", and [...] "Don't Stop Now", in which [...] "Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS, seeking [...] "something I can write about… <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> cry about"".|$|E

500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / <b>Something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch your back / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Jim Kurring {{originated in the}} summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was [...] "always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can't you give me <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> relate to, like falling in love with a girl?" [...] Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.|$|E

[...] Gaskarth calld [...] "Heroes" [...] the [...] "no-so-find farewell closer" [...] that is also the [...] "most pop-punk song" [...] on the record, in tribute to their roots.

[...] He said it was an [...] "important final song and point to make for this album specifically as we've really taken some risks and stretched ourselves."

[...] However, in an interview with Auto Express in April 2010, Yamauchi explained that, [...] "Deciding a release date for a game is always difficult, as it’s not <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> decide on my own. The agreement on a date comes between various parties at Sony, and it’s not necessarily a date I would be hoping for. March would've been too early.

[...] Sony Computer Entertainment has certain control over the release dates of their games, this {{could be one of the}} contributing factors delaying Gran Turismo 5.

Gran Turismo 5 was shown off extensively at E3 2010 including a new trailer, a North and Latin American release date, playable demos on the show floor and various private press conferences revealing new information about the game.

Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
