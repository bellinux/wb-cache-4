5|$|Linezolid's <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> against Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{is similar}} to that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} this broader <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of {{lamotrigine}} is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-activated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.|$|E

25|$|Ketoconazole has {{activity}} against {{many kinds}} of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus). First synthesized in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as itraconazole, because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

25|$|A serendipitous {{discovery}} {{was made in}} China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess a broad <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> against {{a wide range of}} trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies {{have investigated the}} effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The {{search for}} {{antifungal}} agents with acceptable toxicity profiles led {{first to the}} discovery of ketoconazole, the first azole-based oral treatment of systemic fungal infections, in the early 1980s. Later, triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole, with a broader <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> antifungal <b>activity</b> and improved safety profile were developed. In order to overcome limitations such as sub-optimal <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> drug-drug interactions, toxicity, development of resistance and unfavorable pharmacokinetics, analogues were developed. Second-generation triazoles, including voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole, are more potent and more active against resistant pathogens.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} these {{promising}} advantages, nisin is the only bacteriocin {{generally recognized as safe}} by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently used as a food preservative in several countries.This limitation in bacteriocins availability in the market as preservatives and antimicrobials can be attributed to multiple factors, including: (i) the high cost of their commercial production; (ii) the loss of their activity by proteolytic enzymes; (iii) their unfavorable interactions with other food constituents, which decreases the availability and necessitates a huge amount of the peptide to be added; (iv) the alterations of the chemical and physical properties of these compounds during the various food-processing stages; (v) the low yield of these compounds due to ineffective recovery by traditional purification methods; and (vi) the narrow <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> observed for most of the tested bacteriocins against pathogenic bacteria. In the last years, several studies on bacteriocins have demonstrated that the optimization of their production conditions, their purification methods, their combinations with other antimicrobial agents, the hurdle technology approach, and nanotechnology formulations, could all represent solutions to some of the previously mentioned problems.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that {{it takes a long time}} to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E
500|$|The main use of {{linezolid}} is {{the treatment}} of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics; {{it should not be}} used against bacteria that are sensitive to drugs with a narrower <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> such as penicillins and cephalosporins.

2500|$|Ehrlich's {{approach}} of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring {{the effects of}} these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including Bayer scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and Gerhard Domagk.

In 1939, Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this discovery. Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to World War II was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of anti-infective drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.|$|E
