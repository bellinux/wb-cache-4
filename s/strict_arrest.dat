50|$|Thurzó debated further {{proceedings}} with Elizabeth's son Paul {{and two of}} her sons-in-law. A {{trial and}} execution would have caused a public scandal and disgraced a noble and influential family (which at the time ruled Transylvania), and Elizabeth's considerable property would have been seized by the crown. Thurzó, along with Paul and her two sons-in-law, originally planned for Elizabeth to be spirited away to a nunnery, but as accounts of her murder of the daughters of lesser nobility spread, {{it was agreed that}} Elizabeth Báthory should be kept under <b>strict</b> house <b>arrest</b> and that further punishment should be avoided.|$|R
50|$|Anti-fascists {{consisted}} of various sorts {{of political and}} ideological opponents or antagonists of the Ustaše regime. In general, their treatment was similar to other inmates, although known communists were executed right away, and convicted Ustaše or law-enforcement officials, or others close to the Ustaše in opinion, such as Croatian peasants, were held on beneficial terms and granted amnesty after serving a duration of time. The leader of the banned Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček was held in Jasenovac from October 1941 to March 1942, after which he was kept under <b>strict</b> house <b>arrest.</b> Jasenovac {{consisted of}} a unique camp for children in Sisak.

50|$|After {{enduring}} {{years in}} the Fleet, Mary's husband Thomas Keyes was released in 1569, and permitted to return to Kent. However, his health had been broken by the conditions of his imprisonment, and he died shortly before 3 September 1571. Mary begged Elizabeth for permission to bring up her husband's orphaned children from his first marriage, but her request was denied, {{and it was not}} until May 1572, after Mary had been under <b>strict</b> house <b>arrest</b> for seven years, that the Queen relented sufficiently to allow her to live where she pleased. However, for the time being Mary had no friends to take her in, and insufficient income to live independently. She continued to reside as an unwelcome guest with the Greshams until Sir Thomas suggested that she be sent to live at Beaumanor in Leicestershire with her late mother's second husband, Adrian Stokes, who had recently married Anne Carew, the widow of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. In 1573 Mary left the Gresham household for good, 'with all her books and rubbish', as Sir Thomas put it.|$|R
5000|$|During Jackson's Valley Campaign of 1862, Garnett's {{military}} career took a downward {{turn at the}} First Battle of Kernstown in March. Jackson marched his army 40 mi to intercept {{a portion of the}} Union Army under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks. On March 23, Jackson's cavalry commander, Col. Turner Ashby, brought faulty intelligence that the retreating Union division of Brig. Gen. James Shields had four regiments in the rear outside Winchester, Virginia. Since that force was of comparable size to Jackson's, he ordered Garnett and the Stonewall Brigade to attack. Unfortunately, Shields had a full infantry division on hand, almost 9,000 men, twice the size of Jackson's force. The attack went badly and Garnett, finding his brigade low on ammunition and surrounded by forces attacking from three sides, ordered a retreat. Jackson was infuriated and accused Garnett of disobeying orders, meaning that he should not have retreated without obtaining permission from Jackson first. Jackson, well known as a <b>strict</b> disciplinarian, <b>arrested</b> Garnett for [...] "neglect of duty" [...] on April 1 and relieved him of command. Garnett's court-martial started in August 1862, with only Jackson and his aide giving testimony. However the trial was suspended due to the start of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Northern Virginia Campaign and the Second Battle of Bull Run that August.|$|R
40|$|The Duluth model's major {{contribution}} to the national legal reform effort has been its method of negotiating agreements with community agencies that intervene in domestic violence cases. Included in this interagency effort are victim advocates, law enforcement officers and administrators, prosecutors, probation officers, court administrators, mental health providers, policy makers, and in a limited role, judges. The model focuses on ensuring that practitioners respond to domestic violence cases in a consistent manner and that their response centralizes victim safety. Although coordination is a method to reach the overall goal of victim safety, {{it is not in}} itself the primary goal of the Duluth model. When reform efforts focus on coordinating the system rather than on building safety considerations into the infrastructure, the system could actually become more harmful to victims than the previously unexamined system. If we measure success by counting increases in arrests, conviction rates, or a reduction of repeat cases entering the system, coordination may seem to be the key to an interagency effort. However, if we use the criteria of insuring victim safety, holding offenders appropriately accountable for their violence, and changing the climate of tolerance for this type of violence, we see that coordination is merely a means to far more complex objectives. Many cities adopt a <b>strict</b> mandatory <b>arrest</b> or a no-drop prosecution policy on domestic violence cases, as if apprehending and convicting batterers is the only goal of intervention. This course of action is shortsighted and ultimately fails because typically the victim is the bigges...|$|R
50|$|On 19 August 1565 Thomas Keyes, Lady Mary, and her servant Frances Goldwell were {{examined}} concerning the marriage, {{and for this}} 'monstrous' act of lese-majeste Keyes was committed to solitary confinement in the Fleet prison, while Lady Mary was placed under <b>strict</b> house <b>arrest.</b> In June and July 1566 Keyes wrote several times to Cecil from the Fleet, begging him to intercede for him with the Queen. Keyes offered to have the marriage annulled, but on 5 August Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, having investigated the matter, wrote to Cecil that if the marriage were to be dissolved {{it must be done}} judicially. On 21 December Keyes again wrote to Cecil, complaining of his harsh treatment in the Fleet, and in particular that he had become ill, having been served meat for his dinner which had been steeped in a liquid used to treat the prison's dogs for mange. On 7 July 1567, Keyes wrote again to Cecil. He was finally released from the Fleet in 1568, but was still not permitted to see his wife. On 6 October 1568, a free man, he wrote to Cecil from Lewisham, stating that he would rather die in the Queen's service than end his days banished from her presence. His plea went unregarded, and for the few remaining years of his life Keyes resided at Lewisham and then at Sandgate. In 1569 he was re-appointed captain of Sandgate Castle when England was threatened by a French-Spanish alliance, and on 7 May 1570 he wrote to Archbishop Matthew Parker asking him to intercede for him with the Queen, again requesting that he might be permitted to live with his wife. In 1571 Keyes made an unsuccessful bid to be re-elected to parliament for Hythe.|$|R
50|$|The Allies high {{commander}} gave <b>strict</b> {{orders to}} <b>arrest</b> {{the crew and}} bring the ship back. On the night of 8 February 1921 when Alemdar was trying to sail to east, the French gunboat C-27 waiting in ambush out of Karadeniz Ereğli harbor, caught Alemdar. The French navy was especially active in western Black Sea because of the coal mines in Zonguldak, which is situated {{to the east of}} Karadeniz Ereğli. French commander Tilli and a small platoon embarked the ship, and the ship was directed to İstanbul with the gunboat in rear. After a short voyage, however, the crew overtook the French soldiers by surprise, and redirected the ship back to Karadeniz Ereğli. The gunboat opened fire, but fearing to wound the French soldiers, they didn’t use their heavy guns. In Karadeniz Ereğli harbor, the French gunboat maneuvered sailing between Alemdar and the pier. But this was not a wise choice; because the nationalists in Karadeniz Ereğli opened fire from the pier. According to Erol Mütercimler while the casualty of Alemdar was one death (Recep Kahya) and three wounded soldiers, the casualty of C-27 was two deaths and three wounded soldiers. The gunboat retreated. According to the agreement reached on 2 March, the French military personnel who were held captive were released and the French navy promised not to interfere Alemdar’s voyage. This was a relatively small clash. But the news of arresting an allied commander brought a big morale for the nationalists.|$|R
40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 16 is {{a potent}} mediator of cell cycle arrest and it is inactivated in {{a broad spectrum of}} human cancers. However, {{little is known about the}} physiologic settings of p 16 expression as well as factors that are important in regulating p 16 during tumorigenesis. Since p 16 expression is low in normal tissues and it does not appear to be required for development, we hypothesized that, like p 53, p 16 may be induced specifically in response to features of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic states. To test this hypothesis, we examined p 16 expression in human colorectal tumorigenesis because it is one of the best-studied examples of multi-step carcinogenesis. Our study revealed that p 16 is expressed at low to undetectable levels in normal colonic epithelium and is expressed at elevated levels in neoplastic cells from all stages of tumorigenesis. p 16 is likely to be functional by several criteria. In addition, p 16 expression was detected in areas of crypt architectural distortion and epithelial regeneration in ulcerative colitis, suggesting neoplastic changes are not required for p 16 induction. Our findings suggest that p 16 induction is not likely to be dependent on a specific mutational event, rather it may be a generalized cellular response to proliferative or oncogenic stress. Consistent with this notion, we obtained evidence that p 16 can be induced in cultures of normal human epithelial cells following ionizing irradiation. To investigate how p 16 may influence tumor development in the intestine, we introduced an Apc mutation into the INK 4 a-null mice. Preliminary findings suggest that the INK 4 a/ARF locus may restrain tumor development in the colon, in part, by suppressing angiogenesis. ^ p 16 has been shown to play a role in senescence. However, it is unclear whether p 16 can block cell proliferation irreversibly. Using a single cell assay, we demonstrated that p 16 can initiate a durable block to cell proliferation and this state becomes independent of p 16 expression, hypophosphorylation of pRb, or a <b>strict</b> G 1 <b>arrest.</b> The finding that long term p 16 expression is not required to impose an irreversible block to proliferation may have important clinical implications. ...|$|R
40|$|In Atwater v. City of Lago Vista the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} arrest and jailing {{of a woman}} for a seat belt {{violation}} even though her offense was punishable only with a small fine, {{and there was no}} reason why the police officer could not have simply issued a citation. Atwater thus permits, and indeed encourages, unnecessary and disproportionate arrests (along with the various searches and other hardships which routinely accompany an arrest). The extremely broad arrest power recognized by the Court also creates a grave potential for abuse in light of the breadth of modern traffic laws (almost every driver violates some minor traffic rule), the broad search powers which accompany an arrest, the documented tendency for some officers to engage in pretextual investigations and/or racial profiling, and the absence of effective legal limits on pretexts and profiling. The Atwater decision is puzzling as well as troubling. The majority opinion admits that Ms. Atwater 2 ̆ 7 s arrest was pointless and, as explained in this article, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasons for upholding her arrest are not persuasive. This decision can best be explained in the context of other recent Fourth Amendment cases which, like Atwater, reveal the Court 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to limit further applications of case-specific reasonableness balancing. However, even if the concerns underlying this latent trend are valid, they did not justify the decision in Atwater. The proper resolution of a case like Atwater can benefit from, and contribute to, current theories of constitutional interpretation. Atwater shows the severe limitations of originalism and textualism, but it adds considerable support to (and helps to further refine) Professor Cass Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s theory of minimalism - that the Court should generally decide cases narrowly both in terms of the scope of the ruling and its reasoning. The facts and case-specific policy arguments in Ms. Atwater 2 ̆ 7 s case were compelling, and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s broad grant of arrest power risks many adverse unintended consequences. The Court easily could and should have ruled narrowly, deciding only that, for non-jailable traffic violations, the police must show a legitimate need to arrest rather than issue a citation. These legitimate needs are well defined in statutes and rules found in a number of states. Given the broad scope of traffic laws, and the infrequent circumstances which justify arrest for these minor violations, <b>strict</b> limitations on <b>arrest</b> powers are both essential and administratively feasible. All states should enact similar limitations by statute or criminal rule; if such limitations are not forthcoming, courts should not hesitate to recognize them under state constitutions.
