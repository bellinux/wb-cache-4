5|$|Following {{his seventh}} {{season with the}} Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the time, {{it was the largest}} {{contract}} ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954.

5|$|In 1966, {{the team}} moved from Milwaukee {{to its current}} location, Atlanta. Its first manager in Atlanta was Bobby Bragan, who managed the team for three seasons earlier in Milwaukee. Lum Harris was the first manager to have managed the team in Atlanta {{for more than four}} seasons. Harris led the team into the NL Championship Series (NLCS) in 1969, but failed to advance into the World Series.

Both Maris and Mantle would {{continue}} to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the record. On {{the last day of}} the season, Maris broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium.

5|$|The 1983 Longhorns {{finished}} with a 61–14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by Collegiate Baseball Magazine.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} objective {{differs from}} that of traditional fighters by aiming to knock opponents off of the stage instead of depleting life bars. The original Super Smash Bros., released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, had a small budget and was originally a Japan-only release, but its domestic success led to a worldwide release. The series achieved even greater success with the release of Super Smash Bros. Melee, which was released in 2001 for the GameCube and became the best-selling game on that system. A third installment, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, was released in 2008 for the Wii. Although HAL Laboratory has been the developer of the first two titles, the third game was developed through the collaboration of several companies. The fourth and fifth installments, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, were released in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, respectively. The 3DS installment was the first <b>series</b> <b>title</b> to be released on a handheld platform.|$|E
