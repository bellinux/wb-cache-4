40|$|A {{survey of}} <b>simulid</b> larval parasites {{was carried out}} in {{different}} localities of the states of Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from February 1996 to May 1998. Prevalences for the microsporidian Polydispyrenia simulii Lutz & Splendore, 1908 were found in Morungaba and Leme, São Paulo, ranging from around 0. 7 to 66. 7 %, depending mainly on the host <b>simulid</b> species. Microsporidiosis was registered in localities of São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Parasitism by Isomermis sp. (Nematoda, Mermithidae) was found in Simulium larvae from Serra do Japi, ranging from 0. 8 to 45. 8 %, depending on the <b>simulid</b> species and the larval microhabitat in the stream, whether a cemented ramp in a lake outlet or the natural stream bed. Parasitism by mermithids was also found in ten localities. Mycoses caused by Coelomycidium sp. were for the first time recorded for larvae of Simulium (Chirostilbia) pertinax Kollar, 1832...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to broaden the survey of simuliid species in French Guiana and to cytologically analyze the species in the Simulium perflavum species group. Twelve species of Simulium were collected from which S. goeldii, S. quadrifidum, S. trombetense, S. near incrustatum, S. metallicum (s. 1.) sp 1, S. metallicum (s. 1.) sp 2 and S. ochraceum (s. 1.) are reported for the first time for this region. The only species collected in the S. perflavum group was S. rorotaense; 34 larvae of this species were cytologically analyzed, all of which had the standard sequence. S. metallicum (s. l.), S. ochraceum (s. 1.), S. guianense (s. 1.) and S. oyapockense (s. 1.) are involved with transmission of onchocerciasis in Central and South America, however, in French Guiana these species were not found biting humans during the sampling period. With the few collections made during this study, we increase the number of <b>simulid</b> species known in French Guiana from 6 to 13. It is clear that more simuliid species can be expected to be found when more sampling is done, including collections in other ecoregions in French Guiana...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} and increasing levels of pollution, water abstraction {{and numbers of}} predatory exotic fishes gave rise to mounting concern {{for the survival of}} the already endangered Twee River redfin, Barbus erubescens. Numbers were believed to be dwindling and an urgent re-assessment of the species' conservation status and major threats was called for. Distribution and estimated numbers of B. erubescens were detennined from a census conducted in the Twee River catclunent, and baseline knowledge of age and growth, reproduction, diet and habitat preferences was gained from biological work on collected specimens. Such understanding was necessary to formullate management ideas. Although an estimated 40 % reduction in area of occupancy has occurred in the middle reaches of the Twee River system, the known distribution of B. erubescens was extended into the upper Suurvlei River. Despite fragmentation, surviving redfin populations remained healthy and total population size was estimated at 8400 individuals, 4100 of which were considered mature. Adults preferred pools with water exceeding 1 m in depth and tended to be associated with sandy or boulder substrates. Due to low numbers no such study was conducted on juveniles, although observations indicated a preference for the upper 50 cm of the water column, in or around marginal vegetation. Barbus erubescens spawn in summer and follow an asynchronous, iteroparous pattern. Males and females reach a maximum age of six years, maturing after two years at calculated SL of 45 mm in males and 42 mm in females. The diet was dominated by <b>simulid</b> and ephemeropteran larvae. Although the combined pressures of pesticide and fertiliser use, predation and competition from exotic species have undoubtedly had a negative impact on B. erubescens, the species has maintained viable populations. With continued expansion of these threats the focus of conservation attention may change but, at present, it is most likely agricultural water use, amounting to 7. 43 x 10 ⁶ m³y⁻¹, 15 % of the entire catchment production, which poses the greatest immediate threat to the survival of the species. Based on a deteriorating habitat and restricted area of occupancy, B. erubescens was rated Critically Endangered, and it is recommended that a conservation management plan be implemented in the Twee River catchment. The focus of such action should be on genetic preservation, with immediate projects including gamete cryopreservation and captive breeding and rearing programmes. Catchment management, including education and rehabilitation programmes, must be the long-term aim of conservation, to ensure the survival of B. erubescens...|$|E
40|$|The {{predation}} and phoretic association (occasional?) among <b>simulids</b> and mollusks {{are being}} registered {{here for the}} first time on the Neotropical region. These inter-relations observations were obtained among Asolene (Pomella) megastoma (Sowerby, 1825) and the simulids: Simulium (Thyrsopelma) Orbitale Lutz, 1910; Simulium (Psaroniocompsa) spp. The material studied is proceeding from the Uruguai river Hidrological Basin.

In this research, we isolated 76 colonies of B. thuringiensis from 30 soil samples that were taken from Ilha Bela (SP, Brazil), a place where <b>simulids</b> are already biologically controlled by B. thuringiensis, to find bacterial isolates that were capable of controlling A. aegypti. The 16 S ribosomal subunit genes of the selected isolates were sequenced, and the isolates were molecularly characterized based on their Dipteran-specific cry gene contents. Eight of the 76 isolates (10. 52 %) contained the cry 4 Aa, cry 4 Ba or cry 10 Aa genes, these isolates were carried out against A. aegypti larvae on bioassay. The presence or absence of specific cry genes was associated with the observed average larval mortalities. From the 76 isolates, seven (9. 2 %) were potentially able to control A. aegypti larvae.

Bacillus thuringiensis é entomopatogênica, por produzir proteínas cristais, denominadas proteínas Cry, as quais são codificadas pelos genes cry. Essa bactéria atua no controle biológico de insetos-praga de culturas economicamente importantes, bem como no controle de insetos vetores causadores de doenças, como o Aedes aegypti, mosquito transmissor do vírus da dengue. Os isolados dessa bactéria podem ser caracterizados pelo conteúdo de genes cry que possuem e, assim, predizer o alvo de controle dos mesmos às diferentes ordens de insetos. Com o objetivo de encontrar isolados eficientes no controle do vetor A. aegypti, o presente trabalho isolou 76 colônias de B. thuringiensis a partir de 30 amostras de solo oriundas de Ilhabela-SP, município que se caracteriza por realizar controle biológico de simulídeos com essa bactéria. Os 76 isolados foram sequenciados na região da subunidade ribossomal 16 S e caracterizados molecularmente quanto ao conteúdo de genes cry díptero-específicos. No total, oito isolados (10, 52 % do total) apresentaram bandas para os genes cry 4 Aa, cry 4 Ba e cry 10 Aa, sendo os mesmos testados contra larvas de A. aegypti por meio de bioensaios. A presença e/ou ausência dos genes cry foi associada à mortalidade média de larvas. Dentre os isolados estudados, sete (9, 2 % do total) apresentaram elevado potencial de controle às larvas de A. aegypti, sendo assim considerados como promissores para o manejo do controle biológico de larvas de A. aegypti com a bactéria B. thuringiensis...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo foi realizado na bacia do rio Caí, no Rio Grande do Sul, em duas áreas com diferentes estados de conservação ambiental: uma fortemente alterada pela intensa avicultura e suinocultura e outra mais conservada. Para padronizar as coletas das larvas e pupas de simulídeos foram utilizados substratos artificiais, instalados nos arroios por períodos de 14 dias. Em todos os pontos de amostragens foram feitas coletas simultâneas de água para análise físico-química e microbiológica. Na área mais conservada foram coletadas onze espécies com as seguintes freqüências: Psaroniocompsa incrustata (42, 95 %), P. auripellita (17, 66 %), Chirostilbia pertinax (16, 86 %), Inaequalium subclavibranchium (8, 43 %), I. nogueirai (5, 80 %), P. anamariae (3, 69 %), I. clavibranchium (1, 58 %), C. riograndense (0, 92 %), Lutzsimulium hirticosta (0, 92 %), I. botulibranchium (0, 79 %), Thyrsopelma itaunense (0, 40 %). Na área de maior impacto foram coletadas apenas seis espécies: C. pertinax (84, 31 %), C. riograndense (7, 52 %), T. itaunense (4, 68 %), P. incrustata (2, 94 %), I. subclavibranchium (0, 33 %), Ectemnaspis dinellii (0, 22 %). As concentrações de Nitrato e Nitrito na água foram os fatores que melhor permitem distinguir os pontos amostrados. A concentração de nitrato esteve significativamente relacionada com C. pertinax (r²= 0, 54; P This {{study was}} carried out in two areas with {{different}} degrees of environmental degradation in the Caí river basin, in Rio Grande do Sul. One sampling area is less altered and the other is strongly impaired by organic pollutants from avian and swine production. The larvae and pupae of <b>simulids</b> were collected using artificial substrates that remain submersed in streams for 14 days. In all sampling sites water was collected simultaneously for physical-chemical and microbiological analysis. In the less disturbed area eleven species were collected with the following frequencies: Psaroniocompsa incrustata (42. 95 %), P. auripellita (17. 66 %), Chirostilbia pertinax (16. 86 %), Inaequalium subclavibranchium (8. 43 %), I. nogueirai (5. 80 %), P. anamariae (3. 69 %), I. clavibranchium (1. 58 %), C. riograndense (0. 92 %), Lutzsimulium hirticosta (0. 92 %), I. botulibranchium (0. 79 %), Thyrsopelma itaunense (0. 40 %). In the more disturbed area only six species were collected: C. pertinax (84. 31 %), C. riograndense (7. 52 %), T. itaunense (4. 68 %), P. incrustata (2. 94 %), I. subclavibranchium (0. 33 %), Ectemnaspis dinellii (0. 22 %).
