50|$|Most turbomolecular pumps employ {{multiple}} stages, each {{consisting of}} a quickly rotating rotor blade and stationary <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> pair. The system works like a compressor that puts energy into the gas, rather than taking it out. Gas captured by the upper stages is pushed into the lower stages and successively compressed {{to the level of}} the fore-vacuum (backing pump) pressure.As the gas molecules enter through the inlet, the rotor, which has a number of angled blades, hits the molecules. Thus the mechanical energy of the blades is transferred to the gas molecules. With this newly acquired momentum, the gas molecules enter into the gas transfer holes in the stator. This leads them to the next stage where they again collide with the rotor surface, and this process is continued, finally leading them outwards through the exhaust.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{diminishing}} reserves {{of fossil fuels}} and increased pollution from exploitation of these fuels, the world is focusing on the renewable energy sources. Energy from tidal waves {{is one of the}} most exciting forms of renewable energy because of its consistent nature. Hence, the predictable, consistent and reliable nature of marine currents has enthused the researchers to emphasize on harnessing energy from marine currents in order to meet the renewable energy targets. Exploitation of this technology is underway and further research is required to extract this energy optimally. Operating under water and harnessing kinetic energy has restated the importance of Vertical Axis Marine Current Turbines (VAMCTs). Recent studies have shown that the shape of the blades, within a VAMCT, has an appreciably considerable effect on its performance output. The flow field in the vicinity of the VAMCT is greatly affected by the design and shape of the <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> This paper presents an effort carried out to analyze the effect of the shape of the <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> of a VAMCT on its performance output. VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> has been analyzed and the results have been compared with the existing literature for the performance output from a VAMCT having straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> It has been shown that a VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> performances superiorly as compared to straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> Furthermore, the operational range of a VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> increases significantly as compared to straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The J79 was {{a brand-new}} engine, with {{development}} continuing throughout the YF-104A test phase and during service with the F-104A. The engine featured variable incidence compressor stator blades, a design feature that altered {{the angle of}} the stator blades automatically with altitude and temperature. A condition known as [...] "T-2 reset", a normal function that made large <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> angle changes, caused several engine failures on takeoff. It was discovered that large and sudden temperature changes (e.g., from being parked in the sun prior to becoming airborne) were falsely causing the engine stator blades to close and choke the compressor. The dangers presented by these engine failures were compounded by the downward ejection seat, which gave the pilot little chance of a safe exit at low level. The engine systems were subsequently modified and the ejection seat changed to the more conventional upward type. Uncontrolled tip-tank oscillations sheared one wing off of an F-104B; this problem was apparent during testing of the XF-104 prototype and was eventually resolved by filling the tank compartments in a specific order.|$|E

40|$|The {{trend of}} modern turbomachines towards lighter and slimmer blades exposed to higher {{loadings}} has made forced response problems {{emerge as a}} major concern in the design process of these machines. Forced response accounts for unsteady forces on the blade due to non-uniformities in the flow field. The clocking method, which consists in this case in changing the relative circumferential position between two consecutive <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> rows, represents a possibility to reduce the excitation level of the blade’s natural modes. The goal {{of this investigation was}} to analyze the influence of the clocking method on a transonic compressor in order to find an optimum regarding aerodynamic forcing. The investigation was carried out in three parts. The first consisted in a computational fluid dynamics analysis which aimed at calculating the unsteady forces acting on the blades. The second consisted in a finite element analysis with the purpose of obtaining the mode shapes of the dangerous natural modes of the blades. In third part, the two analyses were coupled in order to evaluate the excitation level of the blades for seven equally-spaced clocking cases that covered a complete circumferential pitch. The results revealed that changing the circumferential position of the inlet guide vane with respect to the first <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> row can reduce the excitation level of the rotor blade row in between by more than 50 percent and of the <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> row by about 30 percent.
