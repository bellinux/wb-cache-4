Using these two structures, nonvolatile Si-NC floating-gate nMOSFETs were fabri-cated at x = 1. 6 following 1. 5 -µm CMOS standard procedures. The Fowler–Nordheim tunneling of the electrons through the tunnel oxide, their storage into NCs, retention, and endurance are all investigated by varying the device structure and the thicknesses of the NC and oxide layers. It is shown that charge-retention time is longer, and program/erase (P/E) speeds are faster in doubly <b>stacked</b> <b>devices</b> than in single-layer devices, which seem to result from the optimization of device structure, the exclusion of unwanted defects {{due to the nature}} of UHV, and the suppression of charge leakage by the multiple barriers/NC layers in the doubly <b>stacked</b> <b>devices.</b> It is also found that the threshold voltages in the endurance characteristics anomalously increase with the P/E cycles, more strongly in the doubly stacked NC memories.

40|$|Through silicon via (TSV) based 3 D {{integrated}} circuits have inspired a novel design paradigm which explores the vertical dimension, {{in order to}} alleviate the performance and power limitations associated with long interconnects in 2 D circuits. TSVs enable vertical interconnects across stacked and thinned dies in 3 D-IC designs, resulting in reduced wirelength, footprint, faster speed, improved bandwidth, and lesser routing congestion. However, the usage of TSVs itself gives rise to many critical design challenges towards the minimization of chip delay and power consumption. Therefore, realization {{of the benefits of}} 3 D ICs necessitates an early and realistic prediction of circuit performance during the early layout design stage. The goal of this thesis is to meet the design challenges of 3 D ICs by providing new capabilities to the existing floorplanning framework [87]. The additional capabilities included in the existing floorplanning tool is the co-placement of TSV islands with circuit blocks and performing non-deterministic assignment of signals to TSVs. We also replace the wirelength and number of TSVs in the floorplanning cost function with the total delay in the nets. The delay-aware cost function accounts for RC delay impact of TSVs on the delay of individual signal connection, and obviates the efforts required to balance the weight contributions of wirelength and TSVs in the wirelength-aware floorplanning. Our floorplanning tool results in 5 % shorter wirelength and 21 % lesser TSVs compared to recent approaches. The delay in the cost function improves total delay in the interconnects by 10 % - 12 % compared to wirelength-aware cost function. The influence of large coupling capacitance between TSVs on the delay, power and coupling noise in 3 D interconnects also offers serious challenges to the performance of 3 D-IC. Due to the degree of design complexity introduced by TSVs in 3 D ICs, the importance of early stage evaluation and optimization of delay, power and signal integrity of 3 D circuits cannot be ignored. The unique contribution of this work is to develop methods for accurate analysis of timing, power and coupling noise across multiple <b>stacked</b> <b>device</b> layers during the floorplanning stage. Incorporating the impact of TSV and the <b>stacking</b> of multiple <b>device</b> layers within floorplanning framework will help to achieve 3 D layouts with superior performance. Therefore, we proposed an efficient TSV coupling noise model to evaluate the coupling noise in the 3 D interconnects during floorplanning. The total coupling noise in 3 D interconnects is included in the cost function to optimize positions of TSVs and blocks, as well as nets-to-TSVs assignment to obtain floorplans with minimized coupling noise. We also suggested diagonal TSV arrangement for larger TSV pitch and nonuniform pitch arrangement for reducing worst TSV-to-TSV coupling, thereby minimizing the coupling noise in the interconnects. This thesis also focuses on more realistic evaluation and optimization of delay and power in TSV based 3 D {{integrated circuits}} considering the interconnect density on individual device layers. The floorplanning tool uses TSV locations and delay, non-uniform interconnect density across multiple <b>stacked</b> <b>device</b> layers to assess and optimize the buffer count, delay, and interconnect power dissipation in a design. It is shown that the impact of non-uniform interconnect density, across the <b>stacked</b> <b>device</b> layers, should not be ignored, as its contribution to the performance of the 3 D interconnects is consequential. A wire capacitance-aware buffer insertion scheme is presented that determines the optimal distance between adjacent buffers on the individual device layers for nonuniform wire density between <b>stacked</b> <b>device</b> layers. The proposed approach also considers TSV location on a 3 D wire to optimize the buffer insertion around TSVs. For 3 D designs with uniform wire density across <b>stacked</b> <b>device</b> layers, we propose a TSV-aware buffer insertion approach that appropriately models the TSV RC delay impact on interconnect delay to determine the optimum interval between adjacent buffers for individual 3 D nets. Moreover, our floorplanning tool help achieve 3 D layouts with superior performance by incorporating the impact of nonuniform density on the delay, power and coupling noise in the interconnects during floorplanning...|$|R
40|$|The {{driving force}} for the {{semiconductor}} industry growth has been the elegant scaling nature of CMOS technology. In future CMOS technology generations, supply and threshold voltages will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, control switching power dissipation, and maintain reliability. These continual scaling requirements on supply and threshold voltages pose several technology and circuit design challenges. With threshold voltage scaling, subthreshold leakage power is expected to become {{a significant portion of}} the total power in future CMOS systems. Therefore, it becomes crucial to predict and reduce subthreshold leakage power of such systems. In the first part of this paper, we present a subthreshold leakage power prediction model that takes into account within-die threshold voltage variation. Statistical measurements of 32 -bit microprocessors in 0. 18 - m CMOS confirm that the mean error of the model is 4 %.

It is now a very active area of research generating thousands of publications, resulting in advancements in a multi-disciplinary setting. The research described in the body of this thesis aims to investigate the use of new materials and architectures in the fabrication of organic photovoltaics. An approach to incorporate carbon nanotube-Buckminster fullerene hybrid materials into the blended active layer of organic photovoltaic devices is introduced and the effects on devices are elucidated. It is found that the use of cut (barrel) single walled carbon nanotubes was the least detrimental to device performance. The use of alternative methods to fabricate or replace commonly used materials and inter-layers (PCBM, ITO, PEDOT:PSS) in the device structure are presented. The use of thin metal films such as silver and gold is shown to be viable and interesting alternatives to ITO.
