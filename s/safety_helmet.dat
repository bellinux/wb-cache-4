2500|$|The wicket-keeper and the batsmen wear {{protective}} gear {{because of the}} hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than [...] and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> for the head and a box inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads.

5000|$|Headgear. Compressive <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> worn {{tightly and}} {{closely to the}} scalp are a cause of {{traction}} alopecia. The lining of tightly fitted <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> like those worn for activities such as motorcycling, cycling, skiing and snowboarding {{are responsible for the}} constant rubbing and tugging of localised areas of the hair and scalp. Frequent wearers or those who use such helmets for prolonged periods seem more likely to suffer traction alopecia.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate noise exposure of motorcyclists at work. Open and full face <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> were compared and the effects of helmet design and the contribution of radio intercoms investigated. Special measuring equipment is described and hearing protection discussed. Previous studies concentrated mainly on the attenuation of noise by <b>safety</b> <b>helmets,</b> and were made under conditions untypical of day-to-day motorcycling. During town driving the sample equivalent continuous noise level (s. leq) ranged from 63 to 90 dB(A), the intercom giving the highest peak levels. On the open road s. leq was up to 105 dB(A); exposure to this level for only 15 min would exceed the present recommended maximum of 90 dB(A) for an 8 h working day...|$|R

50|$|A kite buggy is a light, {{purpose-built}} vehicle {{powered by}} a traction kite (power kite). It is single-seated and has one steerable front wheel and two fixed rear wheels. The driver sits in the seat located {{in the middle of}} the vehicle and accelerates and slows down by applying steering manoeuvres in coordination with flying manoeuvres of the kite. This activity is called kite buggying. The speed achieved in kite buggies by skilled drivers can range up to around 110 km/h (70 mph), hence protective clothing, including a <b>safety</b> <b>helmet,</b> is commonly worn.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{full-face}} {{crash helmets}} were regarded as essential equipment for drivers in all forms of motor racing, and the Snell Memorial Foundation developed the first auto racing helmet standards in 1959. Since that time, the alternative standard to that of Snell has been that of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, whose standards are used in Grand Prix racing. The <b>Safety</b> <b>Helmet</b> Council of America also developed a race-car helmet standard in the 1970s, but currently only provides certification to the Department of Transportation which does not certify racing car helmets.|$|E
5000|$|The Stackhat, {{originally}} {{designed as a}} generic sport <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> by CIG (Commonwealth Industrial Gases, now BOC) and then developed by Rosebank, was a bicycle helmet widely available in Australia in the 1980s. Due to government regulations and promotion by various State governments, the sturdy bright orange Stackhat had a near monopoly on bicycle helmets {{in the country for}} teenagers and children. Its distinctive design, initial release in a bright orange colour, ubiquitous ownership in the 1980s, and fast disappearance in the 1990s, have combined to make [...] "The Stackhat" [...] a defining symbol of the 1980s for Australians. While the variety of helmet colours expanded throughout the years, the design did not.|$|E
