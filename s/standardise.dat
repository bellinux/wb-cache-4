40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the most relevant}} issues concerning student <b>standardised</b> testing {{in which there are}} no-stakes for students ("standardised testing") through a literature review and a review of the trends in <b>standardised</b> testing in OECD countries. Unlike <b>standardised</b> tests in which there are high-stakes for students, no-stakes implies that test results have no impact on the student’s academic career. The same tests, however, may have high stakes for teachers and schools. The report provides an overview of the <b>standardised</b> testing typology in the no-stakes context, including identifying the driving trends behind the gradual increase in <b>standardised</b> testing in OECD countries and the different purposes of <b>standardised</b> tests. Within this framework the report reviews how <b>standardised</b> tests with no-stakes for students are designed, implemented and used across OECD countries. The report also aims to synthesise the relevant empirical research on the impact of <b>standardised</b> testing on teaching and learning and to draw out lessons from the literature on aspects of <b>standardised</b> tests that are more effective in improving student outcomes. Key debates concerning <b>standardised</b> testing are identified throughout and include (among others) : 1) selecting the appropriate test purpose; 2) teacher evaluation based on student test results; 3) the impact of publishing <b>standardised</b> test results; and 4) minimising strategic behaviour by teachers and administrators in <b>standardised</b> testing...|$|R

40|$|The partial {{concentration}} index (PCI) {{is commonly used}} {{as a measure of}} income related inequality in health after removing the effects of <b>standardising</b> variables such as age and gender which affect health, are correlated with income, but not amenable to policy. Both direct and indirect standardisation have been used to remove the effects of <b>standardising</b> variables. The paper shows that with individual level data direct standardisation is possible using the coefficients from a linear regression of health on income and the <b>standardising</b> variables and yields a consistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation estimates the effects of the <b>standardising</b> variables on health from a health regression which excludes income. The coefficients on the <b>standardising</b> variables include some of the effects of income on health if income is correlated with the <b>standardising</b> variables. Using these coefficients to remove the effects of the <b>standardising</b> variables also removes some of the effect of income on health and leads to an inconsistent estimate of the PCI. Indirect standardisation underestimates the PCI irrespective of the signs of the correlations of <b>standardising</b> variables and income {{with each other and with}} health. An adaptation of the PCI when the marginal effect of income on health depends on the <b>standardising</b> variables is also proposed. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

However, {{the validity of}} such <b>standardised</b> material is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the use of <b>standardised</b> sentences by comparing them to two existing, non-standardised datasets of simulated free and natural speech (the latter produced by mothers in real interactions). <b>Standardised</b> sentences and simulated free speech were produced by students and actresses without an interaction partner. Each dataset comprised recordings of infant- (IDS), foreigner- (FDS) and adult-directed (ADS) speech, which were analysed for mean F, vowel duration and hyperarticulation. Whilst students' mean F pattern in <b>standardised</b> speech was closer to the natural speech than their previous 'simulated free speech', no difference in vowel hyperarticulation and duration patterns was found for students' <b>standardised</b> sentences between the three speech styles. Actresses' F, vowel duration and hyperarticulation patterns in <b>standardised</b> speech were similar to the natural speech, and a part improvement on their 'simulated free speech'. These results suggest that successful reproduction of some acoustic measures (e. g., F) can be achieved with <b>standardised</b> content regardless {{of the type of}} speaker, whereas the production of other acoustic measures (e. g., hyperarticulation) are context- and speaker-dependent...|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} the {{original}} design was such that No. A866 was put {{on display at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley from May to November 1925, and no class-wide modifications were made until 1934. This was when the SECR and Woolwich batches began to receive new domes and front footsteps during overhauls and general repairs. These were the same design as those used on Nos.14001414, and were intended to <b>standardise</b> components between the batches. The SECR and Woolwich batches also received smoke deflectors to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring the driver's vision ahead. The U1 chimneys replaced the standard Nclass type on the earlier locomotives, which, along with the removal of the piston tail rods on the earlier batches, created a truly standardised appearance.|$|E
5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to <b>standardise</b> to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E
5|$|From the start, it was {{considered}} socially appropriate for women to play netball; netball's restricted movement appealed to contemporary notions of women's participation in sports, and the sport was distinct from potential rival male sports. Netball became a popular women's sport in countries where it was introduced and spread rapidly through school systems. School leagues and domestic competitions emerged {{during the first half}} of the 20th century, and in 1924 the first national governing body was established in New Zealand. International competition was initially hampered by a lack of funds and varying rules in different countries. Australia hosted New Zealand in the first international game of netball in Melbourne on 20 August 1938; Australia won 40–11. Efforts began in 1957 to <b>standardise</b> netball rules globally: by 1960 international playing rules had been standardised, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball, later the International Netball Federation (INF), was formed to administer the sport worldwide.|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown {{that it is possible}} to construct <b>standardised</b> curves of the sensitivity corrected growth in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) with exposure to ionising radiation, and that they may be used in the dating of quartz and polymineral samples. <b>Standardised</b> growth curves are particularly advantageous where measurement time is limited, as once they have been defined, only the natural signal and the response to a subsequent test dose are required in order to determine the equivalent dose of a sub-sample. The present study is concerned with the application of the <b>standardised</b> growth curve approach to OSL dating of Holocene age samples. Systematic changes in the shape of the <b>standardised</b> growth curve of coarse-grain quartz are identified as the size of the test dose is varied, because of non-proportionality between the test dose and the luminescence test response. The effect is characterised by fitting the change in gradient of the <b>standardised</b> growth curve as test dose is varied. An equation is defined to describe <b>standardised</b> growth as a function of regenerative dose and test dose. Regenerative dose responses of other samples in this study are treated as unknowns and recovered through different growth curves to compare precision and accuracy of various methods of D e determination. The <b>standardised</b> growth curve is found to yield similar precision to conventional fits of single aliquot regenerative data, but slightly poorer accuracy. The <b>standardised</b> growth curve approach was refined by incorporating the measurement of one regenerative response for each aliquot as well as its natural signal. Measurements of this additional data point for aliquots of 22 samples were used to adjust the <b>standardised</b> growth equation, improving its accuracy. The incorporation of this additional data point also indicated a systematic uncertainty of 2. 4...|$|R

The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs.

It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to <b>standardise</b> the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) held a {{committee}} meeting {{to revise the}} Unified Rules. During it, Kizer and Lembo proposed altering the rule on downward elbow strikes to permit 12-6 elbows to anywhere except {{the head of a}} downed opponent. However, the proposal was strongly rejected by doctors on the committee on the grounds that 12-6 elbows could still cause serious injury, even when not done on the head. The ABC, despite endorsing the Unified Rules, does not have statutory authority over the individual state athletic commissions in the United States though governs through influence. As a result, in some states such as Mississippi, 12-6 elbows are permitted in MMA fights. As a result, a commission was set up by ABC to look at the regional MMA rule variations, including 12-6 elbows, to <b>standardise</b> MMA in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The N class {{principles}} {{applied to}} the U class design aided mass production, and incorporated several features found on the GWR 4300 Class locomotives designed by Churchward. An order made in 1926 for a second batch of 20 K class locomotives was delayed until 1928, when the specification was revised to construct U class locomotives. It was intended to replace several elderly 4-4-0 classes within the former SECR's running fleet, and attempted to <b>standardise</b> and ease maintenance of locomotives by sharing parts with other Maunsell designs. The style of the new locomotive reflected the Midland Railway influence of another of Maunsell’s assistants, the ex-Midland Railway engineer James Clayton. The addition of a tender increased the operating range of the U class over its K class predecessors, and the wheel arrangement {{applied to the}} former K class locomotives improved the locomotive’s stability when operational.|$|E

5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the second}} and third Dukes of Norfolk as Lord High Treasurers from 1501 to 1546 led to a gradual reduction in the Exchequer's power. The Dukes were seen by the government as too independent to be trusted with any real power, but too useful to be removed; as a result, to indirectly reduce their power, the Exchequer was deliberately weakened. When William Paulet was appointed Treasurer in 1546 the Exchequer again increased in power, absorbing the Court of Augmentations and Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 1554. The Exchequer was also assisted in this period by Thomas Fanshawe, the Queen's Remembrancer; a capable man, Fanshawe was often consulted by the Barons of the Exchequer as to the best way to administer the court, and helped <b>standardise</b> pleadings, allowing the Exchequer to cope during a period of increased business. Fanshawe's administrative reforms were considered excellent, and his work continued to be used as the standard until the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War {{the demand}} for {{electricity}} increased in the United Kingdom. In North East England, {{this led to the}} construction of two new power stations at Stella, along with the expansion of stations at Dunston and Billingham, to meet {{the demand for}} power quickly. At Blyth, a larger and more efficient plant was planned, consisting of six 100megawatts (MW) generating units. This increased to six 120MW units, before increasing again in the final proposal for an A station consisting of four 120MW units and a B station consisting of two 275MW units and two 350MW units. This gave the A and B stations generating capacities of 480MW and 1,250MW respectively. The Blyth Power Stations were to be an experiment, using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to <b>standardise</b> power station plant and layout. Blyth was the first in the UK to use generating sets larger than the then standard 30MW and 60MW. The station's location was chosen because of its position within the super grid, rather than to be near a load centre.|$|E

In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to <b>standardise</b> equipment across the network and to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a sub-area section, and a spotting station. Sub-area sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E
