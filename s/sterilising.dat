5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, <b>sterilising</b> it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|Blanche Rosalie Slaughter {{was born}} in 1876 in Lynchburg, Virginia to Mary Harker and John Flavel Slaughter. She had five {{brothers}} and one sister (three other siblings died in childhood), and was educated in Lynchburg before travelling to a finishing school in Baltimore. As a child, she occasionally assisted her two older brothers, who were doctors, on their house visits or by <b>sterilising</b> their instruments, and also attended to pets in her neighbourhood. Following {{the death of her}} father, who had strongly opposed her desire to become a doctor, she joined the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893 using money saved from her childhood allowance.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as <b>sterilising</b> the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
40|$|Between 1975 and 1976 103 women {{requesting}} sterilisation reversal {{were interviewed}} at Hammersmith Hospital. Their average age at sterilisation was 26 - 7 years; 65 (63 - 1 %) had been <b>sterilised</b> immediately after pregnancy, and many patients had previously used contraception inadequately {{when they were}} <b>sterilised.</b> When they had been <b>sterilised</b> 78 (75 - 7 %) patients were unhappily married and remarriage was the chief reason for the request for reversal. Sexual dissatisfaction after sterilisation was common, {{but there was no}} obvious increase in menstrual disturbance. Thirty-nine (37 - 8 %) patients had been <b>sterilised</b> by irreversible methods, and in only half the cases <b>sterilised</b> by tubal ligation were conditions technically suitable for reversal surgery.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study of}} the {{complications}} after sterilisation 485 of the 547 women who had been <b>sterilised</b> by a modified Pomeroy procedure in one unit over 10 years were interviewed. They were asked whether they regretted being <b>sterilised</b> and about the quality of their sex lives, mental health, social relationships, and marriages. Most women were pleased to have been <b>sterilised,</b> only 24 regretting it. Regret was more pronounced among women who had been <b>sterilised</b> in association with a third caesarean section, those <b>sterilised</b> for medical reasons, and those whose marriages had ended in divorce. In each case where a woman regretted a sterilisation that had been performed on the recommendation of a psychiatrist, the psychiatrists were still prepared to defent their opinions. On their sex lives, mental health, social relationships, and marriages, more women reported improvement than deterioration, and in most cases the deterioration could not be attributed to the sterilisation. The overall benefits from sterilisation to the women in this series therefore seemed to outweigh substantially the adverse consequences experienced by a few...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how {{monetary}} policy should respond to nominal exchange rates in a New Keynesian open economy model. <b>Sterilised</b> intervention {{can be a}} potent tool that offers policymakers an additional degree of freedom in maximising global welfare. We show that the gains to <b>sterilised</b> intervention are greater when goods market integration is low and exchange rate pass-through is high. However, increased financial internationalisation reduces the effectiveness of <b>sterilised</b> intervention, as the international policy trilemma implies. Unsterilised intervention may also {{have a role to}} play, although the potential welfare gains from this are generally smaller. Most central banks in Asia have actively used <b>sterilised</b> foreign exchange intervention as a policy tool to smooth exchange rate movements. But, over time, declining exchange rate pass-through and the increasing international integration of financial and goods markets will tend to reduce the efficacy of <b>sterilised</b> intervention. Given the limited effectiveness of unsterilised intervention, our model implies that the role of exchange rate movements in the optimal setting of monetary policy is decreasing in Asia...|$|R

500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and <b>sterilising</b> abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale. Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses Canadian data {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between sterilisation and the work careers of women. The study is motivated by the observation that childbearing and child rearing are {{the main reasons for}} the intermittency of womens ’work. Sterilisation may be correlated with a change in the labour market behaviour of women because it ends childbearing. There are three main findings. First, among women with children, <b>sterilised</b> {{women are more likely to}} work than non-sterilised women. Second,being <b>sterilised</b> is found to have a positive and significant effect on the earnings of women who had stopped working in the past but has an insignifican effect on the earnings of continuously employed women.

However,among <b>sterilised</b> women who are currently working, most had experienced career interruptions that were initiated and completed before they became <b>sterilised.</b> ...|$|R

500|$|The exact {{starting}} {{date of the}} 1930s currency war is open to debate. The three principal parties were Britain, France, and the United States. For most of the 1920s the three generally had coinciding interests; both the US and France supported Britain's efforts to raise Sterling's value against market forces. Collaboration was aided by strong personal friendships among the nations' central bankers, especially between Britain's Montagu Norman and America's Benjamin Strong until the latter's early death in 1928. [...] Soon after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, France lost faith in Sterling {{as a source of}} value and begun selling it heavily on the markets. From Britain's perspective both France and the US were no longer playing by the rules of the gold standard. Instead of allowing gold inflows to increase their money supplies (which would have expanded those economies but reduced their trade surpluses) France and the US began <b>sterilising</b> the inflows, building up hoards of gold. These factors contributed to the Sterling crises of 1931; in September of that year Britain substantially devalued and took the pound off the gold standard. For several years after this global trade was disrupted by competitive devaluation and by retaliatory tariffs. The currency war of the 1930s is generally considered to have ended with the Tripartite monetary agreement of 1936.|$|E
500|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. [...] The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, <b>sterilising,</b> and vulcanisation. [...] In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. [...] Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. [...] It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent material for this purpose. [...] However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the absorbent material. [...] Waffle-iron filters are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. [...] An ideal filter will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. [...] This {{is an example of a}} filter being used in a choke application. [...] In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. [...] The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat.

Results. - Among the IDW included in this study, 22. 2 % are <b>sterilised,</b> which is superior to the 7 % in the general Belgian population. Factors associated with an increased probability to be <b>sterilised</b> are: living in an institution, having a higher intellectual quotient (IQ), being enrolled in an institution where sexual intercourse is authorised and attending an institution where contraception is required. The last three factors are significant only among women living in institutions and the last two, only in women with severe disability. Among IDW using contraception, no factor was associated with a greater probability to be <b>sterilised.</b> Conclusion. - The prevalence of sterilisation among IDW is three times higher than that in the Belgian population and it is mainly correlated with factors related to the institution where these women live, especially the severely disabled.

2500|$|When {{exchange}} rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist {{between members of}} a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy. [...] To a large degree, the change is optional for the surplus country, but compulsory for the deficit country. [...] In {{the case of a}} gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic. [...] When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. [...] The natural effect of this will be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. [...] However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (<b>sterilising</b> the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.|$|E
