40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and compare the weak-form efficiency of a set of 24 African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> and those of eight individual African national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Variance-ratio tests based on ranks and signs were used to examine the weak-form efficiency of the 32 <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> investigated. Findings – On average, it was found that irrespective of the test employed, the returns of all the 24 African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined in the study are less non-normally distributed compared to the eight individual national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined. The authors also report evidence of the African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> having significantly better weak-form informational efficiency than their national counterparts. Practical implications – The policy implication of this evidence is that the African equity price discovery process can be significantly improved if African stock markets integrate their operations. Economically, this may contribute to improved liquidity and more efficient allocation of capital, which in turn can be expected to have a positive impact on economic growth. Originality/value – The paper makes two major contributions to the extant literature. First, it offers for the first time a comparative analysis of the informational efficiencies of a sample of national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> as against African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices.</b> Second, there is no prior evidence as to whether African stock markets can improve their informational efficiencies by integrating their operations. The paper fills this gap by demonstrating that the African equity price formation process can be improved if African stock markets integrate their operations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Using 16 OECD <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> data, {{this paper}} revisits the random walk {{hypothesis}} by inspecting {{the degree of}} persistence of <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> We adopt two recently developed econometric procedures, due to Hansen (1999) and Romano and Wolf (2001), in order to estimate 95 % confidence intervals for {{the sum of the}} AR coefficients in AR representations of international <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> Confidence intervals provide much more information than knowing whether the null hypothesis of a unit root can be rejected or not. They serve as a measure of sampling uncertainty and describe the range of models that are consistent with the observed data. The results convincingly support the view that the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> in the OECD countries are highly persistent.

40|$|A simple {{model that}} is {{commonly}} used to interpret movements in corporate common <b>stock.</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> asserts that real <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> equal {{the present value of}} rationally expected or optimally forecasted future real dividends discounted by a constant real discount rate. This valuation model (or variations on it in which the real discount rate is not constant but fairly stable) is often used by economists and market analysts alike as a plausible model to describe the behavior of aggregate market indexes and is viewed as providing a reasonable story to tell when people ask what accounts for a sudden movement in <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes.</b> Such movements are then attributed to "new information" about future dividends. I will refer to this model as the "efficient markets mode" although it should be recognized that this name has also been applied to other models. It has often been claimed in popular discussions that <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> seem too "volatile," that is, that the movements in <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> could not realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements in the <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> seem to be "too big " relative to actual subsequent events.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the long memory, interrelationships and {{volatility}} spillovers for <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> of Taiwanese TFT-LCD upper, middle and down stream industries. This study formulates a trivariate FIEC-HYGARCH Model. The sample period of this study extends from January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2010. The empirical results verify that the FIEC-HYGARCH model can be used to capture the effects of long memory. The rate of returns of TFT-LCD upper, middle, and down stream <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> have their own-and cross-market mean spillover effects. These findings imply that the TFT-LCD panel market for each industry is not efficient in the sense that the rate of returns of the indexes for these industries could be predicted by using past information for the investors. The empirical results also reveal that the volatility spillover effects of the rate of returns among TFT-LCD upper, middle and downstream industries in Taiwan. Finally, as for the conditional covariance, the dynamic interrelationships were found to exist among the <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indexes</b> of these three TFT-LCD panel industries. 本文旨在探討台灣TFT-LCD產業上中下游股價之長期記憶、關聯性與波動外溢效果。基於此，本文建構FIEC-HYGARCH模型進行實證分析，樣本期間為 2003 年 1 月 1 日至 2010 年 6 月 30 日。實證結果證實FIEC-HYGARCH模型可正確捕捉長期記憶效果。台灣TFT-LCD面板產業上中下游股價指數報酬率具有自身外溢效果，TFT-LCD面板產業上中下游股價指數皆為非效率性，亦投資人可使用過去的資訊預測TFT-LCD面板產業上中下游股價指數報酬率。實證結果也顯示台灣TFT-LCD產業上游與中游及中游與下游股價指數具波動外溢效果，此隱含投資人購買台灣TFT-LCD上中下游產業股票時需考慮彼此間之外溢性。最後，條件變異之估計結果則顯現TFT-LCD面板產業股價指數報酬率於上中下游之間具動態關聯性...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{experiencing}} {{rapid growth}} in their number and size, African stock markets remain highly segmented, small, illiquid and technologically bankrupt, severely affecting their informational efficiency. On this basis, with specific focus on the weak-form of the efficient markets hypothesis, we attempt to empirically ascertain whether African stock markets can improve their informational efficiency by formally harmonising and integrating their operations using a new robust non-parametric variance-ratios test {{in addition to its}} parametric alternative. On average, we find that irrespective of the diagnostic used, all the 24 African continent-wide indices applied returns’ display better normal distribution properties than those of the 8 individual national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> examined. We record evidence of statistically significant improvements in the informational efficiency of the African continent-wide <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> over the individual national <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> used irrespective of the test statistic applied. The potential improvement in efficiency to be gained is much higher in economic sectors indices than in size and regional indices. Finally, consistent with prior evidence, (eg., Wright, 2000; Belaire-Franch and Opong, 2005, Ntim, et al., 2007), the results of the Lo and MacKinlay (1988) parametric variance-ratios test are ambiguous. By contrast, the ranks and signs alternative offer consistent results throughout. ...|$|R
