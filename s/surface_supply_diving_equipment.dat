5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is based on}} both legal and {{logistical}} constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{skills are}} {{the skills and}} {{procedures}} required for the safe operation and use of <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment.</b> Besides these skills, which may be categorised as standard operating procedures, emergency procedures and rescue procedures, there are the actual working skills required to do the job, and the procedures for safe operation of the work <b>equipment</b> other than <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> that may be needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} used for deep diving depends {{on both the}} depth {{and the type of}} diving. Scuba is limited to equipment that can be carried by the diver, or is easily deployed by the <b>dive</b> team, while <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> can be more extensive, and much of it stays above the water where it is operated by the support team.|$|R
2500|$|A {{breathing}} gas is {{a mixture}} of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common, and only natural, breathing gas. [...] But other mixtures of gases, or pure gases, are also used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats such as scuba <b>equipment,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment,</b> recompression chambers, submarines, space suits, spacecraft, medical life support and first aid equipment, high-altitude mountaineering and anaesthetic machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} item of <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> used by divers is underwater breathing apparatus, such as scuba <b>equipment,</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{but there}} are other important pieces of <b>equipment</b> that make <b>diving</b> safer, more convenient or more efficient. <b>Diving</b> <b>equipment</b> used by recreational scuba divers is mostly personal equipment carried by the diver, but professional divers, particularly when operating in the <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> or saturation mode, use a large amount of support equipment not carried by the diver.|$|R
2500|$|Altitude diving is {{underwater}} diving using scuba or <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> {{where the}} <b>surface</b> is [...] or more {{above sea level}} (for example, a mountain lake). The U.S. Navy tables recommend that no alteration be made for dives at altitudes lower than [...] and dives between 91 and 300 metres correction is required for dives over [...] of sea water. Altitude is significant in diving because the depths and decompression used for dives at altitude {{are different from those}} used for the same dive profile at sea level.|$|R
50|$|Altitude diving is {{underwater}} diving using scuba or <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> {{where the}} <b>surface</b> is 300 meters (1,000 feet) or more {{above sea level}} (for example, a mountain lake). The U.S. Navy tables recommend that no alteration be made for dives at altitudes lower than 91 meters (300 feet) and dives between 91 meters and 300 meters correction is required for dives over 44 meters sea water (145 feet sea water). Altitude is significant in diving because the depths and decompression used for dives at altitude {{are different from those}} used for the same dive profile at sea level.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other modes}} of diving, which rely either on breath-hold or on {{breathing}} supplied {{under pressure from}} the surface, scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater freedom of movement than with an air line or diver's umbilical and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold. Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial <b>diving</b> uses <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> for main gas supply when this is practicable. <b>Surface</b> <b>supplied</b> divers may be required to carry scuba as an emergency breathing gas supply to get them to safety {{in the event of a}} failure of <b>surface</b> gas <b>supply.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bell is fed via a large, {{multi-part}} umbilical {{that supplies}} breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use. The divers operate from the bell using <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> umbilical <b>diving</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Offshore divers {{are trained}} {{in the use of}} <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment,</b> which is {{standard}} for most offshore diving work. As much offshore diving contracts are carried out by members of IMCA, a large majority of the divers are registered with certification recognised by IMCA and the International Diving Regulators Forum (IDRF).Most inshore commercial diving work is also done on <b>surface</b> <b>supply,</b> and the training standards, qualifications and registration required vary according to the legislation of the relevant national or state government, but there are some internationally recognised equivalents. Military services may have their own standards, qualifications and registration systems, but these may also tie in with national civilian systems. Scientific and public safety diver training on <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> equipment also varies by jurisdiction. In some countries it follows commercial diving practice, and in others it may be covered by exemptions.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|R
25|$|The divers use <b>surface</b> <b>supplied</b> {{umbilical}} <b>diving</b> <b>equipment,</b> utilizing deep <b>diving</b> breathing gas, such as helium {{and oxygen}} mixtures, stored in large capacity, high pressure cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed {{to the control}} room, where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use.|$|R

50|$|Upper Salford Township is {{also home}} to one of the oldest Underwater Recovery Units in America - Telford Vol. Diving & Rescue Unit. Started in 1947 with the Telford Fire Company in {{response}} to a drowning victim in a low head dam, it was recognized by those members that there was no emergency service to assist those families that have suffered a loss to a drowning. With numerous water filled quarries of various depth, the Telford Fire Company created a new extension to their Fire Company - A Dive Unit. For many years the Unit was part of the Fire Company up until the 1970s where upon they separated and became their own 501c3 entity. Having traveled to numerous places - Finger Lakes region, Buffalo, NY, NJ, MD, OH and as far as Winnipeg Canada and all parts of Pennsylvania, the Unit will spend as much time as possible searching for ones loved one. Their equipment consists of multiple types of <b>surfaced</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>diving</b> <b>equipment</b> - ranging from the Mk V (as in the movie Men of Honor), Mk 12 (the replacement for the Mk V), Superlite 27 (the replacement for the Mk 12), Kirby Morgan Band mask, Divator AGA. The unit also has SCUBA capabilities as well as scanning sonar and side scan sonar.|$|R
