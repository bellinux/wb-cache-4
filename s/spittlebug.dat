50|$|Sulcia muelleri is a {{symbiont}} for a {{group of}} insects classified under the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Usual hosts are cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, spittlebugs, and planthoppers. Sulcia muelleri is always found co-residing its host with another bacterial endosymbiont from the phylum Proteobacteria. For example, Sulcia muelleri and candidatus Zinderia insecticola are both found to live in the bacteriome of select species of the <b>spittlebug.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ptyelus grossus is a Auchenorrhynchan <b>spittlebug</b> in {{the family}} Cercopidae. Occurring from Southern Africa through to West Africa, the species is gregarious in its larval and nymph stages, feeding {{on a variety of}} plants, and {{producing}} protective nests of acrid foam from the plant's sap. Excreted in large quantities, the foam drips incessantly causing wet patches on the soil below.|$|E
5000|$|During spring time it {{may happen}} that water drips from the tree's branches, a {{phenomenon}} that {{is caused by the}} <b>spittlebug</b> Ptyelus grossus. The immature stages of these spittlebugs congregate on the young shoots and derive their nourishment by sucking the tree's sap. While doing so they secrete pure water, which is the cause of the [...] "weeping" [...] effect.|$|E

5000|$|Although it {{is able to}} form a dense {{ground cover}} to compete with weeds, Congo Grass is {{susceptible}} to certain pests and diseases. It is severely attacked by the <b>spittlebug</b> who cause significant damage to the plant in Tropical America affecting the development and persistence of the plants. [...] As well the plant seeds are known to be affected by the fungus Sphacelia in the Congo.|$|E
50|$|In North America {{the disease}} is {{transmitted}} from infected to healthy trees by the whitebanded elm leafhopper (Scaphoideus luteolus Van Duzee), the meadow <b>spittlebug</b> (Philaenus spurarius) and by another leafhopper (Allygus atomarius), although other insects are also suspected of being vectors. Transportation of nursery trees is another way for elm yellows to be spread over long distances. As leafhoppers move very slowly so movement of elm yellows has been slow.|$|E
50|$|The meadow <b>spittlebug</b> Philaenus spumarius is {{a common}} insect {{in much of the}} Northern Hemisphere, and it is {{sometimes}} a pest on crops such as alfalfa. It is important to science because its entire genome has been sequenced. It has also been the subject of many studies of genetic diversity because it displays marked color polymorphism. There are eleven known color phenotypes, with individuals taking various dark, pale, mottled, and striped patterns. Most other Philaenus species are also color polymorphic.|$|E
5000|$|These {{families}} are {{best known for}} the nymph stage, which produces a cover of frothed-up plant sap resembling saliva; the nymphs are therefore commonly known as <b>spittlebugs</b> and their froth as cuckoo spit, frog spit or snake spit. The final family in the group, Machaerotidae, is known as the tube <b>spittlebugs</b> because the nymphs live in calcareous tubes, rather than producing froth as in the other families.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Plants {{are often}} {{simultaneously}} attacked by insect herbivores and plant pathogens, yet relatively {{few studies have}} investigated the potential interactive effects of herbivores and pathogens on plant fitness. We studied the effects of simultaneous attack by meadow <b>spittlebugs,</b> Philaenus spumarius (Homoptera: Cercopidae), and a plant virus, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), on the fitness ofMimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae). We wanted to determine: (1) if trade-offs in defense against meadow <b>spittlebugs</b> and CMV exist, (2) if meadow <b>spittlebugs</b> and CMV interact to affect plant fitness, and (3) if genetic variation is associated with these interactive effects. We {{found no evidence of}} trade-offs in defense against meadow <b>spittlebugs</b> and CMV in M. guttatus in a greenhouse experiment. Thus, the ability ofM. guttatus to defend itself against one of these enemies is unlikely to preclude the evolution of adequate defenses against the second enemy. We did, however, find strong evidence that <b>spittlebugs</b> and CMV interacted to affect plant fitness and that genetic variation underlies the degree and direction of this interaction. This suggests that selection can act on the genetic variation underlying the interaction between the two enemies and that strong selection imposed by one will alter the response of M. guttatus populations to the second. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate genetic variation associated with the non-additive effect of an herbivore and a pathogen on plant fitness. We suggest that future studies of the mechanisms underlying the defensive properties of plants need to consider variation associated with defense mechanisms and the potential effect of this variation on the response of plant populations to selection by multiple enemies.

5000|$|Candidatus Sulcia muelleri is an aerobic, gram-negative, {{bacillus}} {{bacteria that}} {{is a part of}} the phylum Bacteroidetes. [...] Sulcia muelleri is an obligate and mutualistic symbiotic microbe commonly found occupying specialized cell compartments of sap-feeding insects called bacteriocytes. A majority of the research done on Sulcia muelleri has detailed its relationship with the host Homalodisca vitripennis. Other studies have documented the nature of its residency in other insects like the maize leafhopper (Cicadulina) or the <b>spittlebug</b> (Cercopoidea). Sulcia muelleri is noted for its exceptionally minimal genome and it is currently identified as having the smallest known, sequenced Bacteroidetes genome at only 245 kilobases.|$|E
50|$|Sulcia muelleri was {{classified}} under microscope in 2005 by the evolutionary biologist, Nancy A. Moran. The endosymbiont {{was found in}} the dissected bacteriocyte of the <b>spittlebug</b> (Calstopter arizonana). The genus Sulcia is named after Vytváření Karel Šulc, a Moravian embryologist who is responsible for being one of the first scientists to recognize that the insect bacteriome is an organ where bacteria reside. The species, Muelleri, has been named in the honor of H.J. Muller, (not to be confused with Hermann Joseph Muller) whom speculated in 1960 that there was a parallel evolutionary history between endosymbionts and a select clade of insect hosts known as Auchenorrhyncha. Sulcia muelleri {{is a member of the}} order Flavobacteriales. It is currently not classified as a member of any taxonomic family.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Plant {{resistance}} {{is the most}} important method of <b>spittlebug</b> control. The example of this utilization happened in 1980 `s, when the Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu took place the B. decumbens. Since B. brizantha cv. Marandu is resistance to Deois flavopicta <b>spittlebug</b> damage, it could solve the economics damage in savannas pastures in that time. Nowadays, the genus Mahanarva has been attacking and cause widespread damage in B. brizantha cv. Marandu pastures in savannas and Amazonia Legal sites. Likewise, the Embrapa Breeding Program has a challenge in order to develop Brachiaria cultivar with <b>spittlebug</b> resistance performance. Besides, the use the biotechnology tools to manage the problem about apomixia in Brachiaria genus the Entomology studies is the key point. In this work, the information about the CIAT methodology is described as a good model of <b>spittlebug</b> rearing and resistance studies.

50|$|The {{symbiotic}} relationship between Nasuia deltocephalinicola and leafhoppers is proposed to have started at least 200 million years ago, when leafhoppers and <b>spittlebugs</b> evolutionarily diverged. This claim {{is supported by}} the fact that Nasuia deltocephalinicola's closest bacterial relative is Zinderia insecticola, which plays the same role for <b>spittlebugs</b> as Nasuia deltocephalinicola plays for leaf hoppers. Leafhoppers return the favor to bacteria like Nasuia deltocephalinicola by providing shelter {{in the form of a}} specialized organ in their abdominal cavity called a bacteriome, which they have on both sides of their abdomens. Many types of bacteria can reside in these organs, though the bacteria are completely separated from each other and reside in different sections of the bacteriome.|$|R
40|$|O nível de dano econômico de Mahanarva fimbriolata (Stål) em cana-de-açúcar foi estimado em experimento em campo, em área colhida em fim de safra (novembro), aplicando-se {{thiamethoxam}} nas doses de 150, 200 e 250 g i. a. ha- 1, quando as populações da praga eram de 1, 8 (4 / 12 / 02), 7, 6 (17 / 12 / 02) ou 12, 4 cigarrinhas. m- 1 (26 / 12 / 02). Parcelas testemunhas sem inseticida foram mantidas. Após as aplicações, as infestações de cigarrinha foram estimadas mensalmente e em 26 / 9 / 03 o experimento foi colhido. O controle de cigarrinha pela aplicação de inseticida resultou em incremento de produtividade de colmos e de açúcar, em relação à testemunha. Aplicações feitas sob infestações de 1, 8 (04 / 12 / 02) ou 7, 6 (17 / 12 / 02) resultaram em maior produtividade do que aplicações feitas com populações de 12, 4 cigarrinhas. m- 1. Na média, as três doses de thiamethoxam tiveram comportamento semelhante, mas houve interação entre dose e época ou infestação por ocasião das aplicações. Quando as aplicações foram feitas em 4 / 12 / 02, sob infestação de 1, 8 cigarrinhas. m- 1, o tratamento com thiamethoxam a 250 g i. a. ha- 1 resultou em produtividade de colmos e de açúcar total recuperável superior à do tratamento com 150 g i. a. ha- 1, fato atribuído ao maior residual e melhor controle inicial da praga, proporcionado pela dose maior. Pela análise econômica observou-se que thiamethoxam a 250 g i. a. ha- 1 aplicado com infestação de 1, 8 cigarrinhas. m- 1 proporcionou o maior lucro, e enquanto aplicado na dose de 250 g i. a. ha- 1, sob infestação de 12, 4 cigarrinhas. m- 1, a menor receita líquida. Análises de regressão permitiram estimar o nível de dano econômico da praga, nas condições do presente experimento, entre 3 e 5 cigarrinhas. m- 1. The economic injury {{level of}} Mahanarva fimbriolata (Stål) to sugarcane was experimentally evaluated {{in a field}} area harvested at November. The inseticide thiamethoxam was applied: 150, 200 e 250 g i. a. ha- 1. Applications started when the pest populations reached of 1. 8 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1 (12 / 04 / 02), 7. 6 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1 (12 / 17 / 02) or 12. 4 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1 (12 / 26 / 02). Untreated plots were maintained as check. After the insecticide applications, infestations of the sugarcane root froghopper were monthly evaluated till 9 / 26 / 03 when the experiment was harvested. Compared with check plots, the pest control resulted in significant increment of sugar productivity. When applied under infestation of 1. 8 (12 / 04 / 02) or 7. 6 (12 / 17 / 02) the productivity was resulted higher than control made with populations of 12, 4 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1. Thiamethoxam was efficient when applied {{in all of the}} three doses. It was observed interaction between dose and time of insecticide application. When the applications had been made in 12 / 04 / 02, under infestation of 1, 8 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1, the treatment with thiamethoxam 250 g i. a. ha- 1 resulted in stalks and sugar productivities higher than the treatment with 150 g i. a. ha- 1. This fact was attributed to the greater amount of residue and better initial control of the pest, obtained with the highest dose. The economic analysis of the data showed that thiamethoxam at 250 g i. a. ha- 1 applied with the infestation of 1. 8 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1, provided the greatest profit, whereas when applied at the dose of 250 g i. a. ha- 1, under infestation of 12. 4 <b>spittlebugs.</b> m- 1, the smallest net income was obtained.
