5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Randall Larson on May 23, 2008 <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would not}} be returning to Smallville, citing the joint workload of Smallville and Ghost Whisperer, but would return for Ghost Whisperer. Reminiscing about his work on the show, <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> that much of the music had not changed during the series and agreed with Larson that it was [...] "more [...] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes". Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for Smallville in season seven. Febre said that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to [...] "thematic development" [...] in the score, paralleling the characters' growth: [...] "As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his growth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a 'Superman' theme would be required." ...|$|E
500|$|Janek Sirrs was the film's {{visual effects}} supervisor, and Industrial Light & Magic again did the {{majority}} of the effects, as it did on the first film. ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, Ben <b>Snow,</b> <b>said</b> their work on the film was [...] "harder" [...] than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around.

500|$|In {{his review}} of the 2006 remastered album, for Mojo magazine, Mat <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "this long overdue reissue is worth it alone for four {{wonderful}} songs", of which [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] "reveals the lusty lad within the orange robes" [...] associated with Hare Krishna devotees. More recently, Snow has described Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and Harrison as [...] "an old-school pop tunesmith to his marrow, [...] worked hard to ensure the choruses of 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long,' 'The Day the World Gets 'Round,' and 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion".|$|E
500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music {{as he watched}} the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E
500|$|The theme, [...] "The X-Files", {{used more}} {{instrumental}} sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect {{was inspired by}} the track [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] from The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rack-mount synth with an effect called [...] "Whistling Joe". After hearing this effect, Carter was [...] "taken aback" [...] and noted it was [...] "going to be good". According to the [...] "Behind the Truth" [...] segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter {{walked out of the room}} and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; <b>Snow</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it." [...] The second episode, [...] "Deep Throat", marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in [...] "Deep Throat".|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat <b>Snow</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The X-Files" [...] {{typically}} used more instrumental music than most hour-long dramas. According to the [...] "Behind the Truth" [...] segment on the Season 1 DVD, Mark Snow created the echo {{effect on his}} famous X-Files theme song by accident. <b>Snow</b> <b>said</b> that he had gone through several revisions, but Chris Carter felt that something was not quite right. Carter {{walked out of the}} room and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. <b>Snow</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it." ...|$|E
