5|$|The cantata {{is unique}} in Bach's church cantatas in its {{structure}} of arias combined with chorale instead of recitatives. Performed one week after , it shows Bach's emphasis on the chorale even beyond his <b>second</b> <b>cycle</b> of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his <b>second</b> <b>cycle</b> of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle {{in the sense that}} it is based on a chorale, but its style is different from the others.|$|E
5|$|The natural cycle {{has been}} {{accomplished}} five times in NPB history. Fumio Fujimura's <b>second</b> <b>cycle</b> on May 25, 1950, {{was the first time}} a player collected the hits in order. On average, the natural cycle occurs approximately every 13years. Other than Fujimura, the four players to hit for the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961, Takahiro Tokutsu in 1976, Takanori Okamura in 1985, and Muramatsu in 2003. The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa (2004).|$|E

40|$|In 1975, Sheehan conjectured {{that every}} simple 4 -regular {{hamiltonian}} graph has a <b>second</b> Hamilton <b>cycle.</b> If Sheehan's Conjecture holds, then {{the result can}} be extended to all simple d-regular hamiltonian graphs with d at least 3. First, we survey some previous results which verify the existence of a <b>second</b> Hamilton <b>cycle</b> if d is large enough. We will then demonstrate some techniques for finding a <b>second</b> Hamilton <b>cycle</b> that will be used throughout this paper. Finally, we use these techniques and show that for certain 4 -regular Hamiltonian graphs whose automorphism group is large enough, a <b>second</b> Hamilton <b>cycle</b> exists...|$|R

5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a <b>second</b> <b>cycle</b> at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|While the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ranger Company each {{embarked}} for Korea {{shortly after}} their training was complete, the 3rd Ranger Company was retained at Fort Benning, {{to train the}} next cycle of Rangers along with the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Ranger Company. After providing fillers to 1st and 4th companies to cover their training losses, the 3rd had 40 men left. In mid-December, they took an additional 80 men from 7th Company and completed a <b>second</b> <b>cycle</b> of Ranger training. This proved beneficial to the 3rd Company, as it was given cold-weather training alongside the 5th and 8th companies at Fort Carson, Colorado. After the first training cycle was complete; the Ranger units already in Korea had not received this training and were thus unprepared for the Korean winter. The 3rd Company also received additional training which better prepared it for combat, including tactics of the People's Volunteer Army, which the other companies had learned in battle and tracer designation of targets during night attacks. They also received 57mm M18 Recoilless Rifles, however, these were kept on the cargo truck due to the necessity {{to break up a}} rifle team to man a crew-served weapon, which didn't happen. The entire company was trained to be their own forward observers for artillery. In March 1951, the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Companies sailed for Korea, a trip which was fraught with frequent discipline problems as the Rangers continuously got into fights with U.S. Marines on board the troopship while en route. After spending one night in Kobe, Japan, the next morning they sailed for Pusan, South Korea.|$|E

40|$|Chemotherapy is {{currently}} the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer. Clinical response is determined after several cycles of chemotherapy by changes in tumor size as assessed by conventional imaging procedures including CT, MRI, plain film radiography, or ultrasound. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the use of sequential 18 F-FDG PET to predict response after the first and <b>second</b> <b>cycles</b> of stan-dardized chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Eleven patients with 26 metastatic lesions underwent 31 18 F-FDG PET examinations (240 – 400 MBq of 18 F-FDG; 10 -min 2 -dimensional emission and transmission scans). Clinical re-sponse, as assessed by conventional imaging after completion of chemotherapy, served as the reference. 18 F-FDG PET images after the first and <b>second</b> <b>cycles</b> of chemotherapy were ana-lyzed semiquantitatively for each metastatic lesion using stan...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>second</b> Ericsson <b>cycle</b> is {{the cycle}} most {{commonly}} referred to as simply the [...] "Ericsson cycle". The (<b>second)</b> Ericsson <b>cycle</b> is also the limit of an ideal gas-turbine Brayton cycle, operating with multistage intercooled compression, and multistage expansion with reheat and regeneration. Compared to the Brayton cycle which uses adiabatic compression and expansion, the <b>second</b> Ericsson <b>cycle</b> uses isothermal compression and expansion, thus producing more net work per stroke. Also the use of regeneration in the Ericsson cycle increases efficiency by reducing the required heat input. For further comparisons of thermodynamic cycles, see heat engine.|$|R

The existence of solution for both problems is guaranteed by a parity argument. For the first problem we prove that deciding whether a 2 -oik has a room-partitioning is NP-hard, even if the 2 -oik corresponds to a planar triangulation. For the problem of finding a <b>second</b> Hamiltonian <b>cycle,</b> we state the following conjecture: for every cubic planar bipartite graph finding a <b>second</b> Hamiltonian <b>cycle</b> {{can be found in}} time linear in the number of vertices via a standard pivoting algorithm.
