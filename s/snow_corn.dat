5000|$|Coarse, {{granular}} wet snow. Most {{commonly used}} by skiers describing good spring <b>snow.</b> <b>Corn</b> {{is the result}} of cycles of melting during the day and refreezing at night.|$|E
50|$|In {{rural areas}} of {{developing}} countries or during camping trips, sticks, stones, leaves, <b>snow,</b> <b>corn</b> cobs and similar are also used for anal cleansing. This {{may be due to}} the unavailability of toilet paper/similar paper products and water or due to cultural reasons.|$|E
50|$|Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Peters {{was active}} in the local art scene at a young age. While {{attending}} Holyoke Community College, Peters began glassblowing and later studied flameworking at Snow Farm, a craft school based in Williamsburg, MA. Peters later became established as a flameworking teacher, teaching at <b>Snow</b> Farm, <b>Corning</b> Glass Museum, and the Penland Art School.|$|R
5000|$|Next up, Little Kitty {{attempts}} to recite [...] "Mary Had a Little Lamb". She is so nervous that she forgets {{a couple of}} lines (even confusing <b>snow</b> for <b>corn</b> flakes) and then proceeds with the rhyme but gradually speeds up her voice to a high pitch. Throughout her performance she is fidgeting and crossing her legs {{in a way to}} suggest she urgently needs the toilet. She reaches the end of the rhyme as she makes a hasty exit, to a building that may be the school outhouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{ski area}} is multi-directional, with {{portions}} of the main ski area facing south or southwest and other portions north-facing. Thunder Mountain areas serviced by Chair 3 are north-facing, resulting in longer-lasting snow conditions. The majority of the steep Chair 1 terrain down to the base area and parking lot along with the Chair 4 portion of the resort faces west and south, resulting in frequent spring conditions and <b>corn</b> <b>snow.</b> Snow on the lower portion of the mountain is typically hard with afternoon softening on north-facing slopes due to brief thaw/shade conditions. In times of abundant snowfall, prior to complete solar melting of the snowpack on south-facing slopes, there is sunny skiing on the slopes from Chair 4 down to the base area.|$|R
40|$|The {{complex sound}} of someone walking in snow aren't easy to create in a studio. The {{best way to}} get the sound is {{to go out on a}} surface with real snow and record the {{footsteps}} there, but it is a complex procedure to get the right sound on the snow because snow sounds different in various temperature and various kinds of snow. It is important to find the right kind of snow to get the right sound on the foot steps. In a studio, the foley artist can create the sound of footsteps in snow by walking on different kind of material, like potato flour, coarse salt or corn flakes, the question is how realistic this materials sounds and what temperature on the snow they sound like. The results shows that the real snow (warm and cold snow) sounds most realistic and the potato flour sounds like warm and wet <b>snow,</b> the <b>corn</b> flakes some think sounds like cold snow while others think that it doesn't sound like snow at all and the coarse salt sounds like snow when it is around - 10 °C in the air, they all sounds similar in realism compared to each other. An interesting proceeding on this research would be to mix this materials and see if they can sound as realistic as the real snow, for example mix potato flour and coarse salt to get the flour less dense but it will still keep the creaking sound of snow.

40|$|Blowing snow {{can cause}} {{significant}} problems for mobility and safety during winter weather in three distinct ways. It may drift onto the road, thus requiring almost continuous plowing while {{the wind is}} blowing (which may occur when a given winter storm is over). Snow may drift onto wet pavement (perhaps caused by ice control chemicals) and dilute out the chemicals on the road, creating ice on the road. And sufficient blowing snow can cause a major deterioration in visibility on the road, a factor which {{has been shown to be}} significant in winter crashes. The problem of blowing snow can be very effectively addressed by creating a snow storage device upwind of the road that requires protection from snow drifting. Typically, these storage devices are fences. Extensive design guidance exists for the required height and placement of such fences for a given annual snowfall and given local topography. However, the design information on the placement of living snow fences is less complete. The purpose of this report is to present the results of three seasons of study on using standing <b>corn</b> as <b>snow</b> fences. In addition, the experience of using switch grass as a snow storage medium is also presented. On the basis of these experimental data, a design guide has been developed that makes use of the somewhat unique snow storage characteristics of standing <b>corn</b> <b>snow</b> fences. The results of the field tests on using standing corn showed that multiple rows of standing <b>corn</b> store <b>snow</b> rather differently than a traditional wooden snow fence. Specifically, while a traditional fence stores most of the snow downwind from the fence (and thus must be placed a significant distance upwind of the road to be protected, specifically at least 35 times the snow fence height) rows of standing corn store the majority of the snow within the rows. Results from the three winters of testing show that the standing <b>corn</b> <b>snow</b> fences can store as much snow within the rows of standing corn as a traditional fence of typical height for operation in Iowa (4 to 6 feet) can store. This finding is significant because it means that the snow fences can be placed at the edge of the farmer’s field closest to the road, and still be effective. This is typically much more convenient for the farmer and thus may mean that more farmers would be willing to participate in a program that uses standing corn than in traditional programs. ii On the basis of the experimental data, design guidance for the use of standing <b>corn</b> as a <b>snow</b> storage device in Iowa is given in the report. Specifically, it is recommended that if the fetch in a location to be protected is less than 5, 000 feet, then 16 rows of standing corn should be used, at the edge of the field adjacent to the right of way. If the fetch is greater than 5, 000 feet, then 24 rows of standing corn should be used. This is based on a row spacing of 22 inches. Further, it should be noted that these design recommendations are ONLY for the State of Iowa. Other states of course have different winter weather and without extensive further study, it cannot be said that these guidelines would be effective in other locations with other winter conditions...|$|R
