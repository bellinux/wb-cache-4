50|$|These are {{medium-sized}} {{or large}} mole crickets {{characterized by the}} structures on their forelegs: two sharp claws and a blade-like process with a <b>sharp</b> <b>flange</b> or tooth. Other mole crickets {{have three or four}} claws. Like other mole crickets, these burrow in the ground and the males produce calls with their tegmina.|$|E

50|$|A {{letter written}} by James R. Clark {{states that it}} was {{expensive}} to purchase horses, equipment, and harness. After loading eighty barrels of flour on four freight cars, the load caused the <b>sharp</b> <b>flanges</b> on the wheels to cut the wooden rails and the cars would be derailed. It would then require half a day to get the cars back on the tracks. The various difficulties forced the Scottsville-LeRoy Railroad to cease operation soon after 1840.|$|R
50|$|The {{guidance}} system of practical railway vehicles {{relies on the}} steering effect of the conicity of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500 m, or about 1,500 feet). On <b>sharper</b> curves <b>flange</b> contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).|$|R
40|$|Annular {{elastomeric}} bodies having intricate shapes {{are cast}} by dipping a heated, rotating mandrel into {{a solution of}} the elastomer, permitting the elastomer to creep into sharp recesses, drying the coated mandrel and repeating the operation until the desired thickness has been achieved.
