5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
25|$|During {{the game}} the umpires {{expressed}} concern about Wayne Clark's action. <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> he was inclined to agree with them because Clark had adjusted his action because of a bad back.|$|E
25|$|The EQC pays out {{the first}} NZ$1.5billion in claims, and the {{reinsurance}} companies are liable for all amounts between NZ$1.5billion and NZ$4billion. The EQC again covers all amounts above NZ$4billion. EQC chief executive Ian <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> that the $4billion cap for each earthquake {{is unlikely to be}} exceeded by the costs of residential building and land repairs, so $3billion would be left in the EQC's Natural Disaster Fund after payouts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} of Troy McClure on The Simpsons was modeled after McClure and fellow actor Troy Donahue. Mike Reiss, {{executive producer of}} The <b>Simpsons,</b> <b>said</b> that Doug McClure's daughter informed him that Doug was {{a big fan of}} The <b>Simpsons.</b> She <b>said</b> that while watching an episode Doug saw the character Troy McClure on the show and said, [...] "Are they making fun of me?" [...] Doug said he thought the parody was funny and his daughters would call him Troy McClure behind his back as a joke.|$|R
5000|$|I Am Me is, {{like its}} predecessor, {{a mixture of}} rock and pop; it has been {{described}} as similar to Simpson's first album, and <b>Simpson</b> herself has <b>said</b> that she wanted it to be [...] "familiar" [...] to Autobiography. Some differences have also been noted. I Am Me has been said to be influenced by '80s music, and <b>Simpson</b> herself <b>said</b> [...] "I just love '80s music" [...] and [...] "It's just so light and fun, and {{that was a lot of}} what I wanted to do on this record." [...] Prior to recording I Am Me, <b>Simpson</b> had <b>said</b> she wanted to incorporate more of the feel of '80s music into her next album, as some of her favorite music is from that time.|$|R
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{received a}} generally mixed response. Nelson Shin, {{the founder of}} AKOM, the Korean company that animates The <b>Simpsons,</b> <b>said</b> {{that he and his}} staff did protest being asked to animate the sequence.

He added, [...] "Most of the content was about degrading people from Korea, China, Mexico and Vietnam. If Banksy wants to criticize these things ...

25|$|In December 2010 The Times {{reported}} that Kelly had a rare abnormality in the arteries supplying his heart; the information had been disclosed {{by the head}} of the Academic Unit of Pathology at Sheffield University Medical School, Professor Paul Ince. Ince noted that the postmortem had found severe narrowing of the blood vessels, and said that heart disease was likely to have been a factor in Dr Kelly's death as the cut to the wrist artery would not itself have been fatal. Vice-President of the British Cardiovascular Society Ian <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> that Kelly's artery anomaly could have contributed to the scientist's death.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 Ashes tour started poorly amid rumours that Taylor was on {{the verge}} of losing his place in the side. He batted ineffectively as Australia lost the one day series 0–3, scoring seven and 11, before {{dropping}} himself for the final match. In the First Test, Australia were dismissed for 118 in the first innings, with Taylor contributing seven: he had not managed to pass 50 in his last 21 Test innings. England amassed a big lead of 360 runs. With Australia facing a heavy defeat, media criticism of his position intensified. The Melbourne Age ran a competition for its readers to forecast how many runs he would make. Most respondents guessed less than 10 runs. The team's erstwhile coach, Bob <b>Simpson,</b> <b>said</b> that Taylor's retention in the team in spite of his poor form was fostering resentment among the players and destabilising the team.|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> in an interview with Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because {{we spent a lot of}} money on it," [...] <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's first innings was {{notable for}} Graham Yallop {{being the first}} batsman to wear a full {{protective}} helmet in test cricket and Bruce Yardley's knock of 74 off 48 balls. Jeff Thomson then delivered an inspiring spell of bowling which <b>Simpsons</b> <b>said</b> [...] "proved beyond question {{that he is the}} world's fastest bowler". Thomson ended up taking 6–77, limiting the West Indies lead to 38, but Australia collapsed in their second innings (despite another Yardley cameo) and the hosts had little difficulty in winning by nine wickets.|$|R

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} [...] "No One Knows" [...] was generally positive. In The Guardian review of Songs for the Deaf, Dave <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "'No One Knows' has killer riffs to spare". Playlouder were similarly enthused, calling the song [...] "soulful, {{like the last}} gasp of the hero in an old western". Eric Carr of Pitchfork Media called it an [...] "easy groove" [...] and [...] "four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality".|$|E
500|$|Justice Simpson {{examined}} {{the evidence in}} detail, including the evidence put forward {{in support of the}} 3 most likely causes identified by the investigation panel. [...] He eventually found there was insufficient evidence to consider any of the theories proved. Justice Simpson's report of the findings of his inquiry was made public by the Minister on 11 June 1946. <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> he was satisfied the accident was not caused by failure of any part of the aircraft's structure, its engines or its controls; or failure to remove any of the flight-control clamps prior to takeoff.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 interview, <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> {{that when}} she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

5000|$|In 1958, the 18-year-old Simpson broke {{both arms}} in a drag racing crash. <b>Simpson</b> later <b>said,</b> [...] "Until then, I was like most drivers. The only time I thought about safety was after I'd been hurt. This time, I was hurt bad enough {{to do a lot}} of thinking." ...|$|R
500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished." [...] But <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> {{he wanted to go}} on. Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, <b>Simpson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E
500|$|Fraser Middleton of The Evening Times {{wrote that}} Simpson {{captured}} a [...] "girl next door" [...] image with her previous album {{and the music}} videos for its accompanying singles. Although the album was successful, Columbia Records felt {{it was far from}} the successes of her contemporaries, Aguilera and Spears and that Simpson needed to make some changes to her image. As a part of the change, she lost weight, dressed in a more sexy style and learned dance. <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> the video is a kind of [...] "comic strip girl come to life" [...] further explaining that the video was something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 2008 Fightstar {{released}} the B-sides album Alternate Endings, with live radio sessions, covers and a previously-unreleased track. When Gut Records went into administration {{at the end}} of 2008 the band decided to release their next album, Be Human, in a joint venture with their management company (Raw Power) on the Search and Destroy label. The album was distributed by PIAS Records. Fightstar {{released the}}ir first single from Be Human, [...] "The English Way", on 3November 2008 and it topped the UK rock chart. Its video was played on Kerrang! and Scuzz T.V., and topped the MTV2 top 10. The album was co-produced by the band and Carl Bown at Treehouse Studios, Bown's Chesterfield studio. In interviews before its release, Fightstar called the new album [...] "quite different" [...] from their previous releases; Charlie <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> that they wanted to experiment with a [...] "rock opera" [...] sound, including strings and a choir. <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> that although it might be different, it would still be a Fightstar album with their trademark dark, heavy elements. The band supported Feeder for the first part of their UK tour, which began on 21 October 2008. Drummer Jason Bowld of the British metal band Pitchshifter filled in for Omar Abidi on their UK tour while Abidi recovered from a broken wrist; Abidi returned to touring with the band in early 2009. Due to the drummer's injury, Simpson played drums on six tracks of the new album while Abidi wrote the drum parts and oversaw Simpson's playing.|$|E
5000|$|Crash Canyon {{launched}} on September 18, 2011. Joel Cohen, a Canadian expatriate living in Los Angeles while writing for The <b>Simpsons,</b> <b>said</b> that creating an animated Canadian show with fellow expatriates would allow to write [...] "jokes only hosers would get". He recruited ex-Canadian writers Tim Long of The Simpsons and Chuck Tatham of How I Met Your Mother to write scripts for the series. Co-producer and story editor Greg Lawrence {{said that they}} have tried not to put {{too much emphasis on}} the family trying to escape the canyon. [...] "It’s not Gilligan's Island where every episode is: ‘This week we’re getting off the island.’ But we do keep the sentiment alive, so as you move through the series there are attempts to get out and all fail." ...|$|R

[...] A video tape, titled Dream Chaser, was released on January 22, 2002, which included Simpson's biography, music videos, behind-the-scenes looks at [...] "Irresistible" [...] and [...] "A Little Bit", and footage from the tour.

500|$|Part of Kavner's {{contract}} {{says that}} she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it [...] "destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people." [...] Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is, [...] "a little more limiting than live acting. And I {{have nothing to do}} with my character's movement." [...] Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart <b>Simpson,</b> <b>said</b> in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Kavner is [...] "a workhorse of an actor" [...] with [...] "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but <b>Simpson</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to continue.

[...] In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, [...] "It is [...] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion." [...] Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film.
