60|$|George did {{not know}} that it was near him, but Angela's wild eye fell upon it. Slowly raising her hand, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] said Lady Honoria, {{speaking}} in French to the bonne. [...] "There she is," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> the runaway Effie with her parasol.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then go {{into that}} {{opposite}} room," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> {{the door behind me}} with her withered hand, [...] "and wait there till I come." ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Yes: Rufio. (<b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} deadly scorn.) He {{who is to}} rule here in Caesar's name, in Caesar's way, {{according}} to Caesar's boasted laws of life.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Captain Paul {{told me you}} {{climbed the}} masts, Richard, and worked like a common seaman. Tell me," [...] says <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>at</b> the royal yard of a tall East Indiaman, [...] "did you {{go as high as}} that when it was rough?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> {{a corner}} {{so far off}} {{on the other side}} that no one could be distinguished, and then was gone, with a smile flashed over her shoulder, and her hireling {{trying to keep up with}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} her sister, [...] "in our dead mother's name, {{which you have}} dishonoured, I will do it. Listen, Owen Davies, and father: Beatrice, who sits there"--and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> her with her thin hand--"Beatrice is a scarlet woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Richard," [...] she {{answered}} quietly, [...] "our hour {{will come when}} his has gone," [...] and with the spear in her hand once more <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> Ishmael, who stood by watching them sullenly. Then she mounted her horse--how she could never remember--and they were separated.|$|E
5000|$|Alice digs into Barney's {{grave and}} pulls out a gun, which <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> Richard. Alice becomes {{increasingly}} aggressive while Richard tries to calm her down.

While {{separated from}} the rest of the crew aboard USS Enterprise, Lily Sloane asks Captain Jean-Luc Picard what an object visible outside the viewport is.

40|$|Criticism {{related to}} the EUâ€™s {{democratic}} deficit became more prominent {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis. According to Firat Cengiz, it is crucial for European citizens to become more involved in policymaking processes if this deficit is to be overcome. However, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> an inherent problem affecting areas such as competition policy, where the increasing prominence of overly technical language has undermined opportunities for democratic engagement...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> {{two little}} tea stems, which formed a faint {{suggestion}} {{of a man with}} a musket on his back. He had climbed nearly {{to the edge of the}} cup. Mrs. Smith grew pale with excitement. She trembled so she could hardly hold the cup in her hand as she gazed into it.|$|E
60|$|Rachel {{could not}} speak. A lump rose {{in her throat}} and choked her. Betwixt fear and hope her heart stood still. Only with the spear in her hand <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> her own shadow thrown by the level rays of the rising sun. He looked, and {{notwithstanding}} the straitness of his bonds she saw him start.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soon--not just yet. I haven't {{seen you}} for such ages!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> the bull-terrier. [...] "Look at Tommy, {{standing}} there and staring. He can't believe I've really come back. Father, {{there was a}} man on the Lusitania with eyes exactly like Tommy's--all brown and bright--and he used to stand and stare just like Tommy's doing." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> {{her finger}} <b>at</b> Joanna, stepped back, {{and began to}} laugh.|$|R
5000|$|Farideh Farhi, {{professor}} at University of Hawaii, says {{the result was}} [...] "pulled out of a hat." [...] Among several anomalies that <b>she</b> addresses, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> the [...] "secret" [...] Iranian government polls reported by Newsweek on June 5 estimated that Mousavi would win 16 to 18 million votes, and Ahmadinejad just 6 to 8 million and the final [...] "official" [...] figures, that gave Ahmadinejad 24.5 million votes, and Mousavi 13.2 million.|$|R
5000|$|Blanche {{then goes}} into a [...] "trance", climbs the stairs {{into the house and}} halfway up the next stairs, where <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> the huge diamond hidden in the chandelier. Blanche then [...] "wakes" [...] and asks George what she is doing there. He excitedly tells her that she is indeed a real psychic. He calls the police to collect the reward for {{capturing}} the kidnappers and finding the jewels. A smiling Blanche looks at the camera and winks.|$|R
60|$|Now in {{her hand}} Rachel held a little rod of white {{rhinoceros}} horn which she used as a riding whip, and with this rod <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> the woman, meaning {{that some of those}} with her should cause her to loose the bridle. Too late she remembered that in this savage land such a motion when made by the King or one in supreme command, had another dreadful interpretation--death without pity or reprieve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, King, {{before you}} unchain your dogs upon me, I ask one moment. I said that I hated all men, yet, as you know, no woman {{can tell the}} truth--quite. There is a man whom I do not hate, whom I never hated, whom I think I love because he would not love me. He sits there," [...] and to my utter dismay, and the intense {{interest}} of that company, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> me, Allan Quatermain! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Yarmouth," [...] said Mrs. Flushing, [...] "just find my {{diary and}} see where ten days from now would bring us to, and ask the hall porter how many men 'ud be wanted to row eight people up the river for a week, and what it 'ud cost, {{and put it on}} a slip of paper and leave it on my dressing-table. Now--" [...] <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> the door with a superb {{forefinger}} so that Rachel had to lead the way.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we're ALMOST {{on earth}} again," [...] cried Dorothy, [...] "for {{there is the}} sun--the most BEAU'FUL sun that shines!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> eagerly <b>at</b> {{the crack in the}} distant roof.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> {{dramatically}} <b>at</b> the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting {{her hands on her}} hips she said defiantly: ...|$|R
25|$|However, {{she does}} not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender {{inequality}} in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Out of {{the hearts}} of men," [...] she {{answered}} with a low and dreadful laugh. [...] "These marks are those of swords {{and every one of}} them means a life." [...] Then seeing that he looked incredulous she added, [...] "Stay, I will show you. Little Bonsa must be thirsty who has fasted so long, also there are matters that I desire to know. Come hither--you, and you," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> hazard to the two priests who knelt nearest to her, [...] "and do you bid the executioner bring his axe," [...] she went on to a third.|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl was}} on her feet in a moment. [...] "My uncle, you cannot be in earnest," [...] she said. [...] "I declare before God I will stab myself rather than be forced on that young man. The heart rises at it; God forbids such marriages; you dishonour your white hair. Oh, my uncle, pity me! There is not a woman {{in all the world}} but would prefer death to such a nuptial. Is it {{possible}}," [...] she added, faltering--"is it possible that you do not believe me--that you still think this"--and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> Denis with a tremor of anger and contempt--"that you still think this to be the man?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Alice digs into Barney's {{grave and}} pulls out a gun, which <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> Richard. Alice becomes {{increasingly}} aggressive while Richard tries to calm her down. Alice tells Richard she is not going to kill him, but insists he turns around. When he does, Alice knocks him unconscious. The screen cuts to black, and when it fades back in, Richard is locked in a shed. His family photo is sitting on a workbench. Richard picks it up to find Alice has written a note on it, apologising for her actions but saying [...] "we do what we have to do" [...] in order to survive.|$|R
60|$|A look of deep {{disappointment}} was {{mingled with}} an expression of determination as she pursed her little mouth and fitted the second arrow to the string. This time she did not take so careful an aim, but let fly at once, and her shaft entered the bird's throat and brought it to the ground. With a cry of delight she sprang upon her prize, and bore it in triumph into the hut, where she speedily plucked it. Then she split it open, and went down to the lake and washed it quite clean and spread it out flat. Her next proceeding was to cut a short stick, about two feet in length, which <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> both ends, making one point thinner than the other. This thin point she thrust through the bird, and stuck it up before the fire to roast, placing a small dish, made of birch bark, below it to catch the dripping.|$|E

[...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> him with the spear. [...] "Heaven above and earth beneath," [...] she went on, [...] "bear witness that I sentence this man to death. People of the Zulus, hear me in your kraals far away. Hear me, Dingaan, sitting in your Great Place. Hear me, every captain and induna, hear the voice of your Inkosazana: I sentence this man to death, since because of him there is blood between me and my people, the blood of my father and my mother. Now, Night-prowler, do your worst before you die, but know this, you his servants, that if I am harmed, or if this white man, the chief Dario, is harmed, then you shall die also, every one of you. What is your will, Night-prowler?" ...|$|E
5000|$|She had {{her first}} show at the Canvas Gallery in Karachi, {{entitled}} 'Weeds'. This show had been under wraps for nearly 20 years. [...] "She has incorporated many global themes into her work, especially regarding gender," [...] said Marjorie Husain, a Pakistani critic, 'as <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> a painting that was about the Serbian War.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} saw the {{four members of}} the band tied to chairs and in a {{basement}}. A blonde woman with heavy mascara (actress and model Paula Hamilton) walks into the basement and circles the four members individually pulling their hair. She then puts them all into her van and drives down the motorway. She stops by a reservoir and has the four members placed on the edge, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>at</b> each member before grabbing Gary's rope and pushes him back still holding on. Her fingers slip through the rope and he falls backwards, the others look shocked as she does. She then smirks.|$|R
5000|$|Later that night, {{she hears}} a noise {{thinking}} her mom is back from Delhi. She finds a window unlocked and realizes she's in her house with the killer.
