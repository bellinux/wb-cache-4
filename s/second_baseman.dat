50|$|Using sabermetric {{statistics}} {{there is}} a compelling case for Grich {{to be in the}} Hall of Fame. Grich has the highest (JAWS) Jaffe WAR Score System and career WAR of any <b>second</b> <b>basemen</b> not in the Hall of Fame, and there are more than 10 Hall of Fame <b>second</b> <b>basemen</b> with a lower JAWS. The JAWS statistic is particularly compelling given it incorporates both career and peak year statistics. Similarly, Grich has the most runs of any <b>second</b> <b>basemen</b> not in the Hall, and many inductees have fewer.|$|R
