When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his {{feelings}} for her; she is angry that he never acted on them.

5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had <b>sexual</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of four coping strategies ("rumination," "search for affiliation," "threat minimization," and "search for information"), four social network dimensions ("affectively positive," "affectively negative," "accepting confidants," and "liking confidants") and sociodemographics {{on the sexual}} risk behavior of HIV-infected persons were analyzed in sexual encounters with steady and casual partners. The analysis examines bi- and multivariately the predictors for sexual risk behavior. The study population consisted of 103 asymptomatic HIV-infected persons (80 men, 23 women, mean age 34 years, range 21 - 69 years) who participated in our prospective study and reported their <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> during the previous 6 months. In sexual encounters with steady partners, the risk of unprotected behavior increased with the frequency of <b>sexual</b> <b>contact.</b> In these encounters, coping strategies and social network had no influence on sexual risk behavior. In <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> casual partners, the number of <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> these partners was also of importance. The coping strategy "rumination" correlates significantly with enhanced risk behavior. In <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> casual partners, there was no correlation between sexual risk behavior and the three other coping strategies or social network. In multivariate analysis, the number of <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> was the only significant predictor for sexual risk behavior with steady partners as well as casual ones.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the sexual behaviour {{of men and}} women in a fishing village on the shores of Lake Victoria in southwest Uganda. The village is near a well known trading town-truckstop on the main trans-Africa highway with a high recorded prevalence of HIV infection. Data were obtained on the daily travel and sexual activities of 26 women and 54 men with particular attention paid to the rate of partner change and the proportion of <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> people outside the village. During a total of 587 person-weeks the men made 1086 trips, mostly returning home the same day. They had a total of 1226 <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts,</b> most of which occurred either in their own village (83 %) or a neighbouring fishing village (11 %); 17 per cent of <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> were <b>with</b> new partners. Fifteen of the women described themselves as married; 42 per cent of their <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> were <b>with</b> casual, paying partners. Of the eleven women who were single, between 80 and 100 per cent of <b>contacts</b> were <b>with</b> paying partners. Most of the women’s partners were resident in the village. These data show a very high rate of sexual mixing within the village but little <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> people from outside. This suggests that all sexually active men and women in the village are at high risk of STDs including HIV. There is currently no formal health care available in the village. Such communities should be targeted in future STD control programs. HIV prevalence in Uganda as a whole ranges from about 30 per cent in some urban centres to less than five per cent in more remote areas (Uganda AIDS Commission 1994).

40|$|Heterosexual {{bidirectional}} transmission of HIV is now clearly proved.

This is mainly true with bisexual men, IV drug users or people originating from endemic areas. Prostitutes are also at high risk to be infected and to transmit HIV.

40|$|Experimental, clinical, and {{epidemiological}} evidence {{strongly suggests}} that genital Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are predominantly sexually transmitted. Epidemiological studies in virginal and HPV-negative women clearly indicate that sexual intercourse is virtually a necessary step for acquiring HPV. As with any other sexually transmitted disease (STD) men are implicated in the epidemiological chain of the infection. Penile HPVs are predominantly acquired through <b>sexual</b> <b>contacts.</b> <b>Sexual</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> women who are prostitutes {{play an important role}} in HPV transmission and in some populations sex workers may become an important reservoir of high-risk HPVs. Acting both as "carriers" and "vectors" of oncogenic HPVs male partners may markedly contribute to the risk of developing cervical cancer in their female partners. Thus, in the absence of screening programs, a woman's risk of cervical cancer may depend less on her own sexual behavior than on that of her husband or other male partners. Although more rarely than women, men may also become the "victims" of their own HPV infections as a fraction of infected men are at an increased risk of developing penile and anal cancers. Male circumcision status has been shown to reduce the risk not only of acquiring and transmitting genital HPVs but also of cervical cancer in their female partners. More research is needed to better understand the natural history and epidemiology of HPV infections in men...|$|R
