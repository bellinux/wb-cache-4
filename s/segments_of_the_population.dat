5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in use {{up to the}} arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E
5|$|The Tanzimat proved unpopular {{with large}} <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> and a Bedouin revolt broke out, with Transjordanian tribes {{launching}} raids against Tiberias and its countryside {{in the summer}} of 1863. Aqil was unable to stop the raids, and may {{have played a role in}} the revolt. In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would back down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{military}} {{failures and}} bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned large <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> against the government. The German and Ottoman fleets prevented Russia from importing supplies and exporting goods through the Baltic and Black seas.|$|E

50|$|For a {{total of}} 30,617 persons (16,758 men, 13,855 women). This {{represented}} nearly double <b>the</b> 1996 total <b>of</b> 16,478 persons. Numerically, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth was in <b>the</b> foreign-born <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> whose numbers increased from 14,628 over the period in question; however, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> growth was fastest in <b>the</b> locally born <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> which almost tripled in size from 1,850 persons.|$|R
50|$|The early {{selection}} process meant that children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> farmers and workers, were grossly underrepresented at higher schools and universities, whereas <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> {{a relatively small}} <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> those who had attended higher schools or the universities, were overrepresented. Consequently, the education system tended to reproduce or to reinforce traditional social structures {{instead of being a}} vehicle of opportunity or social mobility.|$|R
25|$|The officially sanctioned {{distinction}} between Moldovans and Romanians {{has been criticized}} by {{some members of the}} scientific community within Moldova, and it has raised protests from certain <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> especially intellectuals and students, at their turn inspired by several political forces. Furthermore, the problem strained Moldova's diplomatic relations with neighboring Romania.|$|E
25|$|The {{samples were}} narrow ("male, white, American, and born between 1919 and 1932.") but were {{followed}} {{for a long}} period. As critics and Vaillant himself pointed out, the samples did not include important <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> such as African-Americans and women. Both samples likely excluded those who began abusing alcohol in early adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Niue appears to have had no national government or national leader; chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> Around 1700 the concept and practice of kingship appears to have originated through contact with the Tongans who settled around the 1600s. A succession of patu-iki (kings) ruled, beginning with Puni-mata. Tui-toga, who reigned from 1875 to 1887, was the first Christian king.|$|E

25|$|During Toledo's {{five years}} as president, Peru's economy {{experienced}} 47 consecutive months of growth and grew at an average rate of 6% per year while inflation averaged 1.5% and the deficit sank as low as 0.2% of GDP. Between 2004 and 2006, employment grew at an average rate of 6%, {{the percentage of people}} living in poverty fell, and food consumption by the poorest <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> rose dramatically. Much of this growth has been credited to the free trade agreements signed with the United States, China, Thailand, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|The Maharishi taught {{thousands}} of people during a series of world tours from 1958 to 1965, expressing his teachings in spiritual and religious terms. TM became more popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as the Maharishi shifted to a more technical presentation, and his meditation technique was practiced by celebrities. At this time, he began training TM teachers and created specialized organizations to present TM to specific <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> such as business people and students. By the early 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of people, and the worldwide TM organization had grown to include educational programs, health products, and related services.|$|E

In the prevailing situation in the Balkans, the association is very active in social work for all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> and cooperates closely with the Red Cross in providing aid to refugees, opportunities for the disabled, help for orphans and general aid to areas in crisis. The SIS has recently been featured in news stories about the work they are doing for the environment. The SIS is active in a campaign to introduce new methods and materials of packaging, different schemes for garbage collection and recycling programmes. Serbia and Montenegro fielded a contingent EuroJam 2005.|$|E

25|$|Causes of {{homelessness}} in the United States include lack of affordable housing, divorce, lawful eviction, negative cash flow, post traumatic stress disorder, foreclosure, fire, natural disasters (hurricane, earthquake, or flood), mental illness, physical disability, having no family or supportive relatives, substance abuse, lack of needed services, elimination of pensions and unemployment entitlements, no or inadequate income sources, such as Social Security, stock dividends, or annuity), poverty (no net worth), gambling, unemployment, and low-paying jobs. Homelessness in the United States affects many <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> including families, children, domestic violence victims, ex-convicts, veterans, and the aged. Efforts {{to assist the}} homeless include federal legislation, non-profit efforts, increased access to healthcare services, and affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|Uzbeks {{come from}} a {{predominantly}} Sunni Muslim background, usually of the Hanafi school, but variations exist between northern and southern Uzbeks. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, Uzbekistan's population is 96.3% Muslim. The majority of Uzbeks from the former USSR came to practice religion with a more liberal interpretation due to the official Soviet policy of atheism, while Uzbeks in Afghanistan and other countries to the south have remained more conservative adherents of Islam. However, with Uzbek independence in 1991 came an Islamic revival amongst <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> People living {{in the area of}} modern Uzbekistan were first converted to Islam as early as the 8th century, as Arabs conquered the area, displacing the earlier faith of Manichaeism.|$|E
25|$|From this point, the nullifiers {{accelerated}} {{their organization}} and rhetoric. In July 1831 the States Rights and Free Trade Association {{was formed in}} Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston non-agricultural class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, the governor held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in either organization or leadership.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian-Norse {{chieftain}} Ingólfr Arnarson {{built his}} homestead in present-day Reykjavík in 874. Ingólfr {{was followed by}} many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their thralls, {{many of whom were}} Irish or Scottish. By 930, most arable land on the island had been claimed; the Althing, a legislative and judicial assembly, was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth. Lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986. The period of these early settlements coincided with the Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures were {{similar to those of the}} early 20th century. At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day. Christianity was adopted by consensus around 999–1000, although Norse paganism persisted among some <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> for some years afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Early diet in India mainly {{consisted}} of legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, and honey. Staple foods eaten today include {{a variety of}} lentils (dal), whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), rice, and pearl millet (bājra), which has been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent since 6200 BCE. Over time, <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> embraced vegetarianism during Śramaṇa movement while an equitable climate permitted a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains to be grown throughout the year. A food classification system that categorised any item as saatvic, raajsic, or taamsic developed in Yoga tradition. The Bhagavad Gita proscribes certain dietary practices (chapter 17, verses 8–10). Consumption of beef is taboo, due to cows being considered sacred in Hinduism. Beef is generally not eaten by Hindus in India except for Kerala and the north east.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} action to alter village society was the land {{reform of the}} late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village {{to carry out its}} land reform policy. This in itself was an {{unprecedented}} display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; and to teach everyone {{to think in terms of}} class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.|$|E
5000|$|This {{increasing}} concentration of populations in urban centers created a strong demand on public goods and services, {{which was only}} exacerbated with <b>the</b> economic crisis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. Further adding to the situation, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> urban employment in the informal economy not only restricted access of social rights to this <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> but weakened <b>the</b> tax basis for the welfare state. [...] Under these circumstances, the minority with secured jobs and access to social rights essentially became a privileged <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> This only increased the political, social, and economic inequality that characterized Brazil.|$|R
30|$|Until {{recently}} in Germany, {{there has been}} a lack of meaningful data or statistics related to that <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> that is disabled yet still part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active workforce, including older working people.|$|R

25|$|The DMK and {{its prime}} {{opposition}} party, the ADMK have posted {{an array of}} populist schemes targeting the human development index of the state. Most of the schemes are accused to be targeting garner larger electoral support. Both the parties have schemes listed in the election manifestos covering various <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> involving fishermen, farmers and school children. Till the 2000s, the parties had welfare schemes like maternity assistance, subsidised public transport and educational grants. After the 2000s, the parties started competing at an increasing level over the distribution of consumer goods. The ADMK government distributed free cycles to class 11 and class 12 students during its tenure of 2001–06. The DMK, in competition, promised free colour televisions in its manifesto in 2006 elections. The competition continued during the 2011 elections when both parties announced free laptops for schools students and grinder, mixer and fans for public.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they {{must be able to}} prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E
25|$|Tsarist Russia {{was being}} torn apart in 1914 {{and was not}} {{prepared}} to fight a modern war. The industrial sector was small, finances were poor, the rural areas could barely feed themselves. Repeated military failures and bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned large <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> against the government. Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies or exporting goods. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel supplies grew scarce, war casualties kept climbing and inflation was mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, elite distrust of the incompetent decision making at the highest levels was deepened when a semiliterate mystic, Grigory Rasputin, gained enormous influence over the Tsar and his wife until he was assassinated. Major strikes broke out early in 1917 and the army sided with the strikers in the February Revolution. The tsar abdicated. The liberal reformer Alexander Kerensky came to power in July, but in the October Revolution Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control. In early 1918 they signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that made Germany dominant in Eastern Europe, while Russia plunged into years of civil war.|$|E
