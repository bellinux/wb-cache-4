50|$|In July 2009, Rida is {{releasing}} {{his fourth}} album, “Yom Wa <b>Sana</b> (<b>A</b> Year and a Day),” an ambitious set of fourteen songs he produced and recorded with his team. The product {{of four years}} work, this important album blends traditional Iraqi songs, Arabic and Western pop—everything from maqam to techno. It incorporates violins, oud, cello, flute, clarinet playing in an Arabic mode, also guitars, saxophones, Western and Arabic percussion, and even tabla, trap drums, and rhythmic loops. Among Rida’s original compositions is “La Tesafer (Don’t Go),” written for his mother who cried when he left Iraq in 1997, and died in his arms in Dubai a decade later. The album’s title song recalls a brief romance Rida had {{as a young man}} in Iraq. When they meet by chance a year later, they become inseparable, and Rida tells her that each time they are apart feels like another year. This message, that life is short and unpredictable and must be lived to the fullest, has profound meaning to all Iraqis. At the same time, it is universal, the sentiment {{of a man who has}} come through the worst life has to offer and carries the great traditions of his country forward into the 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Rai {{was cast}} by Mani Ratnam in his bilingual modern-day {{adaptation}} of the Indian epic Ramayana. Her role was that of Ragini (modeled on Sita, the heroine of Ramayana), a woman married to the superintendent of police, who is kidnapped by a bandit. The Hindi version (Raavan) and the Tamil version (Raavanan) of the film were shot simultaneously and Rai played the same role in both the film versions. The films received polarising reviews from film critics, as did Rai's performance. Kaveree Bamzai of India Today wrote, [...] "Aishwarya's Sita {{is one of the}} best things in the film ... her performance is heartfelt—this is a performer who is at ease playing women, rather than girls". However, film critics Aniruddha Guha and Rajeev Masand criticised her character and noted, [...] "She's left to scream and shriek and hiss." [...] Commercially, Raavanan emerged as a success while Raavan flopped.Rai's next role was opposite Rajinikanth in the science fiction Tamil film Enthiran (2010), directed by S. Shankar. She was cast as <b>Sana,</b> <b>a</b> college student and the girlfriend of Rajinikanth's character. At the time of release, Enthiran was the most expensive Indian film production and eventually emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. She then appeared as Mala, an impetuous brat, in Vipul Shah's Action Replayy; a science fiction comedy co-starring Akshay Kumar, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Neha Dhupia.|$|E

Wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs) experience serious security issues even when solutions employ preventive or reactive security mechanisms. In order to support both network operations and security requirements of critical applications, we present <b>SANA,</b> <b>a</b> Secure Ad hoc Network Architecture. Its goal lies in managing adaptively preventive, reactive and tolerant security mechanisms to provide essential services even under attacks, intrusions or failures. We use SANA to design a path selection scheme for WANET routing. The evaluation of this path selection scheme considers scenarios using urban mesh network mobility with urban propagation models, and also random way point mobility with two-ray ground propagation models. Results show the survivability achieved on routing service under different conditions and attacks...|$|E

40|$|The Trans-community Approaches to Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Study (Activa Y Sana) was {{a two-year}} (August 2006 to May 2008) {{intervention}} in {{one hundred and}} forty-one 3 rd and 4 th grade {{children and their parents}} from four schools in the Sunnyside School District in Tucson, Arizona. Activa was designed to expand upon schools as an intervention venue, and was the first to test the feasibility and impact of a multi-level, or "trans-community" approach (involving children, their parents or caregivers, schools, and community agencies) on the prevention of childhood weight gain in an at-risk Mexican-American population. Families were assigned to one of three interventions, depending upon which school the child attended: Level 1, state-mandated nutrition- and physical activity-based health curricula; Level 2, Level 1 curricula plus an after-school program; or Level 3, Level 1 + Level 2 activities, plus a family intervention. Primary endpoints of this study were changes in child BMI z-score, % fat, abdominal circumference, activity levels and food intake, psychosocial characteristics and correlates of these measures. The three manuscripts contained herein represent the main findings of this pilot study. Identifying potential mediators and describing their influence on childhood overweight is essential to development of successful interventions. In Study # 1, the findings for the examination of correlates of child BMI z-score and % fat are reported. Activa Y Sana was designed to test whether combining different levels of intervention would have a greater impact on child weight. In Study # 2, the results of this trans-community intervention on child weight status is discussed. The majority of evidence-based obesity prevention programs in use today were not designed with minorities in mind, and the continued scarcity of research in Latino populations has hindered the development of culturally-competent interventions that might reduce overweight prevalence. The challenges encountered while implementing Activa Y <b>Sana,</b> <b>a</b> population-specific intervention, are described in Study # 3. The results from this research may be used to help inform the design of future intervention programs with the goal of reducing the burden of obesity in Mexican-American children, currently the fastest-growing segment of the U. S. population...|$|E
40|$|Middle Holocene {{climate change}} forced {{significant}} environmental response and influenced human activities throughout southern Arabia. Climate models and proxy {{data indicate that}} climate along the southern Arabian peninsula changed from a moist phase, spanning the early to middle Holocene, to an arid phase, which persisted for the last ca. 5, 000 years. A weakening and southward shift of the Southwest Indian Monsoon System, forced by northern hemisphere insolation variations in the precession band and/or glacial boundary conditions, is suggested as the mechanism for the abrupt shift to more arid conditions. Geoarchaeological evidence suggests that agriculture was more widespread and evolved alongside the development of irrigation technologies during a period when rainfall was more plentiful than today. Here we investigate the surficial record of the dynamic fluvial response to the late Quaternary climate shift and reconstruct the geochronology of the geomorphic evolution of {{a significant portion of}} the ca. 125 km length of Wadi <b>Sana,</b> <b>a</b> north-flowing tributary to the Wadi Hadramout system. Using differential-corrected GPS-based survey, combined with analysis of the sedimentary record, the RASA (Roots of Agriculture in Southern Arabia) Project has created a paleohydrologic reconstruction of Wadi Sana in order to provide a context for understanding how fluvial landscapes, hydrologic regime, and human activity reacted to ivchanging middle Holocene climate. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating of remnant silt terraces suggests that fine-grained sediment began accumulating on an older (late-Pleistocene) coarse cobble surface between 12, 000 - 7, 000 years ago and continued aggrading until about 5, 000 years ago. Paralleling the climate shift, Wadi Sana began incising and eroding the thick sediment infilling about 4, 500 years ago, which has continued to the present time. Field reconnaissance and map analysis reveals structural and lithologic controls on the source and availability of these fluvial sediments for downstream deposition during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Hydrologic modeling of active present-day channels within Wadi Sana estimates stream velocities at 2. 2 m/s and stream discharges of 444 m 3 /s. We propose that a change in hydrologic regime, driven by the monsoon shift, is the cause of the middle Holocene channel adjustment from an aggradational to incising mode in Wadi Sana...|$|E
