40|$|MR {{studies are}} highly {{sensitive}} to patient motion, which can, at the extreme, render them completely uninterpretable. In particular, MR exams of inherently poor signal, such as T 2 -weighted images or surface-coil images, suffer demonstrably. Many techniques have been attempted to minimize and to limit motion {{caused by the}} patient during these studies. While tape and velcro straps can restrict head motion, in some cases its application does not prove beneficial; moreover, a small patient may not provide the correct leverage for a velcro strap. Respiratory motion may {{be transferred to the}} head and spine {{as a consequence of the}} patient's interacting with the contour of the table. Attempts to completely restrict and secure the patient with pads or even vacuum cushions create an environment that increases the patient's anxiety and produces a higher risk that the exam will be terminated as a consequence of claustrophobia. We report here our favorable results with a soft cervical spine collar. These collars have several advantages: they come in different sizes for different-size patients; they are readily applied with a velcro Fig. 1. - 50 ft cervical spine collars provide an inexpensive and quick way to immobilize patients for MR exams of the cervical spine and head in a manner that achieves a large degree of patient compliance. fastener; they do not add to the "enclosed " feeling the magnet bore produces; they moderate and dampen any head motion; and they are useful for head exams as well as for cervical spine exams. For cervical spine exams the collar is positioned so that the velcro <b>strap</b> <b>fastener</b> is placed between the surface coil and the patient to minimize distance between the surface coil and the anatomy of interest (Fig. 1). Image artifacts from swallowing and jaw movement, as well as from respiration and gross head turning, are reduced with the use of the soft collar. Other methods of patient immobilization have not met with as much success...|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, usually low coercivity magnetic stripes are a {{light brown}} color, and high coercivity stripes are nearly black; exceptions include a proprietary silver-colored formulation on transparent American Express cards. High coercivity stripes {{are resistant to}} damage from most magnets likely to be owned by consumers. Low coercivity stripes are easily damaged by even a brief contact with a magnetic purse <b>strap</b> or <b>fastener.</b> Because of this, virtually all bank cards today are encoded on high coercivity stripes despite a slightly higher per-unit cost.|$|R
50|$|Badge tethers {{consist of}} a thin cord, {{dimensions}} {{on the order of}} a millimetre diameter by a metre long with one end wound round a spring-loaded reel contained within a small badge-like body that has a clip for a belt, belt loop, pocket, the edge of the clothing itself, or an attachment specifically for such a tether. The other end of the cord has a clip, loop, splitring, <b>strap,</b> or other <b>fastener.</b>|$|R
25|$|The framed tent (1965â€“1967). This is {{the largest}} and most {{colorful}} of the Westfalia side tents. It's different from the earlier small and large awning-based tents in two important ways: the addition of large, screened windows on the side curtains, and a free-standing frame that allows the tent to be left at the campsite while the bus is driven away for groceries or side trips. The tent also has a rear door that can be zipped closed at such times. Both front and rear flaps can be rolled up and held open by cloth ties or (on later models) <b>straps</b> with lift-the-dot <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop {{criteria}} {{for the design of}} a brace for patients with limited muscular control of their lower leg. To do this, gait theory is first investigated. The fundamental unit of walking is the stride. The stride consists of two symmetrical steps which are divided into several phases. The two major phases are the swing phase and the stance (or support) phase. The swing phase begins when the toes of the leg leave the ground, and ends when the heel strikes the ground {{at the end of its}} swing. A major point of this project is to develop a model that will have the aforementioned patient's leg fully extend just prior to heel-strike. The toes should not strike the ground at any point during the swing. A model that is easily adapted for the purposes of this project is the ballistic walking model. This model has three links: the stance leg, the thigh of the swing leg, and the shank and foot of the swing leg. The links are configured as a jointed pendulum (the swing leg) hanging from an inverted pendulum (the stance leg). When the model is put into motion, the stance leg pivots about its point of contact with the ground, the thigh rotates from its point of contact with the stance leg, and the shank and foot rotate about the pivot of a brace. Static analysis of the ballistic model during the stance phase reveals that stability is given to the patient when the pivot of the brace is moved behind the knee. However, the amount of this displacement can only be determined by dynamic analysis of the swing phase. The equations of motion for the swing phase are derived using Lagrange's method and are solved with a FORTRAN program that uses a Runge-Kutta fourth order solution process. This analysis correlates very well with experimental observations and suggests that the optimal displacement for the brace pivot is 4. 00 inches. The construction process of the brace begins by fitting the patient's leg with orthoplast casts. Bars are then used to attach the upper and lower sections of the casts to one another and to move the pivot of the lower section "a" inches behind the knee. A pin is placed on the upper section of the bar section to prevent the patient from hyperextending their leg. Final adjustments can be made to the fitting by providing elastic <b>straps</b> with velcro <b>fasteners</b> to the brace. It is also suggested that the patient wear a commercial non-slip leg sleeve to prevent their leg from moving within the brace...|$|R
