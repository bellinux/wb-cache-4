6000|$|When the {{advantages}} of the possession and of the project are on a par, there is no motive for a change. But in the present case, perhaps, they are not upon a par, and the difference is in favor of the possession. It does not appear to me that the expenses of those whom you are going to expel do in fact take a course so directly and so generally leading to vitiate and degrade and render miserable those through whom they pass as the expenses of those favorites whom you are intruding into their houses. Why should the expenditure of a great landed property, which is a dispersion of the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> of the soil, appear intolerable to you or to me, when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast libraries, which are the history of the force and weakness of the human mind,--through great collections of ancient records, medals, and coins, which attest and explain laws and customs,--through paintings and statues, that, by imitating Nature, seem to extend the limits of creation,--through grand monuments of the dead, which continue the regards and connections of life beyond the grave,--through collections of the specimens of Nature, which become a representative assembly of all the classes and families of the world, that by disposition facilitate, and by exciting curiosity open, the avenues to science?

60|$|In all {{the views}} of receipt, expenditure, and {{personal}} employment, a sober legislator would carefully compare the possessor whom he was recommended to expel with the stranger who was proposed to fill his place. Before the inconveniences are incurred which must attend all violent revolutions in property through extensive confiscation, {{we ought to have}} some rational assurance that the purchasers of the confiscated property will be in a considerable degree more laborious, more virtuous, more sober, less disposed to extort an unreasonable proportion of the gains of the laborer, or to consume on themselves a larger share than is fit for the measure of an individual,--or that they should be qualified to dispense the surplus in a more steady and equal mode, so as to answer the purposes of a politic expenditure, than the old possessors, call those possessors bishops, or canons, or commendatory abbots, or monks, or what you please. The monks are lazy. Be it so. Suppose them no otherwise employed than by singing in the choir. They are as usefully employed as those who neither sing nor say,--as usefully even as those who sing upon the stage. They are as usefully employed as if they worked from dawn to dark in the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly, unmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations to which by the social economy so many wretches are inevitably doomed. If it were not generally pernicious to disturb the natural course of things, and to impede in any degree the great wheel of circulation which is turned by the strangely directed labor of these unhappy people, I should be infinitely more inclined forcibly to rescue them from their miserable industry than violently to disturb the tranquil repose of monastic quietude. Humanity, and perhaps policy, might better justify me in the one than in the other. It is a subject on which I have often reflected, and never reflected without feeling from it. I am sure that no consideration, except the necessity of submitting to the yoke of luxury and the despotism of fancy, who in their own imperious way will distribute the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> of the soil, can justify the toleration of such trades and employments in a well-regulated state. But for this purpose of distribution, {{it seems to me that}} the idle expenses of monks are quite as well directed as the idle expenses of us lay loiterers.|$|E
60|$|When a {{great nation}} has {{equipped}} itself to produce far more than it can, under the present division of the product, consume, it seeks other markets for its <b>surplus</b> <b>products.</b> When a second nation finds itself similarly circumstanced, competition for these other markets naturally follows. With {{the advent of a}} third, a fourth, a fifth, and of divers other nations, the question of the disposal of <b>surplus</b> <b>products</b> grows serious. And with each of these nations possessing, over and beyond its active capital, great and growing masses of idle capital, and when the very foreign markets for which they are competing are beginning to produce similar wares for themselves, the question passes the serious stage and becomes critical.|$|R

50|$|Essentially the {{techniques}} for estimating {{the size of}} the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> in a capitalist economy are similar to those for measuring surplus-value. However, some components of the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> may not be marketed products or services. The existence of markets always presupposes a lot of non-market labour as well.

50|$|<b>Surplus</b> <b>product</b> (German: Mehrprodukt) is an {{economic}} concept explicitly theorised by Karl Marx in his critique of political economy. Marx first began to work out his idea of <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> in his 1844 notes on James Mill's Elements of political economy.|$|E
50|$|Ownership of {{the means}} of {{production}} and control over the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different economic systems (or modes of production). Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. By contrast, socialism is defined as public ownership {{of the means}} of production so that the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> accrues to society at large.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} a social <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> seems very simple and {{straightforward}} at first sight, but for social scientists it is actually a quite complex concept.

50|$|The {{category}} of <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> is a transhistorical economic category, meaning {{it applies to}} any society with a stable division of labour, and a significant labour productivity, regardless of how exactly that <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> is produced, what it consists of, {{and how it is}} distributed. That depends on the social relations and relations of production specific to a society, within the framework of which surplus labour is performed. Thus, the exact forms taken by the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> are specific to the type of society which creates it.|$|E

5000|$|In Marxism, the {{existence}} of a [...] "surplus product" [...] normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour, i.e. extra labour beyond that which is necessary to maintain the direct producers and their family dependents at the existing standard of life. In Capital, Vol. 1, chapter 9, section 4, Marx actually defines the capitalist <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> exclusively in terms {{of the relationship between the}} value of necessary labour and surplus labour; at any one time, this <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> is lodged simultaneously in money, commodities (goods), and claims to labour-services, and therefore is not simply a [...] "physical" [...] <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> (a stockpile of additional goods).|$|E
40|$|Discussions on {{the issue}} of whether {{production}} price remains a fact in the socialist economy started as early as the 1960 s. Proponents of the theory at that time contended that the department with access to more funds would have a higher organic composition of capital. The department with a higher organic composition of capital would have a higher growth rate of labor productivity. And the department with a higher growth rate of labor productivity should have a higher rate of <b>surplus</b> <b>products</b> and its contribution to the state would be greater. Thus, the proponents maintained that the value of <b>surplus</b> <b>products</b> should be redistributed in proportion to the funds each department possessed. This raised the question of the average rate of return on funds and the question of production price. I, too, was a proponent of this view. Judging by how things stand now, this exposition, though basically correct, did not measure up to a rigorous scientific principle. The following is a reassessment of the basis of production price. ...|$|R

50|$|If the <b>surplus</b> <b>product</b> {{is simply}} held in reserve, wasted or consumed, no {{economic}} growth (or enlarged economic reproduction) occurs. Only when the surplus is traded and/or reinvested does it become possible {{to increase the}} scale of production.

50|$|The private plots {{were also}} an {{important}} source of income for rural households. In 1977, families of kolkhoz members obtained 72% of their meat, 76% of their eggs and most of their potatoes from private holdings. <b>Surplus</b> <b>products,</b> as well as surplus livestock, were sold to kolkhozy and sovkhozy and also to state consumer cooperatives. Statistics may actually under-represent the total contribution of private plots to Soviet agriculture. The only time when private plots were completely banned was during collectivization, when famine took millions of lives.|$|R
