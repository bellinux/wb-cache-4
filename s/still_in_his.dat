After singing to standing ovation crowds in both Spain and Italy, Paoli made his grand debut in Paris, France, where he was encouraged to perform on {{the highest levels of the}} world stage. Before the end of the 19th century and while Paoli was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> twenties, he went on a tour of Europe that earned him both popular acclaim, and imperial honors from princes, kings, and emperors.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing {{little chance of}} further advancement where he was, Brain {{took the opportunity to}} apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{finds himself}} in a bedroom {{appointed}} in the neoclassical style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears {{at the foot of}} the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a fetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.|$|E
5|$|Bran and Meera Reed {{are fleeing}} the wights, who {{continue}} to follow them from the cave. Bran, <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> visions, witnesses several events: Jaime Lannister killing King Aerys Targaryen, a dragon flying over the Red Keep, his fall from Winterfell which left him paralyzed, the Night King transforming Craster's last son into a White Walker, the Massacre at Hardhome, Ned Stark's beheading, {{the murder of his}} mother Catelyn and brother Robb in the Red Wedding, and wildfire exploding beneath King's Landing. As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four years in office.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. <b>Still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|From {{a family}} with no {{background}} of ballet or music, MacMillan was determined {{from an early age}} to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a member of her company. In the late 1940s, MacMillan built a successful career as a dancer, but, plagued by stage fright, he abandoned it while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> twenties. After this he worked entirely as a choreographer; he created ten full-length ballets and more than fifty one-act pieces. In addition to his work for ballet companies he was active in television, musicals, non-musical drama, and opera.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Scamper {{sustained}} a cut to his coronet band {{at the beginning}} of the NFR. James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She wanted that win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> prime. That year, the pair won both the NFR and WPRA world championships, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history.|$|E
5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> throat.|$|E
5|$|Sudell {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the sports club, which by then was known as Preston North End, in 1874 or 1875, while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mid-twenties. In 1880 the club voted to play football exclusively, and the following year Sudell took responsibility for the management of the team. From 1883 the club fielded several Scottish players, after Sudell went on a recruitment expedition to Scotland. The club arranged jobs for the players, and supplemented their income with off-balance sheet payments. At this time professionalism was not permitted, but such payments were common among Lancashire clubs.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{was born}} in Cincinnati in 1857. His father, Alphonso Taft, was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War. William Taft {{attended}} Yale {{and was a member}} of Skull and Bones secret society like his father, and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> twenties. He continued a rapid rise, being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines. In 1904, Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and he became Roosevelt's hand-picked successor. Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice, Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, believing his political work to be more important.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{was born}} in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family had been prominent, but its {{fortunes}} had declined {{by the time of}} Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended Lichfield Grammar School (now King Edward VI School) and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget's sons, and in 1638, with James Paget's help, he qualified as a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a déclassé Cheshire aristocratic family, who died, while pregnant, only three years later on 6 December 1641. <b>Still</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth. He also became allied with Major-General Charles Worsley (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at Westminster Abbey), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John Booth, of Salford.|$|E
