5|$|Many guitar picks {{employ the}} Reuleaux triangle, as its shape {{combines}} a <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> to provide strong articulation, {{with a wide}} tip to produce a warm timbre. Because all three points of the shape are usable, {{it is easier to}} orient and wears less quickly compared to a pick with a single tip.|$|E
5|$|The first pereiopod is {{modified}} into {{a strong}} cheliped (claw-bearing leg): the claw's fingers, the dactylus and propodus, are black at the tips. The other pereiopods {{are covered with}} rows of short stiff setae; the dactylus of each is black towards the tip, and ends in a <b>sharp</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the <b>sharp</b> <b>point.</b> Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>point.</b> The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
5|$|The spores of R.virescens are {{elliptical}} or ellipsoid with warts, translucent (hyaline), {{and produce}} a white, pale or pale yellow spore print; the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7µm. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24–33 by 6–7.5µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8µm and end abruptly in a <b>sharp</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Seagull shape {{was uncomfortable}} for some to play {{due to the}} <b>sharp</b> upper <b>point</b> and the <b>sharp</b> lower <b>point</b> that dug into the leg sitting down. It was {{redesigned}} several times including a smoother lower point, a Junior version with simpler electronics and a pointless version which is quite rare. Finally it morphed into the Eagle shape with no <b>sharp</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
5|$|In November 2010, Viz Media {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Tenjho Tenge manga, stating that their version would be 100% uncut and faithful to the original Japanese. From June 21, 2011 to February 5, 2013, they released the series bi-monthly in eleven 2-in-1 volumes, which collects two individual volumes into a single large one. Viz's releases also includes omake, color pages from the series' original run in Ultra Jump, and since each release will cover two volumes, the second cover will be printed in as a color page. The manga is also published in many other countries, such as in Taiwan by <b>Sharp</b> <b>Point</b> Press, in Italy, France and Germany by Panini Comics, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Brazil by Editora JBC, and in Spain by Norma Editorial.|$|E
5|$|Outlaw Star was {{serialized}} in Japan's monthly Shueisha magazine Ultra Jump between 1996 and 1999. A {{total of}} 21 chapters were published, and 17 of these chapters were compiled among three tankōbon (collected volumes), released in Japan from August 1997 to January 1999. Each volume also contains {{information on the}} series' universe; detailed spaceship and planet descriptions; and character profiles. A Chinese version of the manga was published in Hong Kong by <b>Sharp</b> <b>Point</b> Press. The series has also been published in German and Italian by Planet Manga. No official English translation of the Outlaw Star exists, though Morning Star Studio's official website suggests that a release in the United States was planned at one time.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish-brown. Spores range in shape from roughly rhomboid to roughly elliptical, and {{typically}} have dimensions of 5–6 by 4–6μm. They are thick-walled {{and have a}} large germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped to swollen, hyaline, usually four-spored (although rarely two- or three-spored forms are present), and measure 13–19 by 4.4–6.6μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are ventricose (swollen) near the base and often mucronate (ending abruptly in a short <b>sharp</b> <b>point)</b> at the apex, and measure 14–25 by 4.4–10.5μm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are variable in shape, and measure 14–40 by 4.4–7.7μm. Pleurocystidia are relatively sparse, while cheilocystidia are abundant. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The application of a drop of potassium hydroxide solution turns both the cap and the stem from brown to blackish.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E

For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their impressive beaks to open even the toughest seed.

25|$|The {{safety pin}} is a {{fastening}} device, {{a variation of}} the regular pin, which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to whatever it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the <b>sharp</b> <b>point.</b> The safety pin was invented by Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.|$|E
25|$|By 1874, skirts {{began to}} taper {{in the front}} and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves {{tightened}} around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a <b>sharp</b> <b>point</b> in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath {{in order to keep the}} dress clean.|$|E
