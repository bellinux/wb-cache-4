500|$|The early {{motion picture}} {{industry}} primarily used nitrocellulose film stock, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly, and cannot typically be extinguished, capable of burning even underwater. Additionally, nitrocellulose {{is subject to}} thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time {{in the presence of}} high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously combust. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for <b>self-ignition.</b> Sustained temperatures of [...] or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, exacerbating several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.|$|E

50|$|The {{resulting}} uranium hydride is pyrophoric; if {{the metal}} (e.g. a damaged fuel rod) {{is exposed to}} air afterwards, excessive heat may be generated and the bulk uranium metal itself can ignite. Hydride-contaminated uranium can be passivated by exposition to a gaseous mixture of 98% helium with 2% oxygen. Condensed moisture on uranium metal promotes formation of hydrogen and uranium hydride; a pyrophoric surface may be formed in absence of oxygen. This poses a problem with underwater storage of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel ponds. Depending on the size and distribution on the hydride particles, <b>self-ignition</b> can occur after an indeterminate length of exposure to air. Such exposure poses risk of <b>self-ignition</b> of fuel debris in radioactive waste storage vaults.|$|E

In this work, we develop a numerical method, using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics, to investigate <b>self-ignition</b> behaviour of coal dust accumulations with a main emphasis on the roles of oxygen, diluent gas and dust volume. A one-step 2 nd-order reaction kinetic model consid- ering both coal density and oxygen density is used to estimate reaction rate using the kinetic parameters from previously conducted hot-oven tests. This model is validated to predict the transient temperature and concentration profiles of South African coal dusts until ignition. The computed <b>self-ignition</b> temperatures of dust volumes show a good agreement with experimental results. In addition, it is found that the inhibiting effect of carbon dioxide is comparatively small and oxygen consumption increases dramatically after ignition. Parameter analysis shows that the heating value and kinetic parameters have a comparatively pronounced effect on <b>self-ignition</b> temperature. The model provides a satisfactory explanation for the dependence of <b>self-ignition</b> behaviour on gas atmospheres, thus helping to further understand the fire risk of <b>self-ignition</b> in oxy-fuel combustion systems. status: publishe...|$|E

In this work, both hot-oven and hot-plate tests were conducted to study the <b>self-ignition</b> behaviour of coal dusts in O 2 /CO 2 ambient with O 2 mole fraction from 21 % to 50 %. Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal, Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested with different sizes. Experimental results revealed that the <b>self-ignition</b> risk increased significantly with the increasing O 2 mole fraction: reducing both the critical ignition temperature (10 °C in hot-oven test and 40 °C in hot-plate test) and the ignition delay time. Comparatively, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be small for <b>self-ignition.</b> In addition, a modified Frank-Kamenetzkii analysis was proposed to explain all measured critical ignition temperatures, and the genetic algorithm was used to determine kinetic parameters of the one-step global reaction. The analysis showed that as the coal maturity/rank increased, both the <b>self-ignition</b> risk and the sensitivity to oxidation decreased, along with the decreasing apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor. Such trend did not change with the ambient oxygen condition for all three coal dusts.
