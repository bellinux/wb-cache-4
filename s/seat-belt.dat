25|$|Pre-facelift vs Facelift. In {{respect of}} FTO ownership, {{there is some}} {{division}} in preference for the styling of the front bumper - either Pre-facelift, or Facelift. Interchanging these units is a relatively simple matter and, as the latter version models have become write-offs over the years, there are many pre-facelift models now {{on the road that}} are sporting newer facelift bumpers. Future purchasers of an FTO should be aware of this. A simple check of the VIN Plate details, or the period of manufacture to be found on the <b>seat-belt</b> tags, should resolve any uncertainty as to the origin of the model-build. Apart from body styling, there are other less apparent differences in the Facelift models, such as uprated ECU and also distinct variations to the drive shaft units across the range. Such as 25 or 27-spline shafts and CV cup variants, as well as fitment for ABS or non-ABS shafts and bearings for same.|$|E

5000|$|Active <b>seat-belt</b> buckle with Pre-Safe {{function}} for rear occupants: the active <b>seat-belt</b> buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible belt tensioning is also performed in the rear via the active <b>seat-belt</b> buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the belt tensioning on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active <b>seat-belt</b> buckle complements the pyrotechnic belt tensioning which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|E

5000|$|In Britain in 1981 at a {{time when}} the {{government}} was considering the introduction of seat belt legislation, John Adams of University College London, suggested that there was no convincing evidence of a correlation between the <b>seat-belt</b> legislation and reductions injuries and fatalities based on a comparison between states with and without seat belt laws. He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users. The [...] "Isles Report" [...] echoed these concerns. Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to <b>seat-belt</b> use due to the simultaneous introduction of breath testing for driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
