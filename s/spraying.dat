5|$|DDT {{was banned}} in the US in 1972, after the {{discussion}} opened in 1962 by Silent Spring, written by American biologist Rachel Carson, which launched the environmental movement in the West. The book catalogued {{the environmental impacts of}} indiscriminate DDT <b>spraying</b> and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife. The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT <b>spraying</b> as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide <b>spraying</b> programs in tropical countries.|$|E

5|$|Indoor {{residual}} <b>spraying</b> is the <b>spraying</b> of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by <b>spraying,</b> their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial <b>spraying</b> of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the <b>spraying</b> of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the <b>spraying</b> stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public {{was not made}} aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop <b>spraying</b> had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide <b>spraying</b> was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of phosphite inhibits growth of P.cinnamomi in B.sessilis, {{but does not}} kill the pathogen. In one study, a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of P.cinnamomi by over 90% in plants infected with B.sessilis two weeks after <b>spraying,</b> and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying; yet most plants infected shortly before or after <b>spraying</b> were dead 100 days later, while nearly all plants infected seven months later <b>spraying</b> survived a further 100 days. Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth, but {{has been shown to}} reduce pollen fertility: one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50%, and, in a separate experiment, fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year.|$|E
40|$|Diesel <b>spray</b> {{impinged}} normally on a {{flat wall}} was investigated. <b>Spray</b> tip penetration and <b>spray</b> volumes of before and after impingement were measured on high speed photographs of the <b>sprays</b> which were injected by a single shot injection system into a high pressure chamber of cold state. The effects of the <b>spray</b> tip penetration, <b>spray</b> volume, entrainment mass and air-fuel ratio were discussed on the <b>sprays</b> of before and after impingement. The volume of the post-impingement <b>spray</b> was calculated using axi-symmetrical model. It was greatly affected by {{the distance between the}} injection nozzle and the wall. When the impingement distance was shorter than the break-up length of the original <b>spray,</b> the entrainment mass as well as the volume of post-impingement <b>spray</b> was the larger than that of the original <b>spray</b> at the same inspection time. To calculate the average <b>spray</b> concentration of after impingement <b>spray,</b> the fuel film stuck on the wall was measured. The average air-fuel ratio of the impingement <b>spray</b> increased faster than the free <b>spray</b> because the <b>spray</b> concentration in a space decreased by the fuel stuck on the wall...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate <b>spray</b> is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the <b>spray</b> pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate <b>spray,</b> which will definitely influence the <b>spray</b> characteristics, such as <b>spray</b> droplet sizes, <b>spray</b> angles, <b>spray</b> droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the <b>spray</b> pressure constant during the process of variable- rate <b>spray</b> has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of <b>spray</b> pressure for variable- rate <b>spray,</b> a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the <b>spray</b> volume was changed by adjusting <b>spray</b> pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The <b>spray</b> features concerning the <b>spray</b> angle and the <b>spray</b> volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input <b>spray</b> pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate <b>spray</b> through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the <b>spray</b> angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles. The <b>spray</b> angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when the <b>spray</b> pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of the <b>spray</b> volume distribution basically unchanged and the <b>spray</b> volume and the peak values of the <b>spray</b> distribution gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle. When the setting pressure was increased, the <b>spray</b> volume increased and the peak radial position of the <b>spray</b> distribution gradually expanded toward outside, however the peak value of the <b>spray</b> distribution decreased a little...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide.

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the <b>spray</b> pattern {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern <b>sprays</b> out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat <b>spray,</b> tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the <b>spray</b> over the <b>spray</b> pattern. Flat <b>spray</b> patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical <b>spray</b> nozzles. This <b>spray</b> pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire <b>sprayed</b> surface. Non-tapered flat <b>spray</b> nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform <b>spray</b> pattern without any overlap in <b>spray</b> area.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the macroscopic <b>spray</b> characteristics of different 0 %– 100 % blends of biodiesel derived from drainage oil and diesel (BD 0, BD 20, BD 50, BD 80, BD 100), such as <b>spray</b> tip penetration, average tip velocity at penetration, <b>spray</b> angle, average <b>spray</b> angle, <b>spray</b> evolution process, <b>spray</b> area and <b>spray</b> volume under different injection pressures (60, 70, 80, 90, 100 MPa) and ambient pressures (0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 9 MPa) using a common rail system equipped with a constant volume chamber. The characteristic data was extracted from <b>spray</b> images grabbed by a high speed visualization system. The results showed that the ambient pressure and injection pressure had significant effects on the <b>spray</b> characteristics. As the ambient pressure increased, the <b>spray</b> angle increased, while the <b>spray</b> tip penetration and the peak of average tip velocity decreased. As the injection pressure increased, the <b>spray</b> tip penetration, <b>spray</b> angle, <b>spray</b> area and <b>spray</b> volume increased. The increasing blend ratio of biodiesel brought about a shorter <b>spray</b> tip penetration and a smaller <b>spray</b> angle compared with those of diesel. This is due to the comparatively higher viscosity and surface tension of biodiesel, which enhanced the friction effect between fuel and the injector nozzle surface and inhibited the breakup of the liquid jet...|$|R

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is <b>spraying</b> with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide.
