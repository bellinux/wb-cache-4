25|$|Hattie McDaniel earned {{that gold}} Oscar by her fine {{performance}} of 'Mammy' in Gone with the Wind. If you {{had seen her}} face when <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to the platform and took the gold trophy, {{you would have had}} the choke in your voice that all of us had when Hattie, hair trimmed with gardenias, face alight, and dress up to the queen's taste, accepted the honor in one of the finest speeches ever given on the Academy floor.|$|E
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> and down about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination {{is not to be}} baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E
500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the aisle.|$|E
5000|$|April Webster played Irina when <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to Sydney {{at the end}} of episode 1.22, [...] "Almost Thirty Years" ...|$|R

6000|$|The Lady: [...] "Well, that {{is exactly}} what I want. It ought to be {{something}} very tall and ethereal; something very, very pale, and yet with a sort of suffusion of color." [...] <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down the shop, looking at all the plants and flowers.|$|R
60|$|Berenice {{rose to her}} feet. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the little room restlessly.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to him {{naturally}} {{and spoke}} softly, and reached a hand for his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{with her}} hand still close to her side, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> and down the room with quick step.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no!' said Jane, 'when we {{were about}} old [...] "Russell," [...] we did not begin till nearly two, but since we have been reading this book, Lily will never let us rest till we begin; <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down, and hurries and worries and--' ...|$|R
50|$|After {{discovering}} {{a body in}} the back seat, Mira Holt drives the taxi she has borrowed for the evening to 918 West 35th Street. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> {{the front steps of}} the brownstone just as Archie Goodwin is walking down — having just told Nero Wolfe that he's quit.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the musical, Grizabella {{is chosen}} to go the Heaviside Layer. She does so by {{ascending}} on a flying tyre until she reaches a structure resembling clouds, into which she disappears, although in the film version of Cats she ascends with Old Deuteronomy and then <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> a giant metal hand to the Heaviside Layer.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{stopped at}} the door, but Lucy went in gently. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to her father's side, and stood there still.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Johnson {{accepted}} Philippa's {{hand and}} the inevitable. Her good-by to Lessingham was most affable. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the road with the vicar.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you going}} to do with {{yourself}} this morning?" [...] she asked, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the rocky path, with no arm to lean upon.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA. Gratitude! (Turning on him.) If you are {{incapable}} of gratitude you {{are incapable}} of any noble sentiment. Even animals are grateful. Oh, I see now exactly {{what you think of}} me! You were not surprised to hear me lie. To you it was something I probably did every day--every hour. That is how men think of women. (<b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> the room melodramatically.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ronin: Deirdre is seen on {{the stairs}} next to the café {{considering}} joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Bart Borghesi, and shows Alexa in an old house. In the beginning she is sat to a table singing the first verse, and <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to the band members with sheets over them, which she pulls off, and then starts performing the first chorus with them. Throughout the video she keeps catching sight of a mysterious man, and shots of her sat on the stairs performing with the band.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are not asleep yet,' muttered {{the witch}} to herself; and <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{and down in}} the passage, and then came back to the door, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> with Mr. May, {{and hardly}} noticed he was there. After supper, when James Houghton {{had gone up}} to count his pennies, Alvina said to Miss Pinnegar: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what is it, Myles?" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to him, {{and put her}} {{two hands}} on his shoulders, and looked up in his face--"what is your strange news?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Carey set {{her teeth}} hard. Then with a {{movement}} of her head she dismissed the maid. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> restlessly <b>up</b> and down the room. Then she stopped short with a hard little laugh.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun stood aloof {{looking at}} them with large dark eyes of resentment, {{suspended}} for a few moments. Then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> away <b>up</b> the hill, after the cattle, which had gathered in a little, spell-bound cluster higher up.|$|R
50|$|As {{the video}} begins, there's {{a little girl}} walking around an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where there are posters of The Saturdays on the wall (the posts are off the album, Chasing Lights cover). Then as the music starts, King appears to start the song off, walking down the catwalk, {{then the rest of}} the girls are behind her, then the band spent out. The little girl hears the sound of the girls singing and dancing, and <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> the stairs to see what the noise is, and spots the band singing and dancing.|$|R
60|$|A {{whirlwind}} of scorn seemed to sweep over her. She could keep still no longer. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{and down the}} little room. Her hands were clenched, her eyes flashing.|$|E
60|$|And unable, {{by reason}} of her indignation, to stand still any longer, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the road to meet the {{returning}} oxcart, whose wheels could be heard rumbling in the distance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} rapidly, tying her chip hat {{under her chin}} again. Then she stopped, and taking her chamois purse from her pocket, laid it sharply on the desk.|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 It {{would be much}} too {{dangerous}} to think about Crazy Helen. Even more so to look at her, but you can 2 ̆ 7 t help it. Your eyes just sort of drift in her direction every time <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> those steps, every time she breathes. She gets on the stop after me and for her half hour ride I can 2 ̆ 7 t help but stare. 2 ̆...|$|R
6000|$|At Bath Street {{she must}} {{dismount}} and change trams. She looked uphill. It seemed {{to lead to}} freedom. She remembered the many Saturday afternoons <b>she</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to the shops. How free and careless she had been! ...|$|R
60|$|My aunt {{rose from}} her chair. She {{astonished}} me. On all ordinary occasions the most retiring, the most feminine of women, <b>she</b> now <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to Captain Stanwick and looked him full in the face, without flinching for an instant.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to him, exotic yet familiar, {{with her}} white woman's face and {{shoulders}} above the Malay sarong, {{as if it}} were an airy disguise, but her expression was serious.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{left the}} office and I {{followed}} her. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr. Holmes, it was an undertaker's." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{clinging}} to the reluctant Hardy <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the path; farther back {{in the darkness of}} the room the unfortunate young gentleman saw the faces of Dr. Murchison and Mrs. Kingdom.|$|E
60|$|Cecily did not {{recognize}} him, yet there was something vaguely familiar about him. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> rapidly <b>up</b> to the house. In the sitting-room she found Lucy Ellen peering out between the muslin window curtains. When the latter turned there was an air of repressed excitement about her.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Gobelins, Perifel and Staphylas both {{received}} job offers from DreamWorks Animation. Looking {{back on their}} university's [...] "end-of-year jury day", Staphylas said, [...] "I was stressed because I knew {{that a lot of}} industry professionals would be there...I was in the corridor waiting for the announcement of my results and I see Shelley Page, the European representative of Dreamworks Animation. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to me and gives me her business card and tells me she'll call me tomorrow." [...] Within a year, Staphylas left for the United States. He would eventually be followed by Perifel, and since then, both have taken on senior positions at DreamWorks.|$|R
60|$|A bullet {{struck the}} dust {{a few inches}} from French's feet. Furious with rage, he found himself once more forced to resort to undignified antics. This time, however, Laura intervened. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> into the little circle and stood close to French's side, regardless of the levelled guns.|$|R
