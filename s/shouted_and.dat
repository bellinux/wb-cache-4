25|$|After Ceaușescu left, {{the crowds}} in Palace Square entered a celebratory mood, {{perhaps even more}} intense than in the other former Eastern Bloc {{countries}} because of the recent violence. People cried, <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to Christmas Day, which was a long suppressed holiday in Romania. The occupation of the Central Committee building continued.|$|E
25|$|One {{of their}} {{trademarks}} {{is the use}} of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> screamed above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements.|$|E
25|$|Peak {{claimed that}} {{he lowered his voice}} to {{disguise}} it. Alternately, in his February 4, 1971 deposition, he claimed to have <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> raised his voice to sound like he was excited. In that deposition, he also {{claimed that he}} gave the 911 operator an address on Pratt Street and that the operator asked him his home phone number. In the weeks after the bombing, Peak's brother was said to have identified the voice as Peak's.|$|E

25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then <b>shouted,</b> <b>and</b> {{that would be the end}} of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the group was called Grandpa. The other koledari {{gathered}} at his house {{on the eve of}} koleda, and at midnight they all went out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village they <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff in his hand and spun hemp fibers. The koledari teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the koleda. Some of them were called alosniks, the men possessed by the demon ala. There could have been other named characters in the group.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the red light of the Advance came into sight, Captain Gallant was the only man left alive. The vessel came within {{quarter of a mile}} of him, and he made one more desperate effort to attract attention. In his own words he <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> screeched without stopping, and within 20 minutes was picked up in an almost {{unconscious}} condition by the ship's boat. All his strength had vanished and the boat containing him was hauled up on board the schooner, and he was lifted into the captain's cabin where spirits were administered and his limbs were rubbed to restore the circulation of the blood. Spirits in very small quantities were given to him and the terrible thirst from which he was suffering was gradually allayed. Captain Gallant subsequently managed to obtain a few hours sleep, and upon awakening, although extremely weak from exhaustion and exposure, was able to relate the privations through which he had passed.|$|E
50|$|His vocal style {{consists}} of growls, hardcore <b>shouts</b> <b>and</b> aggressive screams. Kidman's vocal style has distinctly evolved over Meshuggah's career: Earlier Meshuggah albums like Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere showcase Kidman's aggressive <b>shouts</b> <b>and</b> growls. In later albums such as Nothing and Catch Thirtythree, feature Kidman's distinctively harsh screams.|$|R

25|$|The First Vienna Award led to {{worsening}} anti-Hungarian sentiments in Slovakia. Shortly {{after the}} award had been announced, János Esterházy, {{a leader of the}} Hungarian minority in Slovakia, proposed that Hungary return to Slovakia 1000km² of the territory that Hungary had received (predominantly Slovak lands between Šurany (Nagysurány) and Palárikovo (Tótmegyer)) in order to ensure long-term peaceful coexistence between the two nations. His proposal was not accepted by the Hungarian government. The obvious violation of the ethnic balance between the two countries' minorities that had repeatedly been endorsed years before by Hungary, as well as the short period between the award and a Hungarian attack against Slovakia in March 1939, caused the anti-Hungarian mood and social mobilizations against Hungarians to become a significant unifying element in Slovaks during World War II. Anti-Hungarian demonstrations were held on each anniversary of the award. During demonstrations, anti-Hungarian slogans were <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> Hungarian houses or cultural institutions were damaged. On the third anniversary, a mob furious because of the shooting of Slovaks by Hungarian police in Komját destroyed the Hungarian Cultural House.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{arose from}} the media and other {{politicians}} that Patel's home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering to leave the government. Patel's secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it as fodder for Patel's political enemies and political conflict in India. However, Nehru sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel's ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and asserted that after Gandhi's death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly endorsed Nehru's leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any notion that he sought to be prime minister. Though the two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs, they would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing {{on the issues of}} Hyderabad's integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel's counsel on sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People's Republic of China and on ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force. Nehru also tried to scuttle Patel's plan with regards to Hyderabad. During a meeting, according to the then civil servant MKK Nair in his book “With No Ill Feeling to Anybody”, Nehru <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> accused Patel of being a communalist. Patel also one on occasion called Nehru, a Maulana, for appeasing Muslims.|$|E

500|$|Stojanović {{visited the}} {{villages in the}} area, {{inspecting}} individual companies and platoons of the 1st Krajina Detachment. His visits were accompanied by parades of Partisan units and by mass gatherings. Partisan songs were sung, slogans were <b>shouted,</b> <b>and</b> banners were waved. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers and soldiers. He said that the Italian troops in the area were not protectors of the Serbs, but occupiers and enemies. He branded those who collaborated with the Italians as traitors to the Serbian people. Stojanović's speeches were not well received by some people, who spread rumours {{that he was not}} Mladen Stojanović, but a [...] "Turk" [...] (Muslim) impersonator. According to them, Stojanović had been killed by the Ustaše in August 1941 and the communists were using an impersonator to deceive the people. Few people gave credence to these rumours.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{a review}} of CCTV footage, the {{programme}} purports {{to demonstrate that the}} self-immolators donned fire-proof clothing and masks, and raises the question of why the participants' hair and the apparently gasoline-filled bottles they carried did not catch fire. Falun Gong sources also noted that the self-immolators' behaviour, the slogans they <b>shouted,</b> <b>and</b> their meditation postures were not consistent with the teachings or practices of Falun Gong. Furthermore, the program's frame-by-frame analysis of the CCTV footage purportedly shows that Liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to the head from a man in a military overcoat. The False Fire documentary described the death of 12-year-old Liu Siying as being under [...] "unusual circumstances", saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 March. Some Falun Gong sources argue that she may have been killed by the government as a way of guaranteeing her silence.|$|E

2500|$|Premier Barry O'Farrell {{announced}} the [...] "new, simpler Bail Act" [...] {{in a press}} release in November 2012. The Government did not adopt all of the recommendations made by Law Reform Commission. Different interpretations of the bail laws caused a rift between the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Greg Smith, and the Police Minister, Michael Gallacher. Australian Greens MLC David Shoebridge explained this as Smith wanting a [...] "more rational" [...] set of laws that removed complexity and unfairness, and Gallacher [...] "fighting the reforms". [...] Max Taylor, a former magistrate, characterised {{the change in the}} proposal to a risk-based approach as [...] "the police <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> the government trembled".|$|E

Such was his popularity that two medals were struck in celebration of his acquittal. [...] The government, however, declined to leave Lilburne at large. The jurymen were summoned before the Council of State, and the Council of State was ordered to secure Lilburne. On 28 August he was transferred from Newgate Prison to the Tower of London, and the Lieutenant of the Tower was instructed by parliament to refuse obedience to any writ of habeas corpus. On 16 March 1654, the Council ordered that he should be removed to Mount Orgueil Castle, Jersey. Colonel Robert Gibbon, the governor, complained that he gave more trouble than ten cavaliers.|$|E

Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table—'MOMMSEN!'—and the whole house rose. Rose and <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> stamped and clapped and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm! ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{killing of}} Catholic shop worker Philomena Hanna at a chemists near the Springfield Road on 28 April 1992, eyewitnesses {{reported}} that as McKeag and his driver sped {{back to the}} Shankill via Lanark Way they <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> sang his favourite song, 'Follow the Yellow Brick Road' from The Wizard of Oz. Other UDA members later confirmed that the Yellow Brick Road was McKeag's nickname for Lanark Way, a street linking the Shankill and Springfield roads and favoured by loyalist hitmen as an escape route from republican west Belfast. An attack on 14 November 1992, launched by McKeag, under the orders of Johnny Adair, on a branch of Sean Graham's bookmakers on the Oldpark Road left three Catholics dead {{and a number of}} others, including some Protestants who also frequented the betting shop, injured.|$|E
2500|$|As {{most of the}} {{customers}} tried to hide beneath tables and service booths, Huberty turned his attention toward six women and children huddled together. He first shot and killed 19-year-old María Colmenero-Silva with a single gunshot to the chest, then fatally shot 9-year-old Claudia Perez in the stomach, cheek, thigh, hip, leg, chest, back, armpit, and head with his Uzi. He then wounded Perez's 15-year-old sister Imelda once in the chest with the same weapon, and fired upon 11-year-old Aurora Peña with the shotgun. Peña—initially wounded in the leg—had been shielded by her pregnant aunt, 18-year-old Jackie Reyes. Huberty shot Reyes 48 times with the Uzi. [...] Beside his mother's body, 8-month-old Carlos Reyes sat up and wailed, whereupon Huberty <b>shouted</b> <b>and</b> killed the infant with a single pistol shot {{to the center of}} the back.|$|E
