40|$|The {{apoptosis}} regulator Bcl- 2 {{has been}} shown to modulate cell-cycle progression, favouring a quiescent state over a proliferative state, in both normal and tumour cells. We show here that constitutive expression of Bcl- 2 in human carcinoma cells results in a cell-cycle arrest that within a few days can become irreversible. Arrested cells acquire a senescent-like phenotype, which consists of several characteristic morphological alterations and increased activity of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. The induction of the premature <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> is mediated by inhibition of Cdk 2 kinase activity, and p 27 (KIP 1) is required to maintain the senescent phenotype. We propose that the ability to activate an endogenous premature <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> allows Bcl- 2 to suppress tumour growth. These results suggest that the down-regulation of Bcl- 2 expression, which has been observed during the development and progression of human carcinoma, is related to the ability of Bcl- 2 to severely hamper the growth of carcinoma cells and to induce a permanent cell-cycle arrest, with the features of senescence...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} {{is considered}} a major tumour-suppressor mechanism in mammals, and many oncogenic insults, such as the activation of the ras proto-oncogene, trigger initiation of the <b>senescence</b> <b>programme.</b> Although it was shown that activation of the <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> involves the up-regulation of cell-cycle regulators such as the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases p 16 INK 4 A and p 21 CIP- 1, the mechanisms underlying the senescence response remain to be resolved. In the case of stress-induced premature senescence, reactive oxygen species are considered important intermediates contributing to the phenotype. Moreover, distinct alterations of the cellular carbohydrate metabolism are known to contribute to oncogenic transformation, as is best documented for the phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis. These findings suggest that metabolic alterations are involved in tumourigenesis and tumour suppression; however, {{little is known about}} the metabolic pathways that contribute to these processes. Using the human fibroblast model of in vitro senescence, we analysed age-dependent changes in the cellular carbohydrate metabolism. Here we show that senescent fibroblasts enter into a metabolic imbalance, associated with a strong reduction in the levels of ribonucleotide triphosphates, including ATP, which are required for nucleotide biosynthesis and hence proliferation. ATP depletion in senescent fibroblasts is due to dysregulation of glycolytic enzymes, and finally leads to a drastic increase in cellular AMP, which is shown here to induce premature senescence. These results suggest that metabolic regulation plays an important role during cellular senescence and hence tumour suppression...|$|E
40|$|The p 16 INK 4 a-Rb tumour {{suppressor}} pathway {{is required}} for the initiation and maintenance of cellular senescence, a state of permanent growth arrest that acts as a natural barrier against cancer progression. Senescence can be overcome if the pathway is not fully engaged, and this may occur when p 16 INK 4 a is inactivated. p 16 INK 4 a is frequently altered in human cancer and germline mutations affecting p 16 INK 4 a have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. To characterize the functions of melanoma-associated p 16 INK 4 a mutations, in terms of promoting proliferative arrest and initiating senescence, we utilized an inducible expression system in a melanoma cell model. We show that wild-type p 16 INK 4 a promotes rapid cell cycle arrest that leads to a <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> characterized by the appearance of chromatin foci, activation of acidic Î²-galactosidase activity, p 53 independence and Rb dependence. Accumulation of wild-type p 16 INK 4 a also promoted cell enlargement and extensive vacuolization independent of Rb status. In contrast, the highly penetrant p 16 INK 4 a variants, R 24 P and A 36 P failed to arrest cell proliferation and did not initiate senescence. We also show that overexpression of CDK 4, or its homologue CDK 6, but not the downstream kinase, CDK 2, inhibited the ability of wild-type p 16 INK 4 a to promote cell cycle arrest and senescence. Our data provide the first evidence that p 16 INK 4 a can initiate a CDK 4 / 6 -dependent autonomous <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> that is disabled by inherited melanoma-associated mutations...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{well-established}} that primary human cells possess a limited proliferative capacity, undergoing an irreversible cell cycle arrest after a set number of population doublings known as replicative senescence. However, other <b>senescence</b> <b>programmes</b> {{can also be}} activated following exposure of cells to subcytotoxic oxidative stress and genotoxic stresses such as ionising radiation. Senescent cells have been linked through a multitude of studies to organismal ageing, and the dysfunction of these senescent cells can negatively affect tissue function through extracellular matrix remodelling and inflammatory protein secretion, resulting in the onset {{of a number of}} age-related diseases. Furthermore, it has been previously proposed that this release of inflammatory proteins, termed the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype, may be exacerbated by aberrations in the cellular stress response. The formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of RNA-binding proteins known as stress granules, which repress translation and modulate signalling pathways to promote cell survival, is a widely established response to cell stress. Stress granules are known to form more readily following stress in replicative senescent cells compared to in proliferating cells, but whether this is true of all <b>senescence</b> <b>programmes</b> remains unknown. Unexpectedly, this study demonstrates that prematurely senescent cells possess a far more limited granule-forming potential than both proliferating and replicative senescent cells, indicating that increased granule formation is not universal to all senescence phenotypes but differs between <b>senescence</b> <b>programmes.</b> In attempting to determine potential mechanisms through which this differential formation could be established it was further discovered that exposure of fibroblasts to X-ray irradiation did not induce the formation of stress granules, and that X-rays ablate the granule-forming capacity of these cells in the hours immediately following exposure. However, whist ultimately not conclusive, a subsequent investigation also suggested that the Wnt signalling pathway was likely not responsible for this loss of granule formation. This study has therefore discovered two novel circumstances in which stress granule formation is inhibited. Whilst the mechanisms through which this abrogation of stress granule assembly is brought about remain unknown, both of these scenarios occurred following exposure to X-ray irradiation, both in the short- and long-term. Considering a common response to X-ray exposure is the activation of apoptosis, it is possible that stress granule ablation is a response intended to push cells towards cell death over survival. However, further mechanistic studies are required to better elucidate the signalling pathways responsible for this alteration of granule formation before the functional consequences of this granule inhibition can be fully determined...|$|R

For example, PCD is a critical component of many vegetative and reproductive developmental processes, <b>senescence</b> <b>programmes,</b> pathogen defence mechanisms and stress responses. Cell destruction can manifest as apoptotic-like, necrotic or autophagic cell death and these processes are likely to overlap extensively, sharing several regulatory mechanisms. Several of the key PCD regulators and signals have now been revealed, for example, many cell organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles have been shown to have a role in controlling PCD activation. Following activation the actual dismantling of the cell appears to involve cell death proteases including those with caspase-like, or metacaspase, activity. This review will examine the current state of knowledge about the regulation of events during plant PCD. We will describe numerous examples of developmental or environmentally-induced deaths and outline their potential as models systems for use in PCD research programmes. Similarly, a range of techniques and in vitro model systems and {{that can be used to}} identify, and quantify, rates of plant PCD are reviewed. These model systems and techniques can be used to identify the underlying signals and events that drive and regulate PCD and ultimately reveal the steps necessary for the botanical dance of death...|$|R
40|$|Floral {{senescence}} {{does not}} follow the same pattern in all flowering species. Flowers can be broadly divided between those in which petals abscise while still turgid and those in which petals wilt and {{may or may not}} abscise. Furthermore, flower senescence can also be divided into a further two groups. In one group of species ethylene is produced by the flowers as the senescence progresses, and acts as a major regulator of this process. In another group ethylene is not produced, or only at very low levels and does not act as a major senescence regulator. Broadly most species that show rapid abscission without wilting are ethylene sensitive whereas those that wilt are generally ethylene insensitive, although the demarcations are not absolute. Many monocotyledonous flowers including lilies, as well as most Asteraceae are ethylene insensitive, while ethylene sensitive species include orchids, carnations petunia and Brassicaceae including Arabidopsis. Given these major differences it has been difficult to find a suitable model to study floral senescence. However new tools such as transcriptomic analyses are offering new approaches to investigate common and divergent regulatory mechanisms. In the obvious model, Arabidopsis, senescence proceeds rapidly and within 48 h petals are abscised with only moderate wilting. Some {{progress has been made in}} identifying genes regulating ethylene-regulated senescence in Arabidopsis flowers, and some of these genes may also regulate senescence progression in other ethylene sensitive species. Abscission signals also appear to be shared across different floral senescence groups. A comparison of two lily genotypes that have contrasting <b>senescence</b> <b>programmes</b> identified genes related to abscission previously identified in Arabidopsis. However the regulation of senescence in ethylene-insensitive species remains problematic. Recent transcriptomic studies in lily and other species reveal families of transcription factors that may be involved. A further complexity in floral senescence is offered by composite flowers.

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{a stable}} cell cycle arrest that limits {{the proliferation of}} pre-cancerous cells. Here we demonstrate that scaffold-attachment-factor A (SAFA) and the long noncoding RNA PANDA differentially interact with polycomb repressive complexes (PRC 1 and PRC 2) and the transcription factor NF-YA to either promote or suppress senescence. In proliferating cells, SAFA and PANDA recruit PRC complexes to repress the transcription of senescence-promoting genes. Conversely, the loss of SAFAâPANDAâPRC interactions allows expression of the <b>senescence</b> <b>programme.</b> Accordingly, we find that depleting either SAFA or PANDA in proliferating cells induces senescence. However, in senescent cells where PANDA sequesters transcription factor NF-YA and limits the expression of NF-YA-E 2 F-coregulated proliferation-promoting genes, PANDA depletion leads to an exit from senescence. Together, our results demonstrate that PANDA confines cells to their existing proliferative state and that modulating its level of expression can cause entry or exit from senescence...|$|E

To identify new genes controlling the <b>senescence</b> <b>programme,</b> we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen in primary human fibroblasts. We report that knockdown of the M-type receptor PLA 2 R (phospholipase A 2 receptor) prevents the onset of replicative senescence and diminishes stress-induced senescence. Interestingly, expression of PLA 2 R increases during replicative senescence, and its ectopic expression results in premature senescence. We show that PLA 2 R regulates senescence in a reactive oxygen species-DNA damage-p 53 -dependent manner. Taken together, our study identifies PLA 2 R as a potential new tumour suppressor gene crucial in the induction of cellular senescence through the activation of the p 53 pathway...|$|E

Commensurate with delayed <b>senescence,</b> fungicide <b>programmes,</b> particularly when including strobilurins, improved grain yield through improvements in both crop biomass and harvest index, although the relationship with green area duration of the flag leaf (GFLAD) depended on year and in some cases, cultivar. In all years fungicide treatments significantly increased the amount of nitrogen in the above-ground biomass, the amount of nitrogen in the grain and the nitrogen harvest index. All these effects could be linearly related to the fungicide effect on GFLAD. These relationships occasionally interacted with cultivar but {{there was no evidence that}} fungicide mode of action affected the relationship between GFLAD and yield of nitrogen in the grain. Fungicide treatments significantly reduced the amount of soil mineral N at harvest and when severe disease had been controlled, the net remobilization of N from the vegetation to the grain after anthesis. Fungicide maintained the filling of grain with both dry matter and nitrogen. The proportionate accumulation of nitrogen in the grain was later than that of dry matter and this difference was greater when fungicide had been applied. Effects of fungicide on grain protein concentration and its relationship with GFLAD were inconsistent over year and cultivar. There were several instances where grain protein concentration was unaffected despite large (1 (.) 5 t/ha) increases in grain yield following fungicide use. Dilution of grain protein concentration following fungicide use, when it did occur, was small compared with what would be predicted by adoption of other yield increasing techniques such as the selection of high yielding cultivars (based on currently available cultivars) or by growing wheat in favourable climates...|$|R

Although in vivo studies of senescence {{are in their}} infancy, evidence suggesting that senescent cells are a heterogeneous cell type is accumulating: senescence can be induced by different stressors, and senescent cells have varying degrees of genomic and epigenomic instability and different cell origins, contributing to their diversity. Two main classes of senescent cells have been identified: acute and chronic senescent cells. Acute senescent cells are generated during coordinated, beneficial biological processes characterized by a defined senescence trigger, transient senescent-cell signalling functions, and eventual senescent-cell clearance. In contrast, chronic senescent cells arise more slowly from cumulative, diverse stresses and are inefficiently eliminated, leading to their accumulation and deleterious effects through a secretory phenotype. Senescent cells {{have been identified in}} many tissues and organs, including the kidney. Here, we discuss the emerging roles of senescent cells in renal development, homeostasis, and pathology.

40|$|Cancer cells {{arise from}} normal cells through the {{acquisition}} {{of a series of}} mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Mouse models of human cancer often rely on germline alterations that activate or inactivate genes of interest. One limitation of this approach is that germline mutations might have effects other than somatic mutations, owing to developmental compensation. To model sporadic cancers associated with inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumour suppressor gene in humans, we have produced a conditional allele of the mouse Rb gene. We show here that acute loss of Rb in primary quiescent cells is sufficient for cell cycle entry and has phenotypic consequences different from germline loss of Rb function. This difference is explained in part by functional compensation by the Rb-related gene p 107. We also show that acute loss of Rb in senescent cells leads to reversal of the cellular <b>senescence</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus, the use of conditional knockout strategies might refine our understanding of gene function and help to model human cancer more accurately.

40|$|The {{majority}} of human colorectal cancers (CRCs) are initiated by mutations arising in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor gene. However, {{a new class}} of non-APC mutated CRCs has been defined that have a serrated histopathology and carry the (V 600 E) BRAF oncogene. Here we have investigated the pathogenesis of serrated CRCs by expressing (V 600 E) Braf in the proliferative cells of the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We show that the oncogene drives an initial burst of Mek-dependent proliferation, leading to the formation of hyperplastic crypts. This is associated with Î²-catenin nuclear localization by a mechanism involving Mapk/Erk kinase (Mek) -dependent, Akt-independent phosphorylation of Gsk 3 Î². However, hyperplastic crypts remain dormant for prolonged periods due to the induction of crypt senescence accompanied by upregulation of senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase and p 16 (Ink 4 a). We show that tumour progression is associated with down-regulation of p 16 (Ink 4 a) through enhanced CpG methylation of exon 1 and knockout of Cdkn 2 a confirms this gene is a barrier to tumour progression. Our studies identify (V 600 E) BRAF as an early genetic driver mutation in serrated CRCs and indicate that, unlike APC-mutated cancers, this subtype arises by the bypassing of a (V 600 E) Braf driven oncogene-induced <b>senescence</b> <b>programme.</b> 1383...|$|E

After transferring high CO 2 -grown shm 1 - 1 plants to ambient CO 2, the younger leaves remain photosynthetically active while developed leaves display increased yellowing and decreased FV/FM values. Metabolite analysis of plants transferred from high CO 2 to ambient air indicates a massive light-dependent (photorespiratory) accumulation of glycine, 2 -oxoglutarate (2 OG) and D- 2 -hydroxyglutarate (D- 2 HG). Amino acid markers of senescence accumulated in ambient air in wild-type and shm 1 - 1 plants maintained in darkness and also {{build up in}} shm 1 - 1 in the light. This, together with an enhanced transcription of the senescence marker SAG 12 in shm 1 - 1, suggests the initiation of senescence in shm 1 - 1 under photorespiratory conditions. Mitochondrial D- 2 HG dehydrogenase (D- 2 HGDH) converts D- 2 HG into 2 OG. In vitro studies indicate that 2 OG exerts competitive inhibition on D- 2 HGDH with a Ki of 1. 96 Â mm. 2 OG is therefore a suitable candidate as inhibitor of the in vivo D- 2 HGDH activity, as 2 OG is produced and accumulates in mitochondria. Inhibition of the D- 2 HGDH by 2 OG is likely a mechanism by which D- 2 HG accumulates in shm 1 - 1, however it cannot be ruled out that D- 2 HG may also accumulate due to an active <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> that is initiated in these plants after transfer to photorespiratory conditions.

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{a phenomenon}} characterised by stable and durable states of proliferative arrest induced by various stress stimuli. The abundance of senescent cells in tissues increases over a lifetime and, among other functions, they have been proposed to play {{a pivotal role in}} ageing. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a disease characterised by segmental premature ageing. It is caused by the expression of a persistently farnesylated lamin A isoform. Strikingly, HGPS patients show an increased abundance of senescent cells. Therefore the relationship between the farnesylated lamin A precursor, prelamin A, and senescence was studied in this thesis. Cellular models of ageing in human dermal fibroblasts were established. They relied on either replicative exhaustion or prelamin A accumulation. An unbiased genome-wide transcript analysis of the ageing models revealed that {{a significant part of the}} common <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> during cellular ageing can be replicated in young cells by accumulating prelamin A. The most prominent and overlapping expression changes were observed in pathways regulating inflammation, lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Six genes, identified as underexpressed consistently across the studied ageing models, were tested functionally in the context of senescence regulation by prelamin A. The ability of prelamin A-accumulating cells to induce inflammation has also been demonstrated by multiplexed detection of secreted cytokines, chemokines and other factors. This confirms that a significant overlap between replicative and prelamin A-induced senescence exists not only at mRNA level changes, but is also observed at the level of secreted proteins. Finally, nuclear morphology was studied in the ageing models, with a particular interest in the formation of a nucleoplasmic reticulum. We identified NOGO/Reticulon- 4 as a new protein involved in the process of NR formation, and also demonstrated that new NR channels require incorporation of newly synthesised lipid and protein components.

40|$|Abnormalities in the {{cellular}} <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> {{may contribute to}} premature ageing and cancer predisposition. Primary human cells have a limited proliferative capacity, entering a state of irreversible growth arrest/senescence arising from telomere attrition (replicative senescence). Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) can additionally limit cellular lifespan {{and there are several}} human genomic instability (Gl) disorderscancer-prone/premature ageing syndromesin which SIPS may prematurely limit cellular lifespan. The hypothesis is that increased Gl is a critical factor in limiting the lifespan of somatic cells by activating common pathways leading to SIPS. This study examines the extent to which Gl cells present restraints on cellular proliferation with a focus on {{the degree to which they}} share similar properties not least a common dependence on the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediated stress response pathway. The study utilised a panel of normal (N) and a Gl panel of fibroblasts comprising: Rothmund Thomson syndrome (RTS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Cockayne syndrome A (CSA), Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS), Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS), Werner syndrome (WS), Seckel syndrome (SS), Dyskeratosis Congenita (DKC) and Ligase 4 syndrome (LIG 4). The study revealed a commonality of response to p 38 inhibitorsâincreased clonogenicity and lifespanâfor normal and Gl syndrome cells, suggesting that all cells undergo some degree of p 38 -mediated proliferation restraint/SIPS. A degree of inter-strain heterogeneity for reduced replicative potential and/or altered morphology was apparent for both normal and Gl syndrome primary fibroblasts. This study revealed truncated lifespans for LIG 4, SS, HGPS, BS, RTS, DKC and NBS cells. GM 18366 (SS) and GM 07166 (NBS) cell strains show an altered morphology and increased p 38 inhibitor responses suggesting elevated SIPS operation. Growth and DNA damage studies using a newly created bank of hTert-immortalised cell strains AG 16409 (N), AG 18371 (RTS), GM 02548 (BS), GM 07166 (NBS), GM 01856 (CSA), AG 11498 (HGPS) and GM 17523 (LIG 4) showed that Gl syndrome cells, alleviated from the stress of telomere attrition, remain susceptible to SIPS. Of these RTS cells were hTert-immortalised for the first time, showing that senescence in these strains is telomere-dependent. Cell cycle analysis revealed a common p 38 - associated mechanism that limits retention in cycle. The specific p 38 inhibitor BIRB 796 was found to increase clonogenic potential of both normal and Gl syndrome cells. The findings suggest that both RTS and WS cells show a higher proportion of cells that are non-dividing. Furthermore, the study suggests that WS cells have an altered cell cycle transit time that is reduced by BIRB 796 treatment. Overall, the study highlights successful single cell analysis approaches for testing the impact of p 38 inhibitors by teasing out the nature of cellular heterogeneity arising from different sources for specific cell strains. These findings support and expand previous evidence that WS cells undergo higher levels of SIPS compared to normal cells and provide new evidence that RTS cells may also show an increased propensity for SIPS...|$|E
40|$|All {{cells are}} {{equipped}} to sense {{changes in their}} environment and make adaptive responses according to the stimuli. Signal recognition usually occurs at the cell membrane (with the exception of steroid signalling) where the ligand, {{which can be a}} small molecule, a peptide or a protein, binds its cognate receptor. This results in a change in the conformation of the receptor which in turn can regulate the production of second messengers. Second messengers can now modulate specific pathways which control gene expression and modify various aspects of cell behaviour. The signalling cascade is terminated by the removal of second messenger and/or by desensitisation of the receptor to the extracellular signal. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was first identified in the rat urine and since then has emerged as an important second messenger regulating diverse cell processes. Subsequent to its discovery in mammalian cells, enzymes responsible for its synthesis (guanylyl cyclases), hydrolysis (phosphodiesterases) and its most common effectors (cGMP-dependent protein kinases) were identified. Guanylyl cyclases exist in two forms, cytosolic and membrane bound. Both have a conserved guanylyl cyclase domain, but differ in their choice of ligands, overall structure and tissue localization. It is now known that cytosolic and the membrane-bound forms are involved in eliciting distinct cellular responses. Receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) was identified as the target for a family of heat-stable enterotoxin toxins (ST) produced by enterotoxigenic E. coli. Stable toxin-mediated diarrhoeas are observed frequently in infants and contribute significantly to the incidence of Travellersâ Diarrhea. Early studies demonstrated that the effects of ST were mediated by an increase in intracellular cGMP levels in intestinal cells, and the receptor for ST was almost exclusively expressed in the apical microvilli of the intestinal brush-border epithelia. Effectors of cGMP in intestinal cells include protein kinase G (PKG), cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel 3 (CNG), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). ST is an exogenous ligand which serves as a hyperagonist for GC-C, in comparison with the endogenous ligands guanylin and uroguanylin, which maintain fluid-ion homeostasis in the intestinal epithelia. The GC-C/cGMP signal transduction pathway also modulates intestinal cell proliferation along the crypt-villus axis by exerting a cytostatic effect on the epithelial cells, thereby regulating their turnover and neoplastic transformation. The current study describes in molecular detail two signalling pathways, one impinging on and one emerging from GC-C, which regulate colonic cell proliferation. The first part identifies the cross-talk and cross-regulation of GC-C and c-src. The second part delves into the molecular basis of GC-C/cGMP-mediated cytostasis and its effect on colonic tumorigenesis. Cross-talk between signalling pathways is believed to {{play a key role in}} regulating cell physiology. Phosphorylation of signalling molecules by protein kinases is frequently used as a means of achieving this cross-regulation. Aberrant hyperactivation of the c-src tyrosine kinase is an early event in the progression of colorectal cancer, and activated c-src specifically phosphorylates a number of proteins in the cell. It was found that c-src can phosphorylate GC-C in T 84 colorectal carcinoma cells, as well as in the rat intestinal epithelia. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-C resulted in attenuation of ligand-mediated cGMP production; an effect which was reversed by chemical or transcriptional knockdown of c-src. These effects were found to be cell line-independent and relied only on the extent of c-src expression and activation in the cell. Mutational analysis revealed GC-C to be phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine residue (Y 820) in the guanylyl cyclase domain. The sequence of GC-C around Y 820 allowed for efficient phosphorylation by c-src, and indeed, kinase assays indicated that the affinity of c-src for the GC-C Y 820 peptide was one of the highest reported till date. A phospho-mimetic mutation at this site, which mimics a constitutively phosphorylated receptor, resulted in a sharp reduction of guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor, reiterating the inhibitory role of Y 820 phosphorylation on GC-C activity. Phosphorylation of GC-C at Y 820 generated a docking site for the SH 2 domain of c-src which could interact and thereby co-localize with GC-C on the cell membrane. Intriguingly, this interaction resulted in activation of c-src, setting-up a feed-forward loop of inhibitory GC-C phosphorylation and c-src activation. Treatment of colorectal carcinoma cells with ligands for GC-C reduces cell proliferation and inhibits tumorigenesis. It was observed that this cytostatic effect can be modulated by the status of c-src activation, and consequently, the fraction of tyrosine phosphorylated GC-C in these cells. Since activation of c-src is a frequent event in intestinal neoplasia, phosphorylation of GC-C by active c-src may be one of the means by which the cytostatic effects of GC-C agonists (guanylin and uroguanylin) in the intestine are bypassed, thereby leading to cancer progression. Colonisation of the gut with enteropathogenic microorganisms induces secretion of IFNÎ³ from the host mucosal immune system, which subsequently activates c-src in intestinal epithelial cells. Ligand-stimulated activity of GC-C was found to be reduced in IFNÎ³ treated cells. This could be one of the host defence mechanisms initiated in response to enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. These results provide the first evidence of cross-talk between a receptor guanylyl cyclase and a tyrosine kinase that results in heterologous desensitisation of the receptor. Populations with a higher incidence of enterotoxigenic E. coli infections appear to be protected from intestinal neoplasia. It was found that mice lacking GC-C, and therefore unable to respond to ST, displayed an increased cell proliferation in colonic crypts and enhanced carcinogen-induced aberrant crypt foci formation, which is a surrogate marker for colorectal carcinogenesis. However, pharmacological elevation of cGMP was able to efficiently induce cytostasis even in GC-C knockout mice, indicating a key role for cGMP in regulating colonic cell proliferation. Through microarray analyses, genes regulated by ST-induced GC-C activation in T 84 colorectal carcinoma cells were identified. Genes involved in a number of cellular pathways were differentially expressed, including those involved in signal transduction, protein and solute secretion, transcriptional regulation and extracellular matrix formation. One of the genes found to be significantly up-regulated was the cell-cycle inhibitor, p 21. The increase in p 21 expression was validated at both the transcript and protein level. This p 53 -independent up-regulation of p 21 was coupled to the activation of the cGMP-responsive kinase, PKGII, since knockdown of PKGII using specific siRNAs abolished ST-induced p 21 induction. Activation of PKGII led to phosphorylation and activation of the stress responsive p 38 MAPK. Similar to what was seen following knockdown of PKGII, inhibition of p 38 MAPK activity attenuated the up-regulation of p 21 in response to cGMP, indicating that PKGII and p 38 MAPK could be a part of a pathway regulating p 21 expression. It was found that active p 38 MAPK phosphorylated the ubiquitous transcription factor SP 1, enhancing its occupancy at the proximal p 21 promoter. Therefore, SP 1 could be one of the factors linking cGMP to transcription of the p 21 mRNA. Chronic activation of GC-C led to nuclear accumulation of p 21 in colonic cells, which entered a quiescent state. These cells arrested in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, consequent to p 21 -dependent inhibition of the G 1 cyclin-CDK complexes. A fraction of these quiescent cells stochastically initiated a cGMP-dependent <b>senescence</b> <b>programme</b> and displayed all the hallmarks of senescent cells, including flattened cell morphology, expression of SA-ï¢ galactosidase and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Activation of senescence and loss of tumorigenicity in these cells was crucially dependent on the up-regulation of p 21. This irreversible exit from the cell cycle due to cGMP-mediated activation of the PKGII/p 38 /p 21 axis was well correlated with reduced colonic polyp formation in mice exposed to ST. In summary, these observations may provide a possible explanation for the low incidence of colorectal carcinoma seen in countries with a high incidence of ST-mediated diarrhoea. Interestingly, c-src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GC-C prevented p 21 accumulation following ligand application. The findings described in this thesis may have important implications in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression and treatment of colorectal cancer...|$|E
