The series, which was {{being developed by}} Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. executive producer Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, {{would be based on}} storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively. By May 7, 2015, when ABC announced their series renewals and cancellations, and new series pickups, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>spinoff</b> was passed on.|$|E

40|$|Using a 50 percent {{sample of}} all establishments in the German private sector, {{we report that}} <b>spinoffs</b> are larger and {{initially}} employ more skilled and more experienced workers than other startups. Controlling for these and other differences, we find that <b>spinoffs</b> {{are less likely to}} exit than other startups. We show that in West and East Germany and in all sectors investigated pulled <b>spinoffs</b> (where the parent company continues after they are founded) generally have the lowest exit hazards, followed by pushed <b>spinoffs</b> (where the parent company stops operations). The difference between both types of <b>spinoffs</b> is particularly pronounced in the first three years. Contrary to expectations, intra-industry <b>spinoffs</b> are not found to have lower exit hazards in our sample...|$|R
40|$|University <b>spinoffs</b> in Japan only {{started to}} gain {{momentum}} {{in the latter half}} of the 1990 s. While there were only approximately 30 startup companies in 1990, this number soared to 1, 800 in 2008 (Japan Economic Research Institute, 2009). Supporting policies such as the "Hiranuma Plan" have assisted in the setting-up of over 1, 000 university <b>spinoffs</b> in the 3 years since 2001. However, university <b>spinoffs</b> in Japan have appeared to reach a tipping point {{in the latter half of}} 2000. The number of university <b>spinoffs</b> that have closed or become bankrupt has increased to the point that they surpass the number of newly-founded companies. Observations of yearly transitions show that the number of university <b>spinoffs</b> that reach IPO status have plateaued, and are in fact in a decreasing trend (Venture Enterprise Center, 2009). Furthermore, even among the university <b>spinoffs</b> that reach the IPO stage, there are many companies that experience sudden drops in stock prices immediately following IPO. It is therefore extremely rare for university <b>spinoffs</b> in Japan to mature in the same manner as those in the U. S., such as Global Enterprise. The increase in the number of university <b>spinoffs</b> being founded fulfills policy objectives; however, from the perspective of the subsequent maturation and development of these companies, there appears to be a wall deterring the success of Japan’s university <b>spinoffs.</b> In this study, a questionnaire survey was used targeting university <b>spinoffs</b> from Japan, and to a certain extent the U. K. and the U. S., in order to elucidate the main managerial challenges faced by Japanese university spinoffs: including "finding customers", "raising finances", "recruiting", and "utilizing external resources". In addition, I characterize the implications of these findings to the management of Japan’s university <b>spinoffs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Performance-based {{research}} funding {{systems in the}} European Union include a number of established <b>spinoffs</b> among the measures of universities’ third mission. Through a longitudinal study on the establishment of 1, 254 <b>spinoffs</b> during 1999 – 2015 from 85 Italian state universities, {{we find that the}} introduction of such a policy increased the number of academic <b>spinoffs.</b> However, the rate of creation of academic <b>spinoffs</b> increased in regions with higher skilled unemployment and in universities with fewer academic career opportunities, rather than in more research-oriented or more prestigious universities. These results cast doubt on the appropriateness of measures based on the sheer number of academic <b>spinoffs</b> in evaluating the third mission of universities...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the role that {{universities}} can play in contributing to the development of <b>spinoffs.</b> The characterizing element is the link <b>spinoffs</b> have with universities. The link is not limited only to the incubation phases, but continues through the whole life cycle of <b>spinoffs,</b> facilitating their development and survival. This link was analyzed in <b>spinoffs</b> generated by Italian universities and financed by the Italian law on industrial research. The article provides conceptual arguments, and both primary and secondary empirical evidence. The results obtained from the overall analyses, allow us to confirm that the link with universities is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for the consolidation of <b>spinoffs.</b> Finally, the article presents limits and possible implications for future research...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{comprehensive}} linked employer-employee database from Brazil {{for the period}} 1995 - 2001, we are able {{for the first time}} to compare firms founded as employee <b>spinoffs</b> to new firms without parents and to diversification ventures of existing firms entering a new industry. Employee <b>spinoffs</b> are defined either as the director/manager having moved from a parent in the same industry or as one-quarter of the employees having shifted from a common parent. Depending on definition, employee <b>spinoffs</b> account for between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil’s private sector during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for employee <b>spinoffs</b> than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, exit rates for employee <b>spinoffs</b> are less than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms. These results suggest that we can think of some part of a firm’s productivity draw in the Jovanovic (1982) model as embodied in the firm’s employees and portable by them to a new firm. ...|$|R
