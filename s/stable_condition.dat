40|$|In the 1990 s, {{scientists}} at European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggested that artificially enhancing turbulent diffusion in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> improves {{the representation of}} two important aspects of weather forecasts, i. e., near-surface temperatures and synoptic cyclones. Since then, this practice has often been used for tuning the large-scale performance of operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, although it is widely recognized to be detrimental for an accurate representation of stable boundary layers. Here we investigate why, 20 years on, such a compromise is still needed in the ECMWF model. We find that reduced turbulent diffusion in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> improves the representation of winds in stable boundary layers, but it deteriorates the large-scale flow and the near-surface temperatures. This suggests that enhanced diffusion is still needed to compensate for errors caused by other poorly represented processes. Among these, we identify the orographic drag, which influences the large-scale flow {{in a similar way}} to the turbulence closure for <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, which partially controls the near-surface temperatures. We also {{take a closer look at}} the relationship between the turbulence closure in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> and the large-scale flow, which was not investigated in detail with a global NWP model. We demonstrate that the turbulent diffusion in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> affects the large-scale flow by modulating not only the strength of synoptic cyclones and anticyclones, but also the amplitude of the planetary-scale standing waves...|$|R

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} (LES) {{are used}} to investigate the effect of stable stratification on rural-to-urban roughness transitions. Smooth-wall turbulent boundary layers are subjected to a generic urban roughness consisting of cubes in an in-line arrangement. Two line sources of pollutant are added to investigate the effect on pollutant dispersion. Firstly, the LES method is validated with data from wind-tunnel experiments on fully-developed flow over cubical roughness. Good agreement is found for the vertical profiles of the mean streamwise velocity component and mean Reynolds stress. Subsequently, roughness transition simulations are done for both neutral and <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> Results are compared with fully-developed simulations with conventional double-periodic boundary <b>conditions.</b> In <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{at the end of}} the domain the streamwise velocity component has not yet reached the fully-developed state even though the surface forces are nearly constant. Moreover, the internal boundary layer is shallower than in the neutral case. Furthermore, an investigation of the turbulence kinetic energy budget shows that the buoyancy destruction term is reduced in the internal boundary layer, above which it is equal to the undisturbed (smooth wall) value. In addition, in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> pollutants emitted above the urban canopy enter the canopy farther downstream due to decreased vertical mixing. Pollutants emitted below the top of the urban canopy are 85 % higher in concentration in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> mostly due to decreased advection.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] variation of the sea surface sensible heat flux is investigated using data from the Gulf of Tehuantepec Experiment (GOTEX) and from eight additional aircraft datasets representing a variety of surface conditions. This analysis focuses on near-neutral conditions because these conditions are common over the sea and are normally neglected, partly because of uncertain reliability of measurements of the small air–sea temperature difference. For all of the datasets, upward heat flux is observed for slightly <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> The frequency of this “countergradient” heat flux increases with increasing wind speed and is possibly related to sea spray or microscale variations of surface temperature on the wave scale. Upward area-averaged sensible heat flux for slightly <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> can also be generated by mesoscale heterogeneity of the sea surface temperature (SST). Significant measurement errors cannot be ruled out. The countergradient heat flux for weakly <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> is least systematic for weaker winds, even though it occurs with weak winds in all of the datasets. In an effort to reduce offset errors and different SST processing and calibration procedures among field programs, the authors adjusted the SST in each field program to minimize the countergradient flux for weak winds. With or without this adjustment for the combined dataset, the extent of the upward heat flux for weakly <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> increases with increasing wind speed...|$|R

40|$|Near-neutral {{atmospheric}} stability conditions {{form the basis}} for wind turbine design. This is surprising since such near-neutral conditions occur in so-called transition periods only twice each day (around sunrise and sunset). Unstable conditions occur during the day and <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> occur generally at night. During nighttime <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> turbulence is typically generated by shear and destroyed by negative buoyancy. Wind shear (both magnitude and direction) under <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> is much larger in comparison to that during neutral <b>conditions.</b> Moreover, <b>stable</b> boundary layer (SBL) flows are often accompanied by low-level jets (LLJs); these LLJs can be low enough to impact today’s large utility-scale turbines and thus influence loads. This study compares turbulence, turbine loads, and accumulated fatigue damage for a utility-scale wind turbine in stable versus neutral atmospheric conditions. Our focus is on the varying simulated atmospheric flows that result from (i) different surface cooling rates (which control buoyancy destruction); and (ii) different geostrophic winds (which control shear generation). Inflow turbulence time series are generated and applied over the rotor plane of a 90 -meter hub-height 5 MW wind turbine based on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) with refined dynamic sub-grid scale modeling; similarly, neutral boundary layer flows are generated using conventional Fourier techniques for comparison. These simulated wind velocity fields are then fed into an aeroelastic model of the selected wind turbine and turbine fatigue loads are analyzed. Some differences are seen between fatigue loads resulting from neutral versus <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> but these are not significant especially when missing high-frequency content in the inflow turbulence from LES-generated flows is augmented by fractal interpolation.

40|$|At {{present a}} variety of boundary-layer schemes is in use in {{numerical}} models and often a large variation of model results is found. This is clear from model intercomparisons, such as organized within the GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). In this paper we analyze how the specification of the land-surface temperature affects {{the results of a}} boundary-layer scheme, in particular for <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> As such we use a well established column model of the boundary layer and we vary relevant parameters in the turbulence scheme for <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> By doing so, we can reproduce the outcome for {{a variety of}} boundary-layer models. This is illustrated with the original set-up of the second GABLS intercomparison study using prescribed geostrophic winds and land-surface temperatures as inspired by (but not identical to) observations of CASES- 99 for a period of more than two diurnal cycles. The model runs are repeated using a surface temperature that is calculated with a simple land-surface scheme. In the latter case, it is found that the range of model results in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> is reduced for the sensible heat fluxes, and the profiles of potential temperature and wind speed. However, in the latter case the modelled surface temperatures are rather different than with the original set-up, which also impacts on near-surface air temperature and wind speed. As such it appears that the model results in <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> are strongly influenced by non-linear feedbacks in which the magnitude of the geostrophic wind speed and the related land-surface temperature play an important role...|$|R

40|$|A {{disconnect}} {{remains between}} our improved physical understanding of boundary layers stabilized by buoyancy {{and how we}} parameterize them in coarse atmospheric models. Most operational climate models require excessive turbulence mixing in such conditions to prevent decoupling of the atmospheric component from the land component, but the performance of such a model {{is unlikely to be}} satisfactory under weakly and moderately <b>stable</b> <b>conditions.</b> Using large-eddy simulation, we revisit some of the basic challenges in parameterizing stable atmospheric boundary layers: eddy-viscosity closure is found to be more reliable under <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> due to an improved alignment of vertical Reynolds stresses and mean strains under <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> but the dependence of the magnitude of the eddy viscosity on stability is not well represented by several models tested here. Thus, we propose a new closure that reproduces the different stability regimes better.

40|$|A large {{aperture}} scintillometer (LAS) {{observes the}} intensity of the atmospheric turbulence across large distances, which is related to the path-averaged sensible heat flux H. In this paper, two problems in the derivation of continuous series of H from LAS data are investigated and the importance of nighttime H fluxes is assessed. First, as an LAS is unable to determine the sign of H, the transition from unstable to <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> is evaluated in order to make continuous H series. Therefore, different algorithms to judge the atmospheric stability for an LAS installed over a distance of 9. 5 km have been tested. The diurnal cycle of the refractive index structure parameter, C-N(2), results in the best suitable, operational algorithm. A second issue is the humidity correction for LAS data, which is performed by using the Bowen ratio (beta). As beta is taken from ground-based measurements with data gaps, the number of resulting H values is reduced. Not including this humidity correction results in a marginal error in H, but increases the completeness of the H series. Applying these conclusions to the 2 -yr time series of the LAS results in an almost-continuous H time series. As the majority of the time steps {{has been found to be}} under <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> there is a clear impact of H-stable on H- 24 h-the 24 -h average of H. For <b>stable</b> <b>conditions,</b> H-stable values are mostly negative, and hence lower than the H - 0 W m(- 2) assumption as mostly adopted. For months where <b>stable</b> <b>conditions</b> prevail (winter), H- 24 h is overestimated using this assumption, and calculation of H-stable is recommended...|$|R
