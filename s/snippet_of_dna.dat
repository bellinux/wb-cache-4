These snippets are used by the bacterium to detect and destroy DNA from further attacks by similar viruses. These sequences {{play a key role}} in a bacterial defence system, and form the basis of a genome editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9 that allows permanent modification of genes within organisms.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the task of}} detecting regulatory elements in the human genome directly from raw DNA. Past work has focused on small <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{making it difficult to}} model long-distance dependencies that arise from DNA's 3 -dimensional conformation. In order to study long-distance dependencies, we develop and release a novel dataset for a larger-context modeling task. Using this new data set we model long-distance interactions using dilated convolutional neural networks, and compare them to standard convolutions and recurrent neural networks. We show that dilated convolutions are effective at modeling the locations of regulatory markers in the human genome, such as transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites.

40|$|The {{instructions}} for generating and sustaining all lifeforms are encoded within each life formâ€™s genome. A major {{challenge in the}} postgenomic sequencing era has been assigning functions {{to the hundreds of}} thousands of noncod-ing sequence elements within our nuclear genome that are homologous to sequences in other species. These <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> have been hypothesized to impart information for initiating DNA replication, for inter- and intrachromosomal recombination, for structural integration of the genome into the surrounding nucleoskeleton, and for transcriptional regu-lation of gene expression. The latter regulatory elements have been of particular interest inasmuch as variations among our own species, and to some extent between species, are thought largely to be a function of differences in the timing, duration, and intensity of gene expression. Moreover, the explosive rise in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studie...|$|R

Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, {{and the presence of}} inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline, but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields. In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small <b>snippets</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> enabled researchers taking part in the Census of Marine Life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species. Dr. Mitchell Sogin from the Marine Biological Laboratory feels that [...] "the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million." ...|$|R
