5000|$|Transylvanian rugs with {{a prayer}} rug design are {{characterized}} by a single red niche, white spandrels with a waving curvilinear floral stem bearing various kinds of flowers and flowerbuds, and ochre yellow borders with curvilinear patterns. The fields are usually ochre, sometimes red. It is almost always empty of additional ornaments, {{with the exception of}} <b>small</b> <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments</b> close to the edge or in place of a mosque lamp {{at the top of the}} niche. The niche itself shows design types also known from Ottoman prayer rugs from Anatolia: the [...] "head and shoulder" [...] design, high or low point of the arch, and with serrated or stepped outlines. The similarities of the design with their Anatolian counterparts has led to the attribution of specific Transylvanian carpets to more specific Anatolian proveniences like Ghiordes or Melas. The design is related to the Ottoman court prayer rugs of the second half of the sixteenth century. A carpet of this type is depicted in Pieter de Hoochs 1663 painting [...] "Portrait of a family making music".|$|R
5000|$|A smaller {{group of}} the double-niche type has {{at both ends of}} the field a niche, or arch-like form, which is formed by two {{separate}} corner medallions. The medallion corners are decorated with interlacing arabesques resembling similar design types known from [...] "double niche" [...] Ushak carpets, but with a slightly stiffer design. The majority of Transylvanian double-niche rugs are characterized by more heavily stylized corner pieces which are best described as spandrels to a niche, as the separation of the two corner medallions is no longer visible. In the center of these spandrels often stands a larger, plain rosette, while the remaining space is filled with rather crude ornaments. Their field sometimes shows two pairs of vases with undulating motifs in opposing colours. The field is decorated with <b>small</b> <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments,</b> which are drawn in an elaborate, curvilinear manner in earlier examples, and become more stiff and schematic in later pieces. The design is always symmetrically arranged towards the vertical axis. Double-niche Transylvanian carpets with a central medallion sometimes have a medallion design which closely resembles those seen in Ushak rugs. In other, probably later examples, the field decor is condensed into medallions of concentric lozenges and rows of eight-petalled flowers connected by projecting stems of curled leaves. Often central medallions of this type contain a central cruciform ornament. The ground colour is yellow, red, or dark blue.|$|R
40|$|Bronze {{artefacts}} {{from the}} Samon Valley (circa 19 - 22 º N, 95 - 97 ºE) in central Myanmar are strikingly similar to pieces from Lijiashan, 80 km south of Kunming, Yunnan. The affini-ties to Lijiashan {{are greater than}} those to the larger and more renowned cemetery of Shizhaishan. The dates of the Samon Culture overlap with the earlier Dian cemeteries. Most of the Samon finds are not found outside Myanmar, such as <b>small</b> wire packets, <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments</b> and 'mother-goddess' figures. The Samon Valley and Upper Myanmar may be the areas referred to in Chinese texts as beyond the „barbarian‟ regions that came under Han control in the early centuries CE. And, as seen in Yunnan at this time, the Samon Culture may have experienced political change reflecting Han expansion and fluctuating alliances between Myanmar, Yunnan, and South Asia...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the middle}} of the 15th century onwards, a type of carpets was {{produced}} in Egypt which is characterized by a dominant central medallion, or three to five medallions in a row along the vertical axis. Numerous smaller ornaments are placed around the medallions, such as eight-pointed stars, or small ornaments composed of stylized floral elements. The innumerable <b>small</b> geometric and <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments</b> give a kaleidoscopic impression. Sixty of these carpets were given to the English cardinal Thomas Wolsey in exchange for a license for Venetian merchants to import wine to England. The earliest known painting representing a Mamluk carpet is Giovanni Bellinis [...] "Portrait of the Doge of Venice Loredan and his four advisers" [...] from 1507. A French master depicted [...] "The Three De Coligny brothers" [...] in 1555. Another representation can be found on Ambrosius Frankens [...] "The Last Supper", about 1570. The large medallion is depicted {{in a way that it}} forms the nimbus of the head of Christ. The characteristic mamluk carpet ornaments are clearly visible. Ydema has documented a total of 16 dateable representations of Mamluk carpets.|$|R

5000|$|Napes (Lesbos): An Aeolic temple {{probably}} of Apollo Napaios {{was built}} in the 7th century B.C. Some special capitals with <b>floral</b> <b>ornament</b> have been found, which are called Aeolic, and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a common loft building in construction and plan, but its facade departs dramatically from others of its type. An open exterior, using cast iron mullions rather than masonry piers in the central bay, and Sullivan's stylized <b>floral</b> <b>ornament</b> provide distinction.|$|R
50|$|The church {{entrance}} is west. Above the wooden front door {{there is a}} rose window decorated with <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments</b> and a dove. The facade is divided by pilasters and arches of a more intense yellow of Corinth {{that the rest of}} the structure.|$|R

25|$|The first {{ornamental}} murals in {{the cathedral}} appeared in the same period, starting with <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments</b> inside the new galleries; the towers retained their original brickwork pattern.

50|$|Rather poorly-done <b>floral</b> <b>ornament,</b> in-painted {{around the}} figures of John and Jesus, {{dates back to the}} same late time. As for St. John's staff-like cross and {{cartouche}} on the earth at the foreground (probably with the typical inscription Ecce Agnus Dei), those attributes have been closed. The artist considered them redundant {{in the presence of the}} Lamb.|$|R
50|$|The cornice had dentils and beam type modillions (one of {{the first}} {{examples}} ever in Roman temple architecture) and undersides decorated with narrow rectangular panels carrying flowers, roses, disks, laurel crowns and pine-cones. Remnants of the decorations, including elements of a Victory representation and <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments,</b> are visible on site or in the Forum Museum (Antiquarium Forense).|$|R

The second great {{discovery}} of the Middle Ages in <b>floral</b> <b>ornament,</b> was that, in order completely to express the law of subordination among the leaf-ribs, two ribs were necessary, and no more, {{on each side of}} the leaf, forming a series of three with the central one, because proportion is between three terms at least.|$|R
60|$|To {{come back}} to our statue. You will observe that the {{arrangement}} of this sculpture {{is exactly the same}} as at Chartres--severe falling drapery, set off by rich <b>floral</b> <b>ornament</b> at the side; but the statue is now completely animated: it is no longer fixed as an upright pillar, but bends aside out of its niche, and the <b>floral</b> <b>ornament,</b> instead of being a conventional wreath, is of exquisitely arranged hawthorn. The work, however, as a whole, though perfectly characteristic of the advance of the age in style and purpose, is in some subtler qualities inferior to that of Chartres. The individual sculptor, though trained in a more advanced school, has been himself a man of inferior order of mind compared to the one who worked at Chartres. But I have not time to point out to you the subtler characters by which I know this.|$|R
50|$|Islamic {{buildings}} in Bukhara in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated <b>floral</b> <b>ornaments.</b> In South Asia monuments and shrines adorned with Kashi tile work from Persia became a distinct {{feature of the}} shrines of Multan and Sindh. The Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore stands out {{as one of the}} masterpieces of Kashi time work from the Mughal period.|$|R
