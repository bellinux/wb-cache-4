40|$|Actual <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> among {{immigrant}} youth {{has been}} {{addressed in a}} number of studies, but research on hidden <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> among immigrant students is rare. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze hidden <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> among primary <b>school</b> students with an immigrant background. The analyses were performed using survey data of 1186 immigrant students in Swiss primary schools. Our results show that immigrant students’ academic achievement, their attitudes towards school-related values, and the quality of their relationships with classmates and teachers were significant predictors of their disengagement during classes. Moreover, our findings strongly suggest that those predictors that are important for actual <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> are crucial for hidden <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> as well. We conclude that low-achieving immigrant youth who do not value school and who have poor relationships with teachers and peers are especially at risk of hidden and, eventually, of actual <b>school</b> <b>dropout...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at the available research associated with high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> and specifically the relationship between athletic participation and high <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine several aspects associated with high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> and its relationship with athletic participation. The study focused on the following areas: current theories pertaining to high <b>school</b> <b>dropout,</b> the prevalence rates of high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> in the United States, the antecedents associated with the decision to withdraw from high school, the consequences ofdropping out ofhigh school, and the effects of athletic participation on high <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> A review of the existing research found that athletic participation has a positive intervening effect that addresses the high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> issue. Participation in athletics provides a student with a positive and voluntary connection to the school and also offers access to an established social group within the school. The research indicated that this decreases the likelihood a student will withdraw from school. This study was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> problem facing <b>schools</b> today.

40|$|Background High <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> is {{of major}} {{concern in the}} western world. Our aims were to {{estimate}} the risk of <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> in adolescents following chronic somatic disease, somatic symptoms, psychological distress, concentration difficulties, insomnia or overweight and to assess to which extent the family contributes to the association between health and <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> Methods A population of 8950 school-attending adolescents (13 – 21 years) rated their health in the Young-HUNT 1 Study (90 % response rate) in 1995 – 1997. High <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> or completion, was defined with the Norwegian National Education Database in the calendar year the participant turned 24 years old. Parental socioeconomic status was defined by using linkages to the National Education Database, the National Insurance Administration and the HUNT 2 Survey. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and risk differences of high <b>school</b> <b>dropout,</b> both in the whole population and among siblings within families differentially exposed to health problems. Results All explored health dimensions were strongly associated with high <b>school</b> <b>dropout.</b> In models adjusted for parental socioeconomic status, the risk differences of <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> according to health exposures varied between 3. 6 % (95 % CI 1. 7 to 5. 5) for having ≥ 1 somatic disease versus none and 11. 7 % (6. 3 to 17. 0) for being obese versus normal weight. The results from the analyses comparing differentially exposed siblings, confirmed these results {{with the exception of}} weaker associations for somatic diseases and psychological distress. <b>School</b> <b>dropout</b> was strongly clustered within families (family level conditional intraclass correlation 0. 42).

Background: Most Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds report that they have good health, but pain among adolescents is common and identified as an important health problem. The use of over-the-counter analgesics has increased, also among adolescents. High <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> is a challenge for the society and put young people at risk for later work marginalization and social exclusion. The etiology is multifactorial and dependent of variables like gender, grades, ethnicity and the parents socioeconomic status. The role of pain and its associations with high <b>school</b> <b>dropout</b> have not been studied before. Method: 14063 Norwegian 15 - 16 -year-olds from six different counties completed a questionnaire and were followed up for five years.
