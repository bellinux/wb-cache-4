50|$|Going back in {{time when}} Resnet was first {{completely}} wired (Summer 2001) {{the decision was made}} to wire every room on campus 3 years earlier than planned rather than to make all installed lines live. As a result the network used somewhat second hand 3Com FMS 10baseT hubs with up to 144 users per stack. Due to increasing demands of network applications a shared 10Mb segment for 144 users was no longer acceptable for use however the problems of such infrastructure were massively increased by LUSerNet. The increased uptake of the Resnet, falling price for a switch port and massive <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> of a daily walk to 40 comms rooms to make new requests live made this model no longer viable. As a result a complete equipment replacement of Resnet occurred over two summers (2002 and 2003). During in 2002 all hubs were removed and switches installed. the uptake of Resnet was far higher than expected during 2002 and as a result all ports were connected and remotely managed in 2003. Every year since further improvements have been made to the performance, reliability and security. Future developments will almost certainly be 802.1x for user authentication and provision of multicast services.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{identified}} {{per patient}} resource use and <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> at a cystic fibrosis (CF) outpatient unit {{from the health}} care provider's perspective. Methods: Personnel cost data were prospectively collected for all CF outpatients (n = 126) under routine conditions at the Charit 9 Medical School Berlin in Germany over a six month study period. Patients were grouped according to age, sex and two severity categories. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was performed to determine the impact of various independent variables on personnel costs. Results: The mean <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> were 8 ̆ 0142. 3 per patient over six months of outpatient service. Services provided by physicians were the biggest contributor to <b>staff</b> <b>costs.</b> Patient age correlated significantly and negatively with mean total costs per patient. Conclusions: Age of patient is a significant determinant of <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> for CF outpatient care. For a cost-covering remuneration of outpatient treatment it seems plausible to create separate reimbursement rates {{for two or three}} age groups and to consider additional costs due to tasks carried out by physicians without direct patient contact. The relatively low <b>staff</b> <b>costs</b> identified by our study reflect a staffing level not sufficient for specialist CF outpatient care...|$|R

Nursing times are grouped into eight categories based on a principal components analysis. We then investigate the effect of the level and type of nursing care and of physicians' services given in an earlier period on the <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> of nursing home care in a later period. Psychosocial nursing care (emotional support, education) and number of physicians' visits given in the earlier period were found to be negatively associated with costs in a later period. The most powerful predictor of future costs were actual costs in the earlier period. These results suggest that more investment in psychosocial nursing effort and physicians' services may yield modest cost savings in future nursing home patient care. nursing homes costs resident education physicians...|$|E

Based on the Hausman test, a fixed effect model in a generalized form (GLS) was estimated. The result shows that credit risk, growth in loans and advances, staff operating cost, GDP growth, inflation rate and money supply growth are significant determinants of interest margins in Nigeria. Consistent with previous studies, <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> exerts highest impact on interest margins followed by fixed effects term. Further analysis of the banks' fixed effects reveals that seven banks control about 64 %, which raises a policy concern for banks' supervisors. The result also reveals that banks usually transfer their staff operating costs to customers by either imposing exorbitant lending rates or low deposit rates or both.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{debate as}} to {{whether there is a}} trade–off between {{financial}} sustainability and outreach remains inconclusive among many researchers, therefore this research was conducted to bridge this knowledge gap. The study was conducted in Harare using longitudinal research design and analysed using panel data regression model. The study was conducted for the period of 3 years from 2011 to 2013 on 60 sampled MFIs in Harare. The findings were that MFIs in Harare are very sustainable but their outreach is low as shown by large loan sizes offered to clients. It was further revealed that <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> per dollar and proportion of female clients are the only variables that affect sustainability of MFIs in Harare. Finally the research revealed that sustainability goals be achieved simultaneously and therefore are compatible. The key contributions to knowledge revealed by the study are as follows: there is a positive relationship between sustainability and outreach. Two variables affect sustainability on MFIs in Harare namely <b>staff</b> <b>cost</b> per dollar and proportion of female clients. The study recommends that Microfinance institutions in Harare should focus on financial sustainability in order to reduce their subsidy dependence, to ensure survival and growth in the future. To the policy makers the study recommends that sustainability does not compromise the outreach to the poor...|$|E

Initially, asses of performance of the financial aspects consist of four main aspects, which are finance, customers, internal business process, and spending and growth.
