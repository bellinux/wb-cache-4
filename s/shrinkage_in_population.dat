40|$|Persistence of {{population}}s at range edges relies on local population dynamics and fitness, {{in the case}} of geographically isolated populations of species with low dispersal potential. Focusing on spatial variations in demography helps to predict the long-term capability for persistence {{of populations}} across the geographical range of species' distribution. The demography of two ecological and phylogenetically close macroalgal species with different life history characteristics was investigated by using stochastic, stage-based matrix models. Populations of Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus serratus were sampled for up to 4 years at central locations in France and at their southern range limits in Portugal. The stochastic population growth rate (λ(s)) of A. nodosum was lower and more variable in central than in southern sites whilst for F. serratus this trend was reversed with λ(s) much lower and more variable in southern than <b>in</b> central <b>populations.</b> Individuals were larger in central than <b>in</b> southern <b>populations</b> for both species, which was reflected in the lower transition probabilities of individuals to larger size classes and higher probability of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> the southern <b>populations.</b> <b>In</b> both central and southern populations elasticity analysis (proportional sensitivity) of population growth rate showed that fertility elements had a small contribution to λ(s) that was more sensitive to changes in matrix transitions corresponding to survival. The highest elasticities were found for loop transitions in A. nodosum and for growth to larger size classes in F. serratus. Sensitivity analysis showed high selective pressure on individual growth for both species at both locations. The results of this study highlight the deterministic role of species-specific life-history traits <b>in</b> <b>population</b> demography across the geographical range of species. Additionally, this study demonstrates that individuals' life-transitions differ in vulnerability to environmental variability and shows the importance of vegetative compared to reproductive stages for the long-term persistence of populations...|$|R

40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to mitigate}} autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> cementitious materials {{with a low}} water-to-binder ratio is internal curing {{by the use of}} superabsorbent polymers. Superabsorbent polymers are able to absorb multiple times their weight in water and can be applied as an internal water reservoir to induce internal curing and mitigation of self-desiccation. Their purposefulness has been demonstrated in Portland cement pastes with and without silica fume. Nowadays, fly ash and blast-furnace slag containing binders are also frequently used in the construction industry. The results on autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> materials blended with fly ash or blast-furnace slag remain scarce, especially after one week of age. This paper focuses on the autogenous shrinkage by performing manual and automated shrinkage measurements up to one month of age. Without superabsorbent polymers, autogenous <b>shrinkage</b> was reduced <b>in</b> cement pastes with the supplementary cementitious materials versus Portland cement pastes. At later ages, the rate of autogenous shrinkage is higher due to the pozzolanic activity of the supplementary cementitious materials. Internal curing by means of superabsorbent polymers is successful, independent of this long-term higher rate of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> mixtures with supplementary cementitious materials. Superabsorbent polymers proved to be successful in mitigating self-desiccation...|$|R

40|$|In this {{on-going}} work, I explore certain {{theoretical and}} empirical implications of data transformations under the PCA. In particular, I state and prove three theorems about PCA, which I paraphrase as follows: 1). PCA without discarding eigenvector rows is injective, but looses this injectivity when eigenvector rows are discarded 2). PCA without discarding eigen- vector rows preserves pair-wise distances, but tends to cause pair-wise distances to shrink when eigenvector rows are discarded. 3). For any pair of points, the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distance is bounded above by an L 1 norm reconstruction error associated with the points. Clearly, 3). suggests that there might exist some correlation between <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances and mean square reconstruction error which {{is defined as the}} sum of those eigenvalues associated with the discarded eigenvectors. I therefore decided to perform numerical experiments to obtain the corre- lation between the sum of those eigenvalues and <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances. In addition, I have also performed some experiments to check respectively the effect of the sum of those eigenvalues and the effect of the shrinkages on classification accuracies under the PCA map. So far, I have obtained the following results on some publicly available data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 1). There seems to be a strong cor- relation between the sum of those eigenvalues associated with discarded eigenvectors and <b>shrinkages</b> <b>in</b> pair-wise distances. 2). Neither the sum of those eigenvalues nor pair-wise distances have any strong correlations with classification accuracies. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{measure the}} {{kinetics}} of shrinkage {{at the time}} of the cooling of injected polymers during a cycle of moulding. Dynamic measurement of the shrinkage of the castings after ejection is taken by the method of photomechanical in a thermally controlled environment representative of a workshop production one. The technique of photomechanical used allows measurement without contact of the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> the principal plan of the part. It is shown that the profile of temperature quickly becomes uniform in the thickness of the part after the phase of ejection and that the kinetics of shrinkage is controlled by the kinetics of cooling for the PS as for PP. One shows the influence of certain processing parameters on the evolution of the <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>in</b> particular, the dependence of the shrinkage according to the temperature of the mould and the packing pressure. Finally one notes the presence of an anisotropy of <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> the case of PP.

Seeds with an approximate initial moisture content of 0. 61 kgw kgdm- 1 (kilogram of water per kilogram of dry matter) were dried in a convection oven at temperatures of 36, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 °C until they reached a moisture content of 0. 11 ± 0. 006 kgw kgdm- 1. The experimental data were fitted to five mathematical models used to represent volumetric <b>shrinkage</b> <b>in</b> agricultural products. The models were analyzed using the coefficient of determination, chi-square, mean relative error, mean estimated error, and residual distribution. Geometric diameter data were subjected to regression analysis by adopting a 1 % level of significance.
