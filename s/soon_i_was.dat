500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Rose August Wenger in Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of five}} girls to Swiss-German parents, Fred and Annie Wegner. [...] Her father had wanted a son, and {{encouraged}} {{her to be a}} tomboy. Helen saw her first Wild West show in Cleveland in the summer of 1909 and answered a Miller Brothers 101 Ranch ad for girl riders in Billboard magazine. They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders told me I could get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too <b>soon.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry when I had to go home, and could hardly wait to open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} nearly {{complete}} {{in the fall}} of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with Bells Are Ringing, then Bernstein with Candide, and in January 1957 A Clearing in the Woods, Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for West Side Story late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project. Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical New Girl in Town, to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason New Girl was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled, [...] "Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and <b>soon</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> singing along with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paisley {{was born}} on October 28, 1972, in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He is {{the only child of}} Douglas Edward [...] "Doug" [...] Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean [...] "Sandy" [...] (n√©e Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher. He was raised in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He has stated that his love of country music stems from his {{maternal}} grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone, and taught him how to play at eight years old. At ten, he performed {{for the first time in}} public by singing in his church. He later recalled that, [...] "Pretty <b>soon,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat thing about a small town is that when you want to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one." [...] At age 13, he wrote his first song, [...] "Born on Christmas Day", which later appeared on his album Brad Paisley Christmas. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence [...] "Hank" [...] Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called [...] "Brad Paisley and the C-Notes", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends.|$|E
