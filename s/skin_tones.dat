40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} relationships between and among adolescents 2 ̆ 7 self-perceived <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> their own <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> preferences, perceptions of <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> values, and identity formation. I draw inspiration from previous work {{on the impact of}} self-perceived <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> as well as <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> satisfaction on psychosocial development and functioning. Building upon this, I argue that additional critical components are implicated in this process—colorism, defined as bias based on the lightness or darkness of a person 2 ̆ 7 s skin color (Okazawa, Rey, Robinson, 2 ̆ 6 Ward, 1987; Russell, Wilson 2 ̆ 6 Hall, 1992) and <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> stigma (i. e., having a <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> that is, or is perceived to be, devalued by others). My work is set apart from previous work in its use of a multiethnic adolescent sample. An additional contribution of my work is its focus on sociohistorical context, normative development, and an identity-focused phenomenological perspective. ^ Using Spencer 2 ̆ 7 s (1995, 2006) Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST), this study examined the intersections between self-perceived <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissonance (i. e., having or not having the <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> they prefer to have), <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> stigma (having, or perceiving to have, a <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> that is devalued) and identity formation (as measured by self-regard, perceived teacher regard, and perceived peer regard) among a racially and ethnically heterogeneous sample of low-income urban adolescents (n = 1038). Analyses were conducted for the entire sample, as well as separately by race and ethnicity to examine the notion that colorism operates both between and within racial and ethnic groups. The descriptive findings revealed differences in identity formation variables by <b>skin</b> <b>tone.</b> The study also found <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissonance and perceived <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> stigma were related to identity formation. These finding suggest that adolescents are acutely aware that other people perceive them and make assumptions, often based on <b>skin</b> <b>tone.</b> These perceptions of how others view them, in turn, have an influence on how they perceive themselves. Finally, analyses revealed that <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissonance moderated (or changed) the relationship between <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> and identity formation. The theoretical as well as practical implications and conclusions of the study are discussed. ...|$|R

Although darker <b>skin</b> <b>toned</b> players are still more likely to occupy peripheral positions, the situation is more nuanced than first thought.

5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning.

40|$|This study explores how {{changes in}} <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> {{surveillance}} predicted by: (a) <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> satisfaction, (b) preference for lighter <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> (c) internalization of cultural standards of attractiveness, and (d) use of skin-lightening products among Asian Indian women. Exploratory analyses with demographic {{variables such as}} age, education, and marital status were also examined. Cross-cultural issues in conducting research with Asian Indian women using U. S.

Participants were 169 Asian Indian women {{over the age of}} 18 from New Delhi, Mumbai, and other major cities in India and proficiency in English. The data were collected via an Internet-based survey with measures including the <b>Skin</b> <b>Tone</b> Specific Surveillance Subscale of the Objectification Body Consciousness Scale (OBCS, McKinley 2 ̆ 6 Hyde, 1996); the Skin Color Satisfaction Scale (SCSS, Bond 2 ̆ 6 Cash, 1992); Internalization subscale from the Sociocultural Attitudes towards Appearance Questionnaire - 3 (SATAQ- 3, Thompson, van den Berg, Gurada, 2 ̆ 6 Heinberg, 2004), and a questionnaire about <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> preference and use of skin lightening products (Hamed, Tayyem, Nimer, 2 ̆ 6 Alkhatib, 2010).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{potential}} relation between <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and if this relation was moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) among participants enrolled in the Racism, Coping, and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Study. 332 participants aged to 65 years old (M = 40 years, SD = 9. 40). The main analyses consisted of multiple regressions with <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> as a predictor of ABP (24 hr, daytime, nighttime and dipping blood pressure). The main analyses also consisted of interactions of <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> and SES indicators (poverty level, education and a composite) as predictors of ABP. Additional exploratory analyses investigated a three-way interaction between <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> SES indicators and gender as predictors of ABP. Controlling for standard cardiovascular risk factors, results indicated no association between <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> and ABP or an interaction effect between <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> and the SES indicators. However, controlling for standard cardiovascular risk factors, results indicated complex associations between <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> the SES indicators and gender as predictors of ABP.

The present study aimed to examine the utility of a new measure for cancer prevention research, the <b>Skin</b> <b>Tone</b> Rating Scale. Australian undergraduate women (N[*]=[*] 156) completed an online questionnaire measuring <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissatisfaction, peer and media norms surrounding tanning, internalisation of a tanned ideal, appearance reasons for tanning, and self-reported tanning behaviour. The two-item <b>Skin</b> <b>Tone</b> Rating Scale provided a short and easy-to-administer measure of <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissatisfaction that correlated with self-reported tanning behaviour. The <b>Skin</b> <b>Tone</b> Rating Scale was also moderately related to appearance reasons for tanning and internalisation of a tanned ideal, demonstrating concurrent validity. Socio-cultural influences (from peers and media) were positively correlated with <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> dissatisfaction, and this relationship was partially mediated by internalisation of a tanned ideal. Although {{more research is needed to}} establish causation, this study provides an important addition to sun tanning literature; it provides a new measure to predict self-reported tanning behaviour, the <b>Skin</b> <b>Tone</b> Rating Scale, which highlights the importance of appearance concerns in relation to tanning and sun exposure.

40|$|Abstract—In {{consumer}} video conferencing, lighting {{conditions are}} usually not ideal thus the image qualities are poor. Lighting affects image quality on two aspects: brightness and <b>skin</b> <b>tone.</b> While {{there has been much}} research on improving the brightness of the captured images including contrast enhancement and noise removal (which {{can be thought of as}} components for brightness improvement), little attention has been paid to the <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> aspect. In contrast, it is a common knowledge for professional stage lighting designers that lighting affects not only the brightness but also the color tone which plays a critical role in the perceived look of the host and the mood of the stage scene. Inspired by stage lighting design, we propose an active lighting system which automatically adjusts the lighting so that the image looks visually appealing. The system consists of computer controllable LED light sources of different colors so that it improves not only the brightness but also the <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> of the face. Given that there is no quantitative formula on what makes a good <b>skin</b> <b>tone,</b> we use a data driven approach to learn a good <b>skin</b> <b>tone</b> model from a collection of photographs taken by professional photographers.
