5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E
5|$|During <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal,</b> the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, female <b>sexual</b> {{desire and}} <b>arousal</b> {{disorders}} {{are viewed from}} the perspective of incentive motivation and information processing models of sexual response. The effects of hormones, somatic disease, and medication on sexual arousability are discussed, as well as the influence of psychological factors, such as stimulus meaning, mood and cognition, and relational context on female <b>sexual</b> desire and <b>arousal.</b> Specific topics to attend to during the anamnesis of <b>sexual</b> desire and <b>arousal</b> problems, and empirically evaluated psychological and pharmacological treatments for these problems are discussed. <...|$|R
50|$|High {{levels of}} {{vasopressin}} {{can lead to}} decreases in sexual reproduction motivation for females. A link between vasopressin release and aggression has been observed in females, which may impair female <b>sexual</b> reproduction <b>arousal</b> and <b>sexual</b> reproduction motivation by leading to feelings of neglect and hostility toward a sexual partner. In males, vasopressin {{is involved in the}} arousal phase. Vasopressin levels have been shown to increase during erectile response in male <b>sexual</b> reproduction <b>arousal,</b> and decrease back to baseline following ejaculation. The increase of vasopressin during erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual behaviour.|$|R

5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
50|$|Sexual desire {{has been}} {{described}} as a “longing for sexual union”, it associates with certain behaviours that are more linked to arousal and states of fear, concern and enhanced attention to others, and sexual cue displays such as lip biting and touching. In keeping with the correlation between <b>sexual</b> desire and <b>arousal,</b> <b>sexual</b> desire is mediated by gonadal estrogens and androgens.|$|R
50|$|The person {{experiences}} sneezing as {{a result}} of <b>sexual</b> thoughts, <b>arousal,</b> intercourse, or orgasm. Sneezing occurs independent of external nasal stimuli or allergens, and may occur at any point during a sexual experience. Both men and women are affected by the phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} disorders may {{be classified}} into four categories: <b>sexual</b> desire disorders, <b>arousal</b> disorders, orgasm disorders and pain disorders.|$|R
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
25|$|Bailey's <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> {{work was}} {{attacked}} by The Washington Times and some socially conservative commentators as prurient and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Bailey and his defenders have responded that studying <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> patterns is important in understanding human sexuality, especially sexual orientation. Recently, Bailey's lab has begun to study sexual orientation and <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> using fMRI.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} Jon Kabat-Zinn, Brotto has been involved in the subject of mindfulness meditation skills for women with problems of low <b>sexual</b> desire/loss of <b>arousal,</b> <b>sexual</b> distress associated with sexual abuse.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{changes in}} sexual {{activity}} in women treated for cervical cancer by radiotherapy {{over a period of}} 3 to 12 months. Material and Method: Women treated for cervical cancer were selected at 3 to 12 months post-treatment. Main outcome measured were changes of sexual activity in <b>sexual</b> desire, <b>arousal,</b> orgasm, dyspareunia, frequency and satisfaction. Comparisons were made between after radiation and before radiation. Results: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction increased in most patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy. There were significant reduction in <b>sexual</b> desire, <b>arousal,</b> orgasm, frequency of intercourse, and satisfaction after radiation. Increase in sexual pain was common after treatment, but was not significant in deep dyspareu-nia. Sexual frequency was significantly correlated with FIGO staging. Conclusion: Sexual activities were significantly reduced following radiotherapy. Educational and counsel-ing programs on sexual activity after treatment should be provided to the patients...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrative}} {{theoretical framework}} and model for understanding <b>sexual</b> motivation, <b>arousal,</b> and behavior is presented, combining {{the principles of}} incentive motivation theory and the hierarchical control of behavior. It is intended to stimulate discussion. The framework {{can serve as a}} ‘‘route map’’ in understanding the links between different component processes and their interactions, as well as the relations between different academic perspectives on understanding sexuality. It is suggested that both excitation and inhibition of <b>sexual</b> motivation, <b>arousal,</b> and behavior act at various levels in a hierarchical structure, and much confusion can be avoided by distinguishing these levels. The model integrates information from different branches of psychology: biological, evolutionary, clinical, cognitive, developmental, and social. It describes interactions between sexual behavior and anxiety, attachment, aggression, and drug taking; and it is applied to gender differences, evolutionary psychology, sexual deviancy, sexual addiction, and the biological bases of sexuality...|$|R
25|$|Behavioral {{treatments}} target <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> to children, using satiation and aversion {{techniques to}} suppress <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> {{to children and}} covert sensitization (or masturbatory reconditioning) to increase <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> to adults. Behavioral treatments appear {{to have an effect}} on <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term. For sex offenders with mental disabilities, applied behavior analysis has been used.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> also depend on the level of <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal.</b> When <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

5000|$|The antigonadotropic antiandrogens , {{medroxyprogesterone}} acetate (MPA), and [...] analogues {{have all been}} widely used to treat paraphilias (e.g., pedophilia) and hypersexuality in men. They suppress androgen levels to castrate or near-castrate levels and are highly effective in reducing <b>sexual</b> urges, <b>arousal,</b> and behaviors. In addition, {{they are used to}} treat sex offenders as a means of chemical castration for the purpose of reducing the likelihood of recidivism.|$|R
25|$|Androgens may {{modulate}} the {{physiology of}} vaginal tissue {{and contribute to}} female genital <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal.</b> Women's level of testosterone is higher when measured pre-intercourse vs pre-cuddling, as well as post-intercourse vs post-cuddling. There is a time lag effect when testosterone is administered, on genital arousal in women. In addition, a continuous increase in vaginal <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> may result in higher genital sensations and sexual appetitive behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} in rats {{have indicated that}} their degree of <b>sexual</b> <b>arousal</b> is sensitive to reductions in testosterone.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between childhood physical/sexual abuse, suicide attempts, self-harming behavior and sexual functioning in patients with panic disorder. Method: 81 patients with panic disorder were included in the study. Participants were evaluated by using Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, sociodemographic form and Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX). Results: The frequency of physical abuse history was 48. 1 % and the frequency of sexual abuse was 9. 9 % in the sample. Female participants with a history of physical abuse had significantly higher scores in the items of <b>sexual</b> desire, <b>arousal,</b> ability to reach orgasm, satisfaction from orgasm and total ASEX scores than those without a history of physical abuse. Female participants with a sexual abuse history also had higher scores in the items of arousal, ability to reach orgasm and total ASEX scores. No significant difference was found between male participants with regard to physical/sexual abuse history. In a regression model, comorbid major depressive disorder rather than abuse history was found to be a predictor of poor sexual functioning. Conclusion: Female patients with panic disorder who have physical/sexual abuse history have inhibited <b>sexual</b> desire, <b>arousal</b> and orgasm.
