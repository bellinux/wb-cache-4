25|$|Eyes are {{generally}} {{adapted to the}} environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them. For instance, the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required, with horizon-scanning organisms, such as those that live on the African plains, having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia, while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> of ganglia, with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre.|$|E
25|$|Beta is the {{frequency}} range from 14nbsp&Hz to about 30nbsp&Hz. It is seen usually {{on both sides}} in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> and is most evident frontally. Beta activity is closely linked to motor behavior and is generally attenuated during active movements. Low-amplitude beta with multiple and varying frequencies {{is often associated with}} active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration. Rhythmic beta with a dominant set of frequencies is associated with various pathologies, such as Dup15q syndrome, and drug effects, especially benzodiazepines. It may be absent or reduced in areas of cortical damage. It is the dominant rhythm in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck). However, there is no <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> found between trigger zones and sites of referred sensation.|$|E

40|$|Tukey (1960) derived via the {{technique}} of transformation of variables starting from the normal distribution a family of skewed and leptokurtic distributions. Skewness and leptokurtosis are determined by two parametersg and h. Therefore, the family was called gh-distributions.

We speak about a family gh transformed <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distributions.</b> Especially, we condiser the Laplace distribution and the t-distribution with a fixed number of degrees.

5000|$|To fit a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> to data obeying a {{negatively}} skewed distribution (i.e. skewed to the left, with mean [...] < mode, {{and with a}} right hand tail this is shorter than the left hand tail) one could use the squared values of the data to accomplish the fit.|$|E

5000|$|The bounds on this {{inequality}} {{can also}} be sharpened if the distribution is both unimodal and symmetrical.

30|$|As it was {{mentioned}} previously, variables referring to decision-making {{did not follow}} a normal distribution, but we considered the application of MANOVA to be adequate, given its robustness versus the deviations from normality in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distributions,</b> {{as is the case}} of our study. On another hand, the contrast indicators of variance equality of the error term between the groups are satisfactory, except for the variable of the DMQ-Subject scale, which presents a Levene test with a significance of p[*]<[*]. 05. Therefore, the results referring to this variable must be interpreted with caution. Fit tests were, however, satisfactory in all cases.|$|R

30|$|When {{testing the}} {{parametric}} assumptions, {{it was observed}} that the variables referring to decision-making did not follow a normal distribution. The four chosen indicators (DMQ-Total, DMQ-Task, DMQ-Subject, and DMQ-Context) obtained values in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of adaptation to the normal distribution. However, we considered the application of MANOVA to be adequate, given its robustness versus the deviations from normality in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distributions</b> (Kariya & Sinha, 2014), as is the case of our study. On another hand, the contrast indicators of variance equality of the error term between the groups are satisfactory for all variables. Fit tests were also satisfactory in all cases.|$|R

50|$|The Valar left Middle-earth {{and went}} to the newly formed {{continent}} of Aman in the west, where they created their home called Valinor. To discourage Melkor from assailing Aman, they thrust the continent of Middle-earth to the east, thus widening Belegaer at its middle and raising five major mountain ranges in Middle-earth which adopted a relatively <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution,</b> namely the Blue, Red, Grey, Yellow Mountains and the Mountains of the Wind. This act, however, ruined the symmetry of the shape of the continents and their intervening seas.|$|E

It is no coincidence that this is a private building, where there are elements that later modeled for the future developments of the type of villas: internal and external penetration through filters such as loggias, <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> of environments around a central salon ("Centrifugal" [...] space), dominant position in the landscape, conscious recovery of classical architectural elements (such as the barrel vault and the ionic temple facade).|$|E

The two-dimensional sensitivities of the CRL-ASIs produced <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distributions.</b> Using this sensitivity data, we converted airglow/aurora images into two-dimensional distributions of absolute intensity. The sensitivity of the CRL-ASIs was measured for 13 wavelengths between 427. 8 nm and 866. 5 nm, {{and the relationship between}} the sensitivity and the wavelength was investigated for both imagers.

The optimal value of p {{is to be found}} by a numerical method. The numerical method may consist of assuming a range of p values, then applying the distribution fitting procedure repeatedly for all the assumed p values, and finally selecting the value of p for which the sum of squares of deviations of calculated probabilities from measured frequencies (chi square) is minimum, as is done in CumFreq.|$|R
50|$|BFPP {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{discovered}} forms of polymicrogyria to have a gene identified linking to the syndromes caused. This gene is called GPR56. <b>Symmetrical</b> <b>distribution</b> is also evident in this form, but more distinctly, patients with BFPP were found to have atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem, as well as bilateral white matter abnormalities. BFPP is characterized by estopia, global development delay, pyramidal signs, cerebral signs, and seizures. Estopia is also known as dysconjugate gaze, and is a common feature of severe static encephalopathy. This differentiates BFPP from the other bilatieral polymicrogyria syndromes.|$|E

30|$|The {{skewness}} index {{has been}} calculated {{in terms of}} the third moment around the mean (Fisher–Pearson standardised third moment): in <b>symmetrical</b> <b>distributions,</b> the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness.

Distributions nos. 3 and 4 are moderately skewed to the right (+[*]½[*]<[*]skewness <[*]+[*] 1), while nos. 1 and 2 are approximately symmetrical (0 [*]<[*]skewness[*]<[*]+[*]½).
