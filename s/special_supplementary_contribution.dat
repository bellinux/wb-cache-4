40|$|Against the {{background}} of the Commission's CAP mid-term review proposals to complete the shift from product support to farmer support the Italian government announced strong opposition to any cuts in aid to durum wheat producers. Italy currently produces 3. 5 million tonnes of durum wheat per annum for which it receives € 345 per hectare in subsidies, a total of € 552 million per annum. The mid-term review proposals call for a reduction in the <b>special</b> <b>supplementary</b> payments for durum wheat from 'traditional' areas (all of Italy's durum wheat-producing areas) to € 250 per hectare over a three-year period (and its abolition in 'established areas'). The Italian Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno maintained that this was 'a fundamental issue for Italy not only because the reform will cut Italy's share of the budget, but because it could lead to a transfer of durum wheat production, and related pasta production to other countries'. This he maintained 'would be intolerable'. Comment: The Commission maintains that reform of the durum wheat regime is necessary since each year 1 to 2 million tonnes of durum wheat are used in animal feed and not as an input into pasta production. A modification of the current specific supplementary payment regime is thus held to be essential. Furthermore the EU Court of Auditors has criticised the <b>special</b> <b>supplementary</b> payment system for over-compensating farmers. Italian concerns over durum wheat and pasta production may however be addressed through modification of the proposals for special payments for high quality durum wheat for manufacturing purposes. This would help to ensure the ready availability of durum wheat for pasta production. Italian pasta is increasingly appearing on supermarket shelves in southern Africa indicating that existing cereal sector reforms have already assisted in enhancing the price competitiveness of Italian pasta production on overseas markets.

The underlying goal is to understand the present-day diversity of galaxy forms, masses and luminosities.

However, numerous uncertainties remain, including the role that dust might play in obscuring star-forming systems.

Bereft of critical infrastructure, rekindled community cohesion and heightened cultural identity are deployed by VDAs to fill gaps.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{elucidate}} dimensions of normal and abnormal personality underlying DSM-IV personality disorder (PD) symptoms in 168 adolescents referred {{to mental health}} services. Dimensions derived from the Big Five of normal personality and from Livesley's (2006) conceptualization of personality pathology were regressed on interview-based DSM-IV PD symptom counts. When examined independently, both models demonstrated significant levels of predictive power at the higher order level. However, when added to the higher order Big Five dimensions, Livesley's higher and lower order dimensions afforded a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contribution</b> {{to the understanding of}} dysfunctional characteristics of adolescent PDs.

40|$|From {{beginning}} to end, John Dewey’s oeuvre {{is filled with}} philosophical discussions and political comments on the significance de jure and de facto {{of a wide range}} of distinct social spaces.

Nonetheless, sport is expressly recognized as a noteworthy environment and integrated into lines of argumentation in no small number of areas as an example.

40|$|International audienceThe {{flow field}} around a solid {{particle}} {{moving in a}} shear flow along a porous slab is obtained by solving the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem with the Beavers and Joseph slip boundary condition on the slab interfaces. The solution involves the Green's function of this coupled problem, which is given here. It is shown that the classical boundary integral method using this Green's function is inappropriate because of <b>supplementary</b> <b>contributions</b> due to the slip on the slab interfaces. An 'indirect boundary integral method' is therefore proposed, in which the unknown density on the particle surface is not the actual stress, but yet allows calculation of the force and torque on the particle. Various results are provided for the normalized force and torque, namely friction factors, on the particle. The cases of a sphere and an ellipsoid are considered. It is shown that the relationships between friction coefficients (torque due to rotation and force due to translation) that are classical for a no-slip plane do not apply here. This difference is exhibited Finally, results for the velocity of a freely moving particle in a linear and a quadratic shear flow are presented, for both a sphere and an ellipsoid...|$|R

40|$|The formalised naming and {{positioning}} of Indigenous Australian standpoint within the academy {{is relatively new}} and borrows from feminist traditions (Nakata, 2002; Rigney, 1997). Articulating one’s own standpoint is recognition of one’s subject position and proponents of standpoint contend that one’s own identity and subject position is implicated in one’s practice within the academy. The ready acceptance of Indigenous Australian standpoint is testimony to the discontent experienced by Indigenous Australians and Indigenous peoples from other places {{in relation to the}} disciplines that formerly held principal authority in relation to knowledge-building about Indigenous peoples, chief amongst these is of course anthropology and other social sciences.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the coupling {{of the electromagnetic}} sources (charge and current densities) to the scalar and vector potentials in classical electrodynamics, using Green function techniques. As is well known, the scalar potential shows an action-at-a-distance behavior in Coulomb gauge. The conundrum generated by the instantaneous interaction has intrigued physicists for a long time. Starting from the differential equations that couple the sources to the potentials, we here show in a concise derivation, using the retarded Green function, how the instantaneous interaction cancels in the calculation of the electric field. The time derivative of a specific additional term in the vector potential, present only in Coulomb gauge, yields a <b>supplementary</b> <b>contribution</b> to the electric field which cancels the gradient of the instantaneous Coulomb gauge scalar potential, as required by gauge invariance. This completely eliminates {{the contribution of the}} instantaneous interaction from the electric field. It turns out that a careful formulation of the retarded Green function, inspired by field theory, is required in order to correctly treat boundary terms in partial integrations. Finally, compact integral representations are derived for the Lienard-Wiechert potentials (scalar and vector) in Coulomb gauge which manifestly contain two compensating action-at-a-distance terms.
