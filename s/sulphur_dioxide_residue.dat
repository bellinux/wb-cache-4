40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of free molecular and bound forms of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to free molecular form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the bound form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|Abstract. Intact chloroplasts {{isolated}} from <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated Hardwickia binata leaves showed inhibition of PS II electron transport activity without any {{significant effect on}} photosystem I. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> exposed leaves accumulated more hydrogen peroxide than those from non-fumigated plants and this was caused by increase in superoxide radical production. Hydrogen peroxide formation was inhibited by addition of cytochrome C and superoxide disrnutase. In <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated leaves, increase in superoxide dismutase activity showed resistance to sulphite toxicity. The localization of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities in chloroplasts provide evidence for the photogeneration of ascorbate.

40|$|For {{technological}} and economical reasons, in the grape juices production the long time storage of the must {{is made by}} addition of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (up to 2000 mg/l).

40|$|Introduction. Ambient air {{pollution}} {{in the town of}} Kakanj, mostly of industrial origin, has become a major reason for increased use of health care services by {{children under the age of}} six years. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between ambient concentrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SO 2), suspended particles and nitrogenoxides (NOx), and the frequency/number of visits to health care institutions by children under the age of six years. Material and methods. The investigation was carried out in the period from January to December 2003, in the area of Kakanj and Brnjic. We examined the average number of monthly visits to health care institutions and concentrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> suspended particles and nitrogen oxides in the town of Kakanj. Results. The investigation shows that there is a linear increase of visits to health care institutions in relation to linear increase of concetrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> suspended particles and nitrogen oxides (O<R<+ 1). An increase in visits to health care institutions significantly correlates (0. 05) with the average concetrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (0. 713) and suspended particles (0. 433), and with the average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (0. 901). Discussion. High correlation between the increase in visits to health care institutions and increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides and <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> was also found by Berktas, Jazbec, Transande. Conclusion. Children under the age of six in the town of Kakanj visit health care institutions considerably more frequently than children of the same age in the village of Brnjic, which significantly correlates with the average monthly concentrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide,</b> suspended particles and nitrogen oxides in the air. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the winters}} of 1967 / 1968 and 1968 / 1969 a newly {{developed}} air pollution monitor was tried {{out in a}} field test. The <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentration was continuously measured in the atmosphere of Eindhoven, a medium-sized town in the Netherlands. The town is characterized by cleanness in industry and hence the air pollution {{was expected to be}} low, especially after the large-scale change-over from the burning of coal and oil to the use of natural gas for industrial and domestic heating in the year preceding the beginning of the measurements. Generally, these expectations came true, {{with the exception of the}} high <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations which sometimes occurred in easterly winds. They were in contrast with the relatively slight urbanization east of the measuring station. On this the hypothesis is based that high <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations at Eindhoven may be caused by the German Ruhr area situated at 100 km distance. An analysis of the data suggests this influence. The transport of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> is promoted by strong winds and by either a stable atmosphere or a low-level inversion layer in the atmosphere.

These survival patterns were observed {{for the same}} strain in different dry red wine blends with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, {{in the absence of}} free <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> For the same wine blend, these patterns also varied with the tested strain. Under laboratory conditions the addition of 150 mg/l of potassium metabisulphite (PMB) to dry red wine with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50 reduced initial cell counts by more than 6 logarithmic cycles, inducing full death within less than 24 h.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the future growth of commercial vehicles (passenger vehicles and goods vehicles) and to project the subsequent increase in diesel demand and the level of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> emissions in Delhi. Using an S-curve growth model on the data set of auto rickshaws, taxis, buses, and goods vehicles from 1965 - 66 to 2005 - 06, a long-term trend in the growth of commercial vehicles is projected to the year 2020 - 21.
