40|$|Can one {{produce an}} {{international}} comparison of cultural policies, and if so, how? These are our initial questions. The {{possibility of a}} comparative approach appears as a particular problem in France, where the thesis positing {{the very existence of}} cultural policies – amalgamated with the existence of a ministry for culture – as nationally specific enjoys a broad consensus, thereby depriving any comparative analysis of an object. Whether it is celebrated or denounced, i the „French exception ‟ is scarcely questioned. Furthermore, the „French model ‟ has become the object of an export drive, as is shown by the occupation by agents from the Ministry of Culture of positions in international institutions (Unesco, the Council of Europe), the recent organisation of the „Malraux colloquia ‟ whose vocation is the diffusion of this „unique model ‟ across the world, and even the references in other countries to this supposed „model‟. ii Against this flat refusal of any comparative approach, seeing no foreign cases for comparison, one can set – notably in the framework of <b>specialised</b> <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> – the juxtaposition of national monograph studies that presuppose a common identity for objects presented as equivalent. This was the case, for example, with the programme o...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of what is known about how cocaine is produced and trafficked into the European Union. It aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} actors involved, the routes taken, and the scale of the problem in Europe. It also reviews some of the supply reduction responses already developed at European level. Its findings are based on the latest data and analysis available from <b>specialised</b> European and <b>international</b> <b>organisations,</b> NGOs and scholars. This publication is structured in a way that provides a condensed review of key issues relevant to understanding how cocaine reaches European markets. Background information on the chemistry and legal status of cocaine and crack cocaine, as well as key European figures, are also provided.

40|$|The {{existence}} {{of different types}} of mines and explosive devices in certain parts of Kosovo’s territory presents a potential threat to injury and life of the people. Therefore, one of the main tasks during last twelve years that is still ongoing is demining. Demining was carried by <b>international</b> <b>specialised</b> <b>organisations</b> and later on by Kosovo Security Force. Marking the mine fields, detection of unexploded ordnances (UXO) and clearance are phases of such a very difficult process. It is very important minimisation of human role and his replacement with technical devices. In this paper a conceptual design of a technical device for UXO detection that attempts to replace a human role on marked mine fields is presented. The prototype of a detection device remote controlled is equipped with metal detectors. This device is initial step towards design of a device not only for mine/UXO detection, but also for clearance...|$|R

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>organisations</b> have {{recently}} come under pressure. Brexit, {{the election of}} Donald Trump, {{and the rise of}} China appear to all indicate the same thing: established <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> are losing authority. In reality, however, the formal authority of <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> has grown significantly in recent decades. <b>International</b> <b>organisations</b> have become more authoritative {{over the past few decades}} – that is, they are now less dependent on control by individual member states. The growing authority of <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> is reflected in the increasing extent to which national governments (a) set aside their vetoes by endorsing majoritarian forms of decision-making (pooling) and (b) empower independent institutions to act on their behalf (delegation). This rise in international authority involves trade-offs, as pooling and delegation seldom go together. In task-specific organisations, pooling is widespread, whereas delegation is limited; in general-purpose organisations, the opposite is the case. The reasons for the rise in international authority are threefold: (i) the functional quest for effective cooperation, (ii) increasing political demands for participation by non-governmental actors, and (iii) the diffusion of authoritative institutional templates amongst <b>international</b> <b>organisations.</b> These forces are likely to continue pushing towards greater international authority in the future. Stronger <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> also invite contestation, which induces certain governments to devise strategies to circumvent those organisations they perceive to be overly authoritative. These trends could potentially weaken existing <b>international</b> <b>organisations.</b> For much of the post-war period, <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> have largely operated out of the limelight; however, this is changing as their authority increases. Policymakers should realise that international organisations’ growing authority may fuel a political backlash that could lead to stagnation or even backsliding. While there are compelling reasons for deeper international collaboration in an interdependent world, political contestation has the potential to override them...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the global anti-money laundering regime, assesses its purpose and draws some conclusions {{with regards to}} its effectiveness {{as a tool for}} targeting transnational financial crime. The paper shows that targeting money laundering is presented as a means of strengthening the integrity of the financial system and tackling organised crime through a global approach, and contrasts official policies with actual (and potential) results in practice. The paper explains that {{at the core of the}} approach lies the tension of reconciling the cost of dealing with money laundering (to be borne primarily by the private sector) and the benefits of containing financial crime, which are, at best, difficult to determine. The paper analyses the relative input of (and interaction between) the various actors in the emerging anti-money laundering regime: <b>specialised</b> <b>organisations,</b> <b>international</b> financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, large, specialised and offshore financial centres and the private sector. It concludes that there is little evidence that the current regime leads to a systematic approach in addressing organised crime and argues that a similarly cosmetic exercise is evident in the inclusion of anti-terrorist financing measures in the anti-money laundering regime. Instead, the paper shows that regulation in the emerging anti-money laundering regime mostly serves (a) to address the need for ‘public’ action with respect to other types of public policy goals, (b) to relieve competitive pressures from specialised and offshore financial centres and (c) to produce increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques in private financial institutions...|$|R
