5|$|In July 2012 {{the family}} of Kun Liu (the {{stuntman}} killed during filming) filed a wrongful death <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> producers of the film, Nu Image and Millennium Films, and stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The suit alleged that conditions for the stunt were unsafe. The Expendables 2 credits contain a dedication to Liu's memory.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil libel <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party. Because libel laws {{do not apply}} to statements made in the House of Commons, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was injured}} while {{present at the}} W.I.P nightclub in the SoHo {{district}} of New York City when a brawl broke out between entertainers Chris Brown and Drake. Parker filed a $20 million <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> night club. Parker risked missing the 2012 Summer Olympics after a piece of glass thrown in the fight deeply penetrated his eye, requiring surgery to remove. However, on 6 July 2012, he was cleared to participate.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{supported}} The New York Times in its 1971 <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government, requesting {{permission to}} publish the Pentagon papers. The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co. v.

5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} settlement, because the New York state statute of {{limitations}} required people to file a lawsuit within three years of discovering an illness, New York Governor George Pataki signed a bill allowing people infected by blood products, or their survivors, two years to bring product liability <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> manufacturers. [...] While the settled class members are barred from filing <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> companies, the bill allowed an estimated additional 75 eligible persons to file suits.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{reservations}} of the Czech Republic and Poland, the Directive {{was adopted}} by majority vote of the European Council and by first reading vote with no public debate in the European Parliament. It {{was published in the}} Official Journal under No. (EU) 2017/853 on 17 May 2017. Member States will have 15 months to implement the Directive into its national legal systems. The Czech Government announced that it will lodge a <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> directive in front of the European Court of Justice, seeking postponement of its effectiveness as well as complete invalidation, and did so on 9 August 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} want to repeat his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, film {{director}} Sathish Paul filed a copyright infringement <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> makers, {{saying that it}} had similarities to his script titled Oru Mazhakkalathu, written in 2013. The court passed an order saying that the movie had prima facie similarities to Sathish' script, but allowed {{the making of the}} Tamil version Papanasam to proceed, on the condition that the makers of Drishyam produce a 10 lakh bank guarantee before the court to ensure the compensation. The case was dismissed in March 2015 as it was proved that Jeethu had written the script in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|On July 10, 1978, the Temple sued Stoen for $150 million, {{charging}} that Stoen violated his attorney-client {{relationship with the}} Temple by using privileged information in his <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Temple. Charles R. Garry represented the Temple in the suit. [...] The suit alleged that Stoen was attempting to [...] "harass and oppress" [...] his former client and sought to enjoin Stoen from soliciting former members as clients in <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Temple.|$|R

5|$|Oneida I and Oneida II were litigated as {{test cases}} by both sides; the Oneidas <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{counties}} for 200 years of damages was stayed pending its resolution. After settlement efforts, that suit resumed in 2000. In a similar suit {{by a different}} tribe, the Second Circuit adopted {{the view of the}} four dissenting Oneida II justices in Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki (2005). The same laches defense defeated the larger Oneida claim. The Oneida and the United States petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari on May 16, 2011. The Court denied certiorari on October 17, with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissenting from the denial.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Moxon's {{legal work}} is Scientology-related. He {{has served as}} Commissioner of the Scientology-affiliated {{organization}} Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). He represented the Church of Scientology in 1988 in a billion-dollar class action lawsuit against the organization by former Scientologists which was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. In 1990 Moxon represented the organization in a <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Internal Revenue Service {{in an attempt to}} gain access to information about Scientology held by the IRS. He assisted 50 Scientologists in filing separate lawsuits against the organization Cult Awareness Network (CAN), which led to the bankruptcy of the organization. He represented the plaintiff in the Jason Scott case against CAN and cult deprogrammer Rick Ross.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>The</b> Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

5|$|In a {{case before}} the International Court of Justice, Croatia filed a <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 2 July 1999, citing Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. With the {{transformation}} of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro and the dissolution of that country in 2006, Serbia is considered its legal successor. The application was filed for Croatia by a U.S. lawyer, David B. Rivkin. Serbia reciprocated with the genocide lawsuit against the Republic of Croatia on 4 January 2010. The Serbian application covers missing people, killed people, refugees, expelled people, and all military actions and concentration camps with a historical account of World War II persecution of Serbs committed by the Independent State of Croatia during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 {{and returned to}} Jamaica shortly afterward {{to serve as the}} territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica {{in the absence of the}} post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a libel <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of Morgan has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.|$|E
5|$|The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust was {{established}} on December 2, 1909, {{for the care}} of orphaned and destitute children in Hawaii. Effective upon her death, the proceeds of her estate, with the exception of twelve individual inheritances specified therein, were to be used for the Trust. The largest of these hereditary estates were willed to her hānai sons and their heirs: John ʻAimoku Dominis would receive Washington Place while Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa would receive Kealohilani, her residence at Waikiki. Both men predeceased the Queen. Before and after her death, lawsuits were filed to overturn her will establishing the Trust. One notable litigant was Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, the nephew of her brother Kalākaua and his wife Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani's second cousin, who brought a <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Trust on November 30, 1915, questioning the Queen's competency in executing the will and attempting to break the Trust. These lawsuits were resolved in 1923 and the will went into probate. The Queen Liliʻuokalani Children's Center was created by the Trust.|$|E
50|$|Former senior {{managers}} Martin Newson, Eduardo Listorti and Michael Adams sued but {{settled out of}} court. Other executives (Areski Iberrakene, Efstratios Hatzistefanis, Kaveh Taleghani and Stefan Guetter) won their bonus <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bank in August 2009.|$|R
50|$|There were 2,729 {{sidewalk}} injury <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> city in 2006 (resulting in $55.5 {{million in}} recovery), compared to 3,482 in 2003 ($68 million).

50|$|Frances Jalet-Cruz {{represented}} Texas {{inmates in}} a number of <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Texas Department of Corrections and became one of the central figures in the Texas prison reform movement during the late 1960s and 1970s, leading to broad changes in the Texas prison system in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E
50|$|Both the Weaver {{family and}} Harris brought civil <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} over {{the events of}} the firefight and siege, the Weavers winning a combined out-of-court settlement in August 1995 for $3.1 million, and Harris being awarded, after persistent appeals, a $380,000 settlement in September 2000.|$|R
50|$|Lawyers for Synanon {{responded to}} the exposé by filing six libel <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Mitchells. The Mitchells {{received}} a pro bono defense from Heller Ehrman White and McAuliffe, which in representing them won a significant victory for the state’s press. In its 1984 decision, the California Supreme Court ruled that reporters could often keep confidential sources secret in libel and other civil cases without forfeiting their defense.|$|R
