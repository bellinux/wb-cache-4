5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV {{executives}} were <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for a series that could comfortably replace it. On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.|$|E
5|$|After years, Ulmo {{returned}} to Beleriand {{to seek out}} the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as their leader and became the Falathrim. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{have been}} the primary way of linking {{countries}} in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century.

5|$|The {{blood that}} spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds was created using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood floated in a convincing manner while <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by {{literary}} critics {{and does not}} sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E

25|$|Konoe {{played a}} role in the fall of the Tōjō {{government}} in 1944. In February 1945, during the first private audience he had been allowed in three years, he advised the Emperor to begin negotiations to end World War II. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, Hirohito, <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for a tennozan (a great victory), firmly rejected Konoe's recommendation.|$|E
25|$|However, the easing {{tensions}} did not last. Kỳ was <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> {{to make a}} show of force. Without {{telling the}} figurehead President Thiệu or Westmoreland, Kỳ ordered General Cao Văn Viên to lead a force into Da Nang. On May 15, government Vietnamese marines and airborne units were airlifted from the capital to Da Nang. Landing at dawn, they proceeded into the city centre and captured the local ARVN headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that these}} {{exceptions}} {{generally do not}} cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for those bodies. The U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts have affirmed {{the right of a}} lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory is}} that the Spanish {{destroyed}} the colony. Earlier in the century, the Spanish did destroy evidence of the French colony of Fort Charles in coastal South Carolina and then massacred the inhabitants of Fort Caroline, a French colony near present-day Jacksonville, Florida. However, a Spanish attack is unlikely, as the Spanish were <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for the location of England's failed colony as late as 1600, ten years after White discovered that the colony was missing.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the views}} and history, {{homes in the}} area still command a high price. The open space {{overlooking}} the river within the district {{is a source of}} constant development pressure on the district, as builders look to serve buyers priced out of growing suburbs further south in the valley yet <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for a rail commute to the city via Amtrak or Metro-North (via Poughkeepsie). The district boundaries had to be drawn to exclude one newer subdivision near Staatsburg, but had to include one in Tivoli.|$|E
25|$|Akio Suyama voiced Ogami. At the time, Suyama {{had little}} to no voice acting experience, and was working {{part-time}} at Red Company while training as a voice actor. Hiroi was <b>still</b> <b>looking</b> for a voice actor for Ogami, but there was limited budget to hand. Upon hearing of Hiroi's situation, Suyama offered {{to take on the}} role despite there only being a few lines of any note. Faced with his budget and time limitations, Hiroi accepted Suyama's offer. Ogami was the last main character to be cast.|$|E
