5|$|The double {{burden that}} single mothers endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. Single mothers usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. Single mothers fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E
25|$|In all matches, {{in case of}} a draw after {{regulation}} time, {{the team}} that ended the season with the higher placement in the league table will be considered the winner, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no extra time and/or penalty shootout.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, the post-nationalisation {{management}} of Northern Rock {{decided not to}} bring legal action for negligence against the directors in charge during the crisis, including former chief executive Adam Applegarth, citing insufficient grounds to do <b>so.</b> <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no action either against the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Sweden {{signed a}} {{contract}} for 18 NH90 TTH, made up of 13 TTT/SAR and 5 SAR/ASW to be operated by the Swedish Air Force. Because of renewed foreign submarine activity at the Swedish coast in 2014 it was decided in 2015 that four TTT/SAR would be modified to SAR/ASW {{in order to increase}} the anti-submarine warfare capability, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> 9 TTT/SAR and 9 SAR/ASW. The NH90 is known as the Helikopter 14 (HKP14) in Swedish service, the FOC version of TTT/SAR are designated HKP14E and the FOC version of SAR/ASW are designated HKP14F.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E
25|$|If global {{oil prices}} remain high, {{it is likely}} that Canada will become one of the largest oil {{producers}} in the world in the next few decades. If <b>so,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products. The oil sands deposits are roughly the size of Florida and the operations would drastically alter the landscape, which until recently was largely wilderness. In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use {{a large portion of the}} flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels. However, given the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue expected to be generated by the oil sands in the next few decades, {{it is likely that}} future projects will be approved regardless of the problems.|$|E

The constraint may change with time, so time t will appear explicitly in the constraint equations. At any instant of time, when t is a constant, any one coordinate will be determined from the other coordinates, e.g. if xk and zk are given, then so is yk. One constraint equation counts as one constraint. If there are C constraints, each has an equation, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> C constraint equations. There is not necessarily one constraint equation for each particle, {{and if there are}} no constraints on the system then there are no constraint equations.|$|E

[...] One report suggested that a benefit of the ACT test was that it allowed the test-taker to have greater freedom to choose which scores to send to which colleges. Counselors suggest that students practice taking the test under actual testing conditions. Counselors advise students taking tests should become familiar with directions beforehand <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more time to focus on problems during the actual test.
