5000|$|For first {{generation}} pressure cookers with a weighted valve or [...] "jiggler", the primary safety valve or regulator {{is usually a}} weighted stopper, commonly called [...] "the rocker" [...] or [...] "vent weight". This weighted stopper is lifted by the steam pressure, allowing excess pressure to be released. There is a backup pressure release mechanism that releases pressure quickly if the primary pressure release mechanism fails (e.g., food jams the <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> path). One such method is {{a hole in the}} lid that is blocked by a low melting point alloy plug and another is a rubber grommet with a metal insert at the center. At a sufficiently high pressure, the grommet will distort and the insert will blow out of its mounting hole to release pressure. If the pressure continues to increase, the grommet itself will blow out to release pressure. These safety devices usually require replacement when activated by excess pressure. Newer pressure cookers may have a self-resettable spring device, fixed onto the lid, that releases excess pressure.|$|E

(2002) detected a subsidence source at a shallow depth in Kiska Island using Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) data. They speculated that vigorous <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> caused {{a decrease in the}} pore fluid pressure within a shallow hydrothermal system and subsidence of the ground surface. Hamling et al. (2016) presented InSAR results that showed 3 -year-long local subsidence after a phreatic eruption at Tongariro Volcano in 2012. They concluded that the subsidence source was a hydrothermal reservoir emplaced just beneath low-conductivity zones that were regarded as the low permeability sealing layer. Likewise, Nakaboh et al. (2003) discussed the relationship between deflation and <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> after a phreatic eruption in 1995 at Kuju Volcano. They showed a clear temporal correlation between the temporal vapor mass flux and deflation rate, indicating that the post-eruptive deflation was caused by <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> from a deflating reservoir. They concluded that {{a large portion of the}} discharged steam originated deeper than the deflation source by comparing the total discharge mass with the mass loss calculated from the decreased volume. Thus, geophysical data obtained during and after eruptive events give us the opportunity to derive important insights about hydrothermal systems that would be otherwise unobtainable.|$|E

Four distinct microfacies of siliceous stromatolitic sinter formation and their associated microbiota were elucidated from acid-sulphate-chloride hot spring outflows (pH 2. 1 - 2. 3, 91 - 30 °C), located on the floodplain of Parariki Stream, ~ 1 km north of Lake Rotokawa in the Rotokawa Geothermal Field.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{related to}} <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> into sub-cooled water {{was carried out}} with a scaled down condensation pool test facility at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The vertical blowdown pipe was submerged by 1. 81 m and thermally insulated. Condensation took place only at the steam-water interface near the pipe outlet. Since very low steam flow rates (1. 0 … 1. 5 g/s) were used, the steamwater interface remained steady close to the pipe outlet. Several quasi-steady intervals suitable for the validation of direct contact condensation models can be found from the experiment data. Simulations with the Hughes-Duffey based DCC model of the NEPTUNE CFD code indicated two orders of magnitude higher condensation rates than the experiment. This overestimation was reduced by one order of magnitude by decreasing the numerical truncation parameter and by disabling the residual droplet handling.

Temperatures of nonthermal springs on Mount Hood decrease with elevation and {{are similar to}} air temperatures from nearby weather stations. Dissolved constituents in nonthermal springs generally increase with spring temperatures and reflect weathering of volcanic rock from the action of dissolved carbon dioxide. Isotopic contents of nonthermal springs follow a local meteoric water line and generally become lighter with elevation. Some nonthermal springs at low-elevation have light values of isotopes indicating a high-elevation source for the water. Three hydrothermal systems have been identified on Mount Hood. Swim Warm Springs is interpreted to have a source water that boiled from 187 °C, re-equilibrated at 96 °C, and then mixed with nonthermal water to produce the range of compositions found in various springs. The Meadows Spring is interpreted to have a source water that boiled from 223 °C, re-equilibrated at 94 °C, and then mixed with nonthermal water to produce the range of compositions found in the spring over several years.

Only the upper part of geothermal reservoir was penetrated by drillholes (up to 1200 m), therefore they have used a mathematical modeling to assess the conditions of water and heat feeding of the hydrothermal system. The hydrothermal system belongs to a linear fracturing zone of NW trend, therefore the two-dimensional model was used in the calculations. It has been defined that (1) the source of heating is a magma chamber located at a shallow depth; (2) the heat and mass transfer in the geothermal reservoir is defined by free and forced hydraulic convection, (3) the conductivity coefficient of a linear fracturing zone is 400 - 600 m{sup 2 }/day, its width is 2 km and length is 10 km, and (4) the water feeding is defined by infiltration in the recharge area.

The PCCS condenser must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure. The efficient performance of the PCCS condenser is thus vital to the safety of the reactor. In PCCS condenser tube three flow conditions are expected namely the forced flow, cyclic venting and complete condensation modes.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{quantity}} of natural <b>steam</b> <b>discharged</b> from fumaroles or drill-holes in geothermal areas. The flow of steam in underground layers {{is characterized by the}} condition of conservation of enthalpy, so far as it is assumed thermally insulated to the surrounding medium. Therefore, as to the steam originating from deep thermal water, a state of superheat can be observed at each pressure level as it rises to ground surface. The highest possible limit of its temperature is 163 °C at 1 atm. Velocity of fluid ejected from a pipe is known to be unable to exceed the local velocity of sound at the outlet. This limitation is adapted to the flow in a well ejecting steam or boiling water. The sound velocity in the two-phase system of saturated steam and water are calculated at various pressures and mixing ratios. The result shows nearly linear relation of pressure and discharge rate for the flow, the velocity of which is equal to that of sound. The fluid pressure at the orifice is considered to be nearly always equal to the external atmospheric pressure for the well from which the ejecting velocity is below the sound velocity under atmospheric pressure but it becomes higher and is governed by the discharge rate through the well which has higher velocity of ejection than the above. Discharge rates from such boiling wells are then restricted. The well ejecting superheated steam must has a different limit of discharge to preserve its superheated temperature. This limit is obtained by the continuity of energy flux and is shown to be lower than that given by the sound velocity for most of superheated range. Such states are compared with observations...|$|R

Sutton (AMD*) and M. L. Sorey (PEL). Geometry and boundary influences are dominant and estimated steam flows are higher than are consistent with the Corey (1954) expressions for relative permeability. Both of these effects are probably due to the fracture permeability of the reservoirs. A.

This report considers the causes of failure of the inner and outer diffusers. A geothermal discharge silencer with steam input line is shown in Figure 1; Figure 2 shows several failed stainless steel diffusers. This report is part of a continuing DOE effort to gain insight into component materials employed in geothermal energy utilization. The results of these analyses will be incorporated into the next issue of DOE's Material Selection Guidelines for Geothermal Energy Systems. The first commercial production of electricity from geothermal energy in the western hemisphere occurred in 1960 at The Geysers, a vapor-dominated resource located in Sonoma and Lake counties, California. Steam from numerous geothermal wells is supplied to fifteen generating units with a combined capacity of over 900 Mw(e). When a turbine is tripped off-line, steam is discharged through a silencer for noise abatement, as required by environmental regulations. The silencer at Unit 15 consists of two double-walled cylindrical diffusers mounted horizontally in the base of a discharge tower (Figure 1). During a trip, approximately 550, 000 lb{sub m}/hr of steam at 350 F is vented through the silencer. The duration of a trip cycle varies from several hours to a full week.

40|$|Masaya volcano, Nicaragua, {{has been}} the site of {{tremendous}} Plinian basaltic eruptions. Two eruptions ~ 6, 500 and 2, 250 BP formed the 6 kilometer (km) x 11 km, northwest trending Masaya caldera. The present day active Santiago Crater within the caldera {{is the site of}} persistent volcano degassing and occasional phreatic explosions. While the mechanism responsible for these phreatic explosions is unclear, one possible explanation is the interaction of groundwater with the shallow magma chamber beneath Masaya. This interaction with meteoric water is supported by the substantial <b>steam</b> <b>discharge</b> from the vent, which is significantly larger than other similar volcanoes in the world. To better understand these interactions, the distribution of groundwater was characterized for the volcano based on interpretation of 29 Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) soundings. The TEM data were modeled using two independent methods to estimate resistivity as a function of depth. Results from modeling the TEM data indicate an overlying highly resistive layer throughout the caldera that is underlain by one or more conductive layers. The implied water table of the caldera is expressed as a subdued replica of the topography in the higher vent regions in the central and southern portions of the caldera and decreases to a level that coincides with the elevation Lake Masaya in the lower sections of the caldera. The water table elevation in the caldera also shows a marked difference from the regional groundwater flow system as there is a large gradient in head values suggesting a sharp change in transmissivity along the caldera boundaries, which indicate the caldera is hydraulically isolated from the surrounding region. In order to better understand the hydrologic processes at Masaya caldera, a 3 -D finite difference groundwater model was created using the 29 estimated water levels and two groundwater flux measurements to simulate the hydrologic system The model calibration revealed that a deep, highly permeable layer must feed the active vent in order for the steam emissions to be maintained at their current levels.

To satisfy the above objective, the following areas were studied and addressed: (1) study the analytical models of round turbulent jets, (2) to model the turbulent jets using commercially available CFD codes, (3) measure steam convection and stratification pattern within the PUMA Drywell and compare against numerical models. ^ The analytical approach is limited because the solutions for complex geometry and boundary conditions are not readily available. However, the analytical studies provided the necessary understanding of the physical processes involved in turbulent <b>steam</b> jet <b>discharge</b> and convection. From this analytical study, a new mechanistic model of turbulence eddy viscosity model is introduced to replace the ad hoc model recently proposed. ^ Numerical modeling of the current problem allows greater flexibility.

The constructors of nuclear facilities, the operating energy companies in NPP and national regulators are well {{aware of the importance of}} the safety aspect. DCC is applied to improve the safety in a BWR on off-normal conditions and accident transients, such as a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). This study will focus not only on the suppression pool in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) but also on the suppression tank in the Vacuum Vessel Pressure Suppression System (VVPSS) in ITER...|$|R
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives (CAAs) appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 536 : Area 3 Release Site, Nevada Test Site, Nevada, under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 536 consists of a single Corrective Action Site (CAS) : 03 - 44 - 02, <b>Steam</b> Jenny <b>Discharge.</b> The CAU 536 site is being investigated because existing information on {{the nature and extent}} of possible contamination is insufficient to evaluate and recommend corrective action alternatives for CAS 03 - 44 - 02. The additional information will be obtained by conducting a corrective action investigation (CAI) prior to evaluating CAAs and selecting the appropriate corrective action for this CAS. The results of this field investigation are to be used to support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document. Record of Technical Change No. 1 is dated 3 - 2004...|$|R
40|$|Steam trap is {{the most}} {{important}} link in the condensate loop because it connects steam usage with condensate return. The function of steam trap is to discharge condensate while not permitting the escape of live steam. For the efficient usage of steam inside the process equipment, the steam should be kept inside the device until the complete steam is transformed into condensate. For thi s to be happen the steam trap functioning will be in perfect condition. The main objective of the study is to analyse the operating characte ristics of the presently installed steam trap and their effects on the efficiency of heat transfer in their respective process applications. From the study it may clear that trap failure may be of two-live <b>steam</b> to <b>discharge</b> and <b>steam</b> leak. Trap failure may also result in the water logging of heat exchangers of textile processing units. All these may results in excessive steam usage and it directly have an economy impact. This thesis work is an analytical study of steam traps to improve the steam system efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti's {{geography}} of Georgia, finalized in 1745, Akhtala [...] "is {{said to be}} a former village and buried by wrath; tar is <b>discharged,</b> <b>steaming,</b> and brings on the surface spoons, jars, and peasants' commodities". By the time the British diplomat Oliver Wardrop visited Georgia in 1887, Akhtala had already been used as a spa, [...] "a muddy hollow in which are slime baths, resorted to by persons suffering from rheumatism, scrofula, and many other diseases; the baths are simply round holes full of mud, in the middle of which an evil-smelling gas slowly bubbles up; the largest bath of all is reserved for cattle".|$|R
40|$|This Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 536 : Area 3 Release Site, Nevada Test Site (NTS), Nevada, {{in accordance with the}} Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) that was agreed to by the State of Nevada, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U. S Department of Defense (FFACO, 1996). The NTS is approximately 65 miles (mi) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada (Figure 1 - 1). Corrective Action Unit 536 is comprised of a single Corrective Action Site (CAS), 03 - 44 - 02, <b>Steam</b> Jenny <b>Discharge,</b> and is located in Area 3 of the NTS (Figure 1 - 2). The CAU was investigated in accordance with the Corrective Action Investigation Plan (CAIP) and Record of Technical Change (ROTC) No. 1 (NNSA/NV, 2003). The CADD provides or references the specific information necessary to support the recommended corrective action alternative selected to complete closure of the site. The CAU 536, Area 3 Release Site, includes the <b>Steam</b> Jenny <b>Discharge</b> (CAS 03 - 44 - 02) that was historically used for steam cleaning equipment in the Area 3 Camp. Concerns at this CAS include contaminants commonly associated with steam cleaning operations and Area 3 Camp activities that include total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), unspecified solvents, radionuclides, metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The CAIP for Corrective Action Unit 536 : Area 3 Release Site, Nevada Test Site, Nevada (NNSA/NV, 2003), provides additional information relating to the history, planning, and scope of the investigation; therefore, it will not be repeated in this CADD. This CADD identifies potential corrective action alternatives and provides a rationale for the selection of a recommended corrective action alternative for the CAS within CAU 536. The evaluation of corrective action alternatives is based on process knowledge and the results of the investigative activities conducted in accordance with the CAIP (NNSA/NV, 2003) that was approved {{prior to the start of}} the corrective action investigation (CAI). Record of Technical Change No. 1 to the CAIP documents changes to the PALs agreed to by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) and DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). This ROTC provides the justification for changing from background-based to dose-based radiological PALs. This ROTC was approved and the dose-based PAL comparison implemented on March 9, 2004...|$|R
