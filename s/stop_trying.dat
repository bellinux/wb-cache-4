5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to <b>stop</b> <b>trying</b> to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E

Raoul realizes {{that they can use}} the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E

To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked.

With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E

Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we <b>stop</b> <b>trying.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the English {{captured}} Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled after freeing their slaves. The slaves dispersed {{into the}} mountains, joining the maroons, {{those who had}} previously escaped {{to live with the}} Taíno native people. During the centuries of slavery, Maroons established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations. The Jamaican Maroons fought the British during the 18th century. Under treaties of 1738 and 1739, the British agreed to <b>stop</b> <b>trying</b> to round them up in exchange for their leaving the colonial settlements alone, but serving if needed for military actions. Some of the communities were broken up and the British deported Maroons to Nova Scotia and, later, Sierra Leone. The name is still used today by modern Maroon descendants, who have certain rights and autonomy at the community of Accompong.|$|E
25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) get killed by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never <b>stop</b> <b>trying</b> to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E

Both have suffered from sell-outs and hypocrites, but also from true believers whose devotion had crippled their creative drive. Both are viewed by outsiders as unified, cohesive communities when nothing can be further from the truth. Michael Muhammad Knight ...|$|R

500|$|In 1985, {{the song}} was {{included}} on the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) [...] "Filthy Fifteen" [...] list, for the sexual content of its lyrics. The Center's founder Tipper Gore had heard her daughter listening to the song, and considered the line [...] "Gonna dress you up in my love" [...] as exemplifying 'vulgar music'. The PMRC called upon the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to give parents a consumer-friendly means of identifying rock records unsuitable for minors– a rating system based on lyrical content. [...] "Dress You Up" [...] received a rating of 'S', for [...] "sex and obscenity", from the RIAA. Gore commented on the song: [...] "Popular culture is morally bankrupt, flagrantly licentious and utterly materialistic—and Madonna is the worst of all." [...] According to Bruce David Forbes and H.

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.
