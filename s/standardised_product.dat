40|$|The study {{analyses}} how product strategies {{change when}} ICT equipment manufacturing companies {{move from the}} international to the global stage and what factors are expected to explain this development. Product strategy evolution is described in three dimensions - product platforms, product lines, and individual products - {{and in terms of}} three product strategy alternatives developed {{on the basis of the}} standardisation degree. They are called the localised, modified, and <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> strategies. A theoretical framework and working propositions were constructed by analysing the existing theoretical approaches. The framework developed consists of four explaining blocks: first the macro and industry environment, second the corporate level strategies, third the business level strategies, and finally the internal strategic levers, resources/capabilities and decision-making variables. In the empirical part, development of the product strategies of five Finnish ICT equipment manufacturers was analysed with the multiple case research method. It was found that the globalising internationals are developing towards more <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> strategy alternatives, the product assortment is becoming wider and also more advanced product categories are increasingly used, not only goods, but also services, know-how and systems during globalisation. Moreover, global product platforms and horizontal co-operation are increasingly important for ICT companies. This research will contribute theoretically in a number of areas. The globalisation of international companies has been studied very little and a better understanding of this process is valuable. Also, a detailed analysis of the evolution of the product strategies of globalising internationals in the ICT equipment manufacturing field during globalisation is an important contribution. The research contributes further by developing a theoretical framework and by putting forward a number of propositions explaining this evolution. These are expected to be useful for future research in this area. The managerial contributions stem from the understanding of the available product strategy alternatives and their expected development during the often critical transformation period from international towards global companies. Finally, the study suggests that the generalizability of the framework and propositions developed herein could be tested in a large international survey in ICT or some other similar field. Moreover, it would be interesting to compare the results of the product strategies of globalising internationals found in this study with research on born globals. In future in addition to products, also channels, brands, pricing and the operation strategies of globalising internationals could be studied. Moreover, a deeper understanding of co-operation with different value network members could bring interesting findings. It would also be interesting to extend the study from the strategic business unit level to the corporate leve...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the re-emergence and modernisation of traditional goat cheese production in Sweden, {{in particular in}} the northern county of Jämtland. The data have been gathered through fieldwork and interviews with goat farmers, authorities and others involved {{in the production of}} goat cheese. As early as the 1970 s, a number of initiatives were taken to formalise the productive activities of this sector and to improve product quality. The most important project was the launch of the cooperative Jämtspira {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s. In contrast to other Swedish cooperatives, this organisation involved its members in developing a common trademark and a <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> range, undertaking joint marketing efforts, and finding creative solutions to infrastructure problems. Jämtland was strengthened and modernised, largely owing to the active part played by regional authorities in this process. The national artisan centre Eldrimner, which became a hub for small-scale food production, is another important institution that has strengthened local knowledge and taught cheesemaking skills to new goat farmers from all over Sweden. Although many obstacles have been removed and the sector has found successful solutions to strategic issues relating to product development and marketing, there are still significant structural shortcomings that could reduce profitability and endanger the future development of the sector. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 125 13 -month-old, entire males of the Pirenaica breed were {{selected}} from among the progeny of nine dif-ferent sires. They were used to study the intrabreed variability of 41 carcass and meat traits, including weights, lengths, diameters and perimeters, grading parameters, dissection of the sixth rib, pH, colour and meat texture variables, and sensory attributes. Pearson correlations were also calculated. Coefficients of variation ranged from 3. 5 % for dressing percentage to 47. 0 % for fat red index, {{and all of the}} values could be considered within the normal range for cattle. Car-cass traits showed lower variability (11. 7 % on average) than meat variables (14. 8 % on average). Hence, to achieve a <b>standardised</b> <b>product,</b> it would be desirable to include in the breeding selection programme a variable that could be measured on the carcass and that can predict meat quality.

40|$|Wright (1990) argues {{the origins}} of American {{industrial}} success are in the institutions that enabled exploitation of natural resources. These institutions, argue David and Wright (1997), included the state and US geological surveys and universities that worked closely with industry. However, their work does not directly analyse how US re- source intensive manufacturers directly competed with their European predecessors. In this paper we analyse {{the rise of the}} US cement industry, the features of which closely resembles the pattern described by David and Wright. This was in part due to the US successfully adapting a more resource intensive production technology from England, and a rise in demand due to the gradual diffusion of reinforced concrete. Consistent with David and Wright, there is some direct evidence of university-industry links and econometric evidence of geological surveys creating a first mover advantage. However, it is argued the rise in the US industry would not have occurred without adapting German methods of quality control and <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> and test specifications, and to credibly signal this. This is supported by the failure of the US industry to become a large scale exporter (while European firms continued to do so).

It exploits archived historic and recent aerial photographs (a data source that has remained consistent over the last 60 years) to assess land cover change around Natura 2000 sites within 30 x 30 km windows and 15 x 2 km transects. The CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) land cover mapping methodology has been adapted for use with aerial photographs. Sample sites are mapped to CORINE Land Cover (CLC) classes, and then backdated to assess change. Results from eight UK transects (and associated windows) are presented. Changes in land cover classes are interpreted as pressures: urbanisation, intensification, abandonment, afforestation, deforestation and drainage. Urbanisation was the major pressure in all but two transects (both in the uplands), and intensification was of similar importance in most transects. Afforestation was a significant pressure in two transects. In six out of the eight transects, annual change was greater in the 1990 – 2000 period than in the 1950 – 1990 period. The methodology has been demonstrated to provide quantitative results of long-term land cover change in the UK rural landscape at a spatial scale that is relevant to management decisions.

Manufacturers and retailers were given a 12 -month transition period.   Methods: An observational study was conducted using monthly Electronic Point of Sale data from 500 small retailers in England, Scotland, and Wales, between May 2016 and May 2017. The 20 top selling tobacco products (15 FMC, 5 RYO) were monitored to observe when standardised packs were first introduced, the proportion of retailers selling each fully branded and <b>standardised</b> <b>product,</b> and the average number of monitored fully branded and standardised products sold by each retailer. The number of unique tobacco-related product codes sold by each retailer was also recorded each month.   Results: Eighteen of the fully branded products continued to be sold throughout the transition period and no standardised variants were sold in the first five months. It was not until month eleven that the average number of standardised products sold by retailers exceeded the fully branded products. The average number of unique tobacco-related product codes sold by each retailer decreased by a third over the transition period.   Conclusions: Tobacco companies used the transition period to delay the removal of fully branded products and gradually introduce standardised variants. This staggered introduction may have mitigated some of the immediate intended effects of the legislation by desensitising consumers to new pack designs...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{production management}} strategy in paper manufacturing {{is based on}} a volume-intensive approach. This involves the measurement of overall performance or productivity, while aiming at a high level of capacity utilisation and minimum waste levels. This approach has proved successful in mills producing high volumes with a limited and <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> range. The situation changes radically when paper and board products are being tailored to customer-specified dimensions and quantities. The volume-based approach is no longer appropriate, and production has to be controlled by an approach that considers inventory performance along the full length of the supply chains. This paper presents five empirical examples to illustrate the use of the two strategies. The detailed analyses of production cycles, the logistical solutions applied and the inventory levels at various stages of the supply chain, show that the Nordic paper industry is slow, with average lead times of 79 days to market. When production cycles are reduced and logistical alternatives are fully exploited, {{it can be seen that}} 30 % of the inventories can be regarded as slack. The summary of the cases shows that speedier operations easily generate direct cost savings amounting to 2 - 5 % of annual turnover. All these results can be achieved without additional investment; all that is required is a change in production planning principles and logistical control procedures. The paper concludes with a challenge to the Nordic paper industry to be the first in its field to achieve the higher level of productivity that faster operations can generate.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} of {{economies and}} trade growth {{have made it}} necessary for international companies to communicate with consumers of different languages and cultures, since a major objective is to sell a <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> to consumers with linguistic and cultural backgrounds which {{are different from those}} to which the manufacturers are accustomed. Once brought to a foreign country, the sales of a product must be promoted by way of advertising. To begin with, the method of advertising depends on the kind of product to be marketed. In addition, persuasive texts, which are characteristic of the language of advertising, not only employ particular pragmatic strategies, but are based on the values and cultural traditions of the relevant society. In different cultures different signs, symbols, names and customs will be used in different situations. In the case of the translation or localisation of advertisements, a translator must be very sensitive to the loss and gain of cultural elements. These could include objects, historical references, customs and habits that are unique to the source culture and not present in the target culture. The main focus of the research is on the culture-specific elements in advertising texts and their depiction in translation. This treatise investigates certain aspects of translation theory (such as theories of equivalence, Skopos theory and other similar theories) to form a basis for conducting this study and then adapts them to the process of translation.

40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{conducted}} an assessment {{on the use}} of flavouring substances in infant and follow-on formula and in foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children. In the opinion of the BfR, flavouring substances are neither required to improve acceptance of such products nor to support development of taste sensation. […] Since infant formula is a <b>standardised</b> <b>product,</b> even the addition of flavouring substances does not provide the spectrum of flavours that breast milk offers infants. Based on the current state of knowledge, flavoured infant foods cannot, therefore, support the development of a baby’s sense of taste and smell in the way that breast milk can. Babies are especially vulnerable during {{the first few months of}} life: the body’s detoxification systems […]. Therefore, international expert committees emphasise that the ADI values derived for food additives are not to be applied to babies up to the age of 12 weeks. […] The BfR is of the opinion that the rationale behind the use of food additives in baby food should also apply to the use of flavouring substances in baby foods. […] flavouring substances should be used neither in the production of infant formula nor in balanced diets intended for babies aged less than three months. If, under exceptional circumstances, their use is however deemed necessary, the flavouring substances intended to be used require, like any food additives, special case-by-case assessment. In addition, there are indications that sensory experience during infancy influence the development of the sense of taste and thus may have implications on subsequent dietary preferences. However, the currently available data are not sufficient to assess the consequences of the use of flavouring substances in infant formula for later dietary behaviour and related health risks...|$|E
40|$|Background: As Porter’s diamond (1990) suggested, the {{business}} environment highly influences firms’ strategies. Today, {{most of the}} companies have to decide their strategy depending from a worldwide business environment. Yet, strategy researches and the growing importance of marketing for business success also show that customer dimension {{must be taken into}} consideration. On some markets and in certain industries, the offer is much higher than the demand and then, companies need to attract customers. On the national level, companies multiply customer surveys in order to reach their expectations. On the global level, this is more complicated. Adaptation seeks to customise product offerings to be more tailored to a particular culture’s needs and tastes, and thus, can gather a greater market share than would be allowed by offering only a <b>standardised</b> <b>product.</b> In this thesis, we decide to look deeper at industry circumstances, corporation’s customisation strategies and competitive advantages of customisation in order to know whether companies can use customisation to be more profitable. We also want to investigate how the development situation of the industry and the function of customer orientation influence the company’s strategies; and how companies use their customer adaptation strategies to adapt their products and marketing to local markets. Purpose: The purpose of our work is to develop companies’ awareness on the effects of customisation and of adapting their products to customer behaviours by developing customers’ point of view and by comparing it to companies’ strategies. Results: According to the research results, Nestlé has adopted the customised strategies to adapt to French and Chinese dairy markets. Based on the Sheth’s model, we refined a new model by completing Sheth’s one with two dimensions - customer focus dimension and market type dimension. We characterised the customer orientation strategy and the standardisationstrategy, which are the two principal choices the companies need to do regarding the product design. Moreover, to add a new element in those well-known strategies, we introduced a nuance into the corporate strategies depending on the aiming market situation...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{spring barley}} {{varieties}} {{have been developed}} {{with the aim of}} combining high productivity and <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> quality under high-input conditions using pesticides for control of weeds, diseases and insects as well as heavy application of nutrient-rich and water-soluble inorganic fertilizers. In the organic growing system, biotic and abiotic stresses have to be overcome by growing the appropriate varieties and by practicing good farm management. The important spring barley traits to be considered in organic farming are related to the inherited viability and adaptation of plants to survive biotic and abiotic stresses and includes competitive ability (morphology, weed tolerance, growth rate, allelopathy), disease resistance (morphology, specific and non-specific resistance proporties, disease tolerance) and nutrient acquisition ability (root morphology, nutrient uptake and use efficiencies, low-nutrient tolerance, symbioses). An important question is whether modern spring barley varieties possess the right combinations of these characteristics to ensure a stable and acceptable yield of good quality when grown under different organic growing conditions. We know that varieties often perform and yield differently in different environments due to genotype-environment interactions, so it may be important to evaluate characteristics of varieties in organic as well as in conventional farming systems. However, it remains unclear to date whether the differences between the conventional and the organic growing systems are large enough to justify breeding and testing of varieties in both environments. Extensive field experiments and refined statistical methods are needed to clarify this. Characterisation of varieties as part of the official variety testing is at present done under conventional farming conditions in Denmark. The aim of a newly started inter-institutional Danish research project within The Danish Research Center for Organic Farming (DARCOF) with project participants from The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Risø National Laboratory is to Identify combinations of plant characteristics required for a barley crop to be successful in organic growing systems and develop methodologies for measuring these characteristics. Evaluate, by investigating genotype-environment interactions, the need for specific variety trials for organic farming, and if necessary implement such trials. Improve yield and yield stability in different organic farming systems by strategic use of the appropriate varieties and variety mixtures. Investigate the potential of different variety mixtures for reducing diseases and weeds and increasing nutrient uptake efficiency. Obtain new knowledge on plant competition, disease complexes, epidemiological models, nutrient acquisition and associations between molecular markers and agronomical traits. The results of the first-year trials on three organic workshop areas and in two conventional fields with about 120 mostly modern varieties and a few variety mixtures will be discussed. The preliminary analyses indicate large variation in yield between the different varieties. ...|$|E

30|$|The primary {{objective}} of {{strategy is to}} create a competitive advantage (Barney and Hesterly 2010). Competitive advantage is the ability to produce greater economic value than competing firms (Porter 1985 a; Barney and Hesterly 2008, 2010; Lin et al. 1981; Sonka 2003). Porter (1998) identifies three generic strategies firms can use to achieve competitive advantage. The first, a cost leadership strategy, emphasises efficiency and the production of high volumes of <b>standardised</b> <b>products.</b> This provides customers with similar products as competitors but at a lower cost. The second, described as a differentiation strategy, attempts to create products that consumers will pay more for because of attributes they value. The third strategy identifies the breadth of the targeted market segment, where firms attempt to better meet the specific customer needs for a particular market segment. This can involve either a low cost or a differentiated strategy depending of the mature of the market segment.|$|R
40|$|Hypericum perforatum is a herbal {{medicine}} {{that has been}} used for centuries for the treatment of depression. Many studies have been conducted in the Northern hemisphere on the efficacy of the HP extracts produced there. These studies include clinical trials and pharmacological investigations using a standardised HP extract or a fraction of the HP extract containing certain compounds, such as hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin and several of the flavonoids thought to be responsible for the antidepressant activity. The mechanism of action of HP and its constituents is still not completely clear and it is speculated that the antidepressant activity is the result of several of the compounds acting synergistically. HP is indigenous to and also cultivated in the Western Cape of South Africa. Extracts from these plants are sold in the local health shops and there are no previous studies evaluating the efficacy of these products. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the antidepressant activity of one of these products and two of its constituents, quercetin and caffeic acid, to gain further insight into their mode of antidepressant action and to compare these results with similar studies which used a standardised extract produced in the northern hemisphere. The first study investigated the effect of HP, quercetin and caffeic acid on pineal metabolism. Changes in the synthesis of melatonin produced by the pineal gland have been implicated in depression. The results showed an increase in the level of melatonin produced in the animals treated with quercetin, which suggests that this compound may mediate antidepressant activity through such a mechanism. There are no previous reports on the in vivo effects of HP or any of its constituents on pineal metabolism. The second study investigated the effect of HP, quercetin and caffeic acid on the activity of the liver enzyme, tryptophan- 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO). Inhibition of this enzyme has been shown to increase plasma levels of tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin and thereby result in increased serotonin levels in the brain. Low levels of serotonin in the brain have been implicated in depression. This study revealed significant inhibition of TDO by caffeic acid and this suggests that this constituent of HP could be contributing to its antidepressant activity through such a mechanism. There are no previous reports investigating the in vivo effect of HP or any of its constituents on TDO activity. Modulation of the levels of indoleamines, serotonin (5 -HT) and dopamine (DA) as well as the metabolites, 3, 4 dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid (5 -HIAA) and homovallinic acid (HVA) in the brain have been implicated in the neuropharmacology of depression. Different studies using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to determine changes in the levels of these indoleamines brought about after treatment with HP caffeic acid and quercetin. The results of the ELISA study showed significant increases in 5 -HT levels in the brains of the animals treated with caffeic acid and quercetin. The results of the HPLC-ECD studies also revealed significant increases in 5 -HT levels and a decrease in the turnover of 5 -HT in the animals treated with quercetin. A significant increase in DA levels in the animals treated with quercetin was shown in both the HPLC-ECD and LC-MS studies. There was also an increase in DA turnover in the animals treated with HP shown in the HPLC-ECD and LC-MS studies. These results suggest that HP and its constituents, quercetin and caffeic acid mediate their antidepressant effects through serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Adaptive changes in the density of b-adrenergic (b-AR), 5 -HT 2 and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated in depression. Several studies, investigating the effect of treatment with HP and quercetin on these different receptor densities, were undertaken using radioactive binding assays. Treatment with HP resulted in significant down regulation of b-AR and NMDA receptor densities and up-regulation of 5 HT 2 receptors. The effects on the b-AR and 5 -HT 2 receptors are similar to the results reported using HP in the Northern hemisphere, but the effect on the NMDA receptors is novel providing insight into the mode of action of HP. Apoptosis of neuronal cells has been implicated in neuro-degenerative and depressive disorders. Detection of apoptosis, using fluorescent microscopy observed through the labelling of DNA strand breaks, showed a decrease in the amount of apoptosis in the animals treated with HP and quercetin. This adds further support for the use of HP as an antidepressant and these results are similar to results reported from the Northern hemisphere. The results of all these studies suggest that the quality of the locally produced tincture is similar in efficacy to that of the <b>standardised</b> <b>product</b> of the Northern hemisphere. ...|$|E
40|$|Protected Denominations of Origin (PDO) DOC/DOCG {{labelling}} is a {{key factor}} in qualifying wines for premium positioning and requires a batch-level institutional approval based on chemical and physical analyses and a gustative assay by a commission of experts. The highly <b>standardised</b> <b>products</b> required by international markets requires a critical assessment {{of the quality of the}} process generating the assaying commission counsel so that well-known denominated wine products, hold and possibly expand, their market position. The present study was carried out to investigate the relations between electronic nose analysis and judgebased sensory analysis and the assaying commission counsel to address possible ways to 'inject' quality assurance tools and concepts in the pipeline of the 'institutional filter' of the Prosecco-area DOC/DOCG. Chemical analysis and of chemometrics proved good predictors of the assaying commission counsel, while significant deviations between the outcomes of the panel and commission evaluations. The role of the electronic nose detection and of chemical/physical analyses in helping resolve such discrepancies is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{of these}} clay lamps were shaped using moulds in {{workshops}} {{that turned out}} large numbers of <b>standardised</b> <b>products.</b> Some {{of the most popular}} forms incorporated a central , a circular area usually around 4-6 cm. in diameter, that incorporated the filling-hole and could be ornamented with pictorial motifs in low relief. The range of decoration included pagan deities, myths and legends, genre scenes from everyday life, animals, hunting, public entertainments such as gladiatorial combat and chariot-racing, erotic encounters, and in late-Roman times, some Christian symbolism: in short, the full range of subjects that occur in the Roman decorative arts (Jewish lamps with symbols such as the menorah are also found). [...] Types and decoration initiated at the centre of Empire, in Italy, were often imitated in products made in workshops located in other provinces. Lamps could be directly copied by the process known as , using an existing lamp as the archetype for producing the mould, rather than creating a hand-modelled clay archetype.|$|R
2500|$|It is usual {{to divide}} Roman {{domestic}} pottery broadly into coarse wares and fine wares, the former being the everyday pottery jars, dishes and bowls {{that were used}} for cooking or the storage and transport of foods and other goods, {{and in some cases}} also as tableware, and which were often made and bought locally. Fine wares were serving vessels or tableware used for more formal dining, and are usually of more decorative and elegant appearance. Some of {{the most important of these}} were made at specialised pottery workshops, and were often traded over substantial distances, not only within, but also between, different provinces of the Roman Empire. For example, dozens of different types of British coarse and fine wares were produced locally, yet many other classes of pottery were also imported from elsewhere in the Empire. The manufacture of fine wares such as [...] took place in large workshop complexes that were organised along industrial lines and produced highly <b>standardised</b> <b>products</b> that lend themselves well to precise and systematic classification.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{endeavours}} of enterprises and other organisations has shifted from the production and sales of <b>standardised</b> <b>products</b> and services to tailor-made products according to individual customers’ requirements. Flexibility, creativity and innovation have become of utmost importance. Although many authors have argued that large enterprises are unable {{to adapt to the}} required changes, such predictions have not been realised. On the contrary, large corporations have adapted to the changes, mainly by changing and developing their organisation. Thus, changes in organisational structure, organisational culture and organisational processes have led to creativity and innovation in large enterprises. In {{the first part of the}} article, we attempt to show these adaptations briefly and systematically. In the second part, we review research on this issue and its results in large Slovenian enterprises, in order to prove the hypothesis that large Slovenian enterprises have also changed their organisation to adequately develop their creativity and innovation. We also attempt to prove that creativity and innovation have resulted in improvements of efficiency and effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Organisations {{implement}} operational {{strategies in}} order to develop and stay competitive in a changing business environment. However, the strategy needs to be anchored and understood by the employees {{in order to}} become successful on a long-term basis. This paper is based on a case study of a large construction company specialised in new construction of multi-dwelling buildings. Five years ago, the company initiated Structured Production, which is an operational strategy based on lean philosophy. The aim of the paper is to identify how middle managers, lower managers and craftsmen perceive how operational strategies is implemented in the company. First, the strategy and the rational behind the decision to implement the strategy is presented. This section is based on document analysis as well as on interviews with upper managers in the company. Then, middle managers, lower managers and craftsmen’ perceptions of the strategy is presented. This section is based on a questionnaire study made 2014. The study shows that the strategy is perceived to focus on structuring and <b>standardising</b> <b>products</b> and processes, while less focus is on the organisation and its members...|$|R
