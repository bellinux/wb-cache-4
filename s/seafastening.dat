40|$|The {{topic for}} this master thesis is {{transportation}} of heavy platform modules on barges. The {{goal is to}} find the short-term extreme accelerations, or design accelerations, that are limiting for the feasibility of the transportation operation. Motion response analyses have been performed for six different combinations of barges and module weights as follows: Barge                            Module 300 feet                  1000 tonnes﻿ 300 feet                   3000 tonnes 400 feet                  1000 tonnes 400 feet                   5000 tonnes 600 feet                   5000 tonnes 600 feet                   8000 tonnes It has been observed that the roll acceleration is overestimated in non-viscous motion analyses of barge type vessels. Thus for the first case an additional analysis including viscous roll damping has been performed. The software used to perform the analyses and the theory used has been reviewed. The following programs are described: Genie – modelling of the barge (hull, ballast tanks) HydroD (WADAM) – modelling of environment, hydrodynamic analysis by source technique Postresp – combination and printing of motion characteristics Matlab – statistical postprocessing, calculation of design accelerations The founding theories are linear potential wave theory and source technique. The viscous roll damping, which in reality is non-linear, was estimated in a linearised form using strip theory and empirical data. Based on the calculated motion characteristics, the design accelerations are estimated by short-term statistics, meaning the extreme accelerations are estimated in 3 hour seastates. This was performed for four different significant wave heights and all relevant wave periods. The accelerations are calculated in the system centre of gravity, module centre of gravity and top and bottom corners of the module. The limiting criterion of a barge transportation is normally the forces the <b>seafastening</b> can withstand, thus the acceleration on the <b>seafastening</b> has been examined closer. Aker Solutions have roughly defined the <b>seafastening</b> capacity by setting absolute limits for the accelerations in the longitudinal, transverse and vertical direction. Compared to the criteria for accelerations given by Aker Solutions, the results proved that the acceleration in the transverse direction is the limiting factor. Beam seas close to the roll eigenperiod gave the highest accelerations on the <b>seafastening</b> both in the transverse and vertical direction, suggesting that these accelerations are governed by the roll motion. When viscous roll damping was included, there was a significant reduction in the transverse acceleration, and a slightly smaller reduction in the vertical acceleration on the <b>seafastening</b> compared to the non-viscous case. However, the transverse acceleration was still the most critical with respect to the given criteria. There was little or no effect of viscous roll damping on longitudinal design accelerations. Design accelerations for a 1000 tonne module were found for two different barges, a 300 feet barge and a 400 feet barge. The accelerations proved significantly smaller on the 400 feet barge, especially in the transverse direction. A 5000 tonne module was also tested on two different barges, a 400 feet barge and a 600 feet barge. As in the preceding comparison, the accelerations were significantly larger on the smaller barge. Thus, for a given load, switching to a larger barge can give a large reduction in the acceleration. There are indications that the results achieved are conservative, including the case with viscous roll damping. However, this is only an indication. The viscous roll damping is difficult to estimate correctly and therefore a suggestion could be to investigate the validity of the viscous roll damping model through model tests. A certain reduction in the roll acceleration was observed when the load was increased for the 300 feet barge, without giving an increase in the roll angle extremes. This indicates that for some cases a decrease in the metacentric height can, provided that the stability is sufficient, contribute to a decrease in the roll acceleration without increasing the extreme roll angle. In high sea states, non-linear effects can become significant. The resulting effect on roll acceleration is unknown. Hence, it could be advantageous to investigate the extent of these effects using a non-linear calculation model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor that transports, installs and decommissions offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms and offshore wind turbines. During transport, objects need to be secured on the deck, the so-called <b>seafastening.</b> In particular for parts of offshore wind turbines, called Transition Pieces, this proves to be difficult. The Transition Pieces are on average 25 m high tubular structures and weight 300 mT. The outside {{is covered with a}} special coating and various attachments, such as boat landings, ladders, and anodes for corrosion protection. The inside of the Transition Pieces contains various structures and equipment, such as groutskirts, shear keys, J-tubes and internal platforms. Seaway Heavy Lifting currently uses clamps on the lower flange to secure the Transition Pieces in an upright position to the deck of the ship. This causes relative high stresses in the flange and weld and {{turned out to be a}} critical limiting factor during transportation for several projects. Due to this limitation, the workability of the vessels is suboptimal. Many other offshore contractors use the same or similar method of clamping the lower flange to the deck. A new method for <b>seafastening</b> Transition Pieces is proposed to improve the securing strength, the safety, and workability of the vessels. This new method comprises of a tubular element, much like the monopile on which the Transition Piece will stand once on offshore location, welded onto the grillage. The Transition Piece can then be lifted over this tubular element. Mounted on the tubular element are hydraulic cylinders that extend outwards towards the inner wall of the Transition Piece. By exerting a force to the inner wall, the Transition Piece is effectively secured to the vessel. This method avoids using the rather weak lower flange. Strength calculations have shown that this new method can withstand accelerations and accompanying forces caused by the ships motions that are nearly twice as high as the current method allows. Because the new method is fully automated, it requires no manual labour and the <b>seafastening</b> can be activated and deactivated quickly, thus saving critical crane time. It also reduces the time frame where the Transition Pieces stands on the deck unsecured, as is the case with the current method which uses clamps and bolts, thus improving safety. This thesis covers the invention of the new method, calculating the critical structural parts, and detailing those element that are crucial to the design. Currently, a patent applications is pending.

40|$|The {{structures}} which HMC installs offshore are fabricated onshore {{and subsequently}} moved onto a barge or ship, <b>seafastened</b> and then {{transported to the}} offshore location. The process of moving a structure from the onshore quayside to the barge or ship is called the load-out. This load-out can be performed by lifting, skidding or using a trailer (SPMT). This thesis research focused only on a skidded load-out onto a barge. During the load-out {{the weight of the}} jacket or topside is gradually transferred from the quay to the barge. The barge gradually takes more of the load so ballast water needs to be continuously pumped or discharged depending on the location of the structure and the location of the ballast tank concerned. Improper ballasting during this process will cause the alignment between the quay and the barge to be disrupted which in turn causes peak loads in the topside or jacket and the barge. It is questioned if there are more suitable ballasting methods or a structural solution in order to lower these peak loads? It is also modeled what the effects are of quayside stiffness and the best method to model this stiffness. Therefore a 2 -D representation of the entire load-out is made. This model will be made using the finite element method, via a numerical model, in MATLAB. A base case load-out of a topside will be applied to this model. Using this model, optimizing the ballast configuration will be researched. Several different criteria for the optimization were tested and its different effects on the forces during the load-out were researched and quantified. The structural solution of relocating the skidbeams to an area of lower deck stiffness was also tested and the results studied. The effects of the quayside stiffness and modelling methods were also quantified using the 2 -D MATLAB model. The conclusion derived from the optimizations is that there are other ballast configurations which perform better in reducing the peak forces experienced during the load-out. The key to these optimizations is that they keep the barge-quay alignment as perfect as possible. If a critical element is present in the load-out the ballast configuration can be adjusted to lower the forces in this specific element. The results of the simulation in which the skidbeams were relocated show that this approach has no beneficial effects in reducing the forces during the load-out, mainly due to the presence of the transverse bulkheads in het barge. Furthermore for the modelling of the quayside it was proven that especially when using a low stiffness quayside, modelling the quayside without taking into account the foundation layer stiffness is inaccurate and can lead to lower forces in the model than which occur in reality...|$|R
40|$|The {{water has}} been used for {{transportation}} for ages. The barge started early {{to become one of the}} most effective methods to perform such an operation. Over the years the floating flat-bottomed structure has been developed until the one we use today which is characterised by its flat bottom and large deck area. An offshore transport can be divided into three phases, each having its own considerations. The first phase may be called on-loading and here the stability is important. The next phase is named the transport. Here the most important aspect is the motion responses of the barge to the physical environmental conditions. Especially the waves give the barge accelerations which may cause movement of the cargo. To prevent this movement <b>seafastening</b> has to be designed to withstand the forces created by the accelerations. The last phase is the off-loading. Here resonance is the main problem. This phenomenon may cause large motions and accelerations and thereby cause the whole operation to be postponed. The stability analysis is used to decide the intact stability and the damaged stability. The results are compared with criteria given in DNV(1996) and Noble Denton (2005). The requirements states whether the operation is secure according to the stability principle. The motion response analysis uses physical environmental conditions given by Noble Denton (2005) to find the accelerations due to the motions. The <b>seafastening</b> need to be designed according to these accelerations to have a secure transport. The case study included in this report is the analyses of stability and motion response of a barge loaded with 4 bridges and 2 towers. The barge is subjected to physical environmental conditions according to the Valhall field in the southern North Sea (Grant, 2005). A program package called SESAM, including the programs GeniE, HydroD and POSTRESP, is used to perform the analyses. The main results give a range of stability of 76, 8 degrees for intact stability and 61, 8 degrees for damaged stability with two adjacent flooded tanks. Both these are on the correct side of the requirements...|$|E
