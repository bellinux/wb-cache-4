40|$|The hematologic {{profile of}} {{the representatives of the}} bony fishes {{inhibiting}} the Belgorod region - common carp Cyprinus carpio is studied. By means a light microscopy method definition of the blood type cells for fishes on the basis of metachromasy of cytoplasm and core, as well as sizes, forms of cells and their cores after fixing and coloring of dabs by Romanovsky method is carried out. It is established that the hemacytrate profile of common carp Cyprinus carpio is presented by the erythrocytes prevailing by quantity, platelets and leukocytes. Nongranulocytes include monocytes and lymphocytes, granulocytes - eosinophils, basophiles, neutrophils, as well as other uniform blood cells which are at different development stages: progranulocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, <b>stab</b> <b>cell</b> and segment cell leukocytes. In a leukocyte formula of the Cyprinus carpio the most part is occupied by lymphocytes. Among polymorph cell leukocytes neutrophils prevail, quantity of eosinophiles and basophiles at the studied species of bony fishes is rather low. The revealed hematologic {{profile of the}} Cyprinus carpio can be used for assessment of their functional state, health and extent of adaptation to environment conditions.

40|$|By multivariate {{analysis}} of nine laboratory variables, a discriminant function value has been derived that differentiated between a group of 106 drug abusers {{and a group of}} 100 normal controls. The variables were serum phosphorus, glucose, lactate dehydroge-nase, aspartate aminotransferase, and hematocrit, total leukocyte count, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, and monocyte count. The data demonstrate that the two populations can be distinguishedwith 4 % error in the controlgroup and 14 % error in the drug-abuse group. In addition,the individual variables for each group were compared by the t-test. The following were significantly differ-ent: serum calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitro-gen, cholesterol, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate am inotransferase, and he-moglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, polymorpho-nuclear leukocyte count, <b>stab</b> <b>cell</b> count, and eosino-philcount. Additional Keyphrases: {{multivariate analysis}} #{ 149 }statis-tics #{ 149 }variation, source of #{ 149 }screening Clinical laboratory values are used to help in mak-ing or to confirm medical diagnosis. A previous com-munication from this laboratory reported that eosin-ophilia was prevalent in a drug-abuse population as compared to the general hospital-patient population or the hospital-staff population (1). Other studies have indicated that aminotransferase activitiesare abnormally high in a drug-abuse population (2, 3), as are concentrations of immunoglobulins (4 - 7). In the present study, we survey chemical and hematolo-gicalvariablesin a drug-abuse patient population as compared with a hospital-staffpopulation. The sig-nificance of each individual parameter was deter-mined and a profile derived that differentiates the groups...|$|E
40|$|After {{a series}} of {{experimental}} examinations into phagocytic activity of citrated blood on Candida albicans the phagocytosis rate of each kind of differentiated leukocytes in vitro {{was found to be}} in the order as follows: Polymorphonuclear 92 % > monocytes 71 % > eosinophils 50 % > <b>stab</b> <b>cells</b> 18 % > metamyelocytes 8 % > melocytes 6 % > promyelocytes, myeloblasts, lymphocytes = 0. Any direct action of penicillin, vitamin B_ 2 and sulfonamide to influence the intensity of citrated blood in phagocytizing this fungus was not confirmed. The authors think, however, a remarkable deficiency of neutrophil leukocytes in the blood, whatever be the cause, may be accounted for one of occasions for onset of candidasis...|$|R
40|$|Polysaccharides {{purified}} from large-scale cell {{cultures of}} the plant Echinacea purpurea were tested {{for their ability to}} activate human phagocytes in vitro and in vivo. These substances enhanced the spontaneous motility of PMN under soft agar and increased the ability of these cells to kill staphylococci. Monocytes were activated to secrete TNF-alpha,IL- 6 and IL- 1 whereas class II expression was unaffected. Intravenous application of the polysaccharides to test subjects immediately induced a fall in the number of PMN in the peripheral blood, indicating activation of adherence to endothelial cells. This fall was followed by a leukocytosis due to {{an increase in the number}} of PMN and a lesser increase of monocytes. The appearance of <b>stab</b> <b>cells</b> and some juvenile forms and even myelocytes indicated the migration of cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. The acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP) was induced (abstract truncated...|$|R

Martin Ashford and Phoebe Nicholson check on Ricky, and Ash explains that Brax was trying to protect Ricky and their son Casey from his enemy Gunno. Robert Massey, an associate of Gunno's, hears the conversation via a microphone hidden in the house. He calls the prison to tell inmate Michael Tiat that Brax is alive. Michael informs Gunno, who is then <b>stabbed</b> in his <b>cell.</b> His girlfriend and prison nurse, Virginia Eisak, helps him escape. Meanwhile, Brax's brother Heath and his wife Bianca come to support Ricky. When her fiancé Nate Cooper calls her, Ricky feigns illness and tells him not to come over.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they landed}} on the other side, {{they were in a}} medieval setting. A nearby Knight noticed George and Marguerite, and walked over to them. George begged for his help {{to get back to the}} other side of the screen in the real world. However, havoc broke loose. Armies descended and a battle ensued between knights. Kevin Costner as Robin Hood shot an arrow toward Marguerite, but she was saved by George jumping on its way to stop it. The arrow had clearly {{punctured}} his heart, and the fighting stops. As the Knight removed it, he found out that it had actually <b>stabbed</b> George's <b>cell</b> phone. Scared by its ringtone, the Knight crushed it. Then, he walked to the top of the hill and lightning struck his sword. He threw it toward the screen, breaking it open and creating a portal allowing George to travel back to the Theater. He does so, but the portal closed before Marguerite crosses it. Finally, the Magician returned and created a door for George to walk through. George then decided to go back into screen, and the movie ended with a loving embrace between them, complemented by a montage of famous on-screen kisses. The show closed with George and Marguerite skipping toward the Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz ...|$|R
40|$|Bandemia is a {{phenomenon}} observed in infections caused by gram negative organisms, particularly of shigella species. The occurrence has not been quantitated as a diagnostic guideline implicating shigella organisms prior to availability of culture results. We have looked at bandemia in 55 patients with documented shigellosis and compared it to that in 36 non-shigella diarrhoea cases. A 5 % or more band cells in the peripheral blood smear is being proposed as a significant indicator of possibility of shigellosis given the proper clinical set up. Shigellosis, an infection caused by various shigella species is characterised by bandemia, an increase in number of band <b>cells</b> (<b>stabs)</b> in the differential count of the white blood cells. The phenomenon has occasionally been associated with other gram negative organisms such as E. coli and Salmonella but not viral infections although recent reports have attributed the appearance of immature neutrophils in rota virus enteritis 1. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify a cut off point in the number of band cells that favours diagnosis o...|$|R
40|$|Aim – to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of immunomodulating drug Galavit in patients with uncomplicated influenza. Materials and methods. Non-randomized single-center comparative study was performed. Patients with influenza (male, average age – 25, 1 ± 1, 3 years, n = 45) were divided into 2 groups. Study group (n = 20) from the time of admission received the drug Galavit in addition to symptomatic and detoxification therapy. Patients in the control group (n = 25) received only symptomatic and detoxication therapy. The criterion of effectiveness of the preparation was positive dynamics of clinical symptoms and the results of clinical blood. Results. For the 2 nd day of the disease 15 % of patients of the group returned to normal body temperature (in the control group, none of the patients had normal body temperature to the 2 nd day of illness). By the 5 th day of observation, 95 % of the study group patients showed normalization of body temperature (in the control group – 84 % of patients). Catarrhal symptoms resolved faster in patients of the main group than in patients of control group. Patients treated with Galavit observed normal levels of white blood cells and ESR by the moment of hospital discharge, in the control group leukocytosis and increased ESR remained. Conclusion. Galavit drug reduces the duration of catarrhal and intoxication syndrome in patients with influenza, effect positively on hematological parameters: helps reduce the number of white blood <b>cells,</b> <b>stab</b> shift, normalization of ESR. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Musa Abd al-Qadir Ghanimat murdered {{three young}} Israeli {{women in a}} Tel Aviv café, {{in what has been}} {{described}} as either a suicide bombing or possibly as an intended time-bomb attack in which the timer malfunctioned, killing also the perpetrator. He was part of a Hamas cell led by Ibrahim Ghanimat, who was pursued by Israel for eight years and finally captured in 2005. The Israeli authorities have convicted members of the cell, sometimes called the [...] "Surif squad", for the murder of a total of eleven Israelis killed between 1995-1997. Another Ghanimat member of the cell is Abd al-Rahman Ismail Ghanimat, who was sentenced to 5 life terms in prison for a number of terror attacks including the murder of Yaron and Efrat Ungar, but was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. While under arrest, Abd al-Rahman Ghanimat's interrogators used procedures deemed illegal by Amnesty International, but defended by the Israeli authorities in light of the continuing threat of further fatal attacks. Not a Ghanimat, but a top member of the cell nevertheless, was Riad Abu Hamadia, sentenced in 1998 to four consecutive life sentences for his part in attacks leading to the death of nine Israelis, soldiers as well as civilians. Apart from prison sentences, the Israeli army demolished at least four houses belonging to the terrorists and their families. In 2010 a criminal gang run by Kifah Ghanimat decided to expand its actions inside Israel by committing terror attacks. This decision came after the assassination of senior Hamas commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January 2010, allegedly by Israeli Mossad agents. The <b>cell</b> <b>stabbed</b> two women to death in two separate opportunistic attacks, a third woman surviving with multiple stabbing wounds and broken bones due to the savage beating she received. Once captured, Kifah and Ibrahim Ghanimat admitted to the two murders, Kifah Ghanimat also admitting to raping at knifepoint another women in 2009 (this Ibrahim Ghanimat is a different person from his namesake arrested in 2005). Four gang members of the initially suspected thirteen were tried and sentenced to prison, the two Ghanimats for life.|$|R
