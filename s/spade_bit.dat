500|$|When she was young, Varian {{developed}} {{an interest in}} finding the [...] "perfect" [...] horse. She soon realized {{that the way to}} achieve her goal was to begin breeding horses. Her first Arabian was the mare Farlotta (Lotnik × Farza), obtained in 1952. Farlotta became a finished <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> horse who won both stock horse (reining) and western pleasure championships.

2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|E
2500|$|Bits {{that have}} shanks {{coming off the}} bit {{mouthpiece}} to create leverage that applies pressure to the poll, chin groove and mouth of the horse are {{in the category of}} curb bits. Most curb bit mouthpieces are solid without joints, ranging from a straight bar with a slight arch, called a [...] "mullen" [...] mouthpiece, through a [...] "ported" [...] bit that is slightly arched in the middle to provide tongue relief, to the full <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> of the Vaquero style of western riding which combines both a straight bar and a very high [...] "spoon" [...] or [...] "spade" [...] extension that contacts the roof of the mouth. [...] The length of the shank determines the degree of leverage put on the horse's head and mouth. [...] Again, a bit with shanks and leverage is always a [...] "curb" [...] type bit, even when it has a jointed mouthpiece more commonly seen on a snaffle (such bits are sometimes—incorrectly—called [...] "cowboy snaffles"). [...] All shanked bits require the use of a curb chain or curb strap for proper action and safe use.|$|E
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{twist drill}} bits used in metalworking also {{work well in}} wood, {{but they tend to}} chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in rough holes for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including <b>spade</b> <b>bits</b> and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits, Forstner bits and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.|$|R

5000|$|A distantly related {{variation}} on the English double bridle is the [...] "two rein" [...] setup used in the western riding classic vaquero tradition (also known as the [...] "buckaroo" [...] or [...] "California" [...] tradition) of developing a [...] "spade bit" [...] horse. Rather than use of a bit and bradoon, the trainer uses a thin bosal style hackamore over a complex type of curb bit known as a spade. This tradition originated with the same haute ecole and military uses of horses in the Middle Ages, but developed differently from classical dressage since approximately the 16th century, when Spanish horse trainers arrived in the Americas. In this tradition, {{the ultimate goal is}} use of one hand on the spade alone. A young horse is started in a bosal, then is transitioned into the spade by wearing both the <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> with progressively smaller diameter bosals, with the rider usually carrying the reins in the 3 in 1 hold. The reins of the <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> are romal style, with light chains or small lead weights added between the bit and the rein so that it balances perfectly in the mouth of the horse. Over time the trainer uses the bosal less and less until the horse travels with lightness and collection on the spade alone. The process of moving from a bosal alone to a [...] "straight up" [...] <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> horse using the spade alone can take many years, {{as long as it takes}} to bring a Dressage horse to Grand Prix level. For practical working purposes, the modern cowboy of the vaquero or [...] "buckaroo" [...] tradition usually keeps a light bosal on the finished horse as a type of noseband.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} western North America {{influenced}} by the vaquero tradition of Spain and Mexico, a <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> called a ring bit had a metal ring that fastened at the highest point of the port or spoon of the bit mouthpiece passed through the horse's mouth, and surrounded the lower jaw. This design was {{more common in the}} Southwest than in the Northwest, and gradually disappeared from both areas, but remained in general use in Mexico.|$|E

5000|$|At the time, a {{finished}} reining horse (as it was called) required {{at least seven}} years to train: {{three to four years}} to train the basics in a bosal hackamore, then at least a year carrying both the bosal and the high-ported <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> (named for the spade-shaped port which was from 1-3" [...] high) to help the horse learn how to carry the bit, then several years refining techniques in the spade until the horse was a [...] "made" [...] reining horse. The training could not be done by just any Californio, and reining horses were valuable because of the difficulty of training and scarcity.|$|E
50|$|The curb bit's {{mouthpiece}} {{controls the}} pressure on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even pressure on the bars and tongue. A port places more pressure on the bars, but provides room for the tongue. A high port may act {{on the roof of the}} mouth as it touches. Some western style curbs, particularly the <b>Spade</b> <b>Bit,</b> have both a straight bar mouthpiece and a high welded port., thus acting on the bars, tongue and palate.

5000|$|A {{finished}} reining horse {{could be}} controlled and directed with minute movements of the fingers of the left hand, which hovered above the saddle horn. (Compare to the grazing-bit style of Western riding developed in Texas, where reins are split between the fingers and the hand moves {{in front of the}} saddle, controlling the horse by neck reining.) Because of the potential severity of the <b>spade</b> <b>bit,</b> chains added {{to the ends of the}} reins to balance the bit in the horse's mouth, and knotted and braided rawhide reins which prevented the reins from swinging unnecessarily, even at a lope, the [...] "made" [...] reining horse seemed to run, stop, spin and handle a cow on its own, with little communication from its rider.|$|E

The herd work is similar to cutting where a single cow is [...] "cut" [...] from a herd of cattle and prevented from returning to the herd by the intervention of the horse and rider. Herd work is most often included in three-year-old futurity and four- and five-year-old derby classes. Herd work is also included in a [...] "Bridle Spectacular" [...] class. (The Arabian Horse Association omits the reining work in its breed shows.) The horse is judged on the ability to control the cow, as well as speed, balance, responsiveness to the rider.Today's reined cow horse competitors train horses at two levels, similar to the original Californio method. Younger horses, three-year-olds, can compete with a snaffle bit. Four- and five-year-old horses can compete in either a snaffle bit or bosal; six year and older horses compete in a [...] "bridle", which utilizes a curb bit, usually a milder version of the original spade bits used by the Californios. Occasionally, one will see a skilled rider with a horse in a <b>spade</b> <b>bit,</b> but because of its potential severity, the difficulty and time involved in training a horse to a spade, and the well-bred horses of today which can perform without such bits, most horsemen avoid the spade.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing roof support systems in coal mines. When designing the roof support, {{it is necessary to}} account for the uncertainties that are inherently exist within the rock mass and support elements. The performance of a support system is affected by these uncertainties, which are not taken into account in the current design methodologies used in South Africa. This study sets out to develop a method which takes all uncertainties into account and quantitatively provides a risk-based design. Despite the fact that the roof bolting {{is probably one of the}} most researched aspects of coal mine ground control, falls of ground still remain the single major cause of fatalities and injuries in South African collieries. Mainly five different support design methodologies have been used; namely, analytical modelling, numerical modelling, physical modelling, design based on geotechnical rating systems and field testing. As part of this study, it is shown that there are many elements of a support system that can impact the support and roof behaviour in a coal mine and the characteristics of these elements as well as the interaction between them is complex and can vary significantly within a short distance. These variations account for uncertainties in coal mine roof support and they are usually not taken into account in the above design methodologies resulting in falls of ground and/or over design of support systems. The roof and support behaviour were monitored at 29 sites at five collieries. It is found that there was no evidence of a dramatic increase in the stable elevations as experienced in some overseas collieries. A roadway widening experiment was carried out to establish the critical roof displacements. The maximum width attained was 12 m at which stage 5 mm displacement was measured. During the monitoring period no roof falls occurred at any of the 29 sites and road widening experiment site, even where 12 mm displacements were measured. The in situ monitoring programme was continued in additional 26 monitoring stations in 13 sites with the aim of establishing the effect of unsupported cut-out distance on roof and support performances. The results showed that the lithological composition of the roof strata plays a major role in the amount of deflection that was recorded. Bedding separation was seen to occur at the contacts between different strata types. It is concluded that the roof behaved like a set of composite beams with different characteristics. It is also found that the amounts of deflection corresponded with the deflection that would be expected from gravity loaded beams. During this monitoring programme variable nature of roof and support systems are also demonstrated. As many mines use different geotechnical rating systems, an evaluation of the currently used classification techniques were conducted to determine their effectiveness in design of roof support strategies. It is found that currently used systems cannot quantitatively determine the required support system in a given geotechnical environment. Impact splitting tests are found to be the appropriate system for South African conditions. It is however concluded that the roof lithology, stress regime and roof characteristics can change within meters in a production section. Therefore, in order to predict these changing conditions many boreholes are required for a section, which would be costly and time consuming. An in-depth study into the roof support elements was conducted for the purpose of obtaining an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of roof support systems and developing guidelines for their improvement. All of the currently available roof bolt support elements and related machinery were evaluated using in situ short encapsulated pull tests. The results showed that, on average, bond strengths obtained from the roof bolts supplied by different manufacturers can vary as much as 28 per cent. The test results conducted on different resins showed that the strength of resin currently being used in South Africa is adequate. Differences between commonly used bit types were established. It is concluded that the 2 -prong bit outperforms the <b>spade</b> <b>bit</b> in sandstone and shale rock types. In addition, the effect of hole annulus was also investigated as part of this study. The results show that an annulus between 2. 5 mm to 3. 8 mm resulted in the most effective bond strengths. The effect of wet and dry drilling was noted. It is found that bond strengths and overall support stiffnesses are greater with the use of the wet drilling in all resin types. The results from the tests in different rock types highlighted the very distinct differences between bolt system performances. Quality control procedures for compliance with the design, support elements and quality of installation are presented. Recommendations for improving the quality control measures and for developing testing procedures for bolt system components, installation quality and resin performance are provided. Finally, a roof support design methodology that takes into account all natural variations exist within the rock mass and the mining process has been developed and presented. This was achieved by adapting a probabilistic design approach using the well established stochastic modelling technique. This methodology enables rock engineers to design roof support systems with greater confidence and should result in safer and economic extraction of coal reserves.
