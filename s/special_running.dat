5000|$|Zátopek's running {{style was}} {{distinctive}} {{and very much}} at odds with what {{was considered to be}} an efficient style at the time. His head would often roll, face contorted with effort, while his torso swung from side to side. He often wheezed and panted audibly while running, which earned him the nicknames of [...] "Emil the Terrible" [...] or the [...] "Czech Locomotive". When asked about his tortured facial expressions, Zátopek is said to have replied that [...] "It isn't gymnastics or figure skating, you know." [...] In addition he would train in any weather, including snow, and would often do so while wearing heavy work boots as opposed to <b>special</b> <b>running</b> shoes. He was always willing to give advice to other runners. One example he often gave was always to be relaxed and to help ensure that while running, gently touch the tip of your thumb with the tip of your index or middle finger. Just making that slight contact would ensure that arms and shoulders remained relaxed.|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} kinesiological analysis of the athletic run - sprint. The aim of the thesis is the time characteristics comparison and switching on of the muscles which are working during the sprint {{before and after the}} performance of <b>special</b> <b>running</b> exercises. It is becoming much more important to use the special training procedures during training sessions. The <b>special</b> <b>running</b> exercises are performed almost daily during training sessions of sprinters. The question is to what extent their performance is evident on the activation of muscles. The qualitative and quantitative results show the activation of muscles during sprint before and after the performance of the <b>special</b> <b>running</b> exercises. The main tool of the research was the surface EMG analysis of muscles during a 30 -metre long sprint. The content of the research were two comparative analysis, where 8 proband participated - interindividual and intraindividual. During the evaluation process we considered the quantitative and qualitative components. On the basic of the reached results we may say that there is no diference between the run before and after the performance of <b>special</b> <b>running</b> exercises.
