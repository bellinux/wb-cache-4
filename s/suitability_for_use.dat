5|$|Eleusis is {{probably}} Abbott's most prominent game, {{due to its}} metaphors and its <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a teaching tool. He invented it in 1956, and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games. It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later. Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June1959 issue of Scientific American. Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards {{in an attempt to}} figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis; the result was considered to be far better than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a bit better. Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October1977 issue of Scientific American. Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis. It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games and New Rules for Classic Games, among others.|$|E
