40|$|<b>Skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} vulnerable components of fish communities in temperate demersal fisheries such as the Irish Sea. They also tend to be data poor in comparison to commercially exploited teleost fish. Spatial management has been suggested as an important tool to protect these species, but requires an understanding of the abundance distribution, and the relationship the abundance distribution has with the environment at both adult and juvenile life history stages. Here we modelled bottom trawl survey data using delta log-normal boosted regression trees on to derive rays’ spatial abundance, and environmental links. The modelling approach allowed the development of high resolution predictive maps of abundance of four <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray</b> species targeted by fishing activity: thornback, spotted, cuckoo <b>and</b> blonde <b>rays.</b> The distributions of these species were driven by a general preference for sand and coarser substrates as well as higher salinities, temperatures and currents speeds. Spatial comparisons between abundance distributions <b>and</b> locations of <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray</b> commercial landings indicated that the main hotspots for the investigated species are outside of the main commercial fishing areas and overlap with potential MPAs proposed for wider ecosystem protection. The method offers a useful tool for selecting potential MPA’s to assist the management and conservation of data-poor species...|$|R

40|$|A {{major factor}} in the {{evolutionary}} success of the elasmobranchs (sharks, <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays)</b> has been the development of a sophisticated battery of sense organs and a large brain. However, very {{little is known about the}} neuroethology of these animals. As a species’ lifestyle is reflected in the organisation of its brain, we quantitatively investigated gross brain morphology in 29 species of elasmobranchs (20 species of shark, 1 species of <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> 9 species of ray). Four sensory brain areas that receive primary projections from the olfactory epithelium (olfactory bulb), eye (optic tectum), electroreceptors (anterior lateral line lobe) and acousticolateralis system (posterior lateral line lobe) were identified, and their volumes measured. The relative mean of each brain area was then calculated and species with above average areas were identified. This analysis revealed a range of sensory strategies. Vision appears more important in sharks than in <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> enlarged optic tecta were more prevalent in active reef-associated and pelagic sharks, as opposed to benthic species <b>and</b> scavengers. In <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays,</b> olfaction was more important, although some species relied more heavily on vision and the octavolateralis senses. Generally, well-developed octavolateralis brain areas were associated with enlarged optic tecta. A similar approach revealed substantial changes in the relative size of the sensory brain areas in juvenile and adult elasmobranchs from four species. In particular, the relative size of the optic tectum declined from juveniles to adults, whereas the size of the olfactory bulbs increased, suggesting that vision is relatively more important than olfaction to juveniles, and visa versa in adults. This apparent shift in sensory orientation with development may be correlated with shifts in habitat and diet...|$|R

40|$|<b>Skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays</b> are an {{integral}} part of the trophic structure of many estuarine ecosystems. However, there are many aspects of the fisheries biology of these species that require further exploration. For example, few comparisons have been done of the feeding habits of sympatric species that potentially overlap in resource usage, diets over time, or food preferences between fish populations from different regions. Most of what is known of batoid elasmobranch (<b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray)</b> diets on the Western Atlantic coast is a compilation of data from the entire continental shelf with no distinction of diets for populations within different estuaries that vary in abiotic characteristics and trophic structure. My research objectives were to: (1) quantitatively characterize the diets of the major batoid elasmobranchs (<b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays)</b> in Delaware Bay and in Narragansett Bay, (2) describe seasonal variation in diet, if any, (3) examine diet overlap and food resource partitioning among species within each ecosystem, and (4) compare diets of selected species between the geographic locations (specifically populations of Little, Winter, and Clearnose skates; Leucoraja erinacea, L. ocellata, and Raja eglanteria, respectively,). Through gut content analysis, calculation of trophic level and overlap indices, and multivariate statistical techniques such as non-metric multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM, diets of 3 different batoids were characterized; 2 from Delaware Bay and 1 from Narragansett Bay. The diets of the bullnose ray Myliobatis freminvillii, the Clearnose <b>skate</b> Raja eglanteria, <b>and</b> the little <b>skate</b> Leucoraja erinacea were also evaluated for ontogenetic, spatial, and temporal differences within their respective species. Myliobatis freminvillii was considered a moderate gastropod specialist with shifts in diet over ontogeny. Raja eglanteria was characterized as a generalist with preferences for benthic crustaceans, exhibiting ontogentic differences between juveniles and adults, and strong dietary differences between sexes. Leucoraja erinacea was determined to be a broad-scale generalist preferring amphipods and sand shrimp and was shown to feed based on prey availability since there were temporal and spatial differences in diet that corresponded to variations in prey abundance. These data were used to contribute to estuary-specific community analyses of batoid trophic relationships in Delaware and Narragansett Bays and a comparison of the trophic dynamics between those two communities. The skate species of Narragasett Bay exhibited significantly different diets, but did not show ontogenetic differences when compared together. The <b>skates</b> <b>and</b> <b>rays</b> of Delaware Bay showed differences in diet by species and by size within species. It is proposed that a higher level of partitioning exists in Delaware Bay since there are more batoid species to compete for resources, but this would only be the case if resources were limiting and data were not collected that could confirm this. Since all the organisms studied were benthic secondary consumers based on available data, the diets of the batoids in each estuary were found not to be significantly different. Any observed differences were not due to the specific prey species that were found in the diet but to the proportions of the various prey that were consumed. ...|$|R
