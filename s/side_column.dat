50|$|When {{designing}} distillation {{processes for}} separating zeotropic mixtures, the sequencing of distillation columns {{is vital to}} saving energy and costs. In addition, other methods {{can be used to}} lower the energy or equipment costs required to distill zeotropic mixtures. This includes combining distillation <b>columns,</b> using <b>side</b> <b>columns,</b> combining main <b>columns</b> with <b>side</b> <b>columns,</b> and re-using waste heat for the system. After combining distillation columns, the amount of energy used is only that of one separated column rather than both columns combined. In addition, using <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> saves energy by preventing different columns from carrying out the same separation of mixtures. Combining main and <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> saves equipment costs by reducing the number of heat exchangers in the system. Re-using waste heat requires the amount of heat and temperature levels of the waste to match that of the heat needed. Thus, using waste heat requires changing the pressure inside evaporators and condensors of the distillation system in order to control the temperatures needed. Controlling the temperature levels in a part of a system is possible with Pinch Technology. These energy-saving techniques have a wide application in industrial distillation of zeotropic mixtures: <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> have been used to refine crude oil, and combining main and <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> is increasingly used.|$|R

A pinned connection between steel links and the <b>side</b> steel <b>columns</b> ensures the transmission of shear forces only, thus, the <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> are subject to compression/traction with very small bending moments. The structure is conceived to concentrate the damage under earthquake excitation to the link elements so to obtain a seismic resistant system that is simple to repair. In order to assess the seismic structural behaviour of the proposed system, nonlinear analyses are used to investigate {{the performance of a}} case study consisting in a six-storey steel building where the proposed hybrid coupled shear walls are the only elements resisting horizontal forces.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the design data and numerical {{analysis of a}} braceless steel semi-submersible wind turbine. The hull of the semi-submersible wind turbine is designed to support a reference 5 -MW {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} at a site in the northern North Sea. The hull is composed of a central <b>column,</b> three <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> and three pontoons. The <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> and pontoons are arranged radially outward from the central column which is used to support the wind turbine. The <b>side</b> <b>columns</b> form the corners of a triangle on the horizontal plane and are connected by the pontoons to the central column at the bottom to form an integrated structure. Numerical analysis has been carried out to analyze the intact stability, natural periods and modes and global dynamic responses in winds and waves. Results of the numerical analysis show that the design has very good intact stability, well designed natural periods and modes, moderate rigid-body motions in extreme environmental conditions and a reasonable structural design. This paper emphasizes the structural responses of the hull considering both the global and local load effects. The global forces and moments in the hull are calculated by carrying out time-domain global analysis and used as inputs for simplified ultimate limit state design checks for structural strength of the hull. The design {{can be used as a}} reference semi-submersible wind turbine...|$|R

U-165 had been patrolling off Les Méchins, Quebec in the St. Lawrence River, approximately 250 km west of where the convoy came under attack by U-517. On 16 September, the convoy approached U-165s patrol area, where the submarine had been alerted by U-517 of the convoy's arrival. Under the command of Fregattenkapitän Eberhard Hoffman, the submarine moved to attack the convoy while submerged, entering the convoy between positions of Vegreville and Summerside.

In particular, the removal of <b>side</b> <b>column</b> with pin-ended connection results in the largest vertical displacement of adjacent joint and increase the flexural demands to the next joint.

30|$|Progressive {{collapse}} resistance of RC buildings {{can be analyzed}} by considering column loss scenarios. Using finite element analysis and a static test, the progressive collapse process of a RC frame under monotonic vertical displacement of a <b>side</b> <b>column</b> was investigated, simulating a column removal scenario. A single-story 1 / 3 scale RC frame that comprises two spans and two bays was tested and computed, and downward displacement of a <b>side</b> <b>column</b> was placed until failure. Our study offers insight into the failure modes and progressive collapse behavior of a RC frame. It has been noted that the damage of structural members (beams and slabs) occurs only in the bay where the removal <b>side</b> <b>column</b> is located. Greater catenary action and tensile membrane action are mobilized in the frame beams and slabs, respectively, at large deformations, but they mainly happen in the direction where the frame beams and slabs are laterally restrained. Based on the experimental and computational results, the mechanism of progressive {{collapse resistance}} of RC frames at different stages was discussed further. With large deformations, a simplified calculation method for catenary action and tensile membrane action is proposed.|$|E
