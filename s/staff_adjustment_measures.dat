40|$|The paper {{examines}} the nexus between {{climate change and}} trade governance from a normative perspective. Only little research {{attention has been paid}} to assessing the interactions between empirical and normative approaches to climate change in the context of potential trade measures. To this end, the paper focuses on currently discussed carbon border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures.</b> This paper assesses these trade measures from a normative perspective: it explores whether they are compatible or in conflict with development ethics on the one hand and with climate ethics on the other. The paper finds that border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are both a threat to development as well as to a workable climate agreement. It argues that they are therefore both in conflict with development as well as climate ethics concerns. From a development ethics perspective, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are objectionable for two reasons. First, they hurt developing countries and above all the ones that are vulnerable in terms of relying only on few export goods. Second, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> restrict market access for developing countries and thereby undermine the potential of trade to foster development. From a climate ethics perspective, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> ar...|$|R

In two-factor analyses, perceptions of parents' warmth and training behaviours combined into a factor that correlated positively with <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures,</b> whereas the dominating control factor correlated negatively. In three-factor analyses, perceptions of mothers' training behaviours predicted variance in relationship harmony, independent of perceptions of warmth and dominating control behaviours. These findings support Chao's views that the dimension of training may play a particularly important role in functional parenting in some non-Western cultures. © 1999 The International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Risk {{adjustment}} of returns and performance measurement {{is of great}} interest to financial institutions around the world today, because management board of a certain financial institution wants to know what risks their institution is bearing while achieving a certain level of returns. Separate measures of risk and return are combined in a single ratio through a risk adjustment process and corresponding measures that are analysed in the paper. All risk <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are divided into two separate classes in the paper according to normality of returns of market variables or portfolios criterion. The analysis revealed the following conclusions: when the normality assumption holds, the generalized Sharpe rule is superior to other risk <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> from the class; when we cannot rely on the normality assumption, then Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio is superior to other asymmetrical risk-adjustment measures because it not only accounts for deviations of financial data from normal distribution, but enables to asses the impact of different preferences of an investor towards profits and/or losses expected...|$|R

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] To date, border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> {{in the form of}} {{emissions}} allowance requirements (EAR) under the U. S. proposed cap-and-trade regime are the most concrete unilateral trade measure put forward to level the carbon playing field. If improperly implemented, such measures could disturb the world trade order and trigger a trade war. Because of these potentially far-reaching impacts, this paper focuses on this type of unilateral border adjustment, which requires importers to acquire and surrender emissions allowances corresponding to the embedded carbon contents in their goods from countries that have not taken climate actions comparable to that of home country. This discussion is mainly on the legality of unilateral EAR under the WTO rules. Given that the inclusion of border carbon <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> is widely considered essential to secure passage of any U. S. legislation capping its greenhouse gas emissions, the paper argues that, on the U. S. side, in designing such trade measures, WTO rules need to be carefully scrutinised, and efforts need to be made early on to ensure that the proposed measures comply with them. After all, a conflict between the trade and climate regimes, if it breaks out, helps neither trade nor the global climate. The U. S. needs to explore, with its trading partners, cooperative sectoral approaches to advancing low-carbon technologies and/or concerted mitigation efforts in a given sector at an international level. Moreover, to increase the prospects for a successful WTO defence of the Waxman-Markey type of border adjustment provision, there should be: 1) a period of good faith efforts to reach agreements among the countries concerned before imposing such trade measures; 2) consideration of alternatives to trade provisions that could be reasonably expected to fulfill the same function but are not inconsistent or less inconsistent with the relevant WTO provisions; and 3) trade provisions that can refer to the designated special international reserve allowance pool, but should allow importers to submit equivalent emission reduction units that are recognized by international treaties to cover the carbon contents of imported products. The paper concludes by arguing that the major developing countries being targeted by such border carbon <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> should make the best use of the forums provided under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol to effectively deal with the proposed border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> to their advantage...|$|R

The literature reviewed is not exhausted, but it is sufficient to provide a balanced view of both academics and policy circles. Section 2 discusses how to identify the sectors at a risk of carbon leakage. Section 3 examines ex ante estimates of potential carbon leakage rates, and explains why they differ from ex post results of environmental tax reforms and greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes that have been implemented in the European Union. Section 4 discusses broad policy options to address competitiveness and leakage concerns, and compares which anti-leakage policy, border adjustments or output-based allocation, is more effective to limiting carbon leakages or mitigating production loss in the sectors affected. Given that border carbon <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> are incorporated in the U.

40|$|Unilateral or sub-global {{policies}} to combat climate change are potentially sensitive to free-riding and carbon leakage. One {{way of dealing}} with carbon leakage and competitiveness is the imposition of border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> for competing imports, for example {{in the form of the}} obligation to importers of goods to purchase and surrender emissions allowances to the authorities when importing. In this paper, we explore some implications of border <b>adjustment</b> <b>measures</b> in the EU ETS, for sectors that might be subject to carbon leakage. We examine the implications of two variants of these measures on the competitiveness of these sectors and on the global environment with the help of a multi-sector, multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global economy. Our calculations suggest that border adjustment might reduce the sectoral rate of leakage of the iron and steel industry rather forcefully, but that the reduction would be less for the mineral products sector, including cement. The reduction of the overall or macro rate of leakage would be modest. So, from an environmental point of view border tax adjustments would not be a very effective policy measure, but might mainly be justified by considerations of sectoral competitiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
