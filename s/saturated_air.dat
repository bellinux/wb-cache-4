5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> and by eating damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the rectal epithelium, which absorbs water, {{ensuring}} that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E
25|$|Adiabatic cooling {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of three {{possible}} lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. If the air is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, it normally sheds vapor it can no longer retain, which condenses into cloud. Water vapor in <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.|$|E
25|$|In a {{wet cooling}} tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{measuring}} the trapping constant of porous materials <b>saturated</b> by <b>air</b> is presented. The trapping constant is evaluated from acoustical {{measurements of the}} imaginary part of the compressibility of the <b>saturating</b> <b>air</b> at low frequencies. Measurements performed on random packings of spheres are compared with predictions obtained from numerical simulations. Conversely, {{the connection between the}} behavior of the compressibility and a well defined physical parameter provides new information about the efficiency of porous sound absorbing materials at low frequencies.

50|$|The laurel {{forest is}} a type of cloud forest that has {{developed}} on mountains, where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean, is precipitated by the action of the relief. The terrain forces up wet and warm air masses, which cool and decreases the dew point, causing moisture to condense and fall as rain or fog. This creates a habitat that is cool, <b>saturating</b> <b>air</b> and soil with moisture.|$|R
2500|$|Plume — The {{stream of}} {{saturated}} exhaust air leaving the cooling tower. The plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses {{in contact with}} cooler ambient air, like the <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> in one's breath fogs on a cold day. Under certain conditions, a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings. Note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is [...] "pure" [...] water, {{in contrast to the}} very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets.|$|E
2500|$|Under certain ambient conditions, {{plumes of}} water vapor (fog) {{can be seen}} {{rising out of the}} {{discharge}} from a cooling tower, and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire. [...] If the outdoor air is at or near saturation, and the tower adds more water to the air, <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> with liquid water droplets can be discharged, which is seen as fog. [...] This phenomenon typically occurs on cool, humid days, but is rare in many climates. Fog and clouds associated with cooling towers can be described as homogenitus, as with other clouds of man-made origin, such as contrails and ship tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Water vapor {{accounts}} for {{the largest percentage of}} the greenhouse effect, between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when including clouds. Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales, such as near irrigated fields. Indirectly, human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a process known as water vapor feedback. The atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature, from less than 0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass in <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> at about 32°C. (See Relative humidity#other important facts.) ...|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be prevented}} by decreasing the relative humidity of the <b>saturated</b> discharge <b>air.</b> For that purpose, in hybrid towers, <b>saturated</b> discharge <b>air</b> is mixed with heated low relative humidity air. Some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level, passing through heat exchangers. The relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower. The discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible.|$|R

50|$|Rime {{is a type}} of ice {{deposition}} {{that occurs}} quickly, often under conditions of heavily <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> and windy conditions. Technically speaking, it is not a type of frost, since usually supercooled water drops are involved, in contrast to the formation of hoar frost, in which water vapour desublimates slowly and directly. Ships travelling through Arctic seas may accumulate large quantities of rime on the rigging. Unlike hoar frost, which has a feathery appearance, rime generally has an icy solid appearance.|$|E
50|$|Direct solar dryers {{expose the}} {{substance}} to be dehydrated to direct sunlight. Historically, {{food and clothing}} was dried in the sun by using lines, or laying the items on rocks or on top of tents. In Mongolia cheese and meat are still traditionally dried using {{the top of the}} ger (tent) as a solar dryer. In these systems the solar drying is assisted by the movement of the air (wind) that removes the more <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> away from the items being dried. More recently, complex drying racks and solar tents were constructed as solar dryers.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{saturation}} {{vapor pressure}} {{is proportional to}} temperature, cold air has a lower saturation point than warm air. The difference between these values {{is the basis for}} the formation of clouds. When <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> cools, it can no longer contain the same amount of water vapor. If the conditions are right, the excess water will condense out of the air until the lower saturation point is reached. Another possibility is that the water stays in vapor form, even though it is beyond the saturation point, resulting in supersaturation.|$|E

Here, we show that Acidiphilium sp. strain 3. 2 Sup 5 cells that were isolated from an extreme acidic environment are able to colonize graphite felt electrodes. These bacterial electrodes were able to produce high-density electrocatalytic currents, up to 3 A/m 2 at a poised potential of + 0. 15 V (compared to the value for the reference standard calomel electrode) in the absence of redox mediators, by oxidizing glucose even at <b>saturating</b> <b>air</b> concentrations and very low pHs...|$|R

The excessively moist air of Florida also rusts metal within a short space of time. Experiments to discover the most suitable rust-proof paint had been numerous, based, for the most part, on the anti-fouling compositions of red-lead similar to that used on ships keels.

50|$|Self-heating in coal {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied. The tendency to self-heat decreases with increasing rank of the coal. Lignite coals are more active than bituminous coals, which are more active than anthracite coals. Freshly mined coal consumes oxygen more rapidly than weathered coal, and freshly mined coal self-heats {{to a greater extent}} than weathered coal. The presence of water vapor may also be important, as the rate of heat generation accompanying the absorption of water in dry coal from <b>saturated</b> <b>air</b> can be an order of magnitude or more than the same amount of dry air.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge {{numbers of}} studies are {{reported}} on solar collectors using a single fluid to cool it, be {{it with water}} or with air only.

Parameters analyzed in the study include the effects of the air-to-water ratio and the inner diameters of the absorber tubes of the solar collector. A mechanism to control air-water ratio was also developed in the process.
