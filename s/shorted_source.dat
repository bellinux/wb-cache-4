To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known decremental algorithm for directed graphs with unit edge weights that is asymptotically faster than recomputing the single <b>source</b> <b>shortest</b> path tree from scratch after each deletion, which can be accomplished in O(m 2) total time.

A new BSS-based BIE algorithm is proposed in this paper and is compared with a subspace method as well as a normalized variant of the well-known constant modulus algorithm (NCMA). The equalization qualities of the three algorithms are assessed using channels with well-conditioned and ill-conditioned convolution matrices.

Dispersion measurements however are usually performed by assuming body-wave amplitudes to be negligible and the recorded wave-field {{to be dominated by}} plane Rayleigh-waves. The estimated dispersion curves may then be corrupted by near-field effects. In this instance, both numerical and physical modeling has helped illustrate such effects,which are typically identified as a systematic underestimation of measured phase velocity at low frequencies. A normalized representation, based on theoretical phase velocities and spread length, has shown the apparent invariability of near-offset effects : the underestimation occurred as soon as the measured wavelength exceeded 50 % of the spread length; homogeneous and normally-dispersive media provide the same limitation, regardless of the spread length value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wireless ad-hoc {{networks}} {{are characterized by}} the lack of infrastructure, use of wireless links with limited bandwidth and frequent topological changes. On-demand multipath routing in wireless ad-hoc networks is effective in providing resilience to route failures and to successful load balancing. Previous work shows that on-demand multipath routing protocols achieve lower end-to-end delay, routing overheads and higher goodput under certain scenarios when compared to traditional single-path counterparts. In this paper, a <b>Shortest</b> Multipath <b>Source</b> Routing (SMS) protocol is proposed-a multipath extension to DSR- supporting multimedia applications. The proposed protocol builds multiple partialdisjoint paths that are shorter when compared to multiple linkdisjoint or node-disjoint paths and, in so doing, reduce delays and overheads incurred when recovering from route breaks. Simulation results show that the protocol achieves lower end-toend delay and higher goodput compared with DSR and SMR.

40|$|Acoustic pulse {{reflectometry}} {{has become}} {{established as a}} useful non-invasive method of measuring the input impulse response, input impedance and internal dimensions of ducts. The technique involves injecting a sound pulse via a source tube into the duct under test. The reflections returning from the duct are recorded by a microphone embedded in the source tube wall and then analysed. The source tube is necessary to separate the forward and backward travelling waves. Although this provides {{an effective means of}} isolating the input pulse and the duct reflections, the attenuation of the signal while travelling in the source tube can be large, resulting in poor bandwidth input impulse response measurements. In this paper, a reflectometer with a <b>shorter</b> <b>source</b> tube is presented. The reduction in source tube length ensures less attenuation of the measured signals, leading to an improvement in the bandwidth of the experimentally determined input impulse response and more accurate bore profile reconstruction. 1...|$|R
