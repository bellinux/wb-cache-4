The result, the C7A2, has a four-point telescoping stock unit {{similar to that of}} the C8 carbine and a 3-rail TRI-AD I mount on the front <b>sight</b> <b>triangle.</b> The selector lever, magazine release, and charging handle latch are ambidextrous. Also, the C7A2 is issued with green colour furniture as standard. These weapons are often seen with a similar plethora of accessories as their American counterparts given the overall commonalities of the system and the rail mounts. The C7A2 is also issued with the C79A2 ELCAN optical gunsight with 3.4× magnification but with a uniform green rubber armored coating, but some soldiers who are issued it have either been issued or have purchased sights like the EOTech holographic weapons sight and the Trijicon ACOG. Within an eight-man section, six soldiers will normally carry a C7A2: the section commander and second in command, two grenadiers and two riflemen, with only the machine gunners carrying a C9A2 LMG. The C7A2 is considered a [...] "mid-life" [...] upgrade for the C7 family. The addition of the TRI-AD rail mount has made it easier for soldiers to attach accessories such as laser designators and tac lights.|$|E

Using the modified crossable intervals and the traffic volume on the secondary road and the obstacles within the improved <b>sight</b> distance <b>triangle</b> as selection criteria, we put forward the control mode selection flow diagram of plane intersections in this paper, hoping to quantize the selection criteria, as well as normalize and visualize the selection process.

25|$|Un{{controlled}} and yield (give way) controlled intersections require large <b>sight</b> <b>triangles</b> {{clear of}} obstructions {{in order to}} operate safely. At uncontrolled intersections, the basic right-of-way rules apply (either yield to the vehicle on the right, or the boulevard rule, depending on the location). Vehicle drivers {{must be able to}} see traffic approaching on the intersecting road at a point where they can adjust their speed, or stop if need be, to yield to the other traffic before reaching the intersection. It isn't the only criterion for allowing these types of intersection control. Changing an intersection to stop control is a common response to poor safety performance.|$|R

At the conceptual level, the project proposes two solutions {{for the implementation of}} two different types of roundabouts in accordance with the Technical Specifications for Public Roads. For this reason, the acquired traffic loads are obtained through counting of traffic and traffic studies. In both cases, the design solutions are presented {{in the form of a}} construction and traffic situation. The adequacy of the design solutions are checked both, in terms of capacity by calculating the saturation of individual aproaching roads, as well as in terms of transportability of the roundabout using horizontal path analysis. Improved traffic safety is established by analyzing the traffic speed at roundabouts and the construction <b>sight</b> <b>triangles.</b> In conclusion the project solutions are compared with one another based on global criteria for the selection of the roundabout...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I am {{dealing with the}} T {{intersection}} in Sežana. In the first part I make analysis of intersection capacity using the results of traffic counts. I also make the analysis of traffic safety. Main cause of poor traffic safety is lack of traffic sight. In {{the second and third}} part I present two possible solutions for improving traffic safety of the intersection. First solution in my opinion is roundabout, which is the most common solution for traffic calming and improvement of visibility. I make analysis of saturation and <b>sight</b> <b>triangle.</b> Second possible way of improving the exsisting condition is change of geometry of the exsisting intersection where Lipiška road is joining Bazoviška road at the angle of 90 degrees. Again analysis of intersection capacity and <b>sight</b> <b>triangle</b> is done and I find out that both values fot both solutions are permitted. The designing of the intersection is made with help from technical specifications for roads from various fields...|$|E

The first part is a complete analysis of the existing condition, which includes intersection capacity, traffic safety, speed and stopping distance measurements, and analysis of <b>sight</b> <b>triangle</b> of the intersection. It continues {{with a list of}} potential dangers, drawn from my own observations and locals’ experiences. The second part introduces the first possible solution for improvement of the existing condition, the most frequent solution for traffic calming – a roundabout. The next possible solution is a channelized intersection, introduced in the third part of this thesis. Both cases study saturation and visibility of each way of the intersection. I also design basic guiding of motor vehicles and other road users in the intersection using technical specifications for roads from various fields...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a usual 4 -way {{intersection}} {{which is in the}} vicinity of my home town. In the first part complete analysis of the intersection capacity, speed measurements, stopping distance and <b>sight</b> <b>triangle</b> of the intersection is carried out striving to improve the existing condition. I point out the potential conflicts considering my own and locals' experience of the intersection. In the second part I focus on possibility of designing a channelized intersection as the main solution possible to improve the existing condition. Additionally, I consider the possibility of a roundabout as the most frequent solution when aiming at the traffic calming. In both cases, I design basic guiding of motor vehicles and other road users in the intersection using technical specifications for roads from the various fields. At the end I prove that the condition has improved by calculating the intersection saturation and visibility of each way of the intersection...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to utilize light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology to obtain highway safety-related information. The safety needs of older drivers in terms of prolonged reaction times were taken into consideration. The tasks undertaken in this study were (1) identification of crashes that older drivers are more likely to be involved in, (2) identification of highway geometric features that are important in such crashes, (3) utilization of LIDAR data for obtaining information on the identified highway geometric features, and (4) assessment of the feasibility of using LIDAR data for such applications. A review of previous research indicated that older drivers have difficulty negotiating intersections, and it was recognized that intersection <b>sight</b> <b>triangles</b> were critical to safe intersection negotiation. LIDAR data were utilized to obtain information on potential sight distance obstructions at six selected intersections located on the Iowa Highway 1 corridor by conducting in-office line-of-sight analysis. Crash frequency, older driver involvement, and data availability were considerations in the selection of the six intersections. Results of the in-office analysis were then validated by visiting the intersections in the field. Sixty-six potential sight distance obstructions were identified by the line-of-sight analysis, out of which 62 (89. 8...|$|R
40|$|Many {{transportation}} {{agencies have}} started using offset right-turn lanes (ORTLs) at two-way stop-controlled intersections {{in the hope}} of improving driver safety by providing intersection departure <b>sight</b> distance <b>triangles</b> that eliminate through roadway right-turning vehicle obstructions. Currently, there are no specific geometric guidelines for key three-dimensional characteristics to allow drivers the optimal use of laterally-shifted right-turn lanes. Results of driver behavior studies at existing locations of offset right-turns lanes indicate that drivers are not performing as expected at parallel-type ORTLs, rendering its presence useless. Tapered-type ORTLs appear to be much more intuitive to driver expectancy and appropriate for the three-dimensional characteristics of all vehicle types. This research project identifies specific negative driver behaviors and recommends appropriate traffic control devices that meet current MUTCD guidelines to mitigate misleading visual cues and accentuate elements that reinforce the intended positive behavior at ORTL intersections for successful use of the laterally-offset right-turn auxiliary lane...|$|R
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the U. S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Texas Department of Transportation. The Interactive Graphics Intersection Design System (IGIDS) is a computer software program developed for TxDOT that assists engineers in the analysis and design of individual, at-grade intersections. IGIDS was initially developed under several RMC 3 – Geometric Design, Environmental, Hydraulics, and Right-of-Way projects. IGIDS is a MicroStation application which contains (1) geometric, traffic data, and signalization definition tools; (2) built-in analysis tools for vehicle turning templates; horizontal sight distance checking for stop sign, yield sign, and no control; and “Highway Capacity Manual” (HCM), Chapter 9 procedures; and (3) interfaces to external analysis programs for the TEXAS Model for Intersection Traffic (TEXAS), the TxDOT Automated Plan Preparation System (APP), and the Signal Operations and Analysis Package (SOAP). IGIDS can operate in English or metric units. IGIDS was recently enhanced by the addition of vertical sight distance checking within the horizontal <b>sight</b> <b>triangle,</b> the inclusion of pavement striping definition and tabulation, and the development of training materials. Most TxDOT engineers now use GEOPAK for the geometric design of intersections. TxDOT Traffic Operations personnel generally have access to the GEOPAK design files for an intersection. IGIDS was enhanced to directly read th...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{intersection}} {{sight distance}} can effectively lower {{the possibility of}} intersection accidents. American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (2011) provide a series of recommended dimensions of intersection sight triangles for uncontrolled and stop/yield-controlled intersections. However, in reality, although the actual intersection design for unsignalized intersections satisfies the requirements of sight distance and clear <b>sight</b> <b>triangle</b> in American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' guideline, {{there are still a}} large number of crashes occurring at unsignalized intersections for drivers running stop/yield signs or failing to slow down. This paper presents a driving simulator study on pre-crash at intersections under three intersection field of view (IFOV) conditions. The aim was to explore whether better IFOVs at unsignalized intersections improve their emergent collision avoidance performance under an assumption of valid intersection sight distance design. The experimental results show drivers' ability to identify potential hazards to be significantly affected by their IFOVs. As drivers' IFOV improved, drivers were more likely to choose braking actions to avoid collisions. Better IFOVs were also associated with significant increases in brake time to intersection and significant reductions in deceleration rate and crash rate, thus leading to a lower risk of traffic crash involvement. The results indicate that providing a better IFOV for drivers at intersections should be encouraged in practical applications in order to improve drivers' crash avoidance capabilities.
