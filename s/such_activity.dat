5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, a {{team led}} by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition. They claimed to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

5|$|On 23 August, dos Santos {{complained that}} the U.S. and South African governments {{continued}} to fund UNITA, warning <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's insistence that Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The MPLA government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under MPLA control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming {{each other for the}} resumption in armed conflict.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, patent {{aggregation}} and patent trolling {{activities have}} received growing attention {{from all over}} the world because of the controversial nature of <b>such</b> <b>activities.</b> Somehow it becomes a global obsession to presume that <b>such</b> <b>activities</b> or even the existence of PAEs are problematic by nature and need to be redressed via government intervention, partly due to the unpromising situation in the US. This article seeks to explore the nature of such issue and find out the most appropriate way for China to deal with such issue. The author believes that while <b>such</b> <b>activities</b> might at first sight seem problematic, in fact they are legal commercial practice in general, or more specifically, they are merely strategic uses of patents. This article also argues that there are available remedies under both EU and Chinese legal framework to catch the real problematic conducts derived from <b>such</b> <b>activities.</b> Hence it would seem to the author that even though the quantity of <b>such</b> <b>activities</b> is meant to increase in China, there is neither justification nor need to intervene such activities: the existing legal framework is enough to address certain misconducts; and the market is capable of ensuring its own equilibrium...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. <b>Such</b> <b>activity</b> requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented <b>such</b> <b>activity.</b> Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. <b>Such</b> <b>activity</b> was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, Europe {{experienced}} {{a series of}} protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that {{became known as the}} Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor.

A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} {{population of}} the Red River had historically been Métis and First Nation people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the Macdonald government from Bishop Taché and the HBC governor William Mactavish that any <b>such</b> <b>activity</b> would precipitate unrest, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered {{a survey of the}} area. The arrival on 20 August 1869 of a survey party headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis increased anxiety among the Métis. The Métis did not possess title to their land, which was in any case laid out according to the seigneurial system rather than in English-style square lots.|$|E
