Due to the ineffectiveness of chemical control and the lack of cultivars with high levels of genetic resistance, this study investigated the potential of three antagonists (Streptomyces setonii (UFV 618), Bacillus cereus (UFV 592) and Serratia marcescens (UFV 252)), and the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) as a positive control, to reduce {{bacterial spot}} symptoms and to potentiate defense enzymes in the leaves of tomato plants infected by Xg. Tomato seeds were microbiolized with each antagonist, and the soil was drenched with these bacteria. The plants were sprayed with JA 48 h before Xginoculation. The final average severity <b>on</b> the <b>tomato</b> plants was reduced by 29. 44, 59. 26 and 61. 33 % in the UFV 592, UFV 618 and JA treatments, respectively.

However, IAA was shown to influence the develop-ment of P. ultimum <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plantlets. Low concentrations of IAA (0 – 0. 1 mg ml 1) within the rhizosphere of plantlets increased the severity of the symptoms caused by P. ultimum, while higher concentrations (10 mg ml 1), applied either by drenching to the growing medium or by spraying on the shoot, reduced the symptoms caused by this pathogen.

When inoculated on plants with CMV RNA (strain KIN), the transcripts of the cloned Y satellite cDNA elicit a bright yellow mosaic on tobacco and a lethal necrosis ontomato. Addition of the transcripts of the Ra satellite cDNA to an inoculum of CMV RNA resulted in symptom attenuation on both tobacco and tomato, {{in agreement with the}} characterized symptoms of the natural satellite. Recombinant molecules involving these two satellites have been constructed in order to determine which parts of the Y satellite RNA are involved in symptom induction.

40|$|In Uganda, about 3 million {{households}} consume tomato. However, tomato yields (10 ton/ ha) are low due to poor agronomic practices, lack of high yielding and disease resistant varieties, and pests (Varela, 1995; Hansen, 1990; Defrancq, 1989). Viral diseases are the third {{major cause of}} low tomato productivity in Uganda. Therefore, a survey was conducted; <b>symptoms</b> observed <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> were categorized, and screened for both ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acid tomato viruses. Genetic identity for one main virus disease was investigated. Serological and molecular techniques, i. e. DAS-ELISA (Clerk and Adams, 1977), TAS-ELISA (Macintosh et al., 1992), DNA hybridization (Czosnek et al., 1988), and PCR (Navot et al., 1992; Maniatis et al. 1982) were used. TYLCV-UG and ToLCV-UG homology with other begomoviruses, and their vector (Bemisia tabaci) relationship were studied. Major <b>symptoms</b> observed <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> included leaf curl, mosaic and mottling, in descending order of importance. Ribonucleic acid viruses, i. e. Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Pepper veinal mottle virus (PVMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Potato virus X (PVX), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and Chili veinal mottle virus (ChiVMV), as well as deoxyribonucleic acid viruses, i. e. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-UG) and Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV-UG) were identified. TYLCV-UG {{was found to be}} homologous with TYLCV-EG. ToLCV-UG replication gene and coat protein were different from the same genes of other ToLCVs. Virus incidence varied in space and time, and with management practices, crop development stage, and weather conditions. Number of plants infected with tomato yellow leaf curl viruses (TYLCVs) was inversely proportional to percentage marketable tomato yield (R = - 0. 14, p = 0. 04). B. tabaci population, varied with micro-climatic conditions in the agro-ecosystem, and influenced TYLCVs incidence. Furthermore, an integrated package of uprooting infected plants and application of dimethoate insecticide was the most effective treatment in reducing whitefly populations and controlling TYLCVs.

40|$|Fusarium wilt, {{caused by}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases that affect tomato yield worldwide. This study investigated the potential of three antagonists, Streptomyces setonii (UFV 618), Bacillus cereus (UFV 592) and Serratia marcescens (UFV 252), and as positive control the hormone jasmonic acid (JA), to reduce Fusarium wilt symptoms and to potentiate the defense enzymes in the stem tissues of tomato plants infected by Fol. The seeds were microbiolized with each antagonist, and the soil was also drenched with them. The plants were sprayed with JA 48 h before Fol inoculation. The area under the Fusarium wilt index progress curve was reduced by 54, 48, 47 and 45 % for the UFV 618, JA, UFV 592 and UFV 252 treatments, respectively. The three antagonists, and even the JA spray, efficiently reduced the Fusarium wilt <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> the <b>tomato</b> plant stems, which can be explained by the lower malondialdehyde concentration (an indication of oxidative damage to lipids in the plasma membranes) and the greater activities of peroxidases, polyphenoloxidases, glucanases, chitinases, phenylalanine ammonia-lyases and lipoxygenases, which are commonly involved in host resistance against fungal diseases.

40|$|Sequence {{variants}} {{from field}} isolates of citrus exocortis viroid (CEV) that cause either mild or severe <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plants have previously been classified into two groups, A and B.

Infectivity studies with full-length cDNA clones of variants from each class have now directly confirmed the original correlation between Class A sequences and the severe phenotype and between Class B sequences and the mild phenotype. Direct evidence for this correlation could only be obtained by using individual sequence variants since field isolates of CEV {{have been shown to}} contain a mixture of RNA species. The construction and infectivity of chimaeric cDNA clones derived from mild and severe sequence variants of CEV has demonstrated that novel, infectious viroid molecules can be generated in vitro, and that PL is the pathogenicity-modulating domain. The role of the PR domain is not known but infectivity experiments with one chimaeric cDNA clone suggest that it may influence the efficiency of the infection or replication process of the viroid in the plant...|$|E
40|$|MetE and MetH are two {{distinct}} enzymes that catalyze a similar biochemical reaction {{during the last}} step of methionine biosynthesis, MetH being a cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas MetE activity is cobalamin-independent. In this work, we show that the last step of methionine synthesis in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is under the transcriptional control of the master pathogenicity regulator HrpG. This control is exerted essentially on metE expression through the intermediate regulator MetR. Expression of metE is strongly and specifically induced {{in the presence of}} plant cells in a hrpG- and metR-dependent manner. metE and metR mutants are not auxotrophic for methionine and not affected for growth inside the plant but produce significantly reduced disease <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> whereas disruption of metH has no impact on pathogenicity. The finding that the pathogen preferentially induces metE expression rather than metH in the presence of plant cells is indicative of a probable metabolic adaptation to physiological host conditions since this induction of metE occurs in an environment in which cobalamin, the required co-factor for MetH, is absent. It also shows that MetE and MetH are not functionally redundant and are deployed during specific stages of the bacteria lifecycle, the expression of metE and metH being controlled by multiple and distinct signals...|$|E

The name tomato chocolàte virus is proposed for this new torradovirus.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of a few years, Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) {{has become one of the}} most {{important}} viral diseases in tomato production worldwide. Infection by PepMV can cause a broad range of <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plants, often leading to significant financial loses. At present, five PepMV genotypes (EU,LP, CH 2, US 1 and US 2) have been described, three of which (EU, LP and US 2) have been reported in Europe. Thus far, no correlation has been found between different PepMV genotypes and the symptomps expressed in infected plants. In this paper, the genetic diversity of the PepMV population in Belgian greenhouses is studied and related to sympton development in tomato crops. A novel assay based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was developed to descrimate between the different PepMV genotypes. Both RFLP and sequence analysis revealed the occurrence of two genotypes, the EU genotype and the CH 2 genotype, within tomato production in Belgium. Whereas no differences were observed in symptom expression between plants infected by one of the two genotypes, co-infection with both genotypes resulted in more severe PepMV symptoms. Furthermore, our study revealed that PepMV recombinants frequently occur in mixed infections under natural conditions. This may possibly result in the generation of viral variants with increased aggressiveness...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{structure}} of a grapevine viroid (GVs) isolated in Spain was determined. The sequence consisted of 369 nucleotide residues forming a circular molecule. GVs presented extensive homology with viroids of the {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTV) group, that was specially high in the case of citrus exocortis viroid (CEV) both with variants found in isolates inducing severe (92 % with CEV-A) and mild (89 % with CEV-DE 26) <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato.</b> The secondary structure proposed for GVs showed that the changes in the sequence in relation to CEV-A generated modifications of the secondary structure particularly important in the left terminal (Tl), variable (V) and pathogenesis (P) viroid domains that have been postulated. Nevertheless it was noted in GVs a central core in the P domain that is conserved in the class A sequence variants characteristic of severe isolates, but not in the class B ones found in mild isolates of CEV. These observations indicate that GVs should be considered as a severe isolate of CEV from grapevine (CEV-g), a suggestion that correlates with the biological properties of CEV-g both in tomato and in Gynura aurantiaca.

40|$|Summary. Mangotoxin is an {{antimetabolite}} toxin that inhibits ornithine acetyl transferase, a {{key enzyme}} in the biosynthetic pathway of ornithine and arginine and recently reported in strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) isolated from mango. Since symptoms on mango tissues {{are very difficult}} to reproduce, in this study the role of mangotoxin in Pss viru-lence was addressed by analyzing the in planta growth and development of disease <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> leaflets. Inoculation experiments were carried out following several procedures using the wild-type strain Pss UMAF 0158, two Tn 5 -mutant deriv-ative strains defective in mangotoxin production, and their complemented derivative strains in which mangotoxin production is restored. The ability of the mangotoxin-defective mutants to grow in planta was similar, and their epiphytic survival on the tomato leaf surface identical to the wild-type and complemented strains. However, both the disease index data of incidence and the severity of necrotic symptoms indicated that mangotoxin-defective mutants were less virulent, indicating that man-gotoxin is a virulence factor. Furthermore, competition experiments showed that the survival values of the wild-type strain were slightly but significantly higher than those of the mangotoxin-defective mutants, suggesting that mangotoxin production would improve the epiphytic fitness of Pss.

40|$|Bacterial wilt and {{grey mould}} in tomato plants are {{economically}} destructive bacterial and fungal diseases caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. Various approaches including {{chemical and biological}} controls have been attempted to arrest the tomato diseases so far. In this study, in vitro growths of bacterial R. solanacearum and fungal B. cinerea were evaluated using four different vitamins including thiamine (vitamin B 1), niacin (vitamin B 3), pyridoxine (vitamin B 6), and menadione (vitamin K 3). In planta efficacies of the four vitamin treatments <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> protection against both diseases were also demonstrated. All four vitamins showed different in vitro antibacterial activities against R. solanacearum in dose-dependent manners. However, treatment with 2 mM thiamine was only effective in reducing bacterial wilt of detached tomato leaves without phytotoxicity under lower disease pressure (10 ⁶ colony-forming unit [cfu]/ml). Treatment with the vitamins also differentially reduced in vitro conidial germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea. The four vitamins slightly reduced the conidial germination, and thiamine, pyridoxine and menadione inhibited the mycelial growth of B. cinerea. Menadione began to drastically suppress the conidial germination and mycelial growth by 5 and 0. 5 mM, respectively.

40|$|We {{used two}} strains of tomato leaf curl virus from New Delhi to {{investigate}} specificity in replication of their cognate genomes. The strains share 94 % sequence identity and {{are referred to}} as severe and mild on the basis of <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> and tobacco. Replication assays in tobacco protoplasts and plants showed that a single amino acid change, Asn 10 to Asp in the N terminus of Rep protein, determines specificity for replication of the two strains based upon its interaction with the origin of replication (ori) sequences. The change of Asp 10 to Asn in Rep protein of the mild strain coupled with point mutations at the 3 rd and 10 th nucleotides of the 13 -mer binding site altered its replication ability, resulting in increased levels of virus accumulation. Similarly, changing Asn 10 to Asp in Rep protein of the severe strain impaired replication of the virus and altered its severe phenotype in plants. Site-directed mutations made in ori and Asn 10 of Rep protein suggested that Asn 10 recognizes the third base pair of the putative binding site sequence GGTGTCGGAGTC in the severe strain.

Mycelial growth rates and morphologies differed considerably between the strains, but no characters were observed to correlate with virulence or biotype. In plant inoculations using spores from basidiocarp-producing cultures, one C-biotype caused <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato,</b> an S biotype host. Mycelial proteomes of the nine strains were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), and 619 gel spots were indexed on all replicate gels {{of at least one}} strain. Multivariate analysis of these gel spots discriminated the L-biotype, but not the S-biotypes, from the remaining strains. The proteomic similarity of the S and C-biotypes could be seen as consistent with the limited host adaptation seen in our plant infections.

40|$|AbstractAfter the {{unexpected}} appearance of lethal <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plants {{infected with the}} PSTVd strain Intermediate Di, viroids were isolated and sequenced. It was found that a new strain, named RG 1, had been generated spontaneously in our greenhouse. In a different series of plant passages two new strains, named QF A and QF B, were detected which coexisted with the wild-type strain Di. Strains QF A and QF B showed intermediate symptoms when inoculated separately. In order to confirm the working hypothesis that the more pathogenic strain outcompetes the less pathogenic strain but strains of similar pathogenicity might coexist in the host, strains of different pathogenicity were mixed for inoculation in a ratio from 1 : 1 to 1 : 100 (more pathogenic:less pathogenic). The concentrations of the individual strains were determined 6 weeks postinfection with the method of nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the working hypothesis was confirmed. The total concentrations of viroids in infected plants were very similar, irrespective of whether severe, intermediate, or mild strains or mixtures of different strains were present. The mutations in all new strains (3 in RG 1, 2 in QF A, 3 in QF B) were located in the so-called virulence-modulating region. The mutations of strain RG 1 influenced dramatically the thermodynamic stability of the native rod-like structure, as determined experimentally by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis. Since during replication a multihairpin structure is generated transiently which is transformed afterwards into the red-like structure, a lower thermodynamic stability of the rod-like structure leads to a higher accumulation of the transient structure. It is assumed that the transient structure, which is active in replication as shown earlier, is essential also in pathogenesis. This model explains the experimentally determined interdependence between pathogenicity and replicability of PSTVd strains...|$|E

40|$|Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants {{grown in}} plastic {{greenhouses}} near Villa de Leyva, northeast of Bogota, Colombia showed necrotic {{spots on the}} leaves in September 2008. Initial symptoms were necrosis beginning {{at the base of}} leaflets that were surrounded by yellow areas. These symptoms resembled those described for Tomato torrado virus (ToTV; family Secoviridae, genus Torradovirus), which was first found in Spain (2). Other (tentative) members of the genus Torradovirus, Tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV), Tomato chocolate spot virus (ToChSV), and Tomato chocolàte virus (ToChV) (3) induce similar <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plants. One sample, coded T 418, was stored in the freezer and brought to our lab in 2011. Serological tests (double-antibody sandwich-ELISA) using polyclonal antibodies (Prime Diagnostics, Wageningen, The Netherlands) on leaf extracts showed the absence of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus X (PVX), and Potato virus Y (PVY). Leaf extracts were mechanically inoculated onto the indicator plants Physalis floridana, Nicotiana hesperis ‘ 67 A’, and N. occidentalis ‘P 1 ’ (six plants in total) and were kept in a greenhouse at 20 °C with 16 h of light. Necrotic symptoms appeared 4 to 5 days postinoculation and resembled those described for ToTV (2). Two dip preparations of systemically infected P. floridana and N. occidentalis leaves were examined by electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of spherical virus particles of approximately 30 nm. To confirm the presence of ToTV, total RNA was extracted from the original leaf material and an inoculated P. floridana and N. occidentalis plant using the Qiagen Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions. ToTV-specific primer sets ToTV-Dp 33 F/ToTV-Dp 20 R (5 '-TGCTCAATGTTGGAAACCCC- 3 '/ 5 '-AGCCCTTCATAGGCTAGCC- 3 ', amplifying a fragment of the RNA 1 polyprotein with an expected size of 751 bp) and ToTV-Dp 1 F/ToTV-Dp 2 R (5 '-ACAAGAGGAGCTTGACGAGG- 3 '/ 5 '-AAAGGTAGTGTAATGGTCGG- 3 ', amplifying a fragment on the RNA 2 movement protein region with an expected size of 568 bp) were used to amplify the indicated regions in a reverse transcription (RT) -PCR using the One-Step Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI). Amplicons of the predicted size were obtained in all tested materials. The PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly. BLAST analyses of the obtained sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. JQ 314230 and JQ 314229) confirmed the identity of isolate T 418 as ToTV, with 99 % identity to isolate PRI-ToTV 0301 in both fragments (GenBank Accession Nos. DQ 388879 and DQ 388880 for RNA 1 and RNA 2, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report of ToTV in Colombia, and interestingly, since ToTV has been found only in Europe and Australia (1) so far, this is the first report of ToTV on the American continen...|$|E
40|$|Owing {{to their}} large {{population}} size and short generation time, viruses generally {{have a huge}} potential to evolve and adapt under natural selection pressure. Despite tremendous efforts in human, animal and plant health management, viral diseases remain difficult to control and eradicate. Moreover, existing control strategies are compromised by the continuous emergence of new viruses. In Chapter 1 emerging viruses of tomato crops are reviewed. This includes Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a Potexvirus with a single stranded RNA genome, a rapidly emerging virus which {{has become one of}} the most important viral diseases in tomato production worldwide over the recent years. Infection by PepMV can cause a broad range of <b>symptoms</b> <b>on</b> <b>tomato</b> plants, of which especially the typical fruit marbling can lead to significant economical losses. Presently, five PepMV genotypes (EU, LP, CH 2, US 1 and US 2) have been described worldwide, three of which (EU, LP and US 2) have previously been reported to occur in Europe. As nature and severity of PepMV symptoms are highly variable, economical damage caused by PepMV is difficult to assess and the identification of factors contributing to symptom severity is warranted. In Chapter 2 the genetic diversity of the PepMV population in Belgian greenhouses is studied and related to the symptom development in tomato crops. Previously, no correlation has been found between different PepMV genotypes and the symptomatology of infected plants. A novel assay based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was developed to discriminate the different PepMV genotypes. Both RFLP and sequence analysis revealed the occurrence of two genotypes, the EU genotype as well as the CH 2 genotype, within the tomato production in Belgium. Surprisingly, a clear dominance of the CH 2 genotype in the Belgian PepMV population was found, although this genotype has previously not been found in commercial tomato production. Whereas no differences were observed in symptom expression between plants infected by one of the two genotypes, co-infection with both genotypes resulted in more severe PepMV symptoms. Furthermore, our study revealed that PepMV recombinants frequently occur in such mixed infections. So far, it remained unclear whether different PepMV isolates can cause differential symptom severity. Therefore, PepMV symptomatology of different isolates was studied in Chapter 3. Based on the survey described in Chapter 2, four isolates that differed in symptom expression in the crop of origin were selected for greenhouse trials. The selected isolates were inoculated onto tomato plants grown in separate plastic tunnels. PepMV symptom development was assessed regularly and extensive sampling followed by ELISA analyses, genotyping and nucleotide sequencing was performed to study viral presence and variation in PepMV sequences throughout the trial period. Two isolates (EU mild and CH 2 mild) that were selected based on mild symptom expression in the crop of origin caused only mild symptoms in the trial, while two other isolates (CH 2 aggressive and EU+CH 2) that were selected for severe symptom display, caused considerably more severe symptoms. Sequence identity between the mild and the aggressive CH 2 isolates was as high as 99. 4 %. Results of this study show that differential symptom expression can, at least partially, be attributed to the PepMV isolate, which may be related to minor differences at the nucleotide level between isolates. In Chapter 4, seed transmission of PepMV in tomato is demonstrated. Fruit was harvested from the greenhouse trials described in Chapter 3 and more than 100, 000 seeds were extracted and cleaned using an enzymatic treatment without disinfection. Infection assays using indicator plants confirmed the presence of infectious virus particles on the seeds. In the framework of a European project, seeds were distributed to 10 different laboratories in three separate batches, and germinated for seedling analyses by ELISA. In total over 87, 000 plants were tested, and 23 PepMV-infected plants were detected, indicating an overall transmission rate of 0. 026 %. Our results clearly show that PepMV can be transmitted from contaminated seeds to seedlings, highlighting the risk of using seeds from PepMV-infected plants, and revealed the potential for seed transmission to contribute to spread of PepMV. In Chapter 5, the potential of three mild PepMV isolates, belonging to the CH 2, EU and LP genotypes, to protect a tomato crop against the aggressive CH 2 isolate (Chapter 3) as the challenge isolate, was assessed in greenhouse trials. After challenge infection, enhanced symptom display was recorded in plants that were pre-inoculated with a protector isolate that belonged to a different genotype (EU, LP) than the challenge isolate. A quantitative genotype-specific TaqMan assay revealed that in these plants, the accumulation of the challenge isolate only temporarily slowed down. By contrast, efficient cross-protection was obtained using the mild isolate of the CH 2 genotype, and in this case the challenge isolate was barely detectable in the pre-inoculated plants. These results suggest that the interaction between PepMV isolates largely depends on RNA sequence homology and that post-transcriptional gene silencing plays an important role in cross-protection. As plant viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that hijack host cellular functions and resources for their replication and movement, they generally induce a wide variety of alterations in host gene expression and cell physiology. In Chapter 6, we used a custom-designed Affymetrix tomato GeneChip array that contains probe sets to interrogate over 22, 000 tomato transcripts to study transcriptional changes in response to inoculation with the highly similar (99. 4 % nucleotide sequence identity) mild and aggressive CH 2 isolates that are characterized in Chapter 3. Interestingly, our results show that both isolates induce differential transcriptomic responses in the tomato host despite accumulation to similar viral titers. PepMV inoculation resulted in an extensive transient repression of host genes which clearly affected primary metabolism. Especially the defense response intensity was higher upon inoculation with the aggressive isolate, and defense was mediated by salicylic acid signaling rather than by jasmonate signaling. Our results furthermore show that PepMV differentially regulates the RNA silencing pathway, suggesting a role for PepMV-encoded silencing suppressors, and the ubiquitination pathway. In addition, perturbation of pigment biosynthesis, as monitored by differential regulation of the flavonoid/anthocyanin and lycopene biosynthesis pathways, was monitored, which can be associated with the typical PepMV-induced marbling of tomato fruit. Finally, Chapter 7, the general discussion, is a PepMV pathogen profile in which the results obtained in this work are discussed and integrated into a review on the current knowledge on this highly successful pathogen of tomato crops...|$|E
