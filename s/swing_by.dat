5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|The California punk {{scene was}} in full <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> early 1977. In Los Angeles, there were the Weirdos, the Zeros, Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the Germs, X, the Dickies, Bags, and the {{relocated}} Tupperwares, now dubbed the Screamers. San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female Dee Dee and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known as the Young Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E

5|$|In {{his fourth}} over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston {{accompanied}} {{him from the}} other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall’s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.|$|E
25|$|Haggard's 1970 LP A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World, {{dedicated}} to Bob Wills, helped spark a permanent revival and expanded {{the audience for}} western <b>swing.</b> <b>By</b> this point, Haggard {{was one of the}} most famous country singers in the world, having enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol, accumulating 24 number-one country singles since 1966.|$|E

To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> orbits with the Hiten mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter Nozomi (PLANET-B), which {{was launched in}} 1998. It reached its target in 2003, but orbit injection had to be given up.|$|E

25|$|Waqar {{explained}} {{his ability to}} reverse <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> the manipulation of an old ball; with one side shiny, one side rough, the ball would move {{in the opposite direction}} to conventional swing. This led to Waqar having the ability to bowl inswingers and outswingers in the cricket pitch and in effect both Waqar and Akram became successful in taking wickets by this variation of swing bowling. His fastest timed delivery in cricket was 153km/h or 95.1mph, a delivery he bowled against South Africa in 1993 but this was after he had suffered serious back injuries which had really reduced his bowling speeds. He was also effective in the use of bouncers or short pitch deliveries; Waqar's bowling against South Africa in Sheikhupura in Pakistan, is remembered for his effective use of the short pitched delivery.|$|E
25|$|Pioneers and notable {{practitioners}} of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In {{the early days}} of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to Shaharyar Khan, reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan, who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, are also well known for the ability to reverse swing. Bowlers tend to disguise the direction of reverse <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> running up starting with the opposite hand before switching hands and covering the ball {{for as long as possible}} before release. Neil Wagner utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2008, Sabathia threw {{what was}} ruled as a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates in PNC Park. The one hit for the Pirates came {{off of a}} check <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> Andy LaRoche in the fifth inning that rolled fair and was bobbled by Sabathia on an {{attempted}} bare-handed pickup. The team sent in an appeal to Major League Baseball {{to try to get}} the hit ruled as an error, but were unsuccessful. Sabathia struck out eleven in the Brewers' 7–0 win over the Pirates, making Sabathia's ninth complete game in the 2008 season. On September 28, 2008, Sabathia pitched a 4-hitter against the Cubs to win 3–1 in the final game of the season, clinching the wild card for the Brewers—their first-ever postseason berth as a National League club and their first since losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 World Series. It was Sabathia's 10th complete game of the year, the most complete games by any pitcher in a single season since Randy Johnson threw 12 in 1999. In 2008 Sabathia had the most effective slider among major league starting pitchers. When batters swung at his pitches, they failed to make any contact 28% of the time, the highest percentage among major league starting pitchers.|$|E

25|$|The {{uprising}} {{was in full}} <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> April, {{managing to}} kill several figures at Constantin's court, including Ban Ghiorma Alexeanu and Clucer Cârstea Cornățeanu, {{as well as a}} former Vistier, George Karydis. By several accounts, Prince Constantin was his troops' hostage, pretending to endorse the massacres, but secretly asking for a Transylvanian intervention against the Seimeni. This view is partly contradicted by Xenopol, who notes that Constantin had a running dispute with the Transylvanian Prince, George II Rákóczi. The latter was interested in intervening against the Seimeni because he wanted Buicescul and his son to take over as puppet rulers of Wallachia. Rákóczi convened a Diet at his capital in Feyérvár (Bălgrad), asking for its permission to commence war in Wallachia. This began on April 13, with a southward march from Segesvár (Sighișoara) to Corona (Brașov), where Rákóczi gathered some 30,000 soldiers and 12 cannons. Faced with this emergency, the Seimeni took an oath from Constantin, who promised again to act as their sovereign. Led at the time by a Muslim, they welcomed Ottoman envoys, assuring them that theirs was not a revolt against the Empire. As Cazacu notes, the Ottoman overseers, in particular Siyavuş Pasha, wanted to join in the war on the Seimeni, but the main Ottoman army was still fearful of a war in the East.|$|E
500|$|The Invasion of Normandy, {{which started}} on the early morning of 6 June 1944, was in full <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> the time Waldmann's Staffel arrived in France. The Western Allies were already {{breaking}} out of Normandy in what was codenamed Operation Cobra. II./JG 3 [...] "Udet" [...] (2nd Group of the 3rd Fighter Wing) was stationed at Nogent-le-Roi, roughly [...] southwest of Paris. The Gruppe was tasked with ground support missions. In one of these missions against the Allied invasion forces, Waldmann claimed to have damaged a P-51 Mustang on 31 July 1944. He was credited with the destruction of numerous trucks during ground support missions over the period of 2–5 August 1944.|$|E

Beyoncé then shifts to another chaise longue where she relaxes with a bowl of snack food in her hand. Now wearing sunglasses, a black {{butterfly}} turban, and a furry green vest, Beyoncé lounges on a plastic chair around an inflatable pool toys next to lawn flamingos and beer bottle-filled kiddie pools. As she sings, she throws some snack food towards the camera. Cole arrives in a blue Bugatti to rap his verse in the parking lot. In a different scene, he sits on the bumper of a truck with Beyoncé on his left hand-side. They <b>swing</b> <b>by</b> the festivities once they hit the hotel room for a little after-hours. Later, Beyoncé is seen doing a retouch of her make up, sitting on the toilet. Kelly Rowland and Beyoncé are then shown, propped up against a red muscle car.
