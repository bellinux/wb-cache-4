40|$|Abstract—A {{two-stage}} <b>scan</b> {{architecture is}} proposed to constrain transition propagation within {{a small part}} of <b>scan</b> flip-flops. Most <b>scan</b> flip-flops are deactivated during test application. The first stage includes multiple <b>scan</b> chains, where each <b>scan</b> chain is driven by a primary input. Each <b>scan</b> flip-flop in the multiple <b>scan</b> chains drives a group of <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the second stage. <b>Scan</b> flip-flops in different stages use separate clock signals. Test signals assigned to <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the multiple <b>scan</b> chains are applied to the <b>scan</b> flip-flops of the second stage in one clock cycle after the test vector has been applied to the multiple <b>scan</b> chains. There exists no transition at the <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the second stage when a test vector is applied to the multiple <b>scan</b> chains.

40|$|Merged {{orthogonal}} <b>scan</b> is a <b>scan</b> {{technique for}} data path logic.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} not every <b>scan</b> cell {{contributes}} equally to the power consumption during <b>scan</b> based test.

40|$|Background: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results?Medicare database, a {{substantial}} increase {{was found in the}} use of positron emission tomography (PET) <b>scans</b> after 2004 in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients. The reason for the increased utilization of the PET <b>scan</b> was not clear based on available the data. Therefore, the indications for and outcomes of PET <b>scans</b> performed at an academic institution were evaluated. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed of DTC patients who underwent surgery at the University of Michigan Health System from 2006 to 2011. After identifying patients who underwent a PET <b>scan,</b> indications, rate of positive PET <b>scans,</b> and impact on management were evaluated. For positive <b>scans,</b> the location of disease was characterized, and presence of disease on other imaging was determined. Results: Of the 585 patients in the cohort, 111 (19 %) patients had 200 PET <b>scans</b> performed for evaluation of DTC. Indications for PET <b>scan</b> included: elevated thyroglobulin and negative radioiodine <b>scan</b> in 52 <b>scans</b> (26. 0 %), thyroglobulin antibodies in 13 <b>scans</b> (6. 5 %), rising thyroglobulin in 18 <b>scans</b> (9. 0 %), evaluation of abnormality on other imaging in 22 <b>scans</b> (11. 0 %), evaluation of extent of disease in 33 <b>scans</b> (16. 5 %), follow-up of previous <b>scan</b> in 57 <b>scans</b> (28. 5 %), other indications in two <b>scans</b> (1. 0 %), and unclear indications in three <b>scans</b> (1. 5 %). The PET <b>scan</b> was positive in 124 studies (62. 0 %); positivity was identified in the thyroid bed on 25 <b>scans,</b> cervical or mediastinal lymph nodes on 105 <b>scans,</b> lung on 28 <b>scans,</b> bone on four <b>scans,</b> and other areas on 14 <b>scans.</b> Therapy following PET <b>scan</b> was surgery in 66 cases (33. 0 %), chemotherapy or radiation in 23 cases (11. 5 %), observation in 110 cases (55. 0 %), and palliative care in one case (0. 5 %). Disease was identifiable on other imaging in 66 % of cases. PET <b>scan</b> results changed management in 59 cases (29. 5 %). Conclusions: In this academic medical center, the PET <b>scan</b> was utilized in 19 % of patients. Indications for the PET <b>scan</b> included conventional indications, such as elevated thyroglobulin with noniodine avid disease, and more controversial uses, such as evaluation of extent of disease or abnormalities on other imaging tests. PET <b>scan</b> results changed management in about 30 % of cases...|$|R
40|$|Coordinated <b>scan</b> {{can gather}} host {{information}} for further attack more efficiently and stealthily than single-source port <b>scans</b> by distributing tasks amongst multiple sources. The existing coordinated <b>scan</b> detection methods are mostly based on <b>scan</b> behavior characteristics in temporal or spatial correlation.

In this paper, we propose an approach to detecting coordinated <b>scans</b> based on {{the similarities between the}} <b>scan</b> behavior sequences launched by the scanners. Based {{on the assumption that the}} scanners controlled by an attacker are similar in the <b>scan</b> behaviors, the coordinated <b>scan</b> detection problem can be reduced to that of recognizing the similar <b>scan</b> sequences. We first present a description model of coordinated <b>scan.</b> Then a detection algorithm is developed based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances between the sequences and a hierarchical clustering method was used to recognize coordinated scanners.

40|$|Several years ago, {{every patient}} {{that was brought}} to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital with a closed head injury would receive a CT <b>scan</b> — {{regardless}} of whether or not that patient already had a <b>scan</b> performed at an outside institution.

Now, each patient is followed by a total of three CT <b>scans.</b> If a patient had undergone a CT <b>scan</b> at an outside institution, this <b>scan</b> was loaded onto the Jefferson system and was considered their first CT <b>scan.</b> A follow-up CT <b>scan</b> was to be performed 6 hours after the initial <b>scan</b> if any intracranial pathology was noted. As long as the patient remained neurologically stable, a third and final CT <b>scan</b> was to be performed sometime between 12 to 24 hours after the initial <b>scan.</b> Therefore, patients with non-operative intracranial hemorrhage received two or three CT <b>scans</b> at our institution and were observed for at least 24 hours...|$|R
