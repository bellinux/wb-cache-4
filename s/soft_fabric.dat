25|$|An adapted abacus, {{invented by}} Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still {{commonly}} used {{by individuals who}} are blind. A piece of <b>soft</b> <b>fabric</b> or rubber is placed behind the beads {{so that they do}} not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1570s, a <b>soft</b> <b>fabric</b> {{hat with}} a {{gathered}} crown was worn. These derived from the flat hat of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller and far from flat. Later, a conical felt {{hat with a}} rounded crown called a capotain or copotain became fashionable. These became very tall {{toward the end of}} century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or feather, and were worn indoors and out.|$|E
25|$|From the 1890s, {{the mills}} {{produced}} Viyella, {{a mixture of}} cotton with Merino wool, which produces a <b>soft</b> <b>fabric.</b> They continued to flourish, as various extensions show. The Upper Mill was extended in the 1890s, when a fourth storey was added, and again, probably in 1913, when extensions {{were added to the}} north and rear. A large combing shed, where cotton fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, was built just below it in 1913. This was a two-storey building, with a single storey wing at the back. It was extended in 1952, when an extra two floors were added to the main shed, and a three-storey block was added at the side. At this point, it became a mill, and is now called Mill 2. The Lower Mill was also extended, but because it was much larger than the Upper Mill when it was built, and the extensions were relatively small, it retains more of its original character. There were 980 workers employed at the site in 1934, but decline gradually set in. The first workers houses were demolished in 1961, to be followed by the school, the baths and the Mechanics Institute. By 1987, production had moved abroad, and the mills closed. Bolsover District Council bought the mill buildings in 1992, using compulsory purchase powers, and they have been revitalised, to be used for light industry and offices. The mill ponds have also survived.|$|E

500|$|Technical {{director}} Piers Shepperd masterminded {{the complex}} change from rural to industrial during 'Pandemonium'. The seven inflatable chimneys {{were made by}} Airworks, and varied in height (three were , two were [...] and two were [...] high). They were made of <b>soft</b> <b>fabric,</b> with an outer layer of printed brick pattern. [...] Each contained four industrial fans at the base to inflate them, and a smoke machine near the top, and were hoisted into the air from the overhead rigs. Life-size beam engines were constructed onstage by teams of stage hands {{and members of the}} Volunteer Staging Team. [...] At the climax of 'Pandemonium', in the Olympic ring forging scene, amber lights lit in sequence created the illusion of a [...] molten steel river, with pyrotechnic smoke and dry ice as steam. [...] The original grass floor surface had been removed to reveal a giant stylised map of London.|$|E
60|$|The danger, however, was {{not quite}} over. Alison quietly felt with one little, lightly shod foot beneath the cloth, part of which had caught and rested on her dress. Her shoe touched {{something}} that seemed harder than the <b>soft</b> <b>fabric,</b> and she contrived to draw it toward her.|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill laughed, and {{the girl}} who sat beside the man he had spoken to flashed a swift glance at him. She was dressed in some thin, <b>soft</b> <b>fabric,</b> of a pale gold tint, and the firm, round {{modeling}} of the figure it clung about proclaimed her {{a native of the}} Iberian peninsula, the Peninsula, as those who are born there love to call it. Still, there was no tinge of olive in her face, which, like her arms and shoulders, was of the whiteness of ivory. Her eyes, which had a faint scintillation in them, were of a violet black, and her hair of the tint of ebony, though it was lustrous, too. She, however, said nothing, and Major Chillingham, who seemed to feel himself neglected, broke in.|$|E

60|$|She {{stood up}} by his side, little flashes of firelight {{lighting}} her soft white skin, gleaming upon the <b>soft</b> <b>fabric</b> of her gown. She wore no ornaments. The Mandeleys pearls, generally worn by the unmarried women of the family, were reposing in the famous vaults of a West End pawnbroker. Her strong, capable fingers were innocent of even a single ring, although upon her dressing table there was even at that moment reposing a very beautiful pearl one, concerning which she had made some insignificant criticism with only one object, an object which she refused to admit even to herself. David remained silent through sheer wonder. He had a sudden feeling {{that he had been}} admitted, even if for only these few moments, into the inner circle of her toleration--perhaps even more than that.|$|E
60|$|The long, light-tinted skirt was no fuller {{than was}} necessary, but Eleanor {{could afford to}} wear it so, for both in man and woman the average Western figure is modeled in long {{sweeping}} lines, and the <b>soft</b> <b>fabric</b> emphasized her dainty slenderness. The pale-blue blouse that hung in filmy, lace-like folds heightened {{the color of her}} eyes and the clear pallor of her ivory complexion. Eleanor was, in fact, quite satisfied with her appearance, and aware that it suggested a Puritanical simplicity, which was in one respect, at least, not altogether misleading. There is a certain absence of grossness in {{the men and women of}} the West, and even their vices are characterized rather by daring than by materialistic sensuality. She felt that she loathed the man and the part circumstances had forced on her while she dressed herself in expectation of his visit; but, for all that, she was prepared to undertake it.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a recent survey on robotic {{grippers}}. In many cases, modern grippers outperform their older counterparts which are now stronger, more repeatable, and faster. Technological advancements have also attributed {{to the development of}} gripping various objects. This includes <b>soft</b> <b>fabrics,</b> microelectromechanical systems, and synthetic sheets. In addition, newer materials are being used to improve functionality of grippers, which include piezoelectric, shape memory alloys, smart fluids, carbon fiber, and many more. This paper covers the very first robotic gripper to the newest developments in grasping methods. Unlike other survey papers, we focus on the applications of robotic grippers in industrial, medical, for fragile objects and <b>soft</b> <b>fabrics</b> grippers. We report on new advancements on grasping mechanisms and discuss their behavior for different purposes. Finally, we present the future trends of grippers in terms of flexibility and performance and their vital applications in emerging areas of robotic surgery, industrial assembly, space exploration, and micromanipulation. These advancements will provide a future outlook on the new trends in robotic grippers...|$|R

50|$|Mme Chéruit’s {{aesthetic}} was traditionally feminine, incorporating <b>soft</b> <b>fabrics,</b> pastel {{colors and}} rare embroideries, {{but she was}} innovative in line and cut. In late 1911 she introduced the pannier gown, full at the hips and tapering to an ankle-length hem, which recalled French court fashions of the 18th century. Delicate evening dresses may have been her forte, {{but she was also}} adept at elegant street wear, and by 1914 her walking suits and afternoon gowns were fashion staples.|$|R

25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, <b>soft</b> <b>fabrics</b> and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.|$|R
