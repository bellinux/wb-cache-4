25|$|Salmon {{spend their}} early life in rivers, and then swim {{out to sea}} where they live their adult lives and gain most of their body mass.

It is thought that, {{when they are in}} the ocean, they use magnetoception to locate the general position of their natal river, and once close to the river, that they use their sense of smell to home in on the river entrance and even their natal <b>spawning</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{spawning}} {{area of the}} Arcto-Norwegian cod is vast, extending from 62 degrees N to 74 degrees 30 'N in the area investigated. Localities characterized by an intensive rate of spawning are in the Norwegian Sea over the Langgrunnen, Buagrunnen, Halten, Røst, Vesterålen, Andøy, Malangen and Fugløy Banks, in the shelf slope area and in the open sea over great depths. The position of <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> {{and the intensity of}} spawning in the area vary from year to year. Various positions of <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> are grouped into three types: Type 1 - the main <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> are only in the areas of banks near the shore; Type 2 - <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> are both in the areas of banks and in the shelf slope area; Type 3 - <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> are outside the Norwegian Sea shelf and over the Malangen Bank. The position of <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> in the survey area outside the Vestfjorden is not an indicator of the abundance of year classes of the Arcto-Norwegian cod...|$|R

25|$|Forage fish {{often make}} great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a {{particular}} stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds.

25|$|The many mountains, {{streams and}} rivers form a major <b>spawning</b> <b>ground</b> for several species of trout and salmon; yet recently, in the last 50 years, some of the fish stocks have fallen drastically, {{particularly}} salmon stocks. The ecoregion's rivers and streams are home to nine species of native salmonids. The depletions occur mainly because dams and clearcutting on the rugged slopes of the area contribute to large amounts of silt in the stream beds, which in turn interfere with spawning salmon, as they lay their eggs in exposed gravel beds. The notable fish species are king, kokanee, and silver salmon, brown, brook, and rainbow trout (including steelhead), and crappie, bluegill, catfish, and largemouth and smallmouth bass.|$|E
25|$|Spawning grounds are {{the areas}} of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn {{may or may not}} drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species {{undertake}} migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up to three or four thousand kilometres to their <b>spawning</b> <b>ground</b> in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.|$|E
2500|$|Kleptogamy {{refers to}} the sneaking {{behavior}} during reproduction. Female gobies prefer male gobies with large bodies.

The sneakers then release their sperm on the <b>spawning</b> <b>ground</b> {{as soon as the}} paired female releases her eggs. [...] Though sneakers’ sperm fertilizes some eggs, the paired male cannot distinguish the eggs fertilized by the sneakers from those fertilized by his own sperm. Therefore, the paired male equally gives parental care to all the eggs.|$|E

40|$|The catch, distribution, {{and biology}} were studied in Norwegian spring {{spawning}} herring during the spawning season in 1995.

The herring arrived the <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds</b> in a decreasing order of length and condition. This was mainly due to size specific swimming speed and not size specific maturation. Delayed maturation with fish length was only found within the recruits, which spawned in a second wave. In addition, the size and condition of the fish in a spawning area increased southwards, {{and there was a}} delayed spawning and prolonged spawning period at the northernmost <b>spawning</b> <b>grounds.</b> We suggest that life-history theory explains the observed spawning distribution.

2500|$|Some {{sea turtles}} migrate long {{distances}} between feeding and spawning grounds. Green turtles have feeding grounds along the Brazilian coast. Each year, {{thousands of these}} turtles migrate about [...] to their <b>spawning</b> <b>ground,</b> Ascension Island in the Atlantic, an island only [...] across. Each year the returning turtles dig between 6,000 and 15,000 nests, often returning to the same beach from where they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males {{on the other hand}} visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate. Green sea turtles' mating is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line where she digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. Litter size depends on the age of the female and species, but green turtle clutches range between 100 and 200. She then covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.|$|E
6000|$|The loch {{seems to}} prove that any hill-tarn might be made {{a good place for}} sport, if trout were {{introduced}} where they do not exist already. But the size of these in Loch Beg puzzles me, nor can one see how they breed, as breed they do: for twice or thrice I caught a fingerling, and threw him in again. No burn runs out of the loch, and, even in a flood, the feeder is so small, and its course so extremely steep, that one cannot imagine where the fish manage to spawn. The only loch known to me where the common trout are of equal size, is on the Border. It is extremely deep, with very clear water, and with scarce any <b>spawning</b> <b>ground.</b> On a summer evening the trout are occasionally caught; three weighing seven pounds were taken one night, a year or two ago. I have not tried the evening fishing, but at all other times of day have found them the [...] "dourest" [...] of trout, and they grow dourer. But one is always lured on by the spectacle of the monsters which throw themselves out of water, with a splash that echoes through all the circuit of the low green hills.
