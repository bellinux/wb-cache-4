40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of ultrasound in the diagnosis <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> odontogenic origin. Study design: The study group consisted of 25 patients with inflammatory <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> odontogenic origin. Only patients with unilateral swellings were considered for inclusion in the pathologic study group and normal contralateral side was taken as control. Results: Clinically, four cases were diagnosed as cellulitis and 21 cases as abscesses. Under ultrasonography (USG) diagnosis, six cases were diagnosed as edema and two cases as cellulitis and 15 cases as preabscess and two cases as abscesses, considering the intra operative diagnosis as the gold standard technique. The ultrasonography technique presented sensitivity of 92 %. Conclusion: USG can differentiate facial edema, facial cellulitis, and dentoalveolar abscess. USG can also evaluate the extension <b>of</b> these <b>swellings.</b> It is prudent to subject patients with inflammatory <b>swellings</b> <b>of</b> the maxillofacial region to USG in order to determine the appropriate treatment plan...|$|R
5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of {{white blood cells}} (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils).

5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the brain).|$|E

5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (<b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy.

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects.

5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.

Occasionally there may be <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the front part of the neck due to goitre.

5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site.
