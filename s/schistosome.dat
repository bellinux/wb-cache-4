5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are <b>schistosome</b> eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E

40|$|A {{schistosomiasis}} {{model is}} proposed including single <b>schistosomes,</b> paired <b>schistosomes,</b> snails, and the latent period of infected snails. A reasonable sex ratio of <b>schistosomes</b> and the minimum mating function are considered. A threshold condition determining {{the stability of}} the system is given, and the stability of equilibrium for the model is shown. The impact of the latent period of infected snails on schistosomiasis transmission can be found through numerical simulations. Finally, preferable control strategies are obtained by sensitivity analyses. Killing snails may be the preferred control measure. If we choose chemotherapy, we should use some drugs which are sufficient for reducing egg-associated pathology, since paired <b>schistosomes</b> are mostly harmful to definitive hosts...|$|R
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms required for <b>schistosomes</b> to take up glucose, the major nutritional source exploited by these blood flukes from their mammalian hosts and the subsequent metabolism required to fuel growth and fecundity, can provide new avenues for developing novel interventions for the control of schistosomiasis. This aspect of parasitism is particularly important to paired adult <b>schistosomes,</b> due to their considerable requirements for the energy needed to produce the extensive numbers of eggs laid daily by the female worm. This review describes recent advances in characterizing glucose metabolism in adult <b>schistosomes.</b> Potential intervention targets are discussed within the insulin signaling and glycolysis pathways, both of which play critical roles in the carbohydrate and energy requirements of <b>schistosomes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{concerning the}} mechanism of action of praziquantel has been recently reported. The drug seems to interfere with adenosine uptake in cultured worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the <b>schistosome,</b> as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines such as adenosine de novo.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>schistosomes</b> undergo normal {{maturation}} and morphological {{development in}} {{the presence or absence}} of a female, although behavioural, physiological and antigenic differences between males from single-sex, as opposed to bisex, infections have been reported. On the other hand, female <b>schistosomes</b> do not mature without a male. Female <b>schistosomes</b> from single-sex infections are underdeveloped and exhibit an immature reproductive system. Although the maturation of the female worm seems to be dependent on the presence of the mature male, the stimuli for female growth and for reproductive development seem to be independent from each other.|$|R

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about insulin {{signalling}} in <b>schistosomes</b> despite its potential importance in host-parasite molecular dialogue and parasite growth and development. The recent characterization of two insulin receptors (SmIR- 1 and SmIR- 2) in Schistosoma mansoni has led us to reconsider the question of the potential importance of insulin in host-schistosome interactions. In this work, we demonstrated that insulin could regulate glucose uptake in <b>schistosomes</b> and we investigated the implication of SmIR- 1 and SmIR- 2 in this process. The possibility that specific inhibitors of SmIR- 1 and SmIR- 2 tyrosine kinase activities could be developed to target <b>schistosomes</b> is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Antibody {{detection}} can {{be useful}} to indicate <b>schistosome</b> infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs cannot be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens. Test sensitivity and specificity vary widely among the many tests reported for the serologic diagnosis of schistosomiasis and are dependent on both the type of antigen preparations used (crude, purified, adult worm, egg, cercarial) and the test procedure.|$|E
25|$|At CDC, a {{combination}} of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for antibody detection. All serum specimens are tested by FAST-ELISA using S. mansoni adult microsomal antigen (MAMA). A positive reaction (greater than 9 units/µl serum) indicates infection with Schistosoma species. Sensitivity for S. mansoni infection is 99 percent, 95 percent for S. haematobium infection, and less than 50 percent for S. japonicum infection. Specificity of this assay for detecting <b>schistosome</b> infection is 99 percent. Because test sensitivity with the FAST-ELISA is reduced for species other than S. mansoni, immunoblots of the species appropriate to the patient's travel history are also tested to ensure detection of S. haematobium and S. japonicum infections. Immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific and so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species. The presence of antibody is indicative only of <b>schistosome</b> infection at some time and cannot be correlated with clinical status, worm burden, egg production, or prognosis. Where a person has traveled can help determine what Schistosoma species to test for by immunoblot.|$|E
25|$|In long {{established}} disease adult worms {{lay eggs}} {{that can cause}} inflammatory reactions. The eggs secrete proteolytic enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to be shed. However the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver, spleen, lungs, or brain. The long term manifestations are dependent on the species of <b>schistosome</b> as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas. Many infections are mildly symptomatic, with anemia and malnutrition being common in endemic areas.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{characters}} {{alone have}} so far failed to provide adequate criteria for {{the identification of the}} molluscan intermediate hosts of African <b>schistosomes.</b> In the course of investigations into various other taxonomic approaches, it has been found that the egg proteins, when subjected to electrophoresis, are sensitive indicators of differences at the population level. About 80 populations of various species of African and Neotropical planorbids have been examined in this preliminary study. Differences at the population level have a considerable bearing on relationships between the snails and the larval <b>schistosomes</b> that parasitize them and help to explain the evolution of local races of <b>schistosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of drug resistant pathogens {{is a great}} challenge to the control of infectious diseases. Schistosomiasis {{is one of the}} world's greatest neglected tropical diseases, and it is primarily controlled with the drug praziquantel. This drug is often used by repeatedly treating patients to maintain reduced worm burdens, an ideal situation to encourage the evolution of resistant worms. Although drug based control programs are increasing, monitoring efforts for drug resistance remain rare. We measured drug susceptibility of <b>schistosomes</b> from a cohort of patients in Kenya who are enrolled in a longitudinal study in which they are repeatedly treated with praziquantel. We found that <b>schistosomes</b> from previously treated patients were significantly less susceptible than those that were not. Also, <b>schistosomes</b> derived from a single patient who had been treated with praziquantel 18 times showed marked resistance. Although {{the findings of this study}} indicated that reduced drug susceptibility occurs in this population of <b>schistosomes,</b> this trait does not seem to be spreading widely or creating clinical levels of resistance. We hypothesize that the trait remains at low frequency because of the large population of <b>schistosomes</b> that are not exposed to the drug and/or potential fitness costs associated with reduced susceptibility...|$|R

25|$|The mode {{of action}} is not exactly known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of <b>schistosome</b> cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
25|$|Swimmer’s itch {{probably}} {{has been around}} as long as humans. The condition was known to exist {{as early as the}} 1800s, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a biologist found that the dermatitis was caused by the larval stage of a group of flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae. The genera most commonly associated with swimmer’s itch in humans are Trichobilharzia and Gigantobilharzia. It can also be caused by <b>schistosome</b> parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as Schistosomatium douthitti, which infects snails and rodents. Other taxa reported to cause the reaction include Bilharziella polonica and Schistosoma bovis. In marine habitats, especially along the coasts, swimmer’s itch can occur as well.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSchistosomes {{represent}} a unique animal model for comparative analyses of monogamy. Indeed, <b>schistosomes</b> are classified {{at the lowest}} taxonomical level of monogamous species and lack complex social interactions, which could alter {{our understanding of the}}ir unusual mating system. Elements discussed here include the fact that monogamy in <b>schistosomes</b> could be an ancestral state between hermaphroditism and polygyny or polygynandry and the occurrence of mate changes. In addition, hypotheses are proposed to explain monogamy in <b>schistosomes</b> (e. g. female dispersion, the need for paternal care, oviposition site limitation or aggressiveness, and mate guarding). We also propose future experimental and analytical approaches to improve our understanding of the schistosomes' mating system...|$|R
