2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson {{asked her what she}} would do if she were in his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E
2500|$|Mulan {{tells her}} {{they can still}} track the helm and Merida says if her dad can’t lead without magic, neither can she. Later, Mulan takes the cloak scrap and goes to see the witch {{to get her to}} tell her who the cloak belongs to. She goes into the witch’s house and looks around. The wolf snarls and leaps. Mulan backs away and it follows her outside. Then Mulan smiles at her and says she’s not a wolf, and {{transforms}} into Ruby, who told them that Mary Margaret and Emma told them about Mulan and she says she knows Philip and Aurora too. Mulan gets quiet and says it’s hard to travel between realms then asks how Red ended up here. Its revealed in a flashback after defeating Zelena that Ruby told Mary Margaret that being the only one of her kind in Storybrooke, she wanted to return to the Enchanted Forest to find others like her with a magic bean given to her by Tiny who had managed to grow one. But when she arrived back in the Enchanted Forest, the pack had already left and so she sought help from the witch to find them but instead <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> into a wolf to be her guard. When they arrived to the lake and used the spell to bring the helm up, both Arthur and Zelena are stopped by Mulan, Merida, and Ruby. Merida then fights Arthur after finding out he killed her father while Mulan and Ruby use sleeping powder on Zelena as payback. Arthur and Zelena return to Camelot defeated when the clans of DunBroch arrive to aid Merida.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (cutting him short contemptuously). It is {{unnecessary}} {{to tell us}} anything more. That is quite enough for us. (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on him and sweeps majestically back to the window.) ...|$|R

60|$|VALENTINE. Do {{you really}} think it would make me beautiful? (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on him with the coldest contempt.) Ah, you see you're not in earnest. Love can't give any man new gifts. It can only heighten the gifts he was born with.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to him {{and stood}} looking at the fire again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> upon him, and, without reply, {{sat down}} before her glass.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on him peevishly, as if tired {{with the}} efforts of her memory.|$|E
6000|$|O heedless pair of sportsmen slack! [...] You never mark, though trout or jack, [...] Or little foolish stickleback, [...] Your baited snares may capture.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> shapeless <b>back</b> {{on me and}} {{vanished}} into the kitchen region of the house.|$|R

60|$|But Felicity's {{theology}} {{broke down}} at this point. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on Peter and walked disdainfully away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ough!" [...] was all Mademoiselle's comment as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> upon me. Nevertheless, I {{bowed and}} flourished my beaver to her {{retreating}} figure.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> resolutely on convention. The slave {{for once}} rebelled against the taskmaster: the puppet refused to {{dance to the}} ever-wearying {{monotonous}} tune.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Boyne," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "sometimes I think you're almost a fool!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> upon {{her son and}} left him.|$|E
60|$|For answer <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> full upon him, but {{not without}} first {{throwing}} him such a look of contempt that brought the scarlet to his cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{this suit}} you, Mr. Bhaer?" [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to him, and feeling deeply {{grateful}} for the chance of hiding her face.|$|R
60|$|After {{delivering}} {{herself of}} this protest <b>she</b> half <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on <b>her</b> friend, {{and for a}} time there was silence between them, and then Fan spoke.|$|R
50|$|She {{follows the}} man {{into a house}} where all the {{furniture}} is covered with white blankets. She opens many doors, and in one room finds a bed on which a man is lying covered in a white blanket as if laid out in death. They {{stare at each other}} for some moments; then a cat leaps from <b>her</b> arms, and <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and leaves. After walking through several doors, she finds herself on a hilltop, and climbs down to a dune field.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have no more}} to say, Mr. Delamayn." [...] With that reply <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on him, {{and closed}} the door of the morning-room between them.|$|E

6000|$|... "You haven't told me anything." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to him, {{looking away}} at the splendid view. [...] "I do love the scenery," [...] she added in a moment.|$|E
5000|$|Máire, {{sister of}} the corpse Seán Ó Baoill, accidentally cremated in [...] "Dubh agus Bán". She makes the {{situation}} difficult by arriving from New York City (and corrects Charlie by saying she is actually from Boston) just as the coffin containing a falsely bearded and hungry Pádraig has been sealed (with him hiding behind a wardrobe). Unable to find a false beard the three cut one from the <b>back</b> of <b>her</b> coat, which becomes very clear as <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to leave the room.|$|R
6000|$|RUFIO (startled, and puzzled). It was not you: {{you were}} with us when it happened. (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> scornfully on him. He shakes his head, and draws the {{curtains}} to go out. It is now a magnificent moonlit night. The table has been removed. Ftatateeta {{is seen in the}} light of the moon and stars, again in prayer before the white altar-stone of Ra. Rufio starts; closes the curtains again softly; and says in a low voice to Cleopatra) Was it she? With her own hand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose Jim {{will tell}} us all about him," [...] said Mrs. Bradley, dismissing the subject, as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> sleeves <b>back</b> over <b>her</b> white arms, preparatory to {{grappling}} certain culinary difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|... "For Becky Sharp," [...] {{answered}} Jemima, trembling very much, and blushing {{over her}} withered face and neck, as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> on her sister. [...] "For Becky Sharp: she's going too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied; {{and there}} was {{freezing}} hauteur in her voice. With a slight gesture of dismissal, unmistakable in its finality, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> upon him. Then she joined her guests.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'd rather--I {{have the}} money," [...] she {{declared}} hurriedly; and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{that he might}} not perceive, when she had extracted the bills, how little was left in her purse.|$|E
60|$|Louisa <b>turned</b> upon <b>her</b> pillow, {{and heard}} no more. When {{her sister had}} withdrawn, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> head <b>back</b> again, and lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father entered.|$|R
6000|$|LADY. You brute! (abandoning the attitude, {{she comes}} {{to the end of}} the couch, where <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to it, leaning against it and facing him with her hands behind her.) ...|$|R
