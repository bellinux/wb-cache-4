5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{welfare and}} {{leaseback}} programs got an abrupt ending as well. Eventually rulings {{were made on}} the tax issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable. This {{as well as the}} bad media coverage of Brixtofte meant that investors lost faith in the administration. This caused the collapse of various plans that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites. On top of that came increasing rent costs from the previous sales and eventually the municipality was forced to abandon the extraordinary welfare programs and dramatically raise its taxes. It went from being one of the cheapest {{to one of the most}} expensive municipalities in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Briseis wasn't {{the only}} {{sensation}} surrounding the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Two {{months before the}} event, on Saturday 9 September, the City of Melbourne sailed for Melbourne from Sydney with a cargo including 13 racehorses, {{many of whom were}} considered serious contenders for the Melbourne Cup. The following day the ship ran into a savage storm and was hit by several rogue waves, with Nemesis (the winner of the 1876 AJC Metropolitan Handicap in Randwick, Sydney and favourite for the Cup, owned by John Moffat) and Robin Hood (another favourite, owned by Etienne de Mestre) being among the 11 horses that were killed. Betting on the big race was paralysed. To the dismay and anger of the public, bookmakers, showing no feeling, presented a purse (loaded with coins) to the captain as token of their appreciation for his part in saving them many thousands of pounds in bets already laid on the favourites who had perished. Perhaps they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> their money, however. The outsider Briseis comfortably won by 1 length in the biggest field of all time, and in an extremely good time, so {{it is unlikely that the}} horses who perished could have beaten her.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Rolling Stone placed [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] {{at number}} 90 on {{its list of}} [...] "The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs". On a similar list {{compiled}} by Mojo in 2006, the song appeared at number 27. In his commentary for the magazine, Brian Wilson described it as his [...] "all time favourite Beatles track", saying that while the Beatles were [...] "genius songwriters", this song was distinguished by a [...] "heart-and-soul melody". Wilson concluded: [...] "When they broke up I was heartbroken. I think they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> going." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Richardson {{writing for}} Orange U.K. said she [...] "loves a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight. She also branded Kylie a [...] "low-life". Tony Stewart of the Daily Mirror said that Kylie {{was right to}} taunt Tina as a loser. Though when Tina {{attacked}} her, he quipped that she <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> [...] "her chav trap shut and not wind up the fiery girl". Hill also praised the fight, adding that it looked dramatic and was [...] "one hell of a catfight". Stewart's Daily Mirror colleague Jim Shelley bemoaned Kylie's return because it [...] "absolutely ruined" [...] Becky's feud with Tracy.|$|E
500|$|Gardner {{was taken}} to the University of Utah Health Services Center where he was listed in serious condition, but recovered. Burdell died about 45 minutes later while in surgery at Holy Cross Hospital. Kirk survived surgery and was listed in {{critical}} condition at LDS Hospital. During a search of the courthouse, a bag of men's clothing was found in the basement under a women's restroom sink. Prosecutor Bob Stott believed Gardner's gun had been taped to a water fountain on the first floor. Darcy Perry McCoy was found unarmed and was arrested about a mile away. Her sister, Carma Jolley Hainsworth, was sentenced to eight years in prison for delivering the clothes and messages in preparation for the escape attempt, but the identity of the person who provided Gardner with the firearm was not known at the time. State corrections director William Vickrey cleared the actions of the prison guards who escorted Gardner, but Salt Lake County Sheriff N.D. [...] "Pete" [...] Hayward said that the guard who shot Gardner <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> shooting until Gardner was dead. A review found that the guards were inhibited from shooting because Gardner had been using a hostage as a human shield. Sheriff Hayward said the escape attempt [...] "appeared to be well-planned" [...] and blamed the security breach on the layout of the Metropolitan Hall of Justice, which allowed unrestricted access to areas where prisoners were transported.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur John William McIntyre (14 May 1918 [...] 26 December 2009) was an English cricketer. [...] A wicket-keeper, {{he was an}} {{integral}} part of the Surrey side that won the County Championship in every season from 1952 to 1958 inclusive, and played in three Tests for the English cricket team, two in 1950 and one in 1955. According to McIntyre's obituary in the Daily Telegraph, Peter May wrote: [...] "Godfrey Evans could touch great heights of wicketkeeping but day in, day out, Arthur was the most reliable wicketkeeper of the 1950s... He <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> many times for England." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{writing was}} not {{considered}} to be an acceptable role for women at the time, Bradstreet was met with criticism. One of the most prominent figures of her time, John Winthrop, criticized Ann Hopkins, wife of prominent Connecticut colony governor Edward Hopkins. He mentioned in his journal that Hopkins <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> to being a housewife and left writing and reading for men, [...] "whose minds are stronger." [...] Despite heavy criticism of women during her time, Bradstreet continued to write which led to the belief that she was interested in rebelling against societal norms of the time.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon, {{this is how}} the {{exchange}} went: Moses asked Aaron why he had not eaten, suggesting the possibilities that the blood had entered the innermost sanctuary or passed outside the courtyard or been defiled by being offered by his sons, and Aaron said that it had not. Moses then asked whether perhaps Aaron had been negligent through his grief and allowed the sacrifice to become defiled, but Aaron exclaimed with [...] that these events and even more could have befallen him, but Aaron would not show such disrespect to sacrifices. Thereupon Moses exclaimed that Aaron should certainly have eaten it, as Moses had commanded in [...] Aaron argued from analogy to the tithe (as in Rabbi Nehemiah's version), and Moses accepted Aaron's argument. But Moses argued that the priests <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the sacrificial meat and eaten it in the evening. And to that Aaron replied that the meat had accidentally become defiled after the sacrifice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of doing a story about Valkyrie. As we go into the next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E
2500|$|The third quatrain {{begins with}} the turn in line nine, [...] "Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear," [...] with [...] "seat" [...] {{referring}} to designated area for sexual activity. [...] Here in the sonnet, after many attempts to invent excuses for the youth, he is finally honest about his hurt and can no longer deceive himself. [...] Shakespeare alludes to another of his works here, with the word [...] "seat" [...] used with the same meaning by the character Iago in Othello, [...] "I do suspect the lustful Moor / Hath leap'd into my seat" [...] (Othello, 2.1.290-1). [...] Atkins suggests that line 10 is a statement that the youth should forbear even though his beauty and straying youth will lead him [...] "in their riot even there." [...] The [...] "Who" [...] in line eleven marks the same culprit as in line three, Alexander remarks, [...] "young blood whom the beloved <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> under control. Instead he allows them to lead him astray and take him on a rampage into his own home, 'even there' into his estate, his 'seat', breaking two things precious to him, 'a twofold truth,'" [...] with the twofold truth consisting of the mistress's truth, her contract of love with the speaker, and the youth's truth, his contract of love with the speaker, both of which the youth's beauty has led him to break.|$|E
2500|$|Sheppard {{was willing}} to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia in 1962-63. His many friends at Lord's wanted him to captain the Fourth and Fifth Tests against Pakistan in 1962, but Sheppard had not played serious cricket for years. He made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Ted Dexter was {{confirmed}} as captain {{for the remainder of the}} home series and the forthcoming tour of Australia. Sheppard agreed to tour and [...] "the presence in the pulpit of David Sheppard...filled the Anglican cathedral of every state capital from Perth to Brisbane" [...] Sheppard made 0 and 113 in the victorious Second Test at Melbourne, but dropped two catches and was dropped himself when he was on a pair in the second innings. He ran out his captain Ted Dexter, took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry so that Ken Barrington had to come out to see Colin Cowdrey make the winning single. Although he held some good catches on the tour [...] "the ones I dropped were at such vital moments", Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry in the Second Test and Neil Harvey in the Fourth Test off Trueman, who told him [...] "The only time your hands are together are on Sunday". This is a story that increased with the telling, another version being [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and keep your hands together", or that it was Sheppard who said [...] "Sorry Fred, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> my hands together". One couple in Australia asked Mrs Sheppard if the Reverend could christen their baby, but she advised them not to as he was bound to drop it.|$|E
