500|$|Sheffield's {{traditional}} manufacturing industries (along {{with those of}} many other areas in the UK), declined during the 20th century. [...] In the 1980s, it was the setting for two films written by locally-born Barry Hines: Looks and <b>Smiles,</b> <b>a</b> 1981 film that portrayed the depression {{that the city was}} enduring, and Threads, a 1984 television film that simulated a nuclear winter in Sheffield after a warhead is dropped to the east of the city.|$|E

Julie drives up {{to spend some time}} with him, but leaves still confused about her future. Tim is up for parole, and with the help of Coach Taylor and Buddy Garrity, is approved for early release. Buddy gives him a job as a bartender at his bar. Tim is angry with his brother Billy and threatens to move to Alaska to work on a pipeline but Tyra Collette comes back for a visit to Dillon and tells him he needs to repair his relationship with Billy. After they spend the night together, she asks Tim to show her his land, and the episode closes with Tyra asking, [...] "Alaska, Tim?" [...] to which Tim <b>smiles</b> <b>a</b> guilty smile.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He <b>smiles</b> <b>a</b> smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{study done}} by Albright et al. (1997) groups of college {{students}} from China and the United States rated strangers from both countries on the [...] "Big Five" [...] personality traits, external traits, and how well they were dressed. They found that both Chinese and U.S. students rated faces as showing similar levels of agreeableness and extroversion. The people who {{were thought to be}} the most agreeable wore <b>smiles,</b> <b>a</b> facial expression that is recognized around the world. The findings of the research seem to suggest that the trait of agreeableness is attributed to people in a universal way.|$|E

2500|$|Wolff had {{business}} interests outside Harland and Wolff, including the Belfast Ropeworks, which he {{founded in the}} early 1870s with W.H. Smiles, who {{was the son of}} Samuel <b>Smiles,</b> <b>a</b> Scottish author. With Wolff as chairman, the firm became one of the largest ropeworks in the world, challenging the Gourock Ropework Company, who were based on the River Clyde in Scotland. Wolff also bought shares in the Union Steamship Company, and became a director; with his influence, he ensured Harland and Wolff received regular orders from the Union Steamship Company. After Wolff's negotiation, the Union Steamship Company merged in 1900 with the Castle Line, which was owned by Donald Currie; the new company formed was the Union-Castle Line. Outside business, Gustav Wolff served as a Belfast harbour commissioner from 1887 to 1893. Wolff, like Edward Harland, served as a Member of Parliament {{as a member of the}} Conservative and Unionist Party. Edward Harland and Gustav Wolff were known in the House of Commons as [...] "Majestic" [...] and [...] "Teutonic", the names of two ships that the company built. Wolff was the Member of Parliament for Belfast East from March 1892 to December 1910. He replaced Edward de Cobain who had been expelled from the House of Commons and was later jailed for homosexual offences. Wolff only faced election once; in the 1892 by-election Sir William Charley, Q.C., stood against Wolff as an Independent Conservative. Wolff defeated Charley by a margin of over 2100 votes. Wolff was then returned unopposed until his retirement from parliament in 1910. Afterwards, Wolff was made a freeman of Belfast by the Belfast Corporation. In Parliament, Wolff strongly opposed the Irish Home Rule bills. Wolff was a member of the Church of Ireland. He also gave money to local causes, including the Ulster Hospital and the Orange Order. Wolff was a member of many different clubs, including the Carlton Club and the Garrick Club. After his retirement from parliament, Wolff lived almost exclusively in London, where he died on 17 April 1913 at his home, 42 Park Street. Wolff did not marry and died a bachelor.|$|E

It would not have surprised Miss Garth if she had discovered her pupil in the act of making terms with the manager for her forthcoming appearance in a public theater. As events really turned out, she found Magdalen on the stage, receiving, with gracious <b>smiles,</b> <b>a</b> card which the manager presented to her with a professional bow. Noticing Miss Garth's mute look of inquiry, the civil little man hastened to explain that the card was his own, and that he was merely asking the favor of Miss Vanstone's recommendation at any future opportunity.|$|E

Library services need a good interaction between users and librarians, one of these interactions through non verbal communication is smiling. This research was conducted as librarians found it difficult to smile for some reasons. Smile is done only at certaintimes. <b>A</b> <b>smiling</b> librarian will make other librarians and library users respond with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> too, so there will be a positive interaction, with a conducive atmosphere. But there are various kinds of smile; cynical smile, the seductive smile, stoic smile and sincere <b>smile.</b> <b>A</b> sincere <b>smile</b> is hard to do, therefore it requires a method or trainingfor someone to get accustomed to <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> First, look in the mirror.
