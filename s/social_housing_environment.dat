It is critical to the achievement of social housing’s objective. This project on rental systems in Australia and overseas seeks to address four research questions: To what degree has an increasingly complex and dynamic <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> <b>environment</b> changed the nature of how we think about the best methods of setting social housing rents?; What are the practices of social housing rent-setting in other countries and are any of the ideas relevant to Australia?; What is the current state of rent-setting practice in Australia for both the public and community housing sectors and what initiatives or pilots of reform, e. g. local variations to allow for different housing markets, are being discussed or implemented?; IIf there are different, but potentially appropriate, rent-setting practices, can they be modelled to ascertain the effects for social housing agencies and clients, e. g. the different implications for workforce incentives and disincentives, affordability, equity, efficiency and financial viability?

40|$|Social housing models, {{which had}} {{began to develop}} during the last century, for their only {{objective}} had a need to overcome the housing problems of socially vulnerable categories. However, numerous {{studies have shown that}} these social categories, because of their low social status, are highly susceptible to various psychological and sociological problems. On the other hand a low level of quality, which was common for social housing dwellings, has further aggravated these problems by initiating trouble behaviours among tenants, affecting social exclusion and segregation. Contemporary social housing models are therefore conceptualized in a way to provide a positive psycho-sociological impact on their tenants. Therefore the planning approach in social housing should be such to: support important functions in daily life routines; promote tolerance and cooperation; influence on a sense of social order and belonging; affect the socialization of the tenant and their integration into the wider community; and improve social cohesion. Analysis of the influential location parameters of immediate and wider <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> <b>environment</b> strive to define the ones relevant to the life quality of social housing tenants and therefore influence on the sustainability of social housing model...|$|E
40|$|In most {{vertebrate}} species, {{the production}} of vasotocin (VT; non-mammals) and vasopressin (VP; mammals) in the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTm) waxes and wanes with seasonal reproductive state; however, opportunistically breeding species might need to maintain high levels of this behaviorally relevant neuropeptide year-round in anticipation of unpredictable breeding opportunities. We here provide support for this hypothesis and demonstrate that these neurons are instead regulated ‘cryptically’ via hormonal regulation of their activity levels, which may be rapidly modified to adjust VT signaling. First, we show that combined treatment {{of male and female}} zebra finches (Estrildidae: Taeniopygia guttata) with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide and the aromatase inhibitor 1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione does not alter the expression of VT immunoreactivity within the BSTm; however, both hormonal treatment and <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> <b>environment</b> (same-sex versus mixed-sex) alter VT colocalization with the immediate early gene product Fos (a proxy marker of neural activation) in the BSTm. In a second experiment, manipulations of estradiol (E 2) levels with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (LET) or subcutaneous E 2 implants failed to alter colocalization, suggesting that the colocalization effects in experiment 1 were solely androgenic. LET treatment also did not affect VT immunoreactivity in a manner reversible by E 2 treatment. Finally, comparisons of VT immunoreactivity in breeding and nonbreeding individuals of several estrildid species demonstrate that year-round stability of VT immunoreactivity is found only in highly opportunistic species, and is therefore not essential to the maintenance of long-term pair bonds, which are ubiquitous in the Estrildidae...|$|E

40|$|Everyone has {{the right}} to have access to {{adequate}} housing Section 26 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996). This is a basic right that is enshrined in the Constitution. As such, government is obliged to do everything within its means to realise this right. The inclusion of housing as a basic right in South Africa s Constitution makes it a priority issue in government affairs. Years of apartheid created great imbalances in terms of housing in South Africa. The black population was not allowed to own property. The labour immigration system broke family units apart as men ventured into the city in search of jobs and were accommodated in hostels for men. Here no provision for families was made. The democratic government of the day inherited the great responsibility of correcting these imbalances. Gauteng, with an estimated 11. 3 million people in 2011, has the biggest provincial population in the country. Despite the low fertility, the population of Gauteng grew the fastest during this period, growing at an annual average rate of 2. 9 % (Development Bank of Southern Africa, 2011). The Gauteng province has a very high population, and, because of this, {{it is not difficult to}} fathom why the government is unable to meet the housing demand in the province. The birth of informal settlements is a result of immigration into the urban areas by people who are mostly in search of better employment opportunities. Diepkloof and Mamelodi are great examples of places in the Gauteng province that have seen an influx of people into urban areas, as you find diverse groups of people in these two areas, which make it evident, that many of the residents have migrated into these places. This rise of informal settlements all over South Africa depicts the dire need for housing. The Social Housing Act, No 16 of 2008, (2008) is enacted to establish and promote a sustainable <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> <b>environment</b> and to define the functions of national, provincial and local governments with respect to social housing. Sustainability of housing is important for progress in the housing sector. Principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness should be employed to ensure that government resources are use appropriately in the endeavour to supply housing to all beneficiaries. The endowment of housing today should not compromise the ability of future generations to access proper housing.

Application of the flexible elements in the interior provides a variety of spatial interpretations of the residential unit that can be determined by an architect or by users, depending on the applied design concept. The degree of achieved spatial flexibility will depend on the degree of independence of moveable elements within the unchanging structure of the apartment. Appropriate selection and analysis of the certain number of projects and realizations in the field of flexible housing, points to the diversity of motives of flexible elements application and considers the impact of applied design approach on the interpretation of residential environment.

In this article, in particular, I focus on issues related with social educators’ and NGO practitioners’ professional training. The aim of the paper, in this perspective, is to offer some introductory theoretical and methodological remarks for the training of NGO practitioners working in SHe. The basis for this reflection is the idea of informal learning (Schugurensky, 2000), the concepts of learning for reflexive citizenship and learning for active citizenship (Johnston, 2005) and anthropology of citizenship (Ong, 1999, 2003). In the research process, we have intersected instruments and methodologies coming from the different fields of anthropology and educational sciences. Our hypothesis consists in considering the possibility that exploring the professional field of social educators in SHe with an ethnographic approach could contribute to improve reflexive attitudes of social educators and shape their educational attitudes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Agonistic and nonagonistic {{behaviors}} were compared for pullets of two White Leghorn strains. One strain {{had been selected}} for part-year egg production; {{the other was the}} unselected control from which the selected strain was derived. There were two experiments in which the strains were kept separately and intermingled in laying-house floor pens. The selected strain had social dominance over the control at 5 months (before sexual maturity), but that domi-nance had diminished or disappeared when strangers of the two strains were placed together at 17 months. Nevertheless, because of social inertia, selected strain pullets maintained undiminished dominance over control pullets for the entire laying year when they were kept together from housing time onward. Selected strain females had more aggressive acts, more feeding activity, and spent less time resting than control females in both separated- and intermingled-strain <b>housing</b> <b>environments.</b> When pullets of the two strains were kept together, the relative frequencies of their agonistic {{behaviors were}} changed, but nonagonistic activities were not altered. Pullets had increased frequencies of pecking and fighting, but not of chases and threats, when they were hungry and feeding.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the XXXIII IAHS World Congress on Housing, 27 - 30 September 2005,"Transforming <b>Housing</b> <b>Environments</b> through Design", University of Pretoria. Given the variety of ways to define <b>social</b> <b>housing,</b> agreement on one single clear-cut definition is difficult. However, there is consensus that housing policies should take into account those households that cannot meet their housing needs unaided. Furthermore, <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> provision needs to be guided by certain criteria. Commonly, the housing provision involves many actors: public sector actors like national, provincial and local Governments; as well as private sector actors: developers, landowners, construction companies, building material companies, financial institutions, etc… Housing associations are key actors in fulfilling <b>social</b> <b>housing.</b> This study aims to define various schemes of action by housing associations in different countries worldwide. This identification can serve as an important instrument for developing appropriate policies for <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> and can also represent lessons for policy makers of the future. This paper discusses the housing associations in three different countries: the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Egypt. The Netherlands has been and still {{is one of the}} most dynamic and innovative countries in Europe with respect to <b>social</b> <b>housing.</b> In England, the housing association sector has assumed the central role in the delivery of new and restructured <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> over the past decade. In Egypt, the association housing system in Egypt is considered to be chaotic due to being characterized by corruption and profiteering. The methodology adopted in this research is based on reviewing the historical background of housing associations in the four selected countries, and key changes in housing associations sector structure will be highlighted as well. The paper will conclude by determining key items of success or failure of housing associations. Finally, the author develops a set of recommendations concerning the enhancement of the <b>social</b> <b>housing</b> association sector in Egypt.
