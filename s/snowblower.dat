50|$|Buzz, Stretch, and Ranger, a {{snow removal}} crew in Montreal, {{go out to}} clear the streets after a big snowstorm. The {{different}} tasks involved in this process are detailed by Blower, a <b>snowblower</b> machine, Bobcat, a Bobcat loader, and Big Dude, a snowplow.|$|E
50|$|The Snogo Snow Blower {{was used}} on the Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park, United States. Manufactured in 1932 by the Klauer Engineering Company of Dubuque, Iowa, the plow was {{actually}} a <b>snowblower</b> and featured advanced features such as an enclosed cab, four wheel drive and roll-up windows. It {{was used in the}} park until 1952.|$|E
50|$|Snow removal {{services}} may include driveway and parking area snow removal, walkway and deck handwork, and occasionally roof clearing. Contractors use hand shovels, walk behind <b>snowblowers</b> (or snow throwers), truck plows, skid-steers, light-weight tractors, and heavy front-end loaders. Many times, these machines will require use of tire chains {{to perform their}} tasks. Snow may be pushed by plowing methods or blown to {{an area of the}} property by <b>snowblowers.</b> Contracts may apply sand or salt in some locations to help melt ice accumulations.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} over 600 dealers for Honda {{motorcycle}} and power equipment products. These dealers sell motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, <b>snowblowers,</b> lawnmowers {{and other equipment}} in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Large-scale snow removal, {{including}} fleets of salt spreaders, snow plows, <b>snowblowers,</b> dedicated dump trucks, sidewalk plows, the dispatching and routing {{systems for}} these fleets, {{as well as}} fixed assets such as snow dumps, snow chutes, snow melters ...|$|R
5000|$|Building {{techniques}} have included using a front-end loader to fill wooden formwork to create walls and roof structures. In recent years, snow {{has been placed}} into the formwork using a tractor- or bobcat-mounted <b>snowblower.</b> Although the snow is blown {{high into the air}} in this process, the crew refers to filling the formwork this way as [...] "pouring" [...] snow, since the overall process is conceptually similar to that of pouring concrete.|$|E
5000|$|Burton quickly becomes disillusioned {{by the way}} {{the process}} works in an {{atmosphere}} of corruption and inefficiency. He delves into the mountains of paper documenting the Bradley's history and comes to the conclusion that it is [...] "a troop transport that can't carry troops, a reconnaissance vehicle that's too conspicuous to do reconnaissance, and a quasi-tank that has less armor than a <b>snowblower,</b> but has enough ammo to take out half of D.C." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album art for Crisis {{features}} {{aftermath of}} the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977 that hit the Niagara Region and Western New York. The main cover features the famous picture of a frostbitten man, a <b>snowblower</b> clearing the large accumulation of snow, and bare trees during the blizzard. Additional pictures of the event are included inside the album's booklet. The lyrics from the song [...] "Crisis" [...] are based on this event.|$|E
50|$|Gilson Brothers Co. was a Wisconsin-based {{manufacturer}} of {{outdoor power equipment}} and recreational equipment. It operated independently between its inception in 1911 and its acquisition by Lawn-Boy in 1988. The company was probably most well known for its <b>snowblowers</b> and lawn tractors produced from the 1960s through the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment <b>snowblowers</b> and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, <b>snowblowers,</b> blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R
5000|$|Takasu is {{also home}} to one of Honda's [...] "Proving Grounds". Honda tests new {{products}} to see how they stand up to the harsh winter conditions found in central Hokkaido. The other Honda development facility is found in Tochigi Prefecture. Honda not only test cars at the Takasu Proving Grounds, but bikes and <b>snowblowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A running joke is the {{repeated}} theft of Carl's <b>snowblower.</b> Sully steals {{it to get}} back at Carl for his latest failed lawsuit. Carl steals it back, placing it in the yard at his construction business guarded by his doberman pinscher guard dog. Sully, after drugging the dog, steals it a second time. Carl takes it back a final time, and leaves the dog, who is now skittish due to his drugging, at Sully's childhood home for him to find.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, several dozen {{individuals}} and small businesses located mostly in southern Ontario experimented with <b>snowblower</b> innovation. One of these, Samuel McLaughlin of Oshawa, eventually {{became the basis for}} General Motors of Canada. S. L. C. Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick invented the sway bar, a device to improve the suspension of automobiles, in 1919. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney. In Montreal Alexis Nihon invented the tubeless tire.|$|E
5000|$|To {{clear the}} line of snow, the MBTA {{maintains}} a jet engine powered <b>snowblower,</b> officially the Portec RMC Hurricane Jet Snow Blower, model RP-3, dubbed [...] "Snowzilla" [...] by MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo. Snowzilla weighs 26,000 pounds, measures 8 by 12 by 27 feet, and {{is powered by a}} Westinghouse J34 turbojet engine. It uses approximately 500 gallons of jet fuel per line clearing run. Other T lines simply run regular trains to clear the tracks of snow, but the older cars on this line would short out if used for that purpose.|$|E
50|$|Earlier models had {{attachments}} such as rototillers and flail mowers. Later attachment {{options include}} <b>snowblowers,</b> snow blades, and a sprayer.gravely in the '70s had 38 attachments, but through innovations of various companies the list expands to over 80. Sulkies and steering sulkies {{are available for}} walk-behind tractors, {{as well as an}} optional solid platform with space for carrying small amounts of cargo (trailers).|$|R
5000|$|Buhler Industries Inc. (...) was {{established}} in 1969 when John Buhler purchased [...] "Standard Gas Engine Works", {{which was founded in}} 1932. The company produced the Farm King line of grain augers, <b>snowblowers,</b> mowers and compact implements. Buhler Industries expanded in 1982 with the purchase of the Allied line of front-end loaders and the company began trading on the TSE in 1994, at which time all products were marketed under the [...] "Buhler" [...] brand name.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, {{the company}} {{designed}} and built Rail King railcar mover, awarded contract to build $1.2 billion of 2.5 & 5-ton trucks for U.S. Army, purchased Foley Valves - oil field equipment supplier, acquired PAMCO - Waukesha gas compression & generating equipment, signed agreement with European Gas Turbines Ltd., packager of mid-range units. Marketed large self-propelled <b>snowblowers</b> for use at airports and on roadways, competed for the U.S. Marine/Army Medium Tactical Truck Replacement (MTTR) Program, and began production in September of second multi-year contract for the next FMTV increment of 10,000 vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|When a UniTrol <b>snowblower</b> is running, {{the engine}} is always turning a drive platter. The act of {{engaging}} a gear presses a rubber-edged wheel against the flat steel surface of the spinning platter, which transfers power through 90 degrees to the drive axle and at a ratio inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} center of the platter at which the wheel is engaged. A neutral [...] "gear" [...] is available by simply lifting the wheel from the surface of the platter, and a reverse gear is available by engaging the wheel at a symmetric point across the center of the platter.|$|E
5000|$|During February to April 2005, DaimlerChrysler {{hosted a}} [...] "What Can You HEMI?" [...] contest {{promoting}} alternative {{uses of the}} HEMI engines. The top five finalists include HEMI <b>Snowblower,</b> HEMI-Go-Round carousel, HEMI on Ice ice resurfacer, HEMI-Shredder, HEMI Big Wheel, i.e. the child's tricycle of the 1970s. The winner was the HEMI Big Wheel, which had a 5.7 L HEMI in the back that was installed backwards, thus reverse became the only forward gear. Plate steel was the predominant material, while a rolled tube of steel had to be utilized for the front tire as there were no such tires 4 ft in diameter that were as narrow as needed for this project.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission {{estimates}} that each year {{there are approximately}} 5,740 <b>snowblower</b> related injuries in the United States which require medical attention. One problem with {{the design of the}} snow blower is that snow can build up in the auger, jamming it and stalling the motor. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} the auger could deform before applying enough resistance to the motor to turn it off. If the jam is cleared by hand, it is possible for the auger to return to its natural shape suddenly and with great force, possibly injuring the user; snow blowers are a leading cause of traumatic hand and finger amputations. The correct procedure is to turn off the engine, disengage the clutch and then clear the jam with a broom handle or other long object. In an effort to improve safety, many manufacturers now include a plastic tool to be used to clear jams, often mounted directly to the snow blower.|$|E
40|$|Safe {{tips for}} snow removal using snow shovels, <b>snowblowers</b> and powered blades or {{sweepers}} {{are covered in}} this NebGuide. As the temperature drops and the grounds maintenance equipment is stored for the winter, position the snow removal equipment for quick access, and start thinking about snow removal safety. About half the accidents involving snow removal equipment happen to first-time users or those using the equipment {{for the first time}} each winter. Snow removal equipment falls in one of three groups: 1) the snow shovel, 2) the snow thrower or blower, and 3) the powered blade or sweeper...|$|R
50|$|These {{switches}} {{are usually}} {{used as a}} form of fail-safe where they stop a machine with no operator from potentially dangerous action or incapacitate a device as a result of accident, malfunction, or misuse. They are common in such applications in locomotives, aircraft refuelling, freight elevators, lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard motors, chainsaws, <b>snowblowers,</b> tread machines, snowmobiles, amusement rides, and many medical imaging devices. On some machines, these switches merely bring the machines back to a safe state, such as reducing the throttle to idle or applying brakes while leaving the machines still running and ready to resume normal operation once control is reestablished.|$|R
50|$|Various other {{applications}} of the screw or auger conveyor include its use in <b>snowblowers,</b> to move snow towards an impeller, where it is thrown into the discharge chute. Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. Ice resurfacers use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some rubbish compactors to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|R
50|$|In Connecticut an 81-year-old woman using a <b>snowblower</b> {{was hit by}} a car in Prospect, a man in Bridgeport {{was found}} dead under snow at his home, a man died after he {{suffered}} a heart attack while plowing snow in New Milford, a man from Shelton died while digging his truck out of the snow, and police in Danbury said a man was found dead on his back porch on February 9. In Maine, a 75-year-old man crashed his vehicle into a tree in Passadumkeag, then his pickup ended up in the Penobscot River. In Boston, Massachusetts, a 13-year-old boy and a man died separately due to carbon monoxide poisoning while inside cars because the tailpipes were blocked by snow. A man was killed in an automobile accident in Auburn, New Hampshire when his car spun out on a hill and collided with a tree, flattening the front end of his SUV and crushing him.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Dana {{is taken}} to {{the leader of the}} Jokerz, Carter Wilson, aka Terminal. Terminal's {{ultimate}} plan is to resurrect the Joker, who died during a showdown with Batman in the winter after he was left in a bulldozer that was caught in the <b>snowblower</b> of an oncoming train by the Dark Knight. Terry proves his worth to Carter by having Max and Matt fly the Batmobile near the Jokerz hideout, where he would seemingly destroy it and gain Terminal's trust. Dana recognizes Terry's voice and gets a couple of chances to catch up with him when the other Jokerz aren't looking. However, when she shows Carter's plan to Terry, the Jokerz spot them and Carter reveals he knew that Trey was Terry all along (as they went to high school together). The Jokerz knock out Terry and tie him and Dana upside down above a vat of acid. Matt tries to get Terry's backpack to him to aid them. Terry manages to escape using one of his batarangs and gets Dana to the roof, where Matt gives him an upgraded Batsuit that allows him to easily take down the Jokerz. Dana is shocked that Terry is Batman and has been lying to her for a number of years. Terminal escapes with the Joker's body before Batman can find him. However, Carter's plan to resurrect the Joker is revealed to be a ruse. The comatose body he has in his possession is actually a disguised and drugged Bruce Wayne, who's bank account he's using to fund his future crimes. Terry discovers Bruce is alive through the fingerprints Carter used to get to Wayne Enterprises.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{introduce}} the <b>snowblower</b> problem (SBP), a new optimization {{problem that is}} closely related to milling problems and to some material-handling problems. The objective in the SBP is to compute a short tour for the <b>snowblower</b> to follow to remove all the snow from a domain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.). When a <b>snowblower</b> ¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡ abstract. tex passes over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region. The constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the <b>snowblower</b> cannot clear the pile. We give an algorithmic study of the SBP. We show that in general, the problem is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for removing snow under various assumptions about the operation of the <b>snowblower.</b> Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user to control the direction in which the snow is thrown. We differentiate between the cases in which the snow can be thrown in any direction, in any direction except backwards, and only to the right. For all cases, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms; the constants increase as the throw direction becomes more restricted...|$|E
5000|$|Elec-trak branded {{attachments}} included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, rotary brooms, roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, {{row crop}} cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted rotary mowers, front or rear-mounted ganged reel mowers, lawn sweepers, electric rakes, <b>snowblowers,</b> snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more. [...] Most of these attachments were {{connected by a}} 36VDC [...] "power take off" [...] using a NEMA 10-50 outlet, usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords {{in most of the}} USA.|$|R
5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment keyway {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot keyway in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a circular Woodruff cutter without any reliefs. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and keyway also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, <b>snowblowers</b> and marine propellers.|$|R
50|$|A similar system, {{usually called}} a dead man's switch (for other names, see {{alternative}} names), {{as its name}} suggests, is a device intended to stop a machine (or activate one) if the human operator becomes incapacitated, and {{is a form of}} fail-safe. They are commonly used in industrial applications (e.g., locomotives, tower cranes, freight elevators) and consumer applications (e.g., lawn mowers, tractors, jet skis, outboard motors, <b>snowblowers,</b> motorcycles and snowmobiles). The switch in these cases is held by the user, and turns off the machine if they let go. Some riding lawnmowers have a kill switch in the seat which stops the engine and blade if the operator's weight is no longer on the seat.|$|R
