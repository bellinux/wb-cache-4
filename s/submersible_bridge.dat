50|$|A {{low-water}} {{bridge is}} sometimes called a <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{but this is a}} misnomer. A true <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge</b> is used on navigable waterways and is actively lowered into the water.|$|E

50|$|The <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge's</b> primary {{advantage}} over the similar lift bridge {{is that there is}} no structure above the shipping channel and thus no height limitation on ship traffic. This is particularly important for sailing vessels. Additionally, the lack of an above-deck structure is considered aesthetically pleasing, a similarity shared with the Chicago-style bascule bridge and the table bridge. However, the presence of the submerged bridge structure limits the draft of vessels in the waterway.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the Isthmus is the Gulf of Corinth, to the east the Saronic Gulf. Since 1893 the Corinth Canal has run through the 6.3 km wide isthmus, {{effectively}} making the Peloponnese an island. Today, two road bridges, two railway <b>bridges</b> and two <b>submersible</b> <b>bridges</b> {{at both ends of the}} canal connect the mainland side of the isthmus with the Peloponnese side. Also a military emergency bridge is located at the west end of the canal.|$|R
50|$|The canal {{consists}} of a single channel 8 m deep, excavated at sea level (thus requiring no locks), measuring 6343 m long by 24.6 m wide {{at the top and}} 21.3 m wide at the bottom. The rock walls, which rise 90 m above sea level, are at a near-vertical 80Â° angle. The canal is crossed by a railway line, a road and a motorway at a height of about 45 m. In 1988 <b>submersible</b> <b>bridges</b> were installed at sea level {{at each end of the}} canal, by the eastern harbour of Isthmia and the western harbour of Poseidonia.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge</b> is also {{sometimes}} {{applied to a}} non-movable bridge {{that is designed to}} withstand submersion and high currents when the water level rises. Such a bridge is more properly called a low water bridge.|$|E
50|$|As an early, {{experimental}} <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge,</b> the Gairloch Bridge {{is important}} in demonstrating the evolution of bridge design in Queensland and exemplifies how the colonial authorities responsible for bridge building responded to the extreme conditions of the north Queensland wet season. Submersible bridges evolved as a cost-effective {{solution to the problem}} of bridging rivers that were seasonally subject to extreme flooding, and remain common in Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The railway line itself, {{with its}} use of low level <b>submersible</b> track and <b>bridges</b> and Phillips {{patented}} steel sleepers, was an important technical innovation designed for Queensland conditions which has lasted in use with {{a low level of}} maintenance for over a hundred years, proving its viability in these conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of Rural Transport Infrastructure (RTI) {{in developing countries}} carries traffic of less than 50 motorized four-wheeled vehicles per day (VPD), but often {{a substantial number of}} intermediate means of transport, such as bicycles and animal-drawn carts. In most cases, the appropriate standard for these are single-lane, spot-improved earth or gravel roads provided with low-cost drainage structures, such as fords and <b>submersible</b> single-lane <b>bridges.</b> The (trouble) spot improvement approach {{is the key to the}} least-cost design. Cost savings of 50 to 90 % can be achieved compared with fully engineered roads of equal standard throughout. Labor-based approaches are best-suited for the implementation of RTI interventions. By transferring financial resources and skills to the local level, labor-based strategies can have a substantial poverty- reducing impact. They also have the potential to improve the gender distribution of income, providing employment opportunities for women where wage-employment is scarce. Key issues! An emphasis on reliable, cost-effective access to as many of the rural population as possible, rather than high access standards for a few;! Appropriate design standards need to balance the transport requirements of core economic and social activities with the impact of geography (geology, topography and climate) on construction and maintenance costs;! Cost-effective and innovative techniques such as spot improvement, labor-based approaches, and low-cost structures, and;! RTI projects implementation using labor-based approaches, with strong local community involvement, contribute to poverty alleviation...|$|R
50|$|A <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is a type}} of {{movable bridge}} that lowers the bridge deck below the water level to permit {{waterborne}} traffic to use the waterway. This differs from a lift bridge or table bridge, which operate by raising the roadway. Two submersible bridges exist across the Corinth Canal, one at each end, in Isthmia and Corinth. They lower the centre span to 8 metres below water level when they give way to ships crossing the channel.|$|E
50|$|The Gairloch Bridge is a <b>submersible</b> <b>bridge</b> {{designed}} to withstand inundation during major floods. It {{is the first}} submersible road bridge {{known to have been}} designed by Brady who is recognised for his important contributions to the development of this type of bridge. The shorter, submersible bridges were a cost-effective alternative to designing longer bridges above major flood levels, which often inundated a considerable area either side of the river. The principal difficulty of submersible bridges was that debris accumulated against the bridge during floods and this, in combination with the force exerted by the water, could cause major damage. Brady developed designs to avoid trapping debris and to present the least possible obstruction to the flow of flood waters. To date, it remains common practice to design less important bridges to withstand flood submergence.|$|E
