In controlling either a <b>three-phase</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>motor</b> or a <b>three-phase</b> induction <b>motor</b> it is desirable to create three perfectly sinusoidal current waveforms in the motor windings, with relative phase displacements of 120 °. The production of sinewave power via a linear amplifier system would have low efficiency, at best 64 %. If instead of the linear circuitry, fast electronic switching devices are used, and then the efficiency can be greater than 95 %, depending on the characteristics of the semiconductor power switching...|$|R
