40|$|It {{was aimed}} to {{evaluate}} the spectrum and uniformity of droplets in function of sprayers, spraying volumes and rates of chemical insecticide on the mortality of Pseudoplusia includens in laboratory. The work was carried out at UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil. The following treatments were applied over the caterpillars: two equipments (atomizer <b>and</b> <b>hydraulic</b> nozzle); two <b>spray</b> volumes (17 and 50 L ha(- 1) for the atomizer and 50 and 100 L ha(- 1) for the <b>hydraulic</b> nozzle); <b>and</b> two dosages of the insecticide endosulfan (0. 5 and 1. 0 L pc ha(- 1)), in fully randomized plots, in a factorial scheme 2 x 2 x 2 and 1 untreated check. The caterpillars mortality was evaluated until the 6 (th) day after the application of treatments. The spectrum of the droplets was evaluated in a particle size analyzer in real time determining the diameter and spectrum of droplets sprayed through the laser beam of the analyser. It was verified that the spray volume can be reduced by 17 L ha(- 1) without losses on the P. includens control. The doses of 0. 5 L pc ha(- 1) (recommended for Anticarsia gemmatalis) did not satisfactorily control the caterpillar soybean looper. The atomizer produces droplets of higher uniformity (SPAN: 0. 52) and lower percentage of droplets susceptible to drift (3. 3 %) compared to hydraulic nozzle (SPAN: 1. 34 e % droplets <= 100 mu m: 15. 2) ...|$|R

The bellmouth <b>and</b> <b>swirl</b> inlet types were mostly investigated for diabatic cases only with swirl inlet tests limited to the 1. 05 mm channel. Laminar friction factors were approximately {{similar to those of the}} sudden contraction inlet type, however, after the commencement of transition both inlet types exhibited higher friction factors than the sudden contraction inlet. Minor transition occurred as early as at Reynolds numbers of 1200 and 800 for the bellmouth <b>and</b> <b>swirl</b> inlet types respectively while major transition occurred at Reynolds numbers of approximately 1800 and 1500 respectively. Critical Reynolds numbers were found not be significantly influenced by the channel diameter to length ratio considered in this study. Laminar Nusselt numbers were predicted well by conventional macro-channel thermal entry correlations. The swirl inlet type exhibited the highest friction factors and Nusselt numbers in the transitional regime followed by the bellmouth inlet type. During transition while compared with the sudden contraction inlet, both the bellmouth <b>and</b> <b>swirl</b> inlet types exhibited larger enhancement in heat transfer than increases in the friction factor penalty. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study, a set of correlations were developed which describes the relation between the friction factor and Colburn j-factor. Depending on the inlet type, the correlations predicted between 94 % and 100 % of the results to within 10 % of the experimental measurements. [URL]...|$|R
