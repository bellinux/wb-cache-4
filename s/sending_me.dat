"At one point, I asked Ellen Page {{before we}} started shooting, ‘hat do you think Juno listens to?’ And she said [...] She went on my computer, played the songs, and I {{fell in love with}} it. Diablo and I {{discussed}} putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches and she started <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> her work, which was beautiful, and that became a lot of the soundtrack." ...|$|E
500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, {{has given me a}} parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{established}} {{themselves as}} a group, Morrissey and Marr still harboured ambitions {{that they would be}} recognised as songwriters by having their songs covered by others. Their top choice was singer Sandie Shaw, who had scored several hits throughout the 1960s {{and was one of the}} most prominent British vocalists of her era. In the summer of 1983, Marr and Morrissey began asking Shaw to cover their song [...] "I Don't Owe You Anything", which they had conceived with her in mind to perform. The pair sent Shaw various letters coupled with song demos. Shaw was sceptical at first; she was discouraged by the negative media attention that accompanied the Smiths song [...] "Reel Around the Fountain", and when she received a copy of [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] in the mail, she reportedly exclaimed to her husband [...] "he's started <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> pictures of naked men with their bums showing!" ...|$|E

500|$|Bentley's {{early career}} was spent with several senior teams {{throughout}} Saskatchewan. [...] He first played {{in his hometown}} of Delisle for the Tigers hockey team in 1932–33 before playing a year in Saskatoon, then another in Regina before settling in Moose Jaw for three seasons beginning in 1935–36. He led the South-Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League in scoring in 1936–37 with 37 points and added another 14 in the playoffs, also leading the league. In 1937, Bentley, along with future Hall of Famer Elmer Lach attended the Toronto Maple Leafs training camp; both were rejected as too small for the National Hockey League. According to Lach, Conn Smythe, manager of the Leafs, saw Bentley and Lach and said “They were <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> big guys from the West, but instead they’ve sent me peanuts.” He moved to Alberta with brother Reg, and joined elder brothers Max, Wyatt and Roy with the Drumheller Miners of the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) for the 1938–39 season. [...] When not playing hockey, Doug helped run a gas station that the family purchased in Drumheller.|$|E
500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> such a generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E

2500|$|On November 11, 1961, Baez played {{her first}} major New York concert at a sold-out {{performance}} at Town Hall. [...] Robert Shelton, folk {{critic of the}} New York Times, praised the concert, saying, [...] "That superb soprano voice, as lustrous and rich as old gold, flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease. [...] Her singing (unwound) like a spool of satin." [...] (Stu Steadman (2017). [...] "This Day in Rock." [...] www.thisdayinrock.com) [...] Years later when Baez thought back to that concert, she laughed, saying: [...] "I remember in 1961 my manager <b>sending</b> <b>me</b> this newspaper (clipping) in the mail (which) read, 'Joan Baez Town Hall Concert, SRO.'

2500|$|Judging the Meteor F.3s {{were ready}} for combat over Europe, the RAF finally decided to deploy them on the continent. On 20 January 1945, four Meteors from 616 Squadron were moved to Melsbroek in Belgium and {{attached}} to the Second Tactical Air Force, just under {{three weeks after the}} Luftwaffe's surprise Unternehmen Bodenplatte attack on New Year's Day, in which Melsbroek's RAF base, designated as Allied Advanced Landing Ground [...] "B.58", had been struck by the piston-engined fighters of JG 27 and JG 54. The 616 Squadron Meteor F.3s' initial purpose was to provide air defence for the airfield, but their pilots hoped that their presence might provoke the Luftwaffe into <b>sending</b> <b>Me</b> 262s against them. At this point the Meteor pilots were still forbidden to fly over German-occupied territory, or to go east of Eindhoven, to prevent a downed aircraft being captured by the Germans or the Soviets.|$|E
