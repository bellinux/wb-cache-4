And when we wished to strike and take in the sails so as to land, they stole very quickly the small boat called a skiff which was fastened to the poop of the captain's ship. At which he, being very angry, went ashore with forty armed men. And burning some forty or fifty houses with several boats and killing seven men of the said island, they recovered their skiff.|$|E

He claimed to have {{engineered}} the pressure cooker bombs with his associates in a flat in central Mumbai. If verified, these allegations could invalidate the previous claims by the ATS that the ISI or the SIMI were involved. Sadiq states in his confession, ‘‘All five of us arranged local first class train passes beforehand. We also had the local train time table with us <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.’’ He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming {{the attacks on the}} Al-Qaeda.|$|E

[...] The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project. DeHavilland had read the novel, and unlike most other actresses, who wanted the Scarlett O'Hara role, she wanted to play Melanie Hamiltona character whose quiet dignity and inner strength she understood and felt she could bring to life on the screen.|$|E

[...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background.

Why not bring in Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers and let them address the issues?" [...] adding that [...] "It was designed so that we wouldn't have any of the originals there, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> pass on the baton to the next generation". Phillips said that the producers received 80 percent of the people they wanted as recording artists for the song. In addition to Jean, Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis, most famous for playing The Haitian on Heroes, appears in the chorus.|$|E

Iwata did the game's opening sequence and designed the map, overall layout, and bosses; and he oversaw all phases of the game's development. In a 2010 interview, Iwata said: [...] "we {{were trying to make}} the best action game to date, with all that entails. With SOPHIA (the game’s vehicle), we wanted to bring to life a sense of action that incorporated all 360° of the environment in a way that players hadn’t really experienced up to that point. Along with that, we wanted large, expansive maps <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> support that vision." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game {{is known}} for its early and {{elaborate}} use of deep focus cinematography. Renoir said he and his cinematographer Jean Bachelet [...] "ordered some special lenses, very fast lenses, but ones that still gave us considerable depth, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> keep our backgrounds in focus almost all the time." [...] This depth of field in his shots allowed Renoir to shoot in large rooms and long corridors in the chateau sequences, and characters were able to move freely between the background and the foreground. Approximately half of the shots in the film have camera movements. In many shots the camera moves, stops in place, changes direction and circles around the subjects. Film critic David Thomson said [...] "one has the impression of a camera that is always moving to cover as much as possible. One does not notice cuts, one delights in a continuity which is often on the verge of chaos and finally leads to tragedy in the intrusion of subplot into plot, of the theatrical into the real and of disaster into balances." ...|$|E
500|$|The props {{used in this}} film, {{including}} weapons like {{swords and}} shields, were auctioned by Movie Artist Association. Actors, technicians, {{and the general public}} were invited to bid and the proceeds were used to aid poor artists in the Telugu film industry. Actor Sivaji Raja started the bidding by offering 50,000 for the sword that Ram Charan used and comedian Venu Madhav started the bidding for the shield with 25,000. B. V. S. N. Prasad bid for both the sword and knife for 100,000. The bidding started on 7 May 2010 online in the association's official website and ended on 16 May. The winners were declared on 20 May 2010. After Magadheera, S. S. Rajamouli worked on a small budget film Maryada Ramanna (2010) which, according to Crazy Mohan, was similar to the act of S. S. Vasan directing the small budget film Mr. Sampat (1952) after Chandralekha (1948). Rajamouli explained his decision by saying, [...] "I decided that my next project would be Maryada Ramanna during the Magadheera shooting itself because it is a 1 and half year project that demands lot of physical labor and mental strain. I didn't want to commit another physically exhausting film immediately after Magadheera. Maryada Ramanna gave us time to recharge our batteries <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> come up with another huge project." [...] He revealed Maryada Ramannas plot before its launch to minimise the expectations of his audience after Magadheeras success.|$|E

500|$|Mahendra Kumar, one of {{the leaders}} of the Hindu militant youth organisation, denied that any Catholic churches were {{attacked}} by his group but reportedly accepted responsibility for the attacks on prayer halls belonging to the New Life Fellowship Trust. He stated that the Bajrang Dal were not against Christianity in the region, but were offended by the alleged forced conversions. Kumar had initially denied any involvement in the attacks before being arrested on 20 September. When asked again at a later date however if he had accepted responsibility for the attacks, he denied it. Kumar resigned from Bajrang Dal on 1 October 2008 after witnessing a Hindu woman who had decided to commit suicide with her three children but was saved by Christian missionaries. He stated [...] "That was the time I realised that life is more important than dharma (religion). A lot needs to be done for the betterment of life. My dream is to build a society that values life more than religion. In jail I read several literary works. I joined Bajrang Dal <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> mobilise the youth for a good cause, but at the end of the day all our concepts were politically motivated." [...] In February 2011, after the commission reports into the attacks were published, Kumar formally apologised to the public for the attacks and accused the BJP Government of corruption. On 21 February 2011 he joined the JDS, declaring, [...] "I am today shedding the shackles of communalism to strive for communal harmony, for which the JDS is working." [...] His successor Suryanarayana also denied any involvement in the attacks. Some pro-Hindu elements believed that the attacks were politically motivated by the main opposition parties in the state rather than being purely based upon religious indifference, especially the Milagres Church attack.|$|E

[...] Lavelle cited {{the example of a}} January 1972 observation of 55 to 60 tanks 11 miles north of the DMZ.

Chenik stated {{in an interview that}} any collaboration with France became impossible. Bourguiba saw in this case a victory that could rally the bourgeois class, considered to be collaborating with France, and unify the country around nationalism. He wrote: [...] "We need to focus our attention on the event that had happened, on the argument which had been offered, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> widen our movement to important social classes of the nation, once indifferent or hostile to our program".|$|E

He won the Gatornationals, Springnationals, and U.S. Nationals to win the 1977 Winston championship. His most famous race of the season was one he did not win. His chief rival was 1976 champion Larry Lombardo, who drove for Bill Jenkins. At that time, season championships were decided by a combination of regional and national events. Nicholson attended a divisional event Lombardo needed to win. [...] "We qualified low on purpose <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> race Larry early in eliminations," [...] said Nicholson.

Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who said you have to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. But who could tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> continue {{to listen to the}} magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we are going in to dine; do you want to eat with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table we found him still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E
