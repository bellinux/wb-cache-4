25|$|A {{standard}} DSO {{is limited}} to capturing signals with a bandwidth of {{less than half the}} sampling rate of the ADC (called the Nyquist limit). There is a variation of the DSO called the digital <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> that can exceed this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. A similar technique, with analog rather than digital samples, was used before the digital era in analog sampling oscilloscopes.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> {{can display}} signals of {{considerably}} higher frequency than the sampling rate if the signals are exactly, or nearly, repetitive. It does this by taking one sample from each successive {{repetition of the}} input waveform, each sample being at an increased time interval from the trigger event. The waveform is then displayed from these collected samples. This mechanism {{is referred to as}} [...] "equivalent-time sampling". Some oscilloscopes can operate in either this mode or in the more traditional [...] "real-time" [...] mode at the operator's choice.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} an algorithm {{for determining the}} fine phase response of equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> of a linear time-invariant response function from its magnitude. The Nose-to-Nose (NTN) calibration method can give the phase response of the equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes,</b> but the phase resolution can only achieve 250 MHz because the limit of the technology. In this study the fine phase response has been reconstructed. Although the truncation of the Kramers-Kronig transform using three basic functions may approximate gives rise to large errors in estimated phase, these errors may {{be approximated by using}} three basic functions. This result rests on data obtained by an NTN technique in combination with a swept-sine calibration procedure. The NTN technique yields magnitude and phase information over a broad bandwidth, yet has low frequency resolution. The swept-sine procedure returns only the magnitude of the oscilloscope response function, yet can be made at any frequency at which fundamental microwave power standards are available. As an example, we get the fine phase response of equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> Agilent 86100 C from dc to 40 GHz; its frequency resolution achieves 1 MHz. In the process of this analysis, we observe that the true oscilloscope response function as measured by the NTN calibration is indistinguishable from the reconstructed phase response over a very large bandwidth. At last we analyze the phase uncertainty of the phase response, and the uncertainty analysis process is provided. The results show that the algorithm can be used to get the fine phase response of the equivalent <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to find the}} individual impulse response of broadband <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> (HP 54124 T, 50 GHz bandwidth). The method {{is based on the}} fact that, when the <b>oscilloscope</b> is <b>sampling</b> a DC-voltage, pulses are launched from the sampler towards the input connector. These pulses contain information on the scope's characteristic and can be measured by a second oscilloscope. This type of measurement is called a "nose-to-nose" calibration. Applying deconvolution techniques to the result of this measurement the characteristic of the two scopes can be found, assuming that the two scopes are identical. To avoid relying on this assumption, three oscilloscopes can be used. The "nose-to-nose" is then applied three times, with a different pair of scopes connected together each time. The individual characteristics of the three <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> are then calculated.

50|$|A {{real-time}} oscilloscope, {{sometimes called}} a “single-shot” scope, captures an entire waveform on each trigger event. This requires the scope {{to capture a}} large number of data points in one continuous record. A sequential equivalent-time <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope,</b> sometimes simply called a “sampling scope,” measures the input signal only once per trigger. The next time the scope is triggered, a small delay is added and another sample is taken. Thus {{a large number of}} trigger events must occur in order to collect enough samples to build a picture of the waveform. The measurement bandwidth is determined by the frequency response of the sampler which currently can extend beyond 90 GHz.|$|E

The phase-distortion introduced by the sampler is hard to quantify and is usually neglected. In this article upper bounds for this phase-distortion error are derived which are based upon simple assumptions, namely that the sampler weighting function is strictly positive, that it is limited in time and that the function has only one local maximum. The theoretical limits are applied in order to specify the accuracy of a calibration procedure for broadband <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes...</b>|$|R

The substrate of the device-under-test (DUT) must first be thinned mechanically. The device is mounted on a movable X-Y stage in an enclosure which shields it from all sources of light. The DUT is connected to an active electrical stimulus. The stimulus pattern is continuously looped and a trigger signal is sent to the TRPE instrument in order to tell it when the pattern repeats. A TRPE prober operates in a manner similar to a <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope,</b> and is used to perform semiconductor failure analysis.|$|E

The device to be analyzed is de-encapsulated in order to expose the silicon surface. The silicon substrate is thinned mechanically using a back side mechanical thinning tool. The thinned device is then mounted on a movable stage and connected to an electrical stimulus source. Signal measurements are performed through {{the back side of the}} device after substrate thinning has been performed.

The e-beam prober is capable of measuring voltage and timing waveforms on internal semiconductor signal structures. Waveforms may be measured on metal line, polysilicon and diffusion structures that have an electrically active, changing signal. The operation of the prober {{is similar to that}} of a <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscope.</b> A continuously looping, repeating test pattern must be applied to the device-under-test (DUT). E-beam probers are used primarily for front side semiconductor analysis. With the advent of flip-chip technology, many e-beam probers have been replaced with back side analysis instruments.|$|E

40|$|Sequential <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> {{normally}} display eye diagrams as {{a series}} of disconnected points on the screen. While these points accurately represent all the combinations of digitized bit patterns, each point is obtained from a separate trigger event, so {{there is no way to}} determine exact characteristics of any specific bit combination (Fig. 1 a). (a) (b) Fig. 1. Sequential <b>sampling</b> <b>oscilloscopes</b> show eye diagrams {{as a series}} of disconnected dots (a). Using the HP Eyeline display mode (b), the individual bit patterns can be distinguished. When sampling live data there is no alternative, but when sampling repetitive waveforms such as pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) patterns it is often possible to show the individual bit sequences. This is done by synchronizing the oscilloscope trigger with the pattern repetition rate. In this case, the oscilloscope repeatedly triggers at the same point in the pattern, so the display is a sampled representation of that segment of the pattern. This display mode, called pattern triggering, is commonly used in situations where the device under test can be stimulated with a digital pattern generator from a bit error rate tester (BERT). Pattern generators typically include a trigger output that can be set to produce a trigger pulse at the start of each pattern. The problem has been that until recently, it has not been possible to accurately display portions of the pattern far from the trigger point. While it is theoretically possible to show different parts of the pattern by increasing th...|$|R
