One way to prevent damage from occurring to the klystron microwave amplifier tube is through the use of a crowbar circuit which diverts the energy stored in the power <b>supply</b> <b>filter</b> capacitors from the tube arc. The crowbar circuit must be extremely reliable. To test the crowbar circuit, a wire that is designed to fuse when it absorbs a predetermined amount of energy is switched between the high voltage output terminals.

40|$|Abstract—A linearly tunable {{low-voltage}} CMOS transcon-ductor {{featuring a}} new adaptative-bias mechanism that consider-ably improves {{the stability of}} the processed-signal common-mode voltage over the tuning range, critical for very-low voltage appli-cations, is introduced. It embeds a feedback loop that holds input devices on triode region while boosting the output resistance. Analysis of the integrator frequency response gives an insight into the location of secondary poles and zeros as function of design parameters.

Mains EMI (electromagnetic interference) filters carry potentially high currents at dangerously high voltages, so care is essential in their choice. The working voltage and current rating of components can be decided once the specification is known.

40|$|Exposure {{control systems}} {{performance}} {{was investigated in}} an aircraft painting hangar. The ability of the ventilation system and respiratory protection program to limit worker exposures was examined through air sampling during painting of F/A- 18 C/D strike fighter aircraft, in four field surveys. Air velocities were measured across the <b>supply</b> <b>filter,</b> exhaust filter, and hangar midplane under crossflow ventilation. Air sampling conducted during painting process phases (wipe-down, primer spraying, and topcoat spraying) encompassed volatile organic compounds, total particulate matter, Cr[VI], metals, nitroethane, and hexamethylene diisocyanate, for two worker groups: sprayers and sprayer helpers ("hosemen"). One of six methyl ethyl ketone and two of six methyl isobutyl ketone samples exceeded the short term exposure limits of 300 and 75 ppm, with means 57 ppm and 63 ppm, respectively. All 12 Cr[VI] 8 -hr time-weighted averages exceeded the recommended exposure limit of 1 25 g/m 3, 11 out of 12 exceeded the permissible exposure limit of 5 25 g/m 3, and 7 out of 12 exceeded the threshold limit value of 10 25 g/m 3, with means 38 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 8. 3 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Hexamethylene diisocyanate means were 5. 95 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 0. 645 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Total reactive isocyanate group [...] the total of monomer and oligomer as NCO group mass [...] showed 6 of 15 personal samples exceeded the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive workplace exposure limit of 20 25 g/m 3, with means 50. 9 25 g/m 3 for sprayers and 7. 29 25 g/m 3 for hosemen. Several exposure limits were exceeded, reinforcing continued use of personal protective equipment. The supply rate, 94. 4 m 3 /s (200, 000 cfm), produced a velocity of 8. 58 m/s (157 fpm) at the <b>supply</b> <b>filter,</b> while the exhaust rate, 68. 7 m 3 /s (146, 000 cfm), drew 1. 34 m/s (264 fpm) at the exhaust filter. Midway between supply and exhaust locations, the velocity was 0. 528 m/s (104 fpm). Supply rate exceeding exhaust rate created re-circulations, turbulence, and fugitive emissions, while wasting energy. Smoke releases showing more effective ventilation here than in other aircraft painting facilities carries technical feasibility relevance.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{progresses}} on {{the various}} fields related to the project will be described. On the one hand, the development of suitable and reliable filter cells is a crucial task. Especially further decrease of the wall relaxation rate remains to be important. Therefore, we embarked on coatings made out of Cs suboxides, in particular Cs 7 O, and compared such cells in an elementary neutron experiment with those simply coated with Cs. To enable wide angle applications of the 3 He neutron spin filter technique, like reflectometry or small angle scattering, the cell design has been modified {{in order to get}} access to scattering angles up to 18 o. A new type of transportation unit, well adapted to the requirements of those cells, has been constructed and tested. On the other hand, the construction of a filling station to <b>supply</b> <b>filter</b> cells is indispensable. Although a 3 He polarisation degree of 80 during optical pumping had been achieved reliably, further improvements for a novel optical pumping cell has been evaluated prepared and tested. Moreover progresses in the compressor completion are discussed. To integrate it, the rebuilding of the filling station for a flow through type of operation has been evaluated and afterwards the construction of certain parts upgraded, allowing determination of the polarisation in each of the 4 optical pumping cells which {{will be part of the}} filling station in the future...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnRF {{frequency}} synthesizer systems are prevalent in today’s electronics. In a synthesizer {{there is a}} sensitive analog oscillator that may be affected by {{two different types of}} noise. The first is random noise injection from active devices. This results in phase noise in the synthesizer’s spectrum. The second noise source is deterministic. A digital frequency divider with high-amplitude switching is an example of such a deterministic source. This noise enters the system through various forms of electric or magnetic field coupling and manifests itself as spurs or pulling. Both forms of noise can adversely affect system performance. We will first summarize methods for reducing noise. These already known steps have to do with layout techniques, device geometry, and general synthesizer topologies. Then we will show ways to isolate noisy interfering circuits from the sensitive analog systems. Finally, we present some considerations for reducing the effects of random noise. A power <b>supply</b> <b>filter</b> can improve the effects of deterministic noise such as undesired signals on the supply line. We show several ways to improve the rejection of high frequency supply noise (characterized by the power supply rejection ratio or PSRR) through the design of a voltage regulator. The emphasis is on new techniques for obtaining good PSRR at S-band frequencies and above. To validate the techniques, we designed a regulator in Peregrine Semiconductor’s. 25 µm ULTRA CMOS Silicon on Sapphire process. It produces a 2. 5 V output with an input ranging from 2. 6 V to 5 V and has a maximum current sourcing of 70 mA. The regulator’s low drop out performance is 60 mV with no load and it achieves a power supply ripple reduction of 29. 8 dB at 500 MHz. To address random noise in synthesizers, the thesis provides preliminary investigation of an oscillator topology change that has been proposed in the literature. This proposed change reduces the phase noise of the oscillator within the overall system. A differential cross-coupled design is the usual topology of choice, but it is not optimal for noise performance. We investigate current noise injection in the traditional design and present an updated design that uses a differential Colpitts oscillator as an alternative to classic cross-coupled designs...|$|E

[...] The power supply provides DC current to each tube's plate circuit, so the {{power supply wiring}} (power busses) can be an inadvertent feedback path between stages.

This is caused by inadequate power <b>supply</b> <b>filtering</b> or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause.|$|R
