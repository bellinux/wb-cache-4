5|$|Once {{legislation}} is introduced, it is passed {{to one of}} the <b>standing</b> <b>committees</b> of the Senate. There are six such committees. As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer <b>standing</b> <b>committees</b> than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the <b>standing</b> <b>committees</b> deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced {{by a member of the}} Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate committees, members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.|$|E

This gives them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry.

Student representative bodies also exist {{at the various}} colleges, academic faculties and departments.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the committees are the pairs of <b>standing</b> <b>committees.</b> These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse {{is the case for}} the references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E

They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E

In August 1971 the Senate <b>Standing</b> <b>Committees</b> on Education, Science and the Arts conducted a general inquiry into radio and television. On every occasion, Madgwick, accompanied by ABC general manager Talbot Duckmanton, travelled to Canberra to answer each committee's questions. Under Madgwick, the ABC's annual budget grew from $50 million in 1969 to $90 million in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905.

He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E
