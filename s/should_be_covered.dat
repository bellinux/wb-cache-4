The curriculum that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many forms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E

Water Services Boards <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>cover</b> their administrative costs through the Regulatory Levy they collect from WSPs in their service area. In fact, only Athi WSB was able to meet 115% of operational costs in 2006/2007. The other WSBs were still heavily reliant on government subsidies.|$|R

25|$|Of those Americans {{who have}} health insurance, most {{are covered by}} employer-sponsored health insurance. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which relies on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of {{preventive}} care for women <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> in certain employer-based health plans. HHS exempted religious employers (churches and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order), non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception, employers providing grandfathered plans (that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered.</b> Companies that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day, or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{spread of}} {{impetigo}} {{to other people}} the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean. Care {{should be taken to}} keep fluids from an infected person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Sores <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with a bandage. Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens.|$|E
25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take {{at least}} a day to sporulate and become {{infectious}} after they are shed, so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat litter. The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> when not in use.|$|E

A needs assessment was conducted {{to determine whether the}} current employees feel the need to have a centralized employee orientation. A six-question survey was created, and 50 % of full-time teaching and non-teaching employees were asking to participate.

However the story had {{important}} consequences in two short stories which followed closely afterwards (one of which {{was included in the}} trade paperback). In Volt Face, Hershey became acting chief judge and ordered that Volt's suicide <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> up, to present the public with a more heroic death which was fabricated for him by doctoring video footage. This episode foreshadowed a plot device used in the story Origins seven years later, in which Chief Judge Fargo's suicide was also covered up and a heroic death {{in the line of duty}} was invented for him.|$|E
25|$|However, simple {{husbandry}} {{changes and}} practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock {{during times of}} maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The Culicoides midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or slurry pits <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.|$|E

On 26 July 2012 the statue in Lucknow was damaged by members of a group calling themselves [...] "Uttar Pradesh Naunirman Sena". A replacement statue was re-installed overnight by the Lucknow city administration. Following the Lucknow vandalism, there were similar such incidents in other parts of Uttar Pradesh.|$|E

500|$|In {{traumatic}} pneumothorax, chest {{tubes are}} usually inserted. If mechanical ventilation is required, {{the risk of}} tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory. Any open chest wound <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> with an airtight seal, as it carries {{a high risk of}} leading to tension pneumothorax. Ideally, a dressing called the [...] "Asherman seal" [...] should be utilized, as it appears to be more effective than a standard [...] "three-sided" [...] dressing. The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and, through a valve-like mechanism, allows air to escape but not to enter the chest.|$|E

These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, [...] "varminty" [...] expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut.

[...] These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production.
