5000|$|... #Caption: A series {{modulated}} stage. In modern transmitters the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> {{will use}} PWM switching for high efficiency. Historically the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> {{would have been}} a tube in analog mode.|$|E
5000|$|A series charge {{controller}} or <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> disables further current flow into batteries {{when they are}} full. A shunt {{charge controller}} or shunt regulator diverts excess electricity to an auxiliary or [...] "shunt" [...] load, such as an electric water heater, when batteries are full.|$|E
5000|$|Series {{regulators}} {{are the more}} common form; they are more efficient than shunt designs. The <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> works by providing a path from the supply voltage to the load through a variable resistance, usually a transistor (in this role it is usually termed the series pass transistor); {{it is in the}} [...] "top half" [...] of the voltage divider - the bottom half being the load. The power dissipated by the regulating device is equal to the power supply output current times the voltage drop in the regulating device. For efficiency and reduced stress on the pass transistor, designs try to minimize the voltage drop but not all circuits regulate well once the input (unregulated) voltage comes close to the required output voltage; those that do are termed Low Dropout regulators, A <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> can usually only source (supply) current, unlike shunt regulators.|$|E
50|$|Like other <b>series</b> <b>regulators,</b> the diode will {{dissipate}} power {{equal to}} its voltage drop times the current passing through it.|$|R
5000|$|Linear {{regulators}} {{exist in}} two basic forms: shunt <b>regulators</b> and <b>series</b> <b>regulators.</b> Most linear regulators have a maximum rated output current. This is generally limited by either power dissipation capability, {{or by the}} current carrying capability of the output transistor.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{solid-state}} <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulators</b> are the LM78xx (for positive voltages) and LM79xx (for negative voltages). Alternatives are low-dropout regulators {{like the}} AMS1117 and Holtek HT7xxx series, both also available for voltages below those {{supported by the}} LM78xx <b>series.</b> The Holtek <b>regulators</b> have a quiescent current of <5 µA (approximately 1000 times less than the LM78xx series) making them better suited for battery-powered devices.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively a <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> can be {{inserted}} between the DC supply and the anode. The DC supply provides twice the normal voltage the anode sees. The regulator can allow none {{or all of}} the voltage to pass, or any intermediate value. The audio input operates the regulator {{in such a way as}} to produce the instantaneous anode voltage needed to reproduce the modulation envelope. An advantage of the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> is that it can set the anode voltage to any desired value. Thus the power output of the transmitter can be easily adjusted, allowing the use of Dynamic Carrier Control. The use of PDM switching regulators makes this system very efficient, whereas the original analog regulators were very inefficient and also non linear. Series PDM modulators are used in solid state transmitters also, but the circuits are somewhat more complex, using push pull or bridge circuits for the RF section.|$|E
50|$|The EL34 is a {{thermionic}} valve or vacuum tube {{of the power}} pentode type. It has an international octal base (indicated by the '3' in the part number) and is found mainly in the final output stages of audio amplification circuits and {{was designed to be}} suitable as a <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> by virtue of its high permissible voltage between heater and cathode and other parameters. The American RETMA tube designation number for this tube is 6CA7. The USSR analog was 6P27S (Cyrillic: 6П27C).|$|E
50|$|Linear {{regulators}} may {{place the}} regulating device {{in parallel with}} the load (shunt regulator) or may place the regulating device between the source and the regulated load (a <b>series</b> <b>regulator).</b> Simple linear regulators may only contain a Zener diode and a series resistor; more complicated regulators include separate stages of voltage reference, error amplifier and power pass element. Because a linear voltage regulator is a common element of many devices, integrated circuit regulators are very common. Linear regulators may also {{be made up of}} assemblies of discrete solid-state or vacuum tube components.|$|E
50|$|A cascode {{may also}} be {{combined}} with a voltage ladder to form a high-voltage transistor. The input transistor may be of any low-UCEO type, while the others, acting as stacked linear <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulators,</b> {{should be able to}} withstand a considerable fraction of the supply voltage. Note that for a large output-voltage swing, their base voltages should not be bypassed to ground by capacitors, and the uppermost ladder resistor should be able to withstand the full supply voltage.This shows that a linear <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulator</b> is actually a current buffer with its input and output designations swapped.|$|R
40|$|The design {{concept for}} the TWT {{amplifier}} converter for possible {{use in the}} Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft (TOPS) is presented. An unusual combination of semiconductors and magnetics was utilized to achieve very stable voltage regulation {{on a number of}} separate outputs to satisfy the requirements of a high-power TWT, {{and at the same time}} operate at an efficiency of better than 90 % from a 30 -V source. The circuitry consists of an output filter, an auxiliary Jensen oscillator driving a high-reactance transformer to provide current limiting to the heater, a variable time delay, a main Jensen oscillator driving the power transformer with a maximum step-up ratio of 120 to 1, and <b>series</b> transistorized post <b>regulators</b> to provide precise voltage adjustment and low output impedance. This paper discusses the design of the high-reactance transformer and the high step-up ratio transformer, as well as the high-voltage <b>series</b> <b>regulators</b> that are limited in range and operate at the top of the unregulated output voltage. Test data are presented, and details of current transients caused by charging the filter circuits, input current ripple, and output voltage ripples are considered...|$|R

5000|$|The shunt {{regulator}} works {{by providing a}} path from the supply voltage to ground through a variable resistance (the main transistor is in the [...] "bottom half" [...] of the voltage divider). The current through the {{shunt regulator}} is diverted away from the load and flows uselessly to ground, making this form usually less efficient than the <b>series</b> <b>regulator.</b> It is, however, simpler, sometimes consisting of just a voltage-reference diode, and is used in very low-powered circuits where the wasted current {{is too small to}} be of concern. This form is very common for voltage reference circuits. A shunt regulator can usually only sink (absorb) current.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{low-voltage}} {{power supply}} circuit {{was developed for}} micropower CMOS LSI applications, with microwatt smart-sensor LSIs being the specific focus. The circuit consists of a switched-capacitor voltage converter and a <b>series</b> <b>regulator.</b> The switched converter lowers battery voltage by 1. 5 – 3 V to a low voltage of 0. 5 – 0. 7 V that drives the <b>series</b> <b>regulator,</b> and the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> provides LSI logic gates with a power voltage of 0. 4 – 0. 6 V such that the logic gates operate at a subthreshold region. The switched converter lowered the voltage of a 1. 5 -V battery to 0. 68 V in a sample circuit designed to produce a supply voltage of 0. 6 V, and the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> lowered it further to 0. 6 V.

40|$|Capacitors and <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulators</b> {{are widely}} used in {{distribution}} systems to reduce power losses and improve the voltage profile along the feeders. This paper deals {{with the problem of}} contemporaneously choosing optimal locations and sizes for both capacitors and <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulators</b> in three-phase unbalanced distribution systems. This is a mixed, non-linear, constrained multi-objective optimization problem, and is usually solved in deterministic scenarios.

To take into account the unavoidable uncertainties that affect the problem's input data, primarily the load demands, this paper formulates and solves the multi-objective optimization problem in probabilistic scenarios. To reduce the computational efforts, a linearized form of the equality constraints of the optimization model is used, and a microgenetic algorithm-based procedure is applied as a solution method.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to perform a trade study on several candidate power system architectures for small spacecrafts to be used in NASA's new millennium program. Three initial candidate architectures have been proposed by NASA and two other candidate architectures have been proposed by Howard University. Howard University is currently conducting the necessary analysis, synthesis, and simulation needed to perform the trade studies and arrive at the optimal power system architecture. Statistical, sensitivity and tolerant studies has been performed on the systems. It is concluded from present studies that certain components such as the <b>series</b> <b>regulators,</b> buck-boost converters and power converters can be minimized while retaining the desired functionality of the overall architecture.

To take into account the unavoidable uncertainties that affect the input data related to the problem, in this paper, we have formulated and solved the multi-objective optimization problem in probabilistic scenarios. To address the multi-objective optimization problem, algorithms were used in which all the objective functions were combined to form a single function. These algorithms allow us to transform the original multi-objective optimization problem into an equivalent, single-objective, optimization problem, an approach that appeared to be particularly suitable since computational time was an important issue.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{the world of}} power supply design has seen a gradual {{movement}} away {{from the use of}} linear power supplies to the more practical switched mode power supply (S. M. P. S.). The linear power supply contains a mains transformer and a dissipative <b>series</b> <b>regulator.</b> This means the supply has extremely large and heavy 50 / 60 Hz transformers, and also very poor power conversion efficiencies, both serious drawbacks. Typical efficiencies of 30 % are standard for a linear. This compares with efficiencies of between 70 and 80 %, currently available using S. M. P. S. designs. This paper presents an overview of such a design project and the performance results. 1...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaA 5 -Watt S-Band {{telemetry}} transmitter {{is often the}} biggest power drain on an airborne telemetry system's power supply.

In this paper we describe the design philosophy of a high efficiency telemetry transmitter that uses Gallium Arsenide Field Effect Transistors (GaAs FETs) as the power output stages. The GaAs FETs provide efficiency levels not achievable with silicon bipolar technology.

25|$|The River Rother {{is managed}} by the Environment Agency to {{mitigate}} flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, through a <b>series</b> of <b>regulators</b> and washlands. The regulators are used {{to hold back the}} flow of the river, and the washlands consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back. This allows flood flows on the River Don to pass through Rotherham before the water from the Rother does so. There are three regulators, at Canklow, Woodhouse Mill and Meadowgate.|$|R
2500|$|Feedback voltage {{regulators}} operate {{by comparing the}} actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear <b>series</b> <b>regulators</b> and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|R
5000|$|This circuit {{has much}} better {{regulation}} than the simple shunt regulator, since the base current of the transistor forms a very light {{load on the}} Zener, thereby minimising variation in Zener voltage due to variation in the load. Note that the output voltage will always be about 0.65V less than the Zener due to the transistor's VBE drop. Although this circuit has good regulation, it is still sensitive to the load and supply variation. This can be resolved by incorporating negative feedback circuitry into it. This regulator is often used as a [...] "pre-regulator" [...] in more advanced <b>series</b> voltage <b>regulator</b> circuits.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{proportional integral derivative}} (PID) controller model for buck converter topology of switch mode power supply (SMPS). PID controller {{in terms of the}} settling time while exhibiting a greater degree of robustness regarding disturbance rejection represented by severe changes in static and dynamic loads. The controller is used to change the duty cycle of the converter and thereby, the voltage is regulated. The buck converter, P, PI and PID controller are modeled and are evaluated by computer simulations. It has been found that the transient performance and steady state performance is improved using PID controller. SMPS design can produce very compact and lightweight supplies. Power conversion efficiencies of SMPS are 70 & 80 %. Implementation of SMPS by using FPGA, it gives the better performance and faster transient response. Improves the steady state performance and transient response by using PID controller, it is possible to design stable, efficient and ruggedized SMPS which has faster transient response for dynamically switching loads. In SMPS the switching action means the <b>series</b> <b>regulator</b> element is either on or off and therefore little energy is dissipated as heat and very high efficiency levels can be achieved. As a result of the high efficiency and low levels of heat dissipation, the switch mode power supplies can be made more compact.
