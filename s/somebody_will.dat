25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is a temptation to simply leave a problem without resolving it. If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know {{that in a few}} years <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> move and the problem will disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse. Studies show that many brats become very adaptable {{as a result of the}} mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of Avoidant Personality Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder.|$|E

Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E
500|$|Each puppet's {{head was}} fitted with about 10 thin {{tungsten}} steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played {{into the studio}} using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable {{through the application of}} powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: [...] " [...] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [...] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'" [...] Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements {{with the help of a}} viewfinder-powered CCTV feedback system. As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} years, Elgar {{experienced}} a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival {{of his works}} to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when {{it was out of}} fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would [...] "tinker" [...] with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony, but at other times he said, [...] "If I can't complete the Third Symphony, <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> complete it – or write a better one." [...] After Elgar's death, Percy M. Young, in co-operation with the BBC and Elgar's daughter Carice, produced a version of The Spanish Lady, which was issued on CD. The Third Symphony sketches were elaborated by the composer Anthony Payne into a complete score in 1998.|$|E

500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

Matronic commented, [...] "It's one of those songs that people were either gonna love or hate, and that's really, really powerful, because it basically means you're evoking a reaction in everyone.

[...] Their version of [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] became a hit in many dance clubs and, after sending Pink Floyd themselves a copy, the Scissor Sisters received positive remarks from the song's original writers Roger Waters and David Gilmour.

2500|$|For his own part, Zhirinovsky {{has done}} a great deal to foster a {{reputation}} as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear. Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available. Zhirinovsky has on several occasions become involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, he also took part in the 2000 and 2008 presidential elections, promising a [...] "police state", and to institute summary executions.

[...] After {{the owner of the}} college joined the Confederate army, the U.S. War Department seized the school and converted it into a military prison. When the 2nd Iowa began guarding the prison, there were approximately 1,300 prisoners held at the college. [...] Thanks to some reeducation and the resulting oaths of allegiance, the number was reduced to approximately 1,100 prisoners {{at the time of the}} 2nd Iowa’s departure. [...] Colonel Tuttle led the re-education of the prisoners, teaching the rebels “Uncle Samuel is not to be fooled with and that [...] have to submit or <b>somebody</b> <b>will</b> get hurt.” Shortly before the 2nd Iowa would be relieved of prison duty in early 1862, a few unknown members of the regiment broke into a museum at the college and stole some items of minimal importance. [...] Because of this, General Henry Halleck ordered that the regiment, which was well-liked by the people of St. Louis and the prisoners, march through the streets on the way to the steamer T. H. McGill in disgrace without music or colors. [...] On February 10, 1862, the 2nd Iowa Infantry embarked on their next assignment.|$|E

[...] The affidavit also claimed that the reports by US, UK and European Parliament were biased since they [...] "do not provide opportunity to the Government of India or the local embassy/high commission to record their opinion and are heavily biased against the targeted country". The 2014 State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report appeared to classify the Khobragade incident as an example of human trafficking, stating: [...] "An Indian consular officer at the New York consulate was indicted in December 2013 for visa fraud related to her alleged exploitation of an Indian domestic worker." [...] In response, India has shown no urgency to allow visits to India by the newly appointed US anti-people trafficking ambassador Susan P.
