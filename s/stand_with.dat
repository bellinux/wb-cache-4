5|$|An inept batsman with {{an average}} of 5.78 in his {{first-class}} career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey.

40|$|Beech bark {{disease was}} {{discovered}} in Michigan in 2000 and will likely kill at least 50 % of mature American beech trees. Our {{study was designed to}} determine how wildlife resource abundance will be affected as beech bark disease spreads and intensifies throughout Michigan. We assessed the potential impact in forest <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> varying beech densities (low, moderate, and high) and abundance of Cryptococcus fagisuga (absent, light, and heavy). Variables were measured in 62 stands throughout the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan in 2002 and 2003. Beech snags were significantly more abundant in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> heavy C. fagisuga abundance than in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> absent or light C. fagisuga abundance. Coarse woody debris volume and beechnut mass were highest in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> heavy C. fagisuga abundance, although means were not statistically different...|$|R

5|$|Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick {{alleged that}} Clinton had raped {{her in the}} spring of 1978, {{although}} she stated she did not remember the exact date. In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after H. D. G. Leveson-Gower. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team. After the tourists dismissed the home team for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays.|$|E

Macartney's return to form was interrupted by an illness, which caused him to miss the following three Test matches. After a two-month layoff, Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England.|$|E
5|$|India then {{travelled}} to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni {{was ruled}} {{out of the}} Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named captain for the tournament. Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280. It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.

5|$|Trescothick {{played well}} against a weak Zimbabwe {{side in the}} two-Test series in May–June 2003, and scored an unbeaten century in the three ODIs against Pakistan {{averaging}} over 100. His form continued in the 2003 NatWest Series, with 114 not out against South Africa. The opening <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> Vikram Solanki of 200 runs was the highest first-wicket partnership for England and provided the first instance of both England openers scoring centuries in the same innings. Trescothick maintained his form in the South Africa Test matches; a career-best 219 at The Oval completed a successful series in which he averaged 60.87.|$|E
5|$|A {{second tranche}} of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East <b>Stand</b> <b>with</b> a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the corporate and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer2011.
