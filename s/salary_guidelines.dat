40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a heuristic methodology to generate salary merit increases and to schedule these salary actions along a specified planning horizon. The heuristic approach consists of two procedures, referred to as Heuristic Procedure 1 and Heuristic Procedure 2. For a group of executive personnel, Heuristic Procedure 1 yields salary increase percentages, {{in such a way that}} external consistency is maximized without violating internal consistency conditions. Heuristic Procedure 2 establishes the time intervals between salary increases for each eligible employee. A comparison is performed, in terms of computer execution time and optimality of solutions, between the heuristic methodology and a mathematical programming approach developed for formulating <b>salary</b> administration <b>guidelines.</b> Computational results are reported for a number of sample problems. compensation mathematical programming heuristic procedures...|$|R

Group health insurance had yet to be invented, labor laws were weak or nonex-istent, and public welfare programs were limited in scope. Commercial policies were often targeted to wealthier clients, both in terms of cover-age provided and costs, and therefore priced out of the range of working-class <b>salaries.</b> Discriminatory underwriting <b>guidelines</b> also meant that many families—especially those of ethnic and racial minorities—could not obtain coverage even if they could afford to purchase it (Glenn 2000). In short, market failure meant that blue-collar families often had to look elsewhere for financial protection, and for many this was found in a mutual benefit society. Yet mutual benefit societies did more than redress market failure b...|$|R
