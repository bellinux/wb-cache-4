Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem {{to act as if}} they are Jackson's parents in the short film.

Due to this, Michael believes moving to Japan and developing his robotic arm would finally prove to the world that he is, in fact, worthy of dating a princess.

It {{also serves as a}} pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from cleansing creams and milks, skin lotions, eye gels, moisturizers, shampoos, <b>shaving</b> <b>foams,</b> and so on. TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5−6.0. Cleansing milk-cream emulsions based on TEA are particularly good at removing makeup. (HOCH2)3N was used in the synthesis of amustaline.|$|R

5000|$|Shaving {{cream or}} <b>shaving</b> <b>foam</b> [...] is a frothy {{cosmetic}} cream applied to body hair, usually facial hair, to facilitate shaving. The use of cream achieves three effects: lubricates the cutting process; swells keratin; and desensitizes skin. Shaving creams commonly consist of an emulsion of oils, soaps or surfactants, and water.|$|E
30|$|Foam is {{a mixture}} of liquid, {{surfactant}} and other chemical additives, and compressed gasses. The gaseous phase could be nitrogen, carbon dioxide, natural gas or air. Foam is a multiphase, metastable, compressible, non-Newtonian fluid, and has a consistency similar to that of <b>shaving</b> cream. <b>Foam</b> properties are briefly discussed in the following section (Zhu et al. 1995; Rojas et al. 2002; Li and Kuru 2005).|$|R
40|$|International audienceLiquid foams are {{mixtures}} {{of gas and}} liquid, with a liquid volume fraction ϕ _l≤ 0. 3, stabilized with surfactants. Because of their composition and structure, liquid foams are very complex and unstable media with particular acoustical properties. Experimental studies are not very numerous; they have shown a strong dependence of the velocity and attenuation of sound on parameters such as ϕ _l and the average bubble size [1]. The existent theories explain {{a part of the}} acoustic behaviour of liquid foams, but are not exactly in accordance with the experimental data found in the literature. For example, the experimental phase velocities [Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 021404] are larger than the velocities predicted by the Wood approximation [A. B. Wood, A Textbook of sound (Bell, London, 1932) ]. We present an experimental investigation of liquid foams by an ultrasonic setup based on two broadband air transducers (40 - 200 kHz). The acoustic properties are deduced from the reflected signal. We discuss experimental results with commercial (<b>shaving</b> <b>foams)</b> and custom-made controlled foams and compare them with available models. The evolution of the acoustic properties with the aging of the foams is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Before wet shaving, {{the area}} to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by {{showering}} or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair. A lathering or lubricating agent such as cream, <b>shaving</b> soap, gel, <b>foam</b> or oil is normally applied after this. Lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent a painful razor burn. Many razor cartridges include a lubricating strip, made of polyethylene glycol, to function instead of or in supplement to extrinsic agents. It also lifts and softens the hairs, causing them to swell. This enhances the cutting action and sometimes permits cutting the hairs slightly {{below the surface of}} the skin. Additionally, during shaving, the lather indicates areas that have not been addressed. When soap is used, it is generally applied with a shaving brush, which has long, soft bristles. It is worked up into a usable lather by the brush, either against the face, in a shaving mug, bowl, scuttle, or palm of the hand.|$|R

50|$|Shaving soap {{typically}} {{refers to}} a hard soap that is whipped into a lather using a shaving brush. The lather it produces is used to coat the face during shaving, providing protection and lubrication for the razor. Among cartridge razor users, shaving soap has largely been displaced by canned <b>shaving</b> <b>foam</b> or gel, but hard shaving soaps are still utilized by users of double-edge safety razors and straight razors.|$|E
40|$|The white {{appearance}} of familiar {{objects such as}} clouds, snow, milk, or foam {{is due to the}} random scattering of light by the sample. As we all know, pure water is clear and easily passes a beam of light. However, tiny water droplets, such as those in a cloud, scatter light because the air and water droplet have different indexes of refraction. When many droplets, or scattering sites, are present, the incident light is scattered in random directions and the sample takes on a milky white appearance. In a glass of milk, the scattering is due to small colloidal particles. The white {{appearance of}} <b>shaving</b> cream, or <b>foam,</b> is due to the scattering of light at the water-bubble interface. Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) is a laser light-scattering technique used to noninvasively probe the particle dynamics in systems that strongly scatter light. The technique takes advantage of the diffuse nature of light, which is reflected or transmitted from samples such as foams, dense colloidal suspensions (such as paint and milk), emulsions, liquid crystals, sandpiles, and even biological tissues...|$|R

5000|$|Not all jammed {{systems are}} fragile, i.e. foam. <b>Shaving</b> <b>foam</b> is jammed because the bubbles are tightly packed {{together}} under the isotropic stress imposed by atmospheric pressure.

5000|$|Vanishing spray, {{also known}} as {{vanishing}} foam, is a substance applied to an association football pitch {{in order to provide}} a temporary visual marker.

50|$|Many {{people with}} WAM fetishes {{are drawn to}} the tactile sensations of wet or messy {{substances}} against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the sight of others getting messy or wet. A subject will often be pelted with cream pies (sometimes using <b>shaving</b> <b>foam</b> rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.|$|E

50|$|On 24 August 1939, a {{week before}} the {{invasion}} of Poland which started the war, Germany announced rationing of food, coal, textiles and soap, and Shirer noted that it was this action above all which made the German people wake up to the reality that war was imminent.

Housewives soon spent hours standing in line for supplies; shopkeepers sometimes opened otherwise non-perishable goods such as tinned sardines in front of customers when they were bought to prevent hoarding. The clothing allowance was so meagre that for all practical purposes people had to make do with whatever clothing they already possessed until the war was over. Men were allowed one overcoat and two suits, four shirts and six pairs of socks, and had to prove that the old ones were worn out to get new.

40|$|While liquid foams have {{applications}} in {{an increasing number}} of industrial areas (food, cosmetic or petroleum industry), it remains difficult to non-invasively probe their structure and/or composition. Since the propagation of acoustic waves is very sensitive to parameters such that the liquid fraction, the bubble size distribution, or even the nature of the liquid phase, acoustic spectroscopy could be a very powerful tool to determine the structure and/or composition of liquid foams. In this context, we present an investigation of the acoustic properties of a useful and common foam, often considered as a model system: <b>shaving</b> <b>foam.</b> Phase velocity and attenuation of acoustic waves in a commercial <b>shaving</b> <b>foam</b> (Gillette) were measured over a broad frequency range (0. 5 to 600 kHz), using four different experimental setups: an impedance tube (0. 5 - 6 kHz), an acousto-optic setup based on Diffusive Wave Spectroscopy (0. 4 - 10 kHz), and two transmission setups with narrow-band (40 kHz) and broad-band (60 - 600 kHz) transducers. We present the results and discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each setup in terms of a potential spectroscopy technique...|$|E
