40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the electrical insulation techniques at cryogenic temperatures, i. e. Cryodielectrics, for HTS power apparatus, e. g. HTS power transmission cables, transformers, fault current limiters and SMES. Breakdown and partial discharge characteristics are discussed for different electrical insulation configurations of LN 2, sub-cooled LN 2, solid, vacuum and their composite insulation systems. Dynamic and <b>static</b> <b>insulation</b> performances {{with and without}} taking account of quench in HTS materials are also introduced...|$|E
40|$|Current {{solutions}} for highly energy-efficient retrofitting rely on thick <b>static</b> <b>insulation,</b> airtight construction and extensive ventilation systems to become independent from variable outdoor conditions. A building skin that adapts to the outdoor conditions {{to regulate the}} indoor conditions could provide an interesting alternative for current retrofitting practice. This alternatíve is called ADAPTIWALL and consists of three key components: (l) adaptive insulation, (2) a lightweight concrete buffer and (3) a total heat exchanger. Many possible configurations of ADAPTIV/ALL have been simulated in a one-room model, based on a typical Dutch reference dwelling. In TRNSYS simulations, heating demand has been reduced by over 70 % by applying ADAPTIWALL compared to an energy-efficient retrofit solution with <b>static</b> <b>insulation.</b> It has been demonstrated in the simulations that this requires solar heat to be effectively stored in the buffer. For this, a glass cladding is shown to be very effective. In addition, the adaptive insulation should either allow passage or actively transfer the solar heat gains to the buffer. The buffer should preferably have a high heat capacity at a low density. Development of the total heat exchanger could boost the energy savings even further. These material design challenges will be met within the ADAPTIWALL projec...|$|E
40|$|Ground heat is a {{renewable}} resource that {{is readily available}} for buildings in cool climates, but its relatively low temperature {{requires the use of}} a heat pump to extract it for heating. We developed a system that uses low temperature ground heat directly in a building wall to reduce transmission heat losses. The Active Low Exergy Geothermal Insulation Systems (ALEGIS) minimizes exergy demand and maximizes the use of renewable geothermal heat from the ground. A fluid is pumped into a small pipe network in an external layer of a wall construction that is linked to a ground heat source. This decouples the building from the outside temperature, therefore eliminating large peak demands and reducing the primary energy demand. Our steady-state analysis shows that at a design temperature of − 10 °C the 6 cm thick active insulation system has equivalent performance to 11 cm of passive insulation. Our comparison of heating performance of a building with our active insulation system versus a building with <b>static</b> <b>insulation</b> of the same thickness shows a 15 % reduction in annual electricity demand, and thus exergy input. We present an overview of the operation and analysis of our low exergy concept and its modeled performance...|$|E
50|$|These {{insulators}} {{also have}} to be equipped with overvoltage protection equipment. For the dimensions of the guy <b>insulation,</b> <b>static</b> charges on guys have to be considered. At high masts these can be much higher than the voltage caused by the transmitter, requiring guys divided by insulators in multiple sections on the highest masts. In this case, guys which are grounded at the anchor basements via a coil - or if possible, directly - are the better choice.|$|R
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the physical mechanisms {{of heat and}} moisture transfer through textiles incorporating phase change materials, three indices and related test methods are proposed to characterize the thermal functional performance of such textiles. The indices of thermal regulating capability (Id and Δtd) are {{used to describe the}} thermal regulating performance of textiles incorporating phase change materials, and were found to be strongly dependent on the amount of phase change material. From the aspect of thermal comfort of textiles and clothing, the index TPI is used to represent the thermal psychosensory intensity perceived by the body, and it is shown that the TPI value increased with increase of phase change material level. The index I s is used to describe the <b>static</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> effects of the textiles. All indices can be measured and calculated by using the testing methods of the Fabric Intelligent Hand Tester. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|A {{developmental}} {{program was}} conducted to provide and in-pile loop facility for use in evaluating gas-cooledreactor fuel asubassemblies. The program included the design, construction, and installation of a recirculating gas loop which {{is located in a}} 6 by 6 -in. facility in the aluminum reflector of the ETR. The loop system was designed to recirculate the primary nitrogen coolant at flow rates up to 0. 9 lb per sec and pressures up to 200 psia. It will accept fuel subassmeblies up to 36 in. in length and 2. 26 ia. in diameter with specimen power generation up to 150 kw. The maximum coolant temperature at the specimen outlet is set at 1500 deg F. The loop system includes the in-reactor section, the machinery, the control system, and the specimen-handling apparatus. Salient features of the re-ertrant system include an aluminum pressure wall in the in-reactor section, <b>static</b> gas <b>insulation</b> between the reactor coolant and the circulating loop gas, and a controllable rate of heat exchange between the specimen inlet- and specimen outlet-gas channels in sections of concentric countedlow piping. The three blowers in the system feature grease-lubricated bearings and water cooling. The complete system was tested out of pile and is now installed in the ETR. (auth...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMainly {{published}} {{to reduce}} greenhouse gases emissions, new building regulations, {{leads to a}} constant improvement of building components such as building envelopes and <b>static</b> <b>insulation.</b> Although, the effectiveness and the behaviour of the air-conditioning plants, validated by commissioning procedures, affect greatly the energy needs in buildings, through ventilation requirements. The main work of Annex 40 of the International Agency of the Energy reports on "Commissioning of Building HVAC systems for Improved Energy Performance". The retro- and on-going commissioning of existing buildings HVAC systems can be achieved using many tools. In this annex, we focus on three which have several objectives and intervene in different phases of the commissioning process. One leads to the detection of faults whereas the others contribute to energy consumption evaluation. This paper presents a critical analysis of the various tools used and evaluates the potential of each tool in the commissioning phases under consideration, {{in order to determine}} the most convenient ones for the project in question. The work presented in this paper allows providing a helpful advice to the energy service company or to the technical and research institutes to determine the most adequate tool in terms of number of potential detected faults, precision in energy savings evaluation, and end-user's assessment. A critical analysis is presented to evaluate three of these tools and apply them to a real building. It appears clearly that the PECI Guide, developed for new construction, is very useful in retro-commissioning procedures. Moreover, Emma-CTA and its new versions (CITE-AHU, etc.) represent excellent fault detection tools and diagnosis tools of AHU. For energy savings, the IMPVP tends to become an international standard in measurement and verifications procedures for the ESCO, in order to evaluate energy savings following retrofit. The main issue of our work is to evaluate the operability, potential, time consumed, and results of these tools when used by the HVAC operation staff...|$|E
