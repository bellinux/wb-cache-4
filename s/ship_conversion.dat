These ships were largely reused in secondary roles. On 30 December 1904, Prinz Eugen was stricken from the naval register and converted into a repair <b>ship.</b> <b>Conversion</b> work was begun in 1906, which included removing her armament and engines and the installation of a crane that {{had been removed from}} the pre-dreadnought battleship [...] She was re-commissioned on 31 July 1909 with the new name Vulkan, as her previous name was needed for , a new dreadnought battleship. On 16 June 1910, the protected cruiser [...] towed Vulkan to Sebenico, where she was based {{for the rest of her}} career through World War I. After Austria-Hungary's defeat, the ship was seized by Italy in 1919 as a war prize. The postwar negotiations that followed the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which allocated the ships of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the Allies, awarded the ship to Yugoslavia, but Italy never transferred the ship.
