However, investigators must consider carefully whether Kappa’s baseline agreement is relevant for the particular research question. Kappa’s baseline is frequently described as the agreement due to chance, which is only partially correct. Kappa’s baseline agreement is the agreement that would be expected due to random allocation, given the quantities specified by the marginal totals of <b>square</b> <b>contingency</b> table. Thus, Kappa = 0 when the observed allocation is apparently random, regardless of the quantity disagreement as constrained by the marginal totals. However, for many applications, investigators should be more interested in the quantity disagreement in the marginal totals than in the allocation disagreement as described by the additional information on the diagonal of the <b>square</b> <b>contingency</b> table. Thus for many applications, Kappa’s baseline is more distracting than enlightening. Consider the following example: The disagreement proportion is 14/16 or [...]875. The disagreement is due to quantity because allocation is optimal. Kappa is [...]01.The disagreement proportion is 2/16 or [...]125. The disagreement is due to allocation because quantities are identical. Kappa is -0.07.|$|E

It is important to assess the behaviors of the resident population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Galveston Ship Channel, {{near the entrance to}} the second busiest port in the USA, as a 5. 2 billion dollar expansion of the Panama Canal is to be completed in 2015 that will bring more and larger ships to Galveston Bay. Hour-long surveys were conducted from a shore-based station along the Galveston Ship Channel in the morning, mid-afternoon, and late-afternoon from August through December 2012. Group size, number of boats, type of boat, and predominant behavior of dolphin groups were recorded during each survey. I predicted a decrease in social behavior and an increase in travelling behavior as boat traffic increased, as noted in previous studies of short-term behavioral shifts of dolphins during periods of heavy boat traffic. Chi <b>squared</b> <b>contingency</b> tests showed that the behaviors of dolphins varied significantly relative to the number of boats, but not the type of boat. However, contrary to predictions, socializing behavior did not change inversely proportionately to boat traffic nor did travelling behavior increase with increasing traffic. Behaviors varied relative to group size, and smaller groups were found in the presence of industrial than non-industrial boats. Behaviors did not change with time of day, although the number of industrial boats increased with time of day. The results suggest that several factors influence behavioral decisions of socially complex dolphins. As smaller group sizes were found in the presence of industrial boats, expansion of the ship channel could potentially disrupt dolphin interactions and habitat use. Further studies are necessary to better understand potential effects of increased ship traffic on the local dolphin population and to establish effective mitigation protocols...|$|R

First, data were extracted with the Genome Studio™ Methylation Module software. The data {{went through a}} quality control (QC) step. The data passing QC step was preprocessed using a color balance adjustment of methylated and unmethylated probe intensities between two color channels using a smooth quantile normalization method. The methylated and unmethylated probe intensities were then background adjusted and normalized using the Quantile method. Differential methylation values were detected by applying the Bayesian moderated t test on the normalized matrix of intensity values (M values) (Du et al. 2010; Smyth 2005). In order to recognize CpG sited with both high statistical significance and strong biological effects, we identified differentially methylated CpG-sites based on the following criteria: false-discovery-rate-adjusted (FDR-adjusted) p value < 0.05 and an absolute DNA methylation differences >than 0.2. Cluster analysis of the epigenome-wide data was performed using unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the Ward. D 2 linkage and Manhattan distance {{as a measure of}} similarity as described in Stefansson et al. (Stefansson et al. 2015) (heatmap. 2 function implemented in the gplot package for R) on the 1264 CpGs found differentially methylated between breast tumors and normal breast samples (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). We next used the pvclust package in R to define statistically significant tumor clusters as those showing an AU (approximately unbiased) p value > 90 (at least five members). Lists of aberrantly methylated CpGs were further analyzed in order to test for differences in the counting of CpGs by categories reflecting functionally relevant sequences: (1) promoter regions, those located proximal to the transcription start site (TSS) (i.e. CpG’s located within 200  bp of the TSS or within the 5 ′UTR/ 1 stExon); (2) TSS 1500, those located more distantly from the TSS lying within the interval from 200 to 1500  bp upstream of the TSS site; (3) gene body, those found within the gene body (excluding the 1 st Exon) and (4) 3 ′UTR, those located at the 3 ′UTR. In addition, CpGs were classified as into three different groups, i.e. those found within (1) CpG islands, (2) CpG shores and (3) CpG poor regions. Continuous variables were compared by use of the Mann–Whitney U test and distributions of categorical variables by Chi <b>squared</b> <b>contingency</b> tests. Finally, the predictive power, which measures the ability of a single site to differentiate the samples in each cluster, was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) associated to the site, where an AUC of 1 means that the methylation level of that site perfectly separates the samples into the two clusters.|$|R

If significant differences were determined to exist, the second purpose was to investigate how those differences related to differences in the retention rates for freshman fraternity pledges. The data were obtained from the records of all freshman pledges in the Oregon State University fraternity system for a four-year period. From these data the high pledge retention and low pledge retention fraternities were determined. The sample for the remainder of this study was two of the three highest and two of the three lowest pledge retention fraternities. The highest and lowest pledge retention fraternities were eliminated. Analyses included: Pearson Correlation Coefficients to determine if there were significant correlations between retention of pledges in the fraternity system and six factors involving grades and the number of members and pledges living in the fraternities; two-way, fixed analyses of variance to determine if there were significant differences between the high retention fraternities (HRFs) and the low retention fraternities (LRFs) with respect to pledge high school grade point averages and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores; chi <b>square</b> <b>contingencies</b> to determine if there were significant differences between the HRFs and the LRFs with respect to 14 different characteristic, background, and satisfaction variables; and F-test analyses to determine if there were significant living environment differences between the HRFs and the LRFs on each of the subscales of the University Residence Environment Scale, Form R. The conclusions of the study were: 1. Neither high school nor college grades, SAT scores, nor individual characteristics, background, and satisfaction levels can be used to define differences in pledge retention between the HRF and LRF houses. 2. The differences within the living environment, and primarily the relationship dimension of that environment, of the two groups offer the best explanation of the pledge retention differences between the two groups. 3. The overt pressure exerted by the LRFs on their pledges to study and achieve academic success did not result in greater academic success than in HRFs, but did tend to limit the degree of social integration achieved by their pledges. 4. Social integration has a significant positive impact on pledge retention, while overt pressure toward academic integration has a probable negative impact on pledge retention. 5. Successful social integration, while having a positive impact on pledge retention, does not {{have a negative impact on}} academic performance. In fact, the impact on academic performance may be positive. 6.

40|$|Background: Trauma is {{the leading}} cause of death of Australians aged between 14 and 50 years with trauma admissions to {{hospitals}} costing governments millions of dollars per year. Managing health budgets set by governments whilst still delivering quality health care is an important issue. Strategies for addressing effectiveness and efficiency are often focused on providing high quality, cost effective services, which are aimed at reducing hospital length of stay while providing appropriate care. One such strategy adopted by Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) has been the creation of a new State Major Trauma Unit (SMTU) that offers increased trauma services by allowing for greater contact between patients, nursing medical and allied health teams. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the new Western Australian State Major Trauma Unit and its impact on length of hospital stay in major trauma patients. Results can be used to analyse one indicator of effectiveness; namely, length of stay in relation to differing types of services offered pre and post impementation of the SMTU. This provides the basis for recommendations for further studies into effectiveness and efficiency in trauma management in areas such as cost analysis, delayed discharges and unplanned admissions. Methodology: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Trauma Registry from Royal Perth Hospital. Data on the length of stay (LOS) of patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 who were admitted to any general ward at RPH in 2007, prior to establishment of the SMTU, were compared with data from patients who were admitted to the SMTU during the same period in 2008. Descriptive analysis included comparisons of median and interquartile range of age, sex, admission, specialty, discharge destination and ISS. A Chi <b>Square</b> Test of <b>Contingencies</b> or Mann Whitney U test was used to test for any differences in demographic data and the length of stay between these two groups. All p values <. 05 are considered significant. Results: There was no statistically significant difference found between the length of stay or Injury Severity Score of major trauma patients who were admitted to RPH in 2007 and 2008. Conclusions: The results are useful in providing an indicator of trauma patient management in terms of length of stay. The lack of a significant finding suggests the need for a longer term analysis of the LOS for patients admitted to the SMTU and further research into other indicators of effectiveness and efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of counseling on the energy commitments of clients. Other purposes of the research were to examine the differences in energy commitment and its various components in relation to the success of counseling, to evaluate the feasibility of using energy commitment theory as a means for measuring change as a result of counseling, and to investigate factors which might produce change in man's energy commitments. The theoretical framework used to study the effect of counseling on clients' energy commitments was formulated by Hollis and Hollis. Energy commitment was defined as the condition of consigning energy to be used in facilitating action in the future. In this context, energy commitment possesses three major components [...] direction, thrust, and flexibility. Direction was divided into the three separate categories of people, objects, and ideas; while thrust was divided into the three separate categories of priority, force, and amount. The research design of the study required that the participating clients submit to specific measurements prior to counseling, undergo counseling, and submit to specific measurements after counseling. In all, twenty-one clients completed this sequence during the eight week time period. In terms of specific criteria for selection, two qualifications were established. All subjects were at least eighteen years of age and were willing to participate on a voluntary basis. In total, nine null hypotheses were investigated at the. 05 level of significance. Six of the null hypotheses pertained to the effect of counseling on clients' energy commitments, while three of the null hypotheses pertained to the degree of association between various energy commitment measurements and various measurements of counseling success. The six hypotheses pertaining to the effect of counseling on clients' energy commitments were evaluated by three different statistical treatments: the Friedman two-way analysis of variance by ranks, the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, and the Chi Square. The three remaining hypotheses were evaluated by Chi <b>Square</b> and <b>contingency</b> coefficients. The instruments used to determine change, if any, in clients' energy commitments were the Structured Interview Guide (SIG) and the Interview Rating Sheet (IRS). In terms of the degree of counseling success, three measurements were employed. First, the Personal Orientation Inventor, (POI) by Everett Shostrom was used to determine change, if any in the clients' level of self-actualization. Second, the Client Expectancy Inventory (CEI) and the Inventory of Fulfillment of Client's Expectancy (IFCE) were employed to measure counseling success in terms of counseling expectancy and fulfillment of counseling expectancy. The CEI and the IFCE were developed by the author and Joseph Hollis specifically for the present study. The theoretical framework for both instruments was developed after reviewing the literature pertaining to the goals of counseling and clients' expectations of counseling. Third, the researcher employed ratings of counseling success obtained from the participating counselors. In this respect, the researcher constructed the Counselor's Rating of Counseling, Success (CRCS) for this purpose. Two major conclusions were made from an analysis of the data. First, the counseling process produces significant change in the way an individual approaches his commitments, but the actual energy commitments remain essentially the same. Second, the findings concerned with the degree of association between energy commitment change and measurements of counseling success were not significantly related. Hence, the conclusion was made that energy commitment variables are not to any measureable degree assessing the same change criteria as those employed to measure counseling success. Additional data were analyzed pertaining to the correlation between client and counselor ratings of the counseling experience. The obtained Pearson Product-Moment Correlation was not significant at the. 05 level of probability. However, the difference between the means of the two groups was significant at the. 05 level. Based on the preceding data, the conclusion was made that clients tend to rate the counseling experience more successful than their respective counselors. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{research that}} has been undertaken to understand factors influencing software developers' intention to perform test driven development (TDD). Unit tests are a form of testing, where tests are written for small units of software being developed. TDD is a practice where these tests are written before the functionality is written, so as to guide {{the design of the}} code for the functionality, as well as to ensure test coverage for all functionality. There has been some research conducted to understand TDD by looking at its effects on both the outcomes and the practice of software development. It has been found to increase quality by decreasing defects, while also increasing the maintainability and the changeability of the code. On the other hand, some research has also found it to increase time spent on completing tasks. Despite this, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, there hasn't been research done to understand the behavioural components of TDD, and in particular, why developers choose to practice TDD. A conceptual model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is described and used as a lens to understand intention. TPB proposes that intention to perform a behaviour (TDD in this case) is influenced by three factors: attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. This dissertation seeks to build onto this model for the purpose of understanding TDD, and proposes the following determinants of the influences of intention: attitude is influenced by attitude towards time taken, differences in quality, maintainability and developer efficiency; subjective norm is influenced by the perceived perception of the environment regarding changes in quality, time taken, and maintainability of the code. Lastly, perceived behavioural control is posited to be made up of perceived difficulty of TDD, and how much experience a developer has. This model is then tested based on data collected from a n online survey distributed around the world. 779 responses were collected from developers in various countries around the world. The majority of the respondents to practice TDD, allowing us to gain greater insight into why those that practice TDD actually do so.

Special cases of the proposed measure include Tomizawa's measures. The proposed measure would be useful for comparing the degree of departure from symmetry in several tables. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{measures}} of symmetry and special types of asymmetry for <b>square</b> <b>contingency</b> tables with nominal or ordinal classification variables is undertaken in this paper. Measures of divergence from complete symmetry and marginal homogeneity have appeared {{so far in the}} literature. We generalise these measure {{with the help of the}} φ-divergence and introduce measures of quasi symmetry and triangular asymmetry as well. Finally, we derive the asymptotic distributions of these measures and provide tests of their significance. Key words: quasi symmetry, marginal homogeneity, triangular asymmetry, φ...|$|E
