50|$|A {{compression}} release mechanism works {{to ease the}} starting of internal combustion engines {{by allowing them to}} spin up to <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> without having to work against the pumping action of the pistons.

At that point the valve closes and the ignition is engaged.|$|E
5000|$|The {{multi-stage}} fitness test, {{also known}} as the pacer test, is a series of stages that have different tasks sometimes used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The most common variation of the multi-stage fitness test is the FitnessGram/Cooper PACER test. The test is especially useful for players of sports such as rugby, association football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, hurling, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash, and fitness testing in schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of cardiovascular fitness, one of the more important components of physical fitness. The test was created in 1982 by Luc Léger, University of Montreal and published in 1983 with a <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> of 8 km/h and stages of 2 min duration. The test was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology in 1988 in its present form with a <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> of 8.5 km/h and 1 min stages under the name [...] "The multistage 20 metre shuttle run test for aerobic fitness". Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|In {{another study}} drivers {{were asked to}} {{indicate}} how much time they feel can be saved when increasing from either a low (30 mph) or high (60 mph) speed (Fuller et al., 2009). For example, participants were asked the following question: [...] "You are driving along an open road. How much time do you feel you would gain if you drove for 10 miles at 40 mph instead of 30 mph?" [...] (Fuller et al., 2009, p. 14). Another question had a higher <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> (60 mph) and two other questions asked about losing time when decreasing speed (from either 30 or 60 mph).|$|E
5000|$|When {{a stator}} pole is energized, the rotor torque {{is in the}} {{direction}} that will reduce reluctance. Thus the nearest rotor pole is pulled from the unaligned position into alignment with the stator field (a position of less reluctance). (This is the same effect used by a solenoid, or when picking up ferromagnetic metal with a magnet.) In order to sustain rotation, the stator field must rotate {{in advance of the}} rotor poles, thus constantly [...] "pulling" [...] the rotor along. Some motor variants will run on 3-phase AC power (see the synchronous reluctance variant below). Most modern designs are of the switched reluctance type, because electronic commutation gives significant control advantages for motor <b>starting,</b> <b>speed</b> control, and smooth operation (low torque ripple).|$|E

50|$|Jet fuel {{starters}} use a {{free power}} turbine section, but {{the method of}} connecting it to the engine depends on the aircraft design. In single-engine aircraft such as the A-7 Corsair II and F-16 Fighting Falcon, the JFS power section is always connected to the main engine through the engine's accessory gearbox. In contrast, the twin-engine F-15 Eagle features a single JFS, and the JFS power section is connected through a central gearbox which can be engaged to one engine at a time. On the F-15, the jet fuel starter (JFS) is mated with a central gearbox (CGB). The CGB has extendable pawl shafts that extend out to reach the aircraft mounted accessory drive (AMAD) mounted {{in front of each}} engine. The AMAD is connected to the jet engine by the power takeoff (PTO) shaft. As the engine accelerates to <b>starting</b> <b>speed,</b> the PTO shaft becomes the method to drive the AMAD during flight. Once the aircraft engine has started and begins driving the AMAD, the pawl shaft on the CGB returns to its retracted position and the JFS is shut down.|$|E
50|$|Contestants {{can answer}} a {{question}} {{as many times as}} they wish, and are not able {{to move on to the}} next question until it is answered correctly or the contestant chooses to pass. Every time a question is passed, the belt gets faster. In addition, the <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> of the belt increases as the contestant advances to later rounds. If a contestant successfully completes a round by answering the requisite number of questions (see table below) before the cash prize falls off the belt, the contestant wins the cash plus any prizes still on the belt. If the contestant successfully completes round 3, he or she is guaranteed $25,000 in cash, but prizes are always at risk. After each round, the contestant is given the choice of quitting and keeping the cash and prizes won, or risking it to continue to the next round. If the cash prize falls, the contestant loses and the game is over. In addition to losing any prizes won, the contestant is also dropped from the building (wearing a safety harness that stops their fall shortly before impact). In the final round, worth $1 million, the contestant is placed on the belt with the money and must correctly answer all the questions before falling off the edge.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to compare the {{indicators}} of <b>starting</b> <b>speed,</b> anaerobic endurance and power in {{women as well as}} men, and to investigate whether the values of these indicators differ in women during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The studied group included 16 men and 16 women. The subjects performed the 20 -second maximal cycling sprint test. The men performed the test twice at 14 -day intervals. The women undertook the test 4 times: twice during the middle of follicular phase and twice in the middle of luteal phase in separate menstrual cycles. Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle do not influence anaerobic performance, <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> or anaerobic endurance in women. Anaerobic performance in men is higher than in women with similar aerobic performance expressed as VO 2 max/LBM (lean body mass). A lower power decrease with time was noted for women than men, with a similar time of maintaining power in both groups. This is evidence of women’s better anaerobic endurance compared to men. At the same time, the men had significantly better <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> rates than women...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of eccentric exercise on anaerobic power, <b>starting</b> <b>speed</b> and anaerobic endurance. The participants performed the maximum cycling sprint test (MCST) prior to eccentric exercise (ECC), 10 minutes after, as well as one hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and one week after ECC. The peak and mean power, time to attain peak power, time of maintaining peak power and power decrease were measured in the MCST. Before and after ECC, the myoglobin concentration (Mb) in the blood plasma was measured. After ECC, a significant (p<. 05) increase in Mb was observed. A significant (p<. 05) decrease was noted in peak (-. 92 ± 0. 42 W. kg- 1) as well as in mean power (-. 57 ± 0. 36 W. kg- 1) immediately after ECC.
