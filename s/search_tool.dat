The aim {{of this study is to}} illuminate the library staff's negative experiences of the <b>search</b> <b>tools,</b> and to present a basis for future discussion and development. To our help we have used a quantitative survey which were sent to library staff that used one of the two largest integrated library systems in Sweden, BOOK-IT and Mikromarc. The questions regarded the library staff's perception of a number of features in the <b>search</b> <b>tools.</b> The results showed that in general, the overall impression of the catalogue <b>search</b> <b>tools</b> were positive, even though dissatisfaction with specific features could be observed, e. g. the system's way of handling misspellings and the ability to search the catalogue when the system is offline. This study can be seen as a small step on the way to better <b>search</b> <b>tools</b> in the library catalogue, giving the library staff better and more effective ways of providing service to the library users. ...|$|R

A variety of queries {{can be used}} for searching: an ss number ID, a refSNP number ID, a gene name, an {{experimental}} method, a population class, a population detail, a publication, a marker, an allele, a chromosome, a base position, a heterozygosity range, a build number, or a strain. In addition, many results can be retrieved simultaneously using batch queries. Searches return refSNP number IDs that match the query term and a summary of the available information for that refSNP cluster.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial tmRNA genes were {{initially}} recognized as short sequences that are conserved among jakobids {{and that have}} the potential to fold into a distinct tRNA-like secondary structure. With the availability of nine complete jakobid mtDNA sequences, and a significantly improved covariance <b>search</b> <b>tool</b> (Infernal;), a covariance model has been developed based on jakobid mitochondrial tmRNAs, which identified mitochondrial ssrA genes also in oomycete. At present, a total of 34 oomycete mt-tmRNAs have been detected across six genera: Albugo, Bremia, Phytophthora, Pseudoperonospora, Pythium and Saprolegnia. A covariance model built with both jakobid and oomycete sequences is now available at Rfam under the name ‘mt-tmRNA’.|$|E

Accepting {{the idea that}} different <b>search</b> <b>tools</b> do use different ranking algorithms, the present research aims to confirm such an idea using a statistical approach. To do this, five metasearch engines (MSEs) namely Ez 2 find, Dogpile, MetaCrawler, Info and WebCrawler along with their four common underlying single search engines (SEs) – Google, Yahoo!, Msn (currently called Windows Live Search) and Ask – have been applied. To conduct the research five queries have been utilized. For comparing ranking algorithms of these web <b>search</b> <b>tools,</b> statistical tests "Kruskal-Wallis " and "Tukey HSD " were utilized.

It sold this stake in April 2008 and has entered into an agreement with Network 18 to launch the Financial Times in India, though it is speculated that they may find it difficult to do so, as the brand 'Financial Times' in India is owned by The Times Group, the publisher of The Times of India and The Economic Times.

40|$|The {{research}} set {{out with}} the broad objective of developing new tools to support Web information searching. A survey showed that {{a substantial number of}} interactive <b>search</b> <b>tools</b> were being developed but little work on how these new developments fitted into the general aim of helping people find information. Due to this it proved difficult to compare and analyse how tools help and affect users and where they belong in a general scheme of information <b>search</b> <b>tools.</b> A key reason for a lack of better information <b>searching</b> <b>tools</b> was identified in the ill-suited nature of existing information retrieval system models. The traditional information retrieval model is extended by synthesising work in information retrieval and information seeking research. The purpose of this new holistic search model is to assist information system practitioners in identifying, hypothesising, designing and evaluating Web information <b>searching</b> <b>tools.</b> Using the model, a term relevance feedback tool called ‘Tag and Keyword’ (TKy) was developed in a Web browser and it was hypothesised that it could improve query reformulation and reduce unnecessary browsing. The tool was laboratory experimented and quantitative analysis showed statistical significances in increased query reformulations and in reduced Web browsing (per query). Subjects were interviewed after the experiment and qualitative analysis revealed that they found the tool useful and saved time. Interestingly, exploratory analysis on collected data identified three different methods in which subjects had utilised the TKy tool. The research developed a holistic search model for Web searching and demonstrated that {{it can be used to}} hypothesise, design and evaluate information <b>searching</b> <b>tools.</b> Information system practitioners using it can better understand the context in which their <b>search</b> <b>tools</b> are developed and how these relate to users’ search processes and other <b>search</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R
