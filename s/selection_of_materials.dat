25|$|The {{design of}} any {{optically}} transparent device requires the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The Lattice absorption characteristics observed {{at the lower}} frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared wavelength range) define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They {{are the result of}} the interactive coupling between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent atoms and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident light wave radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (>10µm).|$|E
2500|$|Other than smart {{structural}} design, one of {{the major}} components of display and storage housing is proper <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and collaboration with a mount maker in the creation of suitable display and storage mounts. [...] Especially for long-term solutions, the materials that surround an object must not interfere negatively with the materials that compose the object. [...] Experimentation using Oddy tests is a qualitative way to determine whether specific materials undergo deleterious chemical reactions in the presence of one another.|$|E

2500|$|While all current Bahá'í Houses of Worship have a dome, {{they are}} not {{regarded}} as {{an essential part of}} their architecture. [...] Bahá'í scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images may be displayed within the House of Worship and no pulpits or altars incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lecture stands). To date all the Houses of Worship built or planned have a single, undivided room under their dome. Furthermore, in all seven, the seats in the auditorium face the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh in 'Akká, Israel. While each of the Houses of Worship is unique, the designs, through the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> landscaping and architecture, reflect the indigenous cultural, social and environmental elements of their location, {{to a greater or lesser}} degree.|$|E
2500|$|Research in the {{microwave}} range continues with split-ring resonators and conducting wires. Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 terahertz [...] issues arise which make using the split ring resonator problematic. [...] "Alternative materials become more suitable for the terahertz and optical regimes." [...] At these wavelengths <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, {{the far end of}} the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor metamaterials in {{the microwave}} regime. Hence, the challenges are to fabricate metamaterials so that they [...] "refract light at ever-smaller wavelengths" [...] and to develop broad band capabilities.|$|E
