5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan would now attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E

50|$|Peter Ambuofa was uneducated and had <b>some</b> <b>confusions</b> {{regarding}} Christian teaching, so he solicited {{help from}} the Queensland Kanaka Mission to help teach his flock, and in response, in 1904, Florence Young led the first party of missionaries to the Solomon Islands in 1904.

5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> {{as to who}} {{actually}} produced The Velvet Underground & Nico.

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} {{of several of}} the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> in the breed’s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E

50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>confusions</b> {{may occur}} {{when using the}} term Belokrinitskoe soglasie in respect to a schism of Okruzhniki and Neokruzhniki. From one point of view, {{both sides of a}} schism {{originated}} from the Rogozhskoe cemetery administrative system and so both belong to the Belokrinitskoe soglasie. From the other side, the Rogozhskoe cemetery priests and authorities were Okruzhniki almost entirely, so the term Belokrinitskoe soglasie can sometimes mean Okruzhniki.|$|R

5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} <b>some</b> <b>confusion.</b> As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to believe they were faced with a far greater force.

5|$|There is <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> {{over the}} number and name of ships {{that were part of}} the Reşadiye class. Some sources report Reşadiye and Mehmed Reşad V as having been {{different}} ships; these were in fact the same vessel, ordered originally under the latter name. Similarly, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is sometimes listed as Fatik or Fatih. Another ship, Reshad-i Hammiss, is sometimes reported to have been ordered in 1911 and cancelled in 1912, though according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet Güleryüz in their authoritative The Ottoman Steam Navy, the Ottomans initially only had ordered one vessel.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{constitution}} of 1988 {{called for a}} general vote on {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, which was held in 1993. The royalists went to the polls divided, with the press indicating there were actually two princes aspiring to the Brazilian throne (Dom Luiz de Orleans e Bragança and Dom João Henrique); this created <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> among the voters. Voting tickets further divided the electorate by placing one box for a presidential republic on the ballot and four for a monarchy. Additional anti-monarchial sentiment was generated by several aggressive television commercials claiming that a vote for monarchy would be a vote for the return of slavery for blacks and a loss of Brazil's recent return to democracy after decades of military dictatorship. This result was a loss for the monarchists at the polls.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Lives {{constitute}} {{the first two}} volumes of Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. The poet, journalist, and literary historian James Montgomery contributed the biographies of Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of Galileo. Mary Shelley contributed the rest: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo de'Medici, Marsiglio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, Luigi Pulci, Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Monti, and Ugo Foscolo. Although there has been <b>some</b> <b>confusion</b> regarding the attribution of these biographies, the Livess recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship {{of all of these}} and granted Montgomery and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.|$|E
5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused <b>some</b> <b>confusion.</b> British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three in the same order. However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E

More recent DNA studies have shown that this species, and other species in the genus Atherinomorus, are actually made up of a number of cryptic species and that the populations identified as A. lacunosus in the Red Sea and Mediterranean may represent three such species.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E
