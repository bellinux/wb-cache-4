5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E

They saw only the headlines about the lawsuit against the family who had lost a son. Before the case went to trial, she adds, her insurance company filed for bankruptcy. Her record and ticket sales fell off “in a big way,” Mandrell says.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through {{in the setting of}} her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread {{that she was going to}} do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> over five {{interviews}} before she got the part. Watson took her audition seriously, but [...] "never really thought [...] had any chance of getting the role." [...] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.|$|E

She was granted housemate status when she allowed Rodrigo to shave her eyebrows and draw a moustache and glasses with permanent marker on her face. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{this every day}} until further notice. On Day 58, Noirin was evicted from the Big Brother house with 60.0% of the public vote.

500|$|When Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy) heard <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a strip {{scene in}} the episode, she called actress Sheila Kelley, wife of Richard Schiff (with whom Edelstein had worked {{previously}} on The West Wing and Relativity). Kelley had worked on a movie about strippers long ago and Edelstein asked her for her advice on the choreography of the striptease. On the episode itself, Edelstein commented: [...] "It is very interesting {{what happens in the}} first half of the finale in terms of learning about how House sees people and getting the world from his point of view entirely". Before the filming of the scene started, Edelstein showed the dance to Hugh Laurie, who, according to Edelstein, was [...] "incredibly supportive, like a cheerleader". Edelstein commented that after the scene was filmed she, [...] "felt beautiful, and it ended up being a really lovely experience".|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the {{chemistry}} between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively {{focused on her}} nationality {{as well as the}} inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, [...] "find the right actor…and [...] is undoubtedly brilliant." [...] Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to [...] "sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been a different person, [...] "not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different".|$|E
500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what she thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E

500|$|After the momentous {{victory in}} the Battle of Stalingrad the Soviet troops {{proceeded}} to nationwide counter-offensives and Shanina on 2 April 1944 joined the 184th Rifle Division, where a separate female sniper platoon had been formed. Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran up saying, [...] "That was a fascist you finished off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions. She wrote that if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.|$|E

Pinker discovers his child is actually Trevor, {{who has been}} living with Jackie {{for the past several}} years as her child. Pinker attempts to kidnap Trevor, but is confronted by Mulder, who is armed with a shotgun loaded with rubber bullets. Pinker manages to evade Mulder and continues to chase after Trevor and Scully, whom he quickly corners. Scully, using Mulder's glass insulator hypothesis, locks herself inside a telephone booth with Trevor. [...] After failing to break into the telephone booth, Pinker sees his son trembling before him. Realizing that he does not want to scare his son anymore, Pinker decides to walk away. However, June appears and hits Pinker with her car; he passes through the metal components of the car, but not its glass windshield, and is cut in half as a result, killing him instantly. Mulder goes to June, who says <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it or else Pinker would have hurt Trevor. She then asks what he [...] wanted, to which Mulder replies [...] "Maybe another chance", causing June to cry.|$|E
500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears {{with the help of}} Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{and historians}} hold various {{opinions}} {{as to how}} deep Anne's commitment to the Reformation was, how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Henry's defiance of papal power. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford, that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's [...] "The Obedience of a Christian Man" [...] or one by Simon Fish called [...] "Supplication for Beggars," [...] which cried out to monarchs {{to rein in the}} evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, [...] "Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety” and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for “having 'idle poesies' written in her prayer book.” If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France. Further, the most recent edition of Ives's biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on, not just as catalyst but expediter for Henry's Reformation, though the process took a number of years.|$|E
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{a lot of research}} before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E
