2500|$|Sheldrake's The Sense of Being Stared At was {{published}} in 2003. The book explores telepathy, precognition, and the [...] "psychic staring effect". It reported on an experiment Sheldrake conducted where blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons were <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> or at another target. Sheldrake reported subjects exhibiting a weak sense of being stared at, but no sense of not being stared at, and attributed the results to morphic resonance. Sheldrake reported a hit rate of 53.1%, describing two subjects as [...] "nearly always right, scoring way above chance levels".|$|E
2500|$|She {{also was}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{effective}} chroniclers" [...] of the violence that erupted at the independence and partition of India and Pakistan, according to Somini Sengupta, who calls her photographs of the episode [...] "gut-wrenching, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> you glimpse the photographer's undaunted desire to stare down horror." [...] She recorded streets littered with corpses, dead victims with open eyes, and refugees with vacant eyes. [...] "Bourke-White's photographs seem to scream on the page," [...] Sengupta wrote. The photographs were taken just two years after those Bourke-White took of the newly captured Buchenwald.|$|E
2500|$|Just after 3pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, {{police were}} called to North Cronulla Beach {{following}} a report of an assault on two off-duty surf lifesavers by four {{members of a group}} of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now fuck off and leave our beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I come down here out of my own spare time to save you dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E

"Job Brown rubbed ’is eyes again, {{and then}} ’e drew hisself up to ’is full height, and putting one ’and {{on the chest}} o’ drawers to steady hisself stood there <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>’em</b> and getting madder and madder every second. Then ’e gave a nasty cough, and Dick and Mrs. Weed an’ the baby all woke up and stared at ’im as though they could ’ardly believe their eyesight.|$|R
6000|$|The {{man named}} Erickson started to answer, {{but at that}} moment there was a stir. A thin man of about thirty had come up to the table, his eyes bright, <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>them</b> warmly. [...] "Well, we're on our way," [...] he said to Erickson.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Worth Saint Chrysostom's seven years' nakedness on all-fours! And so I {{told the}} fellow, who by some cunning {{calculations}} about wind, and sun, and so forth, which he imparted to my uncomprehending ears, brought me suddenly {{to the top}} of a little crag, below which, some hundred yards off, the whole herd stood, stags, hinds--but I can't describe them. I have not brought away a scrap of sketch, though we watched them full ten minutes undiscovered; and then the stare, and the toss of those antlers, and the rush! That broke the spell with me; for I had been <b>staring</b> stupidly <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> trying in vain to take in the sight, with the strangest new excitement heaving and boiling up in my throat; and at the sound of their hoofs on the turf I woke, and found the keeper <b>staring,</b> not <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but <b>at</b> me, who, I verily believe, had something very like a tear in these excitable eyes of mine.' ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Catherine the Great (1762–96), {{children}} are at play in St. Petersburg's Summer Garden pretending to be soldiers. Two officers — Tsurin and Chekalinsky — enter, the former complaining about his bad luck at gambling. They remark that another officer, Herman, seems obsessed with the gaming table but never bets, being frugal and methodical. Herman appears with Tomsky, who remarks that his friend hardly seems like his old self: is anything bothering him? Herman admits he {{is in love with}} a girl above his station whose name he does not even know. When Prince Yeletsky, an officer, strolls into the park, Chekalinsky congratulates him on his recent engagement. Yeletsky declares his happiness while Herman, aside, curses him enviously. Yeletsky points out his fiancée, Liza, who has just appeared with her grandmother, the old Countess. Catching sight of Herman, the two women note they have seen him before, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with frightening intensity. Herman realizes that Liza is his unknown beloved. When Yeletsky and the women leave, Herman is lost in thought as the other officers discuss the Countess: known as the Queen of Spades and formerly as the Muskovite Venus, due to her beauty, she succeeded at gambling in her youth by trading amorous favors for the winning formula of Count St. Germain in Paris. Tomsky says only two men, her husband and, later on, her young lover, ever learned her secret, because she was warned by an apparition to beware a [...] "third suitor" [...] who would try to force it from her. Musing on the winning sequence of three cards, the others lightly suggest that such a combination would solve Herman's problems. Threatened by approaching thunder, all leave except Herman, who vows to learn the Countess' secret.|$|E
2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, {{and you can hear}} people in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping her fingers and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case. She was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and an $8,600 fine.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{three are}} the ones the Leiter was after," [...] Thacher said softly. [...] "You are the destroyers, the saboteurs. But their lie detector-- Why didn't it trap you? How did you get by that? And now you're safe, outside the check-station." [...] He grinned, <b>staring</b> around <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "I'll be damned! And I really {{thought you were a}} salesman, Erickson. You really fooled me." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Hall is four storeys {{high and}} {{consists}} of a large hall {{on the second floor}} with an infamous portrait of Burdett whose eyes Foremarke teachers and students claim 'seem to be <b>staring</b> directly <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in whatever angle'. After the manor house was rendered part of Repton Prep School a store room was built halfway in between the 1st and 2nd floor above the headmaster's offices to house instruments.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they finally}} open the door, {{they see the}} {{children}} <b>staring</b> back <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> They are in a practically empty room, with the children, a table, dolls that resemble some of the black-cloaked coven members and a music box. The children continue {{to stare at the}} people and the camera slowly pans to an empty, black hole in a corner. The screen goes dark, and bright pink gothic words show up, saying, [...] "Come in, children." ...|$|R
60|$|There, indeed, was Trixton Brent, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{from the}} end of the hall, and making no attempt to {{approach}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{resist the}} sorcerer, {{you will be}} turned into {{grasshoppers}} and June-bugs," [...] declared the man, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well!' {{resumed their}} new friend, after <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> intently {{during the whole}} {{interval}} of silence; 'how's the unnat'ral old parent by this time?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, dear, you haven't far to {{look for}} as nice a little heathen as you'd wish;" [...] and Mrs. Pecq glanced at Boo, who {{sat on the floor}} <b>staring</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{attracted}} by the dread word [...] "crocodile." [...] He had a cold and no handkerchief, his little hands were red with chilblains, his clothes shabby, he had untidy darns in the knees of his stockings, and a head of tight curls that evidently had not been combed for some time.|$|R
5000|$|A pencil sketch {{illustrating}} the line [...] "three Puddle-ducks stopped {{and stood in}} a row, <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> the kittens" [...] depicted the duck on the right facing the other two ducks, apparently in conversation. However when Potter copied her sketch for the book picture she inadvertently turned the duck's head to the right (like the other two ducks) with all three now facing the same direction. Although the kittens are not shown in the picture, the ducks now have {{their backs to the}} kittens sitting on the wall and cannot be <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as the line indicates [...] - [...] but only those who are familiar with Sawrey would realize this.|$|R
60|$|The {{strange thing}} was that they paid not the {{slightest}} attention to me, and pulling up my pony I sat <b>staring</b> in astonishment <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> particularly <b>at</b> one, a very big one and nearest to me, engaged in leisurely pecking at the clover plants growing among the big prickly thistle leaves, and as it seemed carefully selecting the best sprays.|$|R
60|$|Then, still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{as though}} they held his eyes in their hearts, Rames departed, and the captain led them to their lodging.|$|E
60|$|He arose {{and took}} the child's hand. The old woman sat <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in silence, but with an evil glint in her glistening eyes.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the party had {{approached}} within easy talking distance of {{the men at the}} cabin, who were <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in dumb amazement. Pat chuckled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you think}} I did after he'd gone? I went and played a piece on the piano,--and I never can bear to hear that ragtime to this day. I couldn't seem to feel anything. And after a while I got up and opened the envelope--it was full of crackly new hundred dollar bills--thirty of 'em, and as I sat there <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em</b> the pain came on, like a toothache, in throbs, getting worse all the time until I just couldn't stand it. I had a notion of sending the money back even then, but I didn't. I didn't know how to do it,--and as I told you, I wasn't able to care much. Then I remembered I'd promised to go away, and I had to have some money for that, and if I didn't leave right off I wouldn't have the {{strength}} to do it. I hadn't even thought where to go: I couldn't think, so I got dressed and went down to the depot anyway. It was one of those bright, bitter cold winter days after a thaw when the icicles are hanging everywhere. I went inside and walked up and down that long platform under the glass roof. My, it was cold in there! I looked over all the signs, and made up my mind I'd go to Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Seminar", Stanley {{is one of}} the {{speakers}} at Andy's seminar on starting a small business, but pulls out along with Phyllis and Dwight. Later, Dwight reveals that he talked to one of the attendees, a man who owns a golf supply business, and that this could actually be a good opportunity for the sales team. Stanley, Dwight and Phyllis then try to rejoin Andy, who refuses at Darryl's prompting. In a deleted scene, he tells the camera is that he makes his sales by meeting with a client, giving his pitch, and then <b>staring</b> intensely <b>at</b> <b>them</b> until they buy something.|$|R
50|$|Back in New Rochelle, Mother and Edgar {{wait for}} the trolley to New York City and meet Tateh and the Little Girl, who are heading to Boston. To {{set an example for}} her son, who is <b>staring</b> rudely <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> Mother surprises Tateh by {{engaging}} him in polite conversation (“Nothing Like the City”). On his way to find Sarah in New Rochelle, Coalhouse encounters a volunteer fire squad, led by chief Will Conklin, who react with hostility to the sight of a black man driving his own car. Meanwhile, Sarah sings to her son in the attic of their new home (“Your Daddy's Son”), attempting to explain how her heartbreak, fear and despair led her to make such a terrible decision.|$|R

Sam loathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities the poor creature. Gollum promises by the Ring (his [...] "Precious")to lead the pair to the Black Gate of Mordor, and for a time appears to be like his old self Sméagol. He leads them through a hidden passage of the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Frodo and Sam learn that the Dead Marshes were once part of an ancient battlefield, upon which the War of the Last Alliance was fought. [...] They see many dead faces of ancient warriors and orcs <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|She stood, and looked. And all the leapings and pulsings {{of flesh}} and spirit slowly died in that wide dark loneliness, where {{the only sound was}} the wistful {{breaking}} of small waves. She was well used to these dead hours--only last night, at this very time, Harbinger's arm had been round her in a last waltz! But here the dead hours had such different faces, wide-eyed, solemn, and there came to Barbara, <b>staring</b> out <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> a sense that the darkness saw her very soul, so that it felt little and timid within her. She shivered in her fur-lined coat, as if almost frightened at finding herself so marvellously nothing before that black sky and dark sea, which seemed all one, relentlessly great.... And crouching down, she waited for the dawn to break.|$|R
60|$|They {{were not}} far away, but too {{taken up with}} each other to see me. She was walking slowly, with the little petulant cock of her dainty head which I knew so well, casting her eyes away from him, and {{shooting}} out a word from time to time. He paced along beside her, looking down at her and bending his head in the eagerness of his talk. Then as he said something, she placed her hand with a caress upon his arm, and he, carried off his feet, plucked her up and kissed her again and again. At the sight I could neither cry out nor move, but stood, with a heart of lead and the face of a dead man, <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> I saw her hand passed over his shoulder, and that his kisses were as welcome to her as ever mine had been.|$|R
60|$|They looked, {{and saw a}} {{sight that}} froze their blood, for there <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> through the glass was the dark face of the Abbot, and with it other faces.|$|E

60|$|For a {{while the}} ever-gathering crowd of their assailants {{remained}} still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> Then the leaders began to whisper to each other, for they scarcely seemed to dare to talk aloud.|$|E
60|$|The two comrades did {{not dare}} to do any work during the day, for fear they should be {{surprised}} by the jailer, or observed from without. No one came near them, but they ate their loaves and drank their water with the appetite of men who had often known {{what it was to}} be without even such simple food as that. The instant that night fell they were both up upon the pegs, grinding away at the hard stone and tugging at the bars. It was a rainy night, and there was a sharp thunder-storm, but they could see very well, while the shadow of the arched window prevented their being seen. Before midnight they had loosened one bar, and the other was just beginning to give, when some slight noise made them turn their heads, and there was their jailer standing, open-mouthed {{in the middle of the}} cell, <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|The whole {{audience}} was <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him. He {{did not dare}} peep <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but he could hear their murmur of amazement. Now that he was up he rather enjoyed defying them.|$|R
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are <b>staring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|R
