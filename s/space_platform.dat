2500|$|Most of {{the early}} {{concepts}} envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed {{in an era when}} the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future <b>space</b> <b>platform</b> or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively [...] "dirty" [...] vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983 NASA was considering the [...] "possibility of a long duration [...] SIRTF mission".|$|E

50|$|Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) is the coordinated and {{integrated}} acquisition, processing and provision of timely, accurate, relevant, coherent and assured {{information and intelligence}} to support commanderâ€™s conduct of activities.

40|$|Modern radar techniques, and in {{particular}} ground based radars, are a powerful tool to observe space objects (natural meteoroids and artificial space debris) on account of their all-weather and day-and-night performance. Natural meteoroids are {{an important component of}} the near-Earth space environment and represent a potential risk for all Earth-orbiting <b>space</b> <b>platforms,</b> which could significantly increase in coincidence of enhanced (outburst or storm) activity of meteoroid streams. A review of the currently active meteoroid streams suggests that a few streams have shown a quasi-periodic outburst activity in the two last centuries and may even undergo a storm activity in the next few years. The Leonids, the most intense of meteor showers, present a potentially serious damage to spacecraft in November of 1998 and 1999, after the perihelion passage of the parent body. Impact probability values of storm meteoroids on <b>space</b> <b>platforms</b> in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) were calculated using the data recorded during systematic observational campaigns carried out by the FS radar facility Bologna-Lecce in Italy. Meteoroid flux predictions and directionality, and investigation on impact parameters at very high velocities (up to 71 km/s) for penetration, charge production and plasma generation, are relevant aspects to develop strategies for safe deployment of the near Earrth-orbiting <b>space</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
