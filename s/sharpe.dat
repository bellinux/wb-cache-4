5|$|Milne {{has been}} {{described}} as Ferguson's and even as Manchester United's worst signing, despite his low transfer fee. Ferguson defended the signing by pointing out Milne's contribution to the development of Lee <b>Sharpe,</b> who was playing left-back at the time. Ferguson remarked that Milne helped <b>Sharpe</b> by both dropping back to protect <b>Sharpe</b> and by giving him positional advice. Milne remained on United's payroll until 30 June 1991, when he was released.|$|E

5|$|Edmund <b>Sharpe</b> {{started his}} {{practice}} {{at the end of}} 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 <b>Sharpe</b> took a house in StLeonard's Gate large enough to accommodate himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1845 <b>Sharpe</b> made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, John Douglas joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed with the firm until about 1859, when he moved to Chester to establish his own practice. <b>Sharpe</b> retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth took 4/92 in South Australia's first innings but was no-balled a {{total of}} three times by Egar and Ryan.
