25|$|For greater {{realism and}} better {{comprehension}} of the 3D structure of a molecule many computer graphics algorithms can be used. For many years molecular graphics has stressed the capabilities of graphics hardware and has required hardware-specific approaches. With the increasing power of machines on the desktop, portability is more important and programs such as Jmol have advanced algorithms that do not rely on hardware. On the other hand, recent graphics hardware is able to interactively render very complex molecule shapes with a quality {{that would not be}} possible with <b>standard</b> <b>software</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Btrieve was modularized {{starting}} with version 6.15 {{and became one}} of two database front-ends that plugged into a <b>standard</b> <b>software</b> interface called the Micro-Kernel Database Engine. The Btrieve front-end supported the Btrieve API and the other front-end was called Scalable SQL, a relational database product based upon the MKDE that used its own variety of Structured Query Language, otherwise known as SQL. After these versions were released (Btrieve 6.15 and ScalableSQL v4) the company was renamed to Pervasive Software prior to their IPO. Shortly thereafter the Btrieve and ScalableSQL products were combined into the products now known and sold as Pervasive.SQL or PSQL. Btrieve continued for a few years while ScalableSQL was quickly dropped. Customers were encouraged to upgrade to Pervasive.SQL which supported both SQL and Btrieve applications.|$|E

However, substantial work remains to create accurate, comprehensive models of complex cells. Methods: We organized the 2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School to teach WC modeling {{and evaluate the}} need for new WC modeling <b>standards</b> and <b>software</b> by recoding a recently published WC model in SBML. Results: Our analysis revealed several challenges to representing WC models using the current standards. Conclusion: We, therefore, propose several new WC modeling <b>standards,</b> <b>software,</b> and databases.
