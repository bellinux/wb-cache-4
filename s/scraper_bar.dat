50|$|For {{use as a}} stone {{lithography}} press, {{standard size}} wooden scraper bars replace the upper roller. The scraper, in its holder, is suspended from a central adjustment screw which allows it {{to conform to the}} surface of the stone. Metal plate lithographs may be printed with the <b>scraper</b> <b>bar</b> or the printing roll.|$|E
50|$|The {{flexibility}} of the Dickerson Press allows numerous approaches not possible with other machines. When using the top roller, the user can adjust {{it so that the}} thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or <b>scraper</b> <b>bar</b> in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive pressure adjustment allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays. Reliefs can be printed either face up or face down, to provide perfect color registry.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear rolls were usually fitted with <b>scraper</b> <b>bars.</b> As the vehicle moved along, these removed any surface {{material}} that had become stuck to the roll, to prevent a build-up of material and ensure a flat finish was maintained.|$|R
40|$|Natural ground {{generally}} {{consists of}} various types of soils and each soil independently reacts with cementing materials. In order to realize uniform and stable soil ground improvement, it is preferable that the excavated soils are vertically mixed together as a whole. Chain Conveyor Cutter (CCC) is like a chain conveyor but is installed vertically on a pile driver, sunk into and is raised up from the ground. An 180 kw water cooled electric motor rotates chain units and enables CCC to cut harder soils {{at the bottom of}} the machine discharging cement slurry. The soils and cement slurry are hauled up by the <b>scraper</b> <b>bars</b> of the chain units being mixed together on the way up to the ground surface, which consequently establishes stable improved ground...|$|R
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of <b>scraper</b> <b>bars</b> fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{shortage}} of labors in Taiwan's livestock farming is an apparent problem now. How to mechanize {{to help the}} daily works in the farm using limited labors becomes a very important issue. Meanwhile, cleaning and managing the livestock's waste take time and {{cost a lot of}} labors. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a scraping shovel with movable flanks to replace the traditional shovels attaching on the shovel loaders and it could be used in both livestock and poultry houses. Utilizing this scraper with a shovel loader on cleaning floors in either livestock or poultry houses is able to improve the percentages of cleaning floors as well as to save labors. The direction of this research starts with basic analysis in the prototype of a scraping shovel with movable flanks. To find the geometric relationship of a scraper with movable flanks is able to ensure the functioning of open and close when the size of scraper is increased. A commercially available program of finite element analysis method, ANSYS, was used to analyze the stresses that resulted from the changes of the structures associated with various loads. The load for the scraper with movable flanks was considered to be loaded as the same volume of a traditional shovel carried, 200 kg. The result confirmed the safety of this new scraper. When we increase the volume of the shovel <b>scraper</b> having three <b>bars</b> under the bottom plate, the load goes up to 300 kg. The safe design of plate components holds firmly as well as other components in the scraper with movable flanks. To scale up the model of scraper using the methods developed in the research, thus, is possible. 摘 要 目前臺灣畜牧工作人力短缺，能使用的人力資源有限，所以如何將工作機械化是很重要的課題，而現今處理畜禽舍的排泄物乃是一項既費時且耗費人力的工作。中興大學農機系開發一組改良式蛋雞舍適用之活動鏟斗雛型機，功能佳，但容量小，部份強度不足，因此本研究之目標為改良一套二段式活動鏟斗，替代人力並取代一般傳統的鏟斗，來從事畜禽舍的清潔，以提高清潔率及節省勞力為主要目標，且使用鏟裝車及二段式活動鏟斗，收集動物所產生的糞尿，可以減少直接用水沖洗畜禽舍所耗費寶貴的水資源。 本研究的方向是從二段式活動鏟斗的雛型斗之基礎分析著手，研究二段式鏟斗的幾何關係，得到改變鏟斗尺寸時，其兩臂為了保持正常開合之動作，兩臂製作前所需之步驟，以及使用有限元素法分析軟體ANSYS研究鏟斗負載時，所承受應力之變化。經設計分析結果顯示：當二段式活動鏟斗負載量以傳統工程用鏟斗容量為考量時，在承載量為 200 kg下，其分析結果是合乎安全標準，當鏟斗容量加大，負載達 300 kg時，在鏟斗下方支撐架增加至三支，其分析結果同樣達到安全標準，進而分析二段式活動鏟斗其餘重要部分，分析結果也都符合設計上之要求。依本研究之方法可以將此活動鏟斗尺寸放大，而兼顧運轉之平順性與結構之安全性。目 錄 中文摘要I 英文摘要II 目 錄III 圖目錄VI 表目錄IX 第一章 前言 1 1. 1 畜禽舍糞尿處理之簡介 1 1. 2 畜禽舍糞尿處理之方法 1 1. 3 研究項目 4 1. 4 研究目的 5 第二章 文獻探討 6 2. 1 牛舍清潔的探討 6 2. 1. 1 牛舍環境對牛隻之影響 6 2. 1. 2 牛糞尿之處理方式 7 2. 2 豬舍清潔的探討 8 2. 2. 1 豬舍環境對豬隻之影響 8 2. 2. 2 豬糞尿之處理方式 8 2. 3 雞舍清潔的探討 9 2. 3. 1 雞舍環境對雞隻之影響 9 2. 3. 2 雞糞之處理方式 10 2. 4 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對環境的污染 11 2. 4. 1 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對空氣品質的影響 11 2. 4. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對對水源的影響 12 2. 5 畜禽舍產生的糞尿與有機農業的關係 13 2. 5. 1 何謂有機農業 13 2. 5. 2 畜禽舍產生的糞尿對有機農業的影響 14 2. 6 有限元素法在農業力學方面的應用 17 第三章 實驗原理 19 3. 1 何謂有限元素法 19 3. 2 有限元素法的簡史 19 3. 3 有限元素法和有限差分法之比較 20 3. 4 有限元素法之基本學理 21 3. 5 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之源由 23 3. 6 電腦輔助分析軟體ANSYS之基本架構 24 3. 6. 1 元素、截面及材料的定義 24 3. 6. 2 建構幾何模型 25 3. 6. 3 分割網格 25 3. 6. 4 夾持及負載 25 3. 6. 5 分析 25 3. 6. 6 結果 26 第四章 實驗設備 27 4. 1 山貓牌鏟裝車 27 4. 2 二段式活動鏟斗之雛型斗 28 4. 3 電腦主機 29 4. 4 Working Model軟體 29 4. 5 Auto Cad軟體 30 4. 6 有限元素法軟體ANSYS 30 第五章 實驗步驟 31 5. 1 研究二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 31 5. 2 使用有限元素分析軟體ANSYS模擬受力狀況 31 5. 3 建構模組及其邊界條件之設定 32 5. 3. 1 底板模組及其邊界條件 32 5. 3. 2 前刮板模組及其邊界條件 35 5. 3. 3 前刮板及側擋板模組及其邊界條件 37 5. 3. 4 後機箱關節模組及其邊界條件 37 第六章 結果與討論 39 6. 1 二段式活動鏟斗之幾何關係 39 6. 1. 1 測出鏟斗開啟之軌跡 39 6. 1. 2 逆推滑槽型板元件鑿孔所需之不規則曲線 40 6. 1. 3 比對所得結果 42 6. 2 利用ANSYS分析二段式活動鏟斗之應力 44 6. 2. 1 建構鏟斗底板之模組 44 6. 2. 2 鏟斗底板分析結果 47 6. 2. 3 更改底板尺寸之分析 50 6. 2. 4 前刮板之分析 52 6. 2. 5 前刮板與側擋板組合分析 56 6. 2. 6 後機箱關節之分析 58 第七章 結論與建議 68 參考文獻 71 附錄 75 附錄 1 雞糞的平均密度 75 附錄 2 鏟斗前刮板前端點開合的 18 個點座標 76 附錄 3 二段式活動鏟斗零件圖 7...|$|R
