5|$|Labor {{conducted}} an extensive campaign in marginal LCL <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power. As Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, the youthful and charismatic Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining {{a much larger}} vote over the LCL, Labor lost two <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander {{and was able to}} convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E
50|$|Ciccarello first won <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Norwood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1997 election. She {{retained}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2002 and 2006 election, {{but lost}} <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2010 election to Liberal Party candidate Steven Marshall.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{previous}} mayoral vote, Labour {{had taken the}} majority of London votes and <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2015 General Election, despite the Conservative Party winning the vote nationally. Ten further candidates contested the election; of these the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) (8.1%), the Liberal Democrats (7.7%, 1 seat) and the Green Party (4.7%) {{had been the most}} popular parties in London at the 2015 election.|$|E

5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instigator}} for {{the creation}} of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform. The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council, yet at the 1973 state election Labor had, through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote, managed to gain two seats, giving a 14–6 split in the council. As half the council was elected at each election, Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two <b>seats</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1975 state election, and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them. It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it, and push through any electoral legislation it so wished.|$|E
