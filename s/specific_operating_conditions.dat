25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> including temperatures and thermal loads.

Power system stabilisers are used to enhance the damping of low frequency oscillations in the shaft speed of the generators used in a power system. The most widely used power system stabiliser is a lead-lag compensator known as a conventional power system stabiliser. The design of conventional power system stabilisers is based on linearised model of the power system for a <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> point.

It is well known that cavitation in torque converters occurs frequently when a car with an automatic transmission makes an abrupt start. Cavitation is closely related to a performance drop and noise generation at a <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> in a car and a torque converter itself. This study addressed the relation between cavitation and performance in an automotive torque converter in a quantitative and qualitative manner using numerical simulations. The cavitation was calculated at various <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> using a commercial flow solver with the homogeneous cavitation model, and the torque converter performance was compared with the experimental data. Numerical results well match to the data and indicate that the cavitation causes significant performance drop, as the pump speed increases or both speed ratio and reference pressure decrease...|$|R

40|$|The vortex blade-element theory {{modified}} {{to apply to}} an axial fan working in a duct is reviewed. Thrust and power coefficients for a fan are identified with the corresponding coefficients for airplane propellers. The relation of pressure produced by the fan to the blade-element coefficients is developed. The distribution of axial velocity of fluid through a fan {{is assumed to be}} controlled by the fan itself. The radial distribution of tangential velocity imported by the fan to fluid moving through the fan is shown to be independent of the axial-velocity distribution. A nondimensional coefficient, designated the rotation constant, is introduced. This constant is based solely upon design information. The use of the rotation constant in simplifying the design of a fan for a <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> is demonstrated. Based {{on the use of the}} rotation constant, a graphical method is outlined by which the performance of a given fan in a given wind tunnel may be predicted and by which the distributions of axial velocity of the fluid through the fan under various <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> may be established...|$|R

The effects of the ignition timing, air-fuel ratio, and mixture preparation on the engine heat flux and heat release have been investigated at a <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> An engine thermodynamic simulation code has been used to predict the gas-to-wall heat transfer using different heat transfer correlations.

When dry gases are fed into the fuel cell, the drying out effect of the polymer electrolyte is measured during the sweep process. The polarization curve of the fuel cell and time-dependent membrane resistance is shown. A hysteresis effect of the fuel cell polarization curve is found. The "threshold", defined as the match point of the forward and backward sweep current-voltage curve is introduced. In this paper, threshold indicates {{the status of the}} fuel cell membrane hydration. The transient behavior during load change is investigated when dry gases are fed into the fuel cell.

The theory developed by Ruden had produced results which found excellent confirmation in wind-tunnel tests {{and in spite of}} certain still-existing defects, are technically very promising. The reasons for the new theory of the diffuser forms indicated by Ruden are twofold: first, the arguments adduced in Ruden's theory deal only with one <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> that is, a certain ratio of mean velocity within the diffuser to flying speed, while in the present report any desired velocity ratios are involved; second, a different choice of parameters and the increased possibilities of variation result in diffuser forms which cannot be reconciled at once with Ruden's theory. The first enables a theoretical check of the measurements made with Ruden's diffusers at variable velocity ratio, the second permits the calculation of diffuser types which in many respects are superior to Ruden's diffusers...|$|R
40|$|Microelectronics {{integration}} density {{is limited by}} the reliability of the manufactured product at a desired circuit density. Design rules, operating voltage and maximum switching speeds are chosen to insure functional operation over the intended lifetime of the product. In order to determine the ultimate performance for a given set of design constraints, the reliability must be modeled for its <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> Thus, Reliability modeling for the purpose of lifetime prediction is the ultimate task of a failure physics evaluation. Unfortunately, all the industrial approaches to reliability evaluation fall short of predicting failure rates or wear-out lifetime of semiconductor products. This is attributed mainly to two reasons; the lack of a unified approach for predicting device failure rates and the fact that all commercial reliability evaluation methods rely on the acceleration of one, dominant, failure mechanism.

The components exhibit two different failure modes, namely early and wearout failures, and are mounted on different vehicles, which differ among themselves for car model and engine type, thus involving different <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Hence, the failure time of each component is a random variable with a bimodal pdf which also depends upon a vector of covariates that indexes the <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> Then, a mixed-Weibull distribution, where the pdf of each subpopulation (namely the â€˜weakâ€™ and â€˜strongâ€™ subpopulation) depends on the covariates through the scale parameter, is {{used to analyze the}} component lifetime. A Fortran algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters has been implemented and a stepwise procedure, in its backwards version, has been used to test the significance of covariates and to construct the regression model. The presence of a weak subpopulation has been verified and the fraction of weak units in the population has also been estimated.

40|$|The {{design of}} a gas turbine, or one of its {{constituent}} modules, is generally approached with some <b>specific</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> in mind (its design point). Unfortunately, engine components seldom exactly meet their specifications and do not operate at just one condition, but over a range of power settings. This simplification can then lead to a product that exhibits performance worse than nominal in real-world conditions. The integration of some consideration of robustness as an active part of the design process can allow products less sensitive {{to the presence of}} the noise factors commonly found in real-world environments to be obtained. To become routinely used as a design tool, minimization of the time required for robustness analysis is paramount.
