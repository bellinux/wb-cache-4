50|$|The Loch Promenade Construction Railway was a {{temporary}} railway on the Isle of Man which {{ran along the}} southerly end of the majestic promenade at Douglas {{as part of the}} extensive widening scheme that took place {{at the start of the}} twentieth century. Running to a broad gauge and carrying a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>crane</b> it assisted in the reclamation of land which now forms the outer walkway of the promenade.|$|E
50|$|Titan {{is a large}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>crane</b> vessel {{with the}} tip of its main boom {{standing}} at 374 ft above the typical water line and a lifting capacity of 385 ST. In 1957, it was claimed to be the largest floating crane in operation. Its rated capacity is 350 t at up to 114 ft from the center of rotation; the lift capacity drops to 50 t at 210 ft from center, and a single rotation about its pedestal takes 10 minutes.|$|E

The greatest number of defects associated with the destruction and dete-rioration of structural elements, the occurrence of fatigue cracks and {{a violation of the}} conditions of operation of the equipment. The greatest number of defects occurs in the hydraulic system of cranes, the rope-block system, and rarely in steel structures. To conduct risk analysis of <b>self-propelled</b> jib <b>cranes</b> in case of insufficient information, proposed the method of expert estimations. It allows {{to assess the impact of}} potential defects on <b>self-propelled</b> jib <b>cranes</b> on the value of the economic damage of the crane and moving cargo and the value of the traumatic exposure on men. The proposed list of possible defects <b>self-propelled</b> lifting jib <b>cranes</b> and a checklist of questions about the degree of influence of these defects.

5000|$|One of {{the large}} cranes at Long Beach NSY, YD-171, was nicknamed [...] "Herman the German" [...] based on its origin as a {{floating}} crane for the Kriegsmarine (one of four ships in the class). It is a large <b>self-propelled</b> <b>crane</b> standing 374 ft tall with a lifting capacity of 385 ST, and was {{claimed to be the}} largest floating crane in operation as of 1957. [...] "Herman the German" [...] was seized as a war prize following the end of World War II. [...] "Herman" [...] was dismantled and transported across the Atlantic through the Panama Canal to Long Beach, where it subsequently served at the Long Beach NSY from 1946 (following its reassembly) to 1996. While serving at Long Beach, it participated in the refurbishment of the battleships USS Missouri and New Jersey in the 1980s and lifted the Hughes H-4 ("Spruce Goose") from its original hangar in Long Beach when it was relocated to its geodesic dome from 1980 to 1982 for tourist display by the Wrather Corporation. Following the closure of the shipyard, the crane was sold to the Panama Canal Commission and was transported on the semi-submersible ship [...] "Sea Swan" [...] (IMO 8001000) to the Panama Canal Zone, where it currently serves as the floating crane [...] "Titan".|$|E

50|$|Posted minimum speeds {{usually only}} apply to {{specific}} lanes like the common configuration on 6-lane roads {{with a minimum}} speed of 110 km/h (68 mph) {{on the left and}} 90 km/h (56 mph) on the center lane. Vehicles which cannot sustain speeds of 60 km/h (37 mph) on the flat are not allowed on the Autobahn, however. Because of this, many European <b>self-propelled</b> <b>cranes</b> and other extra-heavy trucks which would be unsafe at much higher speeds, but similarly unsafe or impractical (and certainly obstructive) to drive for long distances on surface streets between job sites and depots, are engineered with maximum design speeds a little over 60 km/h - typically 62 km/h (39 mph) at governed engine speed in top gear.|$|R
50|$|Three cranes {{of various}} sizes are {{preserved}} at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California. They are all cranes once owned by the Western Pacific Railroad and two of them, a small, <b>self-propelled</b> Burro <b>Crane</b> and a large, 200-ton capacity Industrial Brownhoist crane, are maintained in operable condition.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, Seida {{received}} a license from the German firm Kässbohrer to build Setra chassisless coaches. These were equipped with Pegaso engines and other mechanical units and were marketed {{with a double}} badge as the Setra Seida S14 and the Pegaso 5070. Despite being expensive, these coaches were very successful in the Spanish market and competed well with Pegaso's own Monotrals and all other conventional chassis-body models. This was the main OEM business of Pegaso; others were selling engines for railcars and shunter locomotives and providing running units and cab components to Barazábal, a Vitoria-based maker of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>cranes.</b> Specially interesting in the railway OEM sector was the fitting in 1964 of Pegaso engines to five ex-New Haven Railroad Mack railcars operated in Asturias by Ferrocarril de Langreo.|$|R
50|$|The {{erection}} {{scheme for}} {{the bridge is}} a project in itself. Two pylons (about 130 m and 100 m high) were erected {{on either side of}} the river, and two auxiliary <b>self-propelled</b> cable <b>cranes</b> (capacity of 80t each) were used to tow temporary auxiliary ropes across these pylons. The ropes were used to support the partly finished arch parts. After arch completion, the trusses will be added, finally the girder will be constructed as a horizontal sliding type platform.|$|R
50|$|The Douglas Breakwater Crane Railway was {{a massive}} <b>self-propelled</b> steam <b>crane</b> that {{ran the length of}} the {{original}} breakwater at Douglas, for the loading and unloading of vessels. It was built by Cowans, Sheldon of Carlisle (capacity 25 tons; carried on two four-wheel bogies; Works number 9057 of 1948 to Drawing 18087). The crane was owned by the Isle of Man Harbour Board and ran on 10 ft gauge track, the broadest in the British Isles. It was in action until the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Production {{of diesel}} {{locomotives}} started in 1948. From the early 1960s the product range diversified into rolling stock (rail and tram) components. In 1977, the production profile expanded into construction equipment and its name was changed into Fabryka Maszyn Budowlanych i Lokomotyw BUMAR-FABLOK (Factory of Building Machinery and Locomotives BUMAR-FABLOK). The factory {{was taken over}} by Zjednoczenie Przemyslu Maszyn Budowlanych BUMAR (BUMAR Association of Building Machinery Industry) in Warsaw. Production included excavators with bucket capacity of 1.2 cubic metre, cranes with 25-28 ton lifting capacity, <b>self-propelled</b> road <b>cranes,</b> and hydraulic telescopic jibs.|$|R
50|$|Hikitia is {{a working}} <b>self-propelled</b> {{floating}} steam <b>crane</b> in Wellington, New Zealand. She {{is thought to}} be the only working steam crane of her type in the world.
