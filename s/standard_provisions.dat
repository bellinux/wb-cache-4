2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the expedition as directed by President Jefferson was to observe and record the whereabouts, lives, activities, and cultures of the various American Indian tribes that inhabited the newly acquired territory and the northwest in general. The expedition encountered many different tribes along the way, many of whom offered their assistance, providing the expedition with {{their knowledge of the}} wilderness and with the acquisition of food. Along with the <b>standard</b> <b>provisions</b> of weapons, powder, tools, and cooking utensils, the expedition also had blank leather-bound journals and ink for the purpose of recording such encounters, as well as for scientific and geological information. They were also provided with various gifts of medals, ribbons, needles, mirrors and other artifacts which were intended to ease any tensions when negotiating their passage with the various Indian chiefs they would encounter along their way. As many of the tribes had had previous friendly experiences with British and French fur traders in various isolated encounters along the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, the expedition subsequently did not encounter any hostilities {{with the exception of the}} Teton-Sioux tribe under Black Buffalo [...] and the Partisan tribe on September 25, 1804. Both of these tribes were rivals and hoped to use the expedition to their own advantage and who both demanded tribute from the expedition for their passage over the river at that particular juncture. Captain Lewis made his first mistake by offering the Sioux chief gifts first, which insulted and angered the Partisan chief. Communication was difficult since the expedition's only Sioux interpreter, Pierre Dorion, had stayed behind with the other party and was also involved with diplomatic affairs with another tribe. Consequently, both chiefs were offered a few gifts, but neither was satisfied. At that point, some of the warriors from the Partisan tribe then took hold of their boat and one of the oars. Lewis took a firm stand, ordering a display of force, presenting arms; Captain Clark, by gesture of brandishing his sword, threatened violent reprisal. Just before the situation erupted into a violent confrontation, Black Buffalo ordered his warriors to back off. After the ensuing diplomacy and with the aid of better gifts and now a bottle of whiskey, of which some was consumed, the captains were able to negotiate their passage through without further incident. During the next two days, the expedition made camp not far from Black Buffalo's tribe. When they attempted to leave, other similar incidents occurred, but they were averted with still more gifts, this time, of tobacco.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{universal}} jurisdiction {{is fundamental to}} the operation of global {{organizations such as the}} United Nations and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which jointly assert the benefit of maintaining legal entities with jurisdiction over a wide range of matters of significance to nations (the ICJ {{should not be confused with}} the ICC and this version of [...] "universal jurisdiction" [...] is not the same as that enacted in the War Crimes Law (Belgium) which is an assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction that will fail to gain implementation in any other state under the <b>standard</b> <b>provisions</b> of public policy). Under Article 34 Statute of the ICJ only nations may be parties in cases before the Court and, under Article 36, the jurisdiction comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force. But, to invoke the jurisdiction in any given case, all the parties have to accept the prospective judgment as binding. This reduces the risk of wasting the Court's time.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 March, {{the court}} heard from senior ANZ Bank {{executive}} Mr Ben Steinberg. He {{indicated that he}} had been informed about a $100m [...] "hole", but despite regarding the matter as extremely serious, he felt it could be rectified because Mr Murphy was [...] "able to obtain assistance from the Packers in receiving guarantees" [...] as had been revealed in earlier evidence. He also indicated that on the day following the execution of the agreement, Blumberg had called him in some distress to indicate that the shortfall was actually closer to $200m than $100m. The court was also told that the agreement included a change to the securities lending agreement between ANZ Bank and Opes Prime. This change applied to the [...] "close out" [...] provisions of the securities lending agreement that would apply {{in the event of a}} default. The <b>standard</b> <b>provisions</b> would have seen all shareholdings valued at market prices with the party with the higher value paying the other party the difference. This would have resulted in ANZ Bank owing Opes Prime the margins between their holdings of shares and the value of loans drawn by Opes Prime and its clients. Mr Steinberg indicated that this payment would have been some $240m. ANZ Bank would have then been left to dispose of the mostly small capitalisation securities on the market for what would likely have been a lower value. The provisions were instead changed to value the shares at the price which could be obtained for them on the market. The risk of loss on disposal was thereby transferred to Opes Prime and its clients.|$|E
50|$|This {{has become}} a more {{difficult}} area as states are not consistent {{on the nature of}} a partnership. Some states opt for the partnership as no more than an aggregate of the natural persons who have joined the firm. Others treat the partnership as a business entity and, like a corporation, vest the partnership with a separate legal personality. Hence, for example, in English law, a partner is the agent of the other partners whereas, in Scots law where there is a separate personality, a partner is the agent of the partnership. This form of agency is inherent in the status of a partner and does not arise out of a contract of agency with a principal. The English Partnership Act 1890 provides that a partner who acts within the scope of his actual authority (express or implied) will bind the partnership when he does anything in the ordinary course of carrying on partnership business. Even if that implied authority has been revoked or limited, the partner will have apparent authority unless the third party knows that the authority has been compromised. Hence, if the partnership wishes to limit any partner's authority, it must give express notice of the limitation to the world. However, there would be little substantive difference if English law was amended: partners will bind the partnership rather than their fellow partners individually. For these purposes, the knowledge of the partner acting will be imputed to the other partners or the firm if a separate personality. The other partners or the firm are the principal and third parties are entitled to assume that the principal has been informed of all relevant information. This causes problems when one partner acts fraudulently or negligently and causes loss to clients of the firm. In most states, a distinction is drawn between knowledge of the firm's general business activities and the confidential affairs as they affect one client. Thus, there is no imputation if the partner is acting against the interests of the firm as a fraud. There {{is more likely to be}} liability in tort if the partnership benefited by receiving fee income for the work negligently performed, even if only as an aspect of the <b>standard</b> <b>provisions</b> of vicarious liability. Whether the injured party wishes to sue the partnership or the individual partners is usually a matter for the plaintiff since, in most jurisdictions, their liability is joint and several.|$|E

The concept of risk underlies the nature of all relations in the building industry and determines the form and conduct of the parties in those relations.
