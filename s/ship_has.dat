5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, {{and the name of the}} <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> become a byword for unexplained desertion.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> {{self-defence}} {{capability and}} {{is equipped with}} an indigenous anti-missile defence chaff system. On-board systems include fully automatic engine controls, power management and battle damage control systems. According to the navy, the ship was designed to operate as a command platform. The ship is fitted with four AK-630 Close-in weapon systems, which can fire {{at a rate of}} 4,000 to 10,000 rounds a minute.|$|E

5|$|Wipeout Pure is {{a racing}} game {{which is set}} in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after the events of Wipeout 2097, and {{revolves}} around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. Players control anti-gravity ships which are owned racing corporations (effectively referred to as 'teams' in-game). There are a total of eight teams featured in the game, with one ship available for each. Every <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> different characteristics, for example each <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> variations in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the player's ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race. However, the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick-ups.|$|E
5|$|From Ulithi, Orizaba sailed east, {{passed through}} the Panama Canal again, and, as the battle for Okinawa raged, arrived at Tampa, Florida. Decommissioning on 23 April, she {{underwent}} an overhaul and on 16 July 1945 she was transferred to Brazil {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease. The ship was permanently transferred to Brazil in June 1953 and struck from the US Naval Vessel Register on 20 July of that same year. Orizaba received one battle star for her US Navy service in World War II. As of 2008, no other US Navy <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> been named Orizaba.|$|E
5|$|Limited-time events {{sometimes}} introduced {{additional material}} into the story. For instance, during the game's first anniversary event (July 2014), the player meets and befriends Goofy and Donald Duck, whose Gummi <b>Ship</b> <b>has</b> crash landed in Daybreak Town and broken into many Gummi Blocks. The player agrees to help collect the Gummi Blocks {{to repair the}} ship, and meets King Mickey, Chip, and Dale while doing so. Once the Gummi Ship is repaired, the player watches the others depart for their world. Meanwhile, a Moogle has constructed a Gummi Ship in his own image, but is unable to locate an entrance into his design.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{leaves on}} his own to locate the Cybermen at the store but Craig shortly follows, {{bringing}} Alfie along. The Doctor finds the spaceship actually sits below the store, underground, accessed by a tunnel from a changing room. The <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> been slowly siphoning energy from the store's power lines, reactivating its crew. The Doctor is captured by the Cybermen, who tell him that their ship crashed long ago but, with this new energy, will soon have enough power to convert the human race.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. The picture of the <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E
5000|$|Maritime interdiction operations: Since the {{beginning}} of Operation Apollo, Canadian <b>ships</b> <b>have</b> hailed more than 21,800 vessels.

50|$|Similar to the {{standard}} panokseon, the turtle <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> two masts and two sails. Oars were also used for maneuvering and increased speed. Another advantage the turtle <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> was that it could turn on its own radius.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} 434 ft long, with {{a beam of}} 56 ft. The <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> a depth of 34 ft and a draught of 26 ft. The <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> a GRT of 7,009 and a NRT of 4,972.|$|R
5|$|In the {{background}} of the oval shield is the mountain Chimborazo, while the river originating from its base represents the Guayas. Chimborazo is also the highest mountain in Ecuador and is part of the Andes Range. The steamboat on the river is named Guayas as well. The ship was built in Guayaquil and was the first seaworthy steamship built in both Ecuador and in all of South America. It was first put into service on 9 October 1841. The <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it. On top a golden sun surrounded by the Zodiac astrological signs for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the March Revolution of 1845 that ousted General Juan José Flores.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. Eddies from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
50|$|All {{five of the}} {{original}} Skuldelev <b>ships</b> <b>have</b> been replicated as true reconstructions by the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. Some of the Skuldelev <b>ships</b> <b>have</b> also been replicated by other groups across the world as both true or inspired reconstructions.|$|R
50|$|Completing {{sea trials}} in April 1992, the <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> her first port visit to her namesake city, Annapolis, MD. She then entered Post Shakedown Availability in January 1993. After {{completing}} PSA in July 1993, the <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> her first port visit to Bermuda.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> 54 {{first class}} berths and 120 deck bunks. [...] The main first class cabins were {{located on the}} upper deck {{together}} with lounges fore and aft. [...] There was a smoking room as well as additional cabins on the aft top deck, on which the pilot house and officers' quarters were located on fore part of the top deck. The <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> a dining saloon on the main deck. [...] The <b>ship</b> <b>had</b> a cargo capacity of about 300 tons.|$|R
5|$|She then {{returned}} to service with the fleet. In 1905 - 1906, Erich Raeder served aboard the <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> her navigation officer. By 1908, she {{was assigned to the}} gunnery training squadron and tasked with training the fleet's gunners. She remained with the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Frithjofs crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Danzig. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to A. Bernstein in Hamburg. Frithjof was rebuilt as a merchant ship in 1923 at Deutsche Werke; she only served in this capacity for seven years, and was dismantled for scrap in Danzig in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop {{a large portion of}} the population from being captured.|$|E
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the <b>ship</b> <b>has</b> a Schottel SST170LKT {{maneuvering}} thruster.|$|E
