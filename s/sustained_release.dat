40|$|The main aim {{of present}} {{work is to}} study the impact of various excipients and co-processed excipientson {{dissolution}} rate.

The objective of present study is to prepare and characterize various coprocessed excipients and its application in tablet formulation. Co-processed excipient prepared wascharacterized by flow properties, solubility, Hardness, Friability, % drug content in tablet formulation. FTIR and SEM show no physical interaction between them with no chemical change. Co processing ofexcipients was evaluated for Drug release, mean dissolution time and dissolution efficiency Sucrose:MCC (2 : 1) used to extend the drug release up to 6 hr, we can prepare <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> tablet of this COprocessing by incorporation of <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> polymer. MCC: Kyron was used to prepare immediatedrug release. So based on these properties we was prepared immediate release formulation and sustainrelease formulation. Co-processing of Sucrose: MCC have been used to achieve <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> byincorporation of pectin, by using this combination we can achieve <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> up to 10 hr similarlyKyron: MCC was used in immediate release formulation.

25|$|Another {{method by}} which <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> is {{achieved}} is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end.

The osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol solution is not absorbed into the body, having the effect of flushing out the entire gastrointestinal tract.

25|$|TEPCO {{claimed that}} there was a small but non-zero {{probability}} that the exposed fuel assemblies in the Unit 4 reactor could reach criticality. The BBC commented that criticality would never mean a nuclear explosion, but could cause a <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> of radioactive materials. Criticality is usually considered highly unlikely, owing to the low enrichment level used in light water reactors. American nuclear engineer Arnold Gundersen, noting the much greater power and vertical debris ejection compared to the Unit 1 hydrogen blast, has theorized that the Unit 3 explosion involved a prompt criticality in the spent fuel pool material, triggered by the mechanical disruption of an initial, smaller hydrogen gas explosion in the building.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E

2500|$|The bipolar cell {{active zone}} of the ribbon synapse can release {{neurotransmitter}} continuously for hundreds of milliseconds during strong stimulation. This release of neurotransmitters occurs in two kinetically distinct phases: a small fast pool where about {{twenty percent of the}} total is released in about 1 millisecond, and a large sustained pool where the remaining components are released over hundreds of milliseconds. [...] The existence of correspondence between the pool of tethered vesicles and the pool for <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> in the rods and bipolar cells of the ribbon reveals that the ribbon may serve as a platform where the vesicles can be primed to allow <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> of neurotransmitters. This large size of the sustained large component is what separates the ribbon synapse active zones from those of conventional neurons where <b>sustained</b> <b>release</b> is small in comparison. Once the presynaptic vesicles have been depleted, the bipolar cell’s releasable pool requires several seconds to refill with the help of ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

5000|$|EG - An {{envelope}} generator is a transient voltage source. A trigger {{in the presence}} of a gate, applied to an Envelope Generator produces a single, shaped voltage. Often configured as ADSR (Attack, Decay, <b>Sustain,</b> <b>Release)</b> it provides a transient voltage that rises and falls. It can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger {{in the presence of}} a gate. Usually it controls the amplitude of a VCA or the center frequency of a VCF, but the patchable structure of the synthesizer makes it possible to use the {{envelope generator}} to modulate other parameters such as the frequency or pulse width of the VCO. Simpler EGs (AD or AR) or more complex (DADSR—Delay, Attack, Decay, <b>Sustain,</b> <b>Release)</b> are sometimes available.|$|R

One of these drug is pain killer which is sustain their action within the body for 12 hours and the other drug is antigout which will release as conventional dosge. After oral administration the Diclofenac sodium prolong up to 12 hours and increase patient compliance. 6 batches of tablet were developed and evaluate. For the <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> action of Diclofenac sodium Kollicoat ® SR 30 and Sicovit ® 30 combination used with other inactive ingredients. In 1 st method only Diclofenac sodium pellets which were <b>sustained</b> <b>released</b> prepared. Pellets of the Diclofenac sodium developed with wet granulation method. This method is easy and cost effective, the evaluation of granules and tablets were done at the end, all prepared material mixed together and form tablet. The tablets were evaluated for all test like appearance, friability, dissolution, hardness, assay, weight variation and in-vitro release profile which is for both API. The result obtained were satisfactory and complies with USP specification. The formulation containing combination of Kollicoat ® SR 30 and Sicovit ® 30 showed good <b>sustain</b> <b>release</b> profile for 12 hours.
