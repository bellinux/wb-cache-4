40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{incidence}} of moral hazard {{played a significant role in}} the 2007 / 2008 credit crunch. In particular, bank traders subjected to asymmetric compensation structures have an incentive to take excessive risks even when the bank's shareholders would prefer prudent investment. Traders ' incentives are shown to be unaffected by capital regulations, with the associated financial burden falling upon the taxpayer through deposit insurance or government bail-outs. Selected case studies further indicate that the phenomenon of “gambling traders ” was widespread during the credit crunch, when high bonuses tempted bank employees to invest in risky subprime-backed securities. The intransparency of structured products and the inaccuracy of credit ratings contributed to the employees ' ability to conceal the underlying risk from the banks ' shareholders. The analysis points to an urgent need to reform compensation practices in the financial sector.

40|$|The first gene (alpha-gal 1) {{encoding}} an extracellular alpha-Dgalactosidase {{from the}} thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii was cloned and characterized. The alpha-gal 1 gene consisted {{of an open}} reading frame of 1, 792 base pairs interrupted by six introns that encoded a mature protein of 452 amino acids, including a 24 amino acid secretory signal sequence. The translated protein had highest identity with other fungal alpha-galactosidases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The alpha-gal 1 gene was overexpressed as a secretory protein with an N-terminal histidine tag in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Recombinant alpha-Gal 1 was secreted into the culture medium as a monomeric glycoprotein with a maximal yield of 10. 75 mg/l and purified to homogeneity using Hisbinding nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme was maximally active at 70 degrees C, pH 4. 5, and lost no activity over 10 days at 50 degrees C. alpha-Gal 1 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax of 240. 3 micronM/min/mg, Km of 0. 294 mM) and was inhibited competitively by galactose (Km obs of 0. 57 mM, Ki of 2. 77 mM). The recombinant T. emersonii alpha-galactosidase displayed broad substrate preference, being active on both oligo- and polymeric substrates, yet had strict specificity for the alpha-galactosidic linkage. Owing to its substrate preference and noteworthy stability, alpha-Gal 1 {{is of particular interest}} for possible biotechnological applications involving the processing of plant materials. J.

40|$|Academic {{writing is}} {{generally}} regarded {{as the most important}} communication medium through which people in the tertiary academic context choose to communicate their ideas. It is also well known that it is sometimes an arduous process for students to become accustomed to the requirements (the conventions and conditions) that hold for the production of appropriate written texts in this context. The initial impetus for the current study was provided by {{what appeared to be a}} significant problem that some <b>supervisors</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> of Pretoria identified in terms of the academic writing ability of their postgraduate students. This study therefore investigates postgraduate academic writing with regard to a number of such issues, and does so within the broader confines of academic literacy. The ultimate purpose of this investigation is to discover how writing interventions may be designed that offer appropriate assistance to students who experience difficulty with their writing. The study commences with an attempt to find support for treating 'academic discourse' as a potentially productive area of academic enquiry. It therefore presents an account on the nature of a 'discourse community', and attempts to ascertain whether there are any grounds on which 'academic discourse' may be regarded as a unique type of discourse used for specific communicative functions in the tertiary academic environment. It further discusses critically some of the traditional features of academic texts. The research then proposes thirteen design principles that serve as injunctions that should be considered in the development of writing courses, and proceeds to a critical discussion of the most important approaches in the teaching and learning of writing. What is evident from this discussion is that none of the historical approaches will, on their own, enable one to design justifiable writing courses. As a result, an eclectic approach is required in order to integrate the strengths of these approaches into a strategy for writing course design that is theoretically and practically justifiable. Subsequently, the critical interpretation of the literature in the first part of the study is used in the design of a framework for writing course design in tertiary education. This framework consists of six focuses that stand in a relationship of dynamic interaction towards a description of the context in which tertiary students write. Thus, relevant aspects concerning the writer, text, reader, institutional context and one's approach to writing are all essential elements that should be carefully considered in terms of their potential influence on the eventual design of materials that will constitute a writing course. The rest of the study consists of an application of the proposed framework that addresses firstly, <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>supervisors</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>University</b> about <b>the</b> academic literacy ability of their postgraduate students, as well as their requirements for academic writing. It then proceeds to an investigation of a specific group of students' (from the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences) perceptions about their own academic literacy ability and a determination of their perceptions and expectations of academic writing <b>at</b> <b>university.</b> Because <b>the</b> information that was collected (by means of questionnaires) in both cases mentioned above is mainly perceptual in nature, it was considered essential to determine the academic literacy ability of students in the study group by means of a reliable testing instrument. A written text that these same students produced was further analysed in order to establish possible writing difficulties they experienced. In addition, it was important to confirm certain findings from the supervisor questionnaire, and more specific information had to be collected on particular writing issues that could inform discipline specific writing course design (this was accomplished through focus group interviews with supervisors of the School of Agricultural and Food Sciences). A combination of all the prominent findings of the empirical work mentioned above, as well as insights gained in the literature survey, is then used to make justifiable suggestions for the design of writing course materials for students in the study group. Finally, a number of issues were identified that could not be addressed by this study and, therefore, suggestions are made for future research that may investigate these matters.
