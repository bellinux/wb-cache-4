2500|$|The 2007 World Cup organisers were criticised {{early on}} for being over-commercialised and, in particular, the {{generally}} smaller crowds have been {{blamed on the}} ICC's security restrictions on things such as outside food, signs, replica kits, and musical instruments, despite Caribbean cricketing customs, {{as well as the}} authorities being accused of [...] "running [...] out of town, then <b>sanitising</b> it out of existence". Sir Viv Richards echoed the concerns. The ICC were also condemned for high prices of tickets and concessions, which were considered unaffordable for the local population in many of the locations. ICC CEO, Malcolm Speed, said that the ICC recognised the problem but said it was the local organisers' fault. However, the later matches had more crowds as the tournament progressed with the local organisers easing restrictions. Although it did not meet the target of US$42million, the US$32million revenue from ticket sales was the highest of any Cricket World Cup and double that of the previous World Cup.|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} remaking {{of inner}} city Pyrmont-Ultimo in Sydney is analysed {{in terms of}} the visions of planners, developers, politicians and residents. Developers and government agencies selectively remembered the blue-collar history of this place in their place marketing efforts. These 'memories' were <b>sanitised</b> to make them more appealing to contemporary lifestyle-oriented residential markets. The need to <b>sanitise</b> and repackage particular urban places can be regarded, following Bourdieu, as a strategy of the ?eld of planners and developers, as they struggle to gain ascendency in the game of land and property development. Their 'feel for the game', it is argued, is re北tive of a 'planning habitus'. Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|Its initial {{task was}} <b>sanitising</b> the German media, {{removing}} figures with Nazi associations or histories and prohibiting overly nationalist or militarized content. It {{was charged with}} licensing the German newspapers, selecting editors who favoured creating a democratic society, and pre-approving content before it was published - although from August 1945 the model switched to approval post-publication. Initially entirely independent of the military government of Germany, it was merged into OMGUS in February 1946.|$|E

Indeed, it has become a Scottish country dance.|$|R

5000|$|The novel The Religion (2006) by Tim Willocks {{tells the}} story of the siege through the eyes of a fictional {{mercenary}} called Mattias Tannhauser, who is on Malta fighting (at times) alongside the Knights (referred to primarily as The Religion), while trying to locate the bastard son of a Maltese noblewoman. In this attempt his opponent is a high-ranking member of the Inquisition. The story presents a picture of both sides of the conflict without romanticising or <b>sanitising</b> the content for modern consumption.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} is unchecked use of constant-size structures and functions for dynamic-size data (the buffer overflow problem). This is especially common for string data in C. C library functions like gets should never be used since the maximum size of the input buffer is not passed as an argument. C library functions like scanf can be used safely, but require the programmer to take care with the selection of safe format strings, by <b>sanitising</b> it before using it.|$|E

50|$|In 1265 a {{defensive}} channel known as 'the king's ditch' was excavated {{around the city}} of Cambridge. By the early 17th century this ditch had become an open sewer. In 1574 Andrew Perne DD, Master of Peterhouse, thought of constructing a channel to bring water to the ditch. Hobson's Conduit, constructed from 1610, used the natural springs at Nine Wells to create a flow of water {{to the city and}} flush the kings ditch. This was not only successful in <b>sanitising</b> the city but it became the principal water supply for Cambridge for over 250 years. Water continues to flow into the city and waters the lake in the Botanic Gardens.|$|E

DEGA-16 is a cleaning and <b>sanitising</b> natural product, that is approved to clean chicken stables. The Dutch owners of ChickFriend were arrested during a large scale operation conducted by Dutch law enforcement agencies on the 10th of August.
