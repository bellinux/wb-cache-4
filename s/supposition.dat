5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common <b>supposition</b> that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. This <b>supposition</b> has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative <b>supposition</b> is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge of defending it.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a probabilistic approach for {{the interpretation of}} user arguments that integrates three aspects of an interpretation: inferences, <b>suppositions</b> and explanatory extensions. Inferences fill in information that connects the propositions in a user‚Äôs argument, <b>suppositions</b> postulate new information that is likely believed by the user and is necessary {{to make sense of}} his or her argument, and explanatory extensions postulate information the user may have implicitly considered when constructing his or her argument. Our system receives as input an argument entered through a web interface, and produces an interpretation in terms of its underlying knowledge representation‚Äîa Bayesian network. Our evaluations show that <b>suppositions</b> and explanatory extensions are necessary components of interpretations, and that users consider appropriate the <b>suppositions</b> and explanatory extensions postulated by our system...|$|R

5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to spend {{much of the rest of}} his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the <b>supposition</b> that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the sundew genus {{stretches}} from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. The centers of diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form {{the outskirts of the}} generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous <b>supposition,</b> the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through continental drift. Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred {{as a result of a}} subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in Africa or Australia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent <b>supposition</b> in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E

This article explores the varying beliefs, attitudes, and views on energy security in the United States among experts and residents. Based primarily on an academic literature review to distill expert views, and a survey distributed to hundreds of residents in the U. S. to capture consumer views, the study begins by explaining its methodology before identifying seven <b>suppositions</b> related to energy security. These <b>suppositions</b> involve security of fuel supply, energy democracy, energy research and development, affordability of energy services, environmental pollution, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The second section of the study tests these <b>suppositions</b> with a survey distributed to 427 respondents in the United States. Three <b>suppositions</b> are supported, two are unsupported, and two are neither supported nor unsupported. The final section of the study offers implications for U. S. energy policy and scholarship...|$|R
