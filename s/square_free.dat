25|$|This {{implies that}} the number of {{singular}} points is finite as long as p(x,y) or P(x,y,z) is <b>square</b> <b>free.</b> Bézout's theorem implies thus {{that the number of}} singular points is at most (d−1)2, but this bound is not sharp because the system of equations is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is d(d−1)/2, this value being reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of d lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of singular points is at most (d−1)(d−2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus in term of the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by the curves of genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).|$|E
