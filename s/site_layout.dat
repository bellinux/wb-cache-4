25|$|Planning for {{the design}} of the Exposition began over five years prior to Opening Day. According to an {{official}} resolution, decisions regarding the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> and the architectural style of the exposition were relegated to an architectural commission, which was led by Paul Cret and Raymond Hood. Local architects on the committee included Edward Bennett, John Holabird, and Hubert Burnham. Frank Lloyd Wright was specifically left off the commission due to his inability to work well with others, but did go on to produce three conceptual schemes for the fair. Members of this committee ended up designing most of the large, thematic exhibition pavilions.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{design was}} {{essentially}} the same as Calder Hall comprising four 180 MW(th) graphite moderated, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear reactors fuelled by natural abundance uranium (0.71% 235U) enclosed in magnesium-alloy cans, the principal difference being in plant layout. Since Chapelcross was commissioned from the outset as a four-reactor site (the option for a further four reactors was not exercised) rather than separate two-reactor sites as at Calder ‘A’ and ‘B’ stations, the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> was more compact. There is a single turbine hall housing all eight turbines which were originally rated at 23 MW(e) but progressively uprated to 30 MW(e) as the reactor thermal output was uprated to nominally 265 MW(th).|$|E
500|$|A {{new design}} for the website was {{launched}} on April 25, 2007, with the comment, [...] "Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking." [...] The new design was initially received with some controversy by many users, mostly due to the change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback. In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise {{you end up with}} a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact." [...] The <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> was refined over the next few weeks in accordance with many suggestions.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} challenge facing Whitchurch–Stouffville {{in the coming}} years, however, is the federal government's proposed development of an international airport immediately south-east of Whitchurch–Stouffville (the Pickering Airport lands). Under the current plan, approaches {{for two of the}} three landing strips would be directly above Whitchurch–Stouffville communities: the first over Ballantrae, Musselman's Lake and the north-east corner of urban Stouffville, with planes descending (or ascending) from 535 to 365 metres (with an allowable building height in Stouffville of 43 metres); the second over Gormley and the Dickson Hill area (near the Walmart and Smart Centre). A [...] "Needs Assessment Study" [...] was completed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority for the federal government in May 2010. After a [...] "due diligence review," [...] Transport Canada released the report in July 2011, which identified the most likely time range for the need of the airport to be 2027–2029, and confirmed the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> proposed in the 2004 Draft Plan Report.|$|E
2500|$|... “There {{was a large}} {{resident}} population at the site, a number of specialists not dedicated to food production, and political, religious, economic, and/or military relations with other sites within its area of influence.” [...] Unfortunately, few, if any, of the residential structures surrounding the large centers of the city have survived. The {{main part of the}} site is a complex of clay constructions stretched out for [...] in a north-south direction, although the site is oriented 8° west of north. The urbanized zone may have covered an area as large of 2km2. This particular <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> is the way the city was from 600 – 400 BCE, which is when the final Olmec occupation occurred. This site is particularly fascinating because of its layout—not only does Complex A face within 8 degrees of true North, but the east and west sides of the site are almost identical, showing bilateral symmetry. This is perhaps related to religion (it’s fairly speculative, at this point) but it certainly shows a high level of sophistication and city-planning.|$|E

50|$|The third {{problem with}} the {{survival}} of prefabs {{in the 21st century}} is that of style. Never seen as aesthetically pleasing, the tight building regulations meant they also came with reasonable-sized rooms and gardens. Modern house construction can create around 35 living spaces per acre, while often the prefabs will form <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> of less than 20. This, together with the age of the properties, makes redevelopment of mass prefab sites a distinct advantage to councils and housing associations. Hence, every year since 2000, the number of prefabs remaining has approximately halved.|$|R
