Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister Owen Bonnici stated that Evans had a right to return to his profession after being released from prison.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} predictors {{of attitudes toward}} <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> focusing on Belief in a Just World (BJW) and religiosity as variables that {{were likely to be}} related to attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> based on previous research. Predictors of attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> may facilitate better understanding of recidivism rates among <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and may aid professionals who work with <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> such as probation and parole officers. Hypotheses were that Religiosity would be negatively correlated with attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and BJW would be positively correlated with attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Responses from 252 participants were collected using a Qualtrics survey. The order of the surveys was randomized. There was no significant correlation between Religiosity and attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> BJW and attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> were significantly positively correlated, possibly because attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> differ between survey conditions. It is possible that attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are influenced by the measurement in the same study of attitudes toward other groups, such as victims of sex offenses. These findings could have significant implications for future research done within the Belief in a Just World theory, as the current study suggests data on attitudes should be controlled for the known presence of other groups in study designs.

40|$|Topics {{related to}} sexual {{offending}} and <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> can provoke {{a great deal}} of fear and anxiety in society. <b>Sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are {{a group of people who}} are considered to be especially unpleasant and harmful compared to other types of offenders. Over the past two decades, academic researchers and clinical professionals have developed a variety of assessment methods and treatment programmes to reduce recidivism rates of <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Public attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> are proposed to play an important role in the effectiveness of treatment for <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> Thus, general community members’ attitudes have been widely studied in western countries. However, there is little cross-cultural research exploring Asian people’s attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> The three keys purposes of this study were to examine university students’ knowledge of and attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> explore how their knowledge and attitudes were formed, and compare the similarities and differences between New Zealand and Chinese university students. A total of 62 participants were included in this study; 29 from New Zealand and 33 from China. It was hypothesized that New Zealand university students would be more knowledgeable of and positive toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders,</b> treatment of <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and released <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> than Chinese university students. The results supported hypotheses that New Zealand students had greater knowledge of and positive attitudes toward <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> and treatment of <b>sex</b> <b>offenders.</b> However, no difference was found in people’s attitudes toward released <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> between two groups of students. The results also indicated that the news media was the most common source of information on sexual offending and <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> in both countries. However, there is a great difference in people’s attitudes toward veracity of information provided by the media between New Zealand and Chinese students. The results are considered in light of current research. Implications and future research directions are briefly discussed...|$|R

Results suggested that male <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> {{were significantly more likely}} than female <b>sex</b> <b>offenders</b> to be rearrested for both sexual and nonsexual offenses.

5|$|Under Oregon law, Goldschmidt {{would have}} been {{required}} to register as a <b>sex</b> <b>offender,</b> had he been convicted {{of the crime of}} third degree rape. The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on ex post facto laws.|$|E

Oral sex was still a felony, and in 1970, nearly 90people in the city were arrested for having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco. By comparison, New York City recorded only 63 arrests for the same offense that year. Any arrest for a morals charge required registration as a <b>sex</b> <b>offender.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{kidnapping}} of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 {{years old at}} the time and was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted <b>sex</b> <b>offender,</b> Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California campus in Berkeley accompanied by two young girls on August 24 and 25 that same year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman who was successfully identified as Jaycee Dugard who was by then 29 years old.|$|E

On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute.
