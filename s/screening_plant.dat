25|$|A small Activated Sludge Plant was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} in 1916, one of the septic tanks was converted between 1918 and 1921 to provide a larger test bed, and a permanent installation was built at Withington Sewage Works, in south Manchester. All proved to be successful, but a full-scale plant was not built at Davyhulme until {{more than ten years}} later. A second main intercepting sewer, which would link various districts in southern Manchester to Davyhulme had been authorised by Act of Parliament in 1911, and construction began soon afterwards, but it took years to complete. It was extended by further Acts in 1914, 1920 and 1924, and sewage finally entered the works on 22 November 1928. To cope with the new flows, the size of the inlet works detritus tanks and screening chamber was quadrupled, and a decision was made to feed half of the output from the <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> to a new Activated Sludge Plant.|$|E
500|$|Isopogon anethifolius {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1796. Along with Isopogon dawsonii, {{it is the}} easiest member of the genus to grow. The fine foliage, red stems, bright yellow flowers in spring and distinctive drumsticks afterwards make I.anethifolius an appealing garden plant. It has potential as a <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> (its dense foliage {{can be used for}} privacy). It prefers acidic soil with extra water, though it does not tolerate waterlogging. A part-shaded position is the preferred location, though I.anethifolius grows readily in full sun. [...] Plants can withstand frosts to [...] Fertiliser applied in spring assists growth. Young plants can grow long stems that eventually droop, and respond well to pruning. [...] The species can be propagated by cuttings or seeds, which germinate after 30 to 60 days. Flowering can take several years from seed. Western Australian Isopogon species including I.cuneatus and I.latifolius have been grafted onto rootstocks of this species. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
