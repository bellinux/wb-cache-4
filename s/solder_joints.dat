25|$|Ceramic {{is on the}} {{one hand}} a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at {{relatively}} low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as surface-mounted components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the printed circuit board (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one. The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and <b>solder</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|E

BLP (Bottom Leaded Plastic) [2] {{which is not a}} type of thin out-line surface mount device(SMD) without the side lead is widely used in manufacturing of new generation memory such as SDRAM RDRAM DDR. For this non-lead SMD, the shape and reliability of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> is the focus of the study. In this paper, we select the C-BLP of 28 -pin device as the research object, complete the forming model of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> shape based on minimum energy principle and the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> shape theory by using Surface Evolver software, and analyze two critical process parameters (solder volume and solder pad width) impacting on the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> shape. The study results show that the solder volume and pad width {{have a significant impact on}} the three-dimensional shape of BLP <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> The law of which is that: in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the <b>solder</b> volume, <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> surface gradually changes from the relatively flat to the convex, <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> heights are gradually decreased; in the case of the other fixed parameters, as the increase of the pad in width, the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> surface gradually changes from the convex to the flat, <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> gradually changes from the completely soldered to the partly soldered in the pad connections, and <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> heights are gradually decreased.

In this paper, soldering experiments of quad flat package (QFP 256) devices were carried out by means of infrared reflow soldering system with Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 03 Ce lead-free solders, respectively, and the mechanical properties of micro-joints of the QFP devices were tested and studied by STR micro-joints tester. The {{results indicate that the}} tensile strength of Sn-Ag-Cu-Ce <b>soldered</b> <b>joints</b> is better than that of Sn-Ag-Cu <b>soldered</b> <b>joints.</b> In particular, the addition of trace Ce to the Sn-Ag-Cu solder can refine the microstructures and decrease the thickness of the intermetallic compound layer of Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys. In addition, the stress-strain response of Sn-Ag-Cu/Sn-Ag-Cu-Ce <b>soldered</b> <b>joints</b> in quad flat packaging was investigated using finite element method based on Garofalo-Arrhenius model.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to fit Coffin-Manson {{equation}} of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> by using results of <b>solders</b> <b>joint</b> reliability test and finite element analysis. Also to present a novel device for <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> reliability test. Design/methodology/approach: Two-points bending test of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> was carried out at three deflection levels by using a special bending tester that can control displacement exactly by a cam system. The failure criterion was defined as resistance of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> getting 10 percent increase. The X-section was done for all failure samples to observe crack initiation and propagation in <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> Finite element analysis was presented with ANSYS for obtaining shear strain range, analyzing distribution of stress and strain and supporting experimental results. Findings: The experimental results indicate that the fatigue life decreased obviously with the displacement increased. By using optical microscope and SEM photographs, two kinds of failure mode were found in <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> The majority failure mode took place at the bottom corner of <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> under the termination of resistor initially, and propagated into the solder matrix. Another failure mode was delamination. It appeared at the interface between the termination of resistor and its ceramic body. The distribution status of stress and strain in <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> and the calculation results of shear strain range at different deflection levels were obtained from simulation result. The Coffin-Manson equation of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu lead free <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> was fitted by combining experimental data with result of finite element analysis.

40|$|Abstract. The {{differences}} in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between the chip and the FR- 4 board generate the shear strains and the bending moment in the <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> It seems to be a main cause of failure in the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> when the chip and the FR- 4 board are heated repeatedly. Thus, the fatigue loading induced by thermal cycling is a major concern in the reliability of the <b>solder</b> <b>joint.</b> The magnitude of shear strain and the final failure are known to be influenced by varying boundary conditions such as the difference of CTE, the height of solder, the distance of the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> from the neutral point (DNP) and the temperature variation. In this paper, the effects of boundary conditions on the failure probability of the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> are studied by using the failure probability models such as the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).

The shape of the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> is correlated to its reliability and thus of importance. For low density chip bond pad applications Flip Chip (FC) manufacturing costs can be kept down by using larger size board pads suitable for solder application. By using “Surface Evolver” software package the <b>solder</b> <b>joint</b> shapes associated with different size/shape solder preforms and chip/board pad ratios are predicted.
