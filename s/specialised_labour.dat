Another example is that Pericles did not manage to impart his wisdom to his sons (319e). Socrates' uses a similar example in the Meno.

To drug the worker one does not want and toss him aside is surely far better than to expel him from his factory to wander starving in the streets. In every complicated social community there is necessarily a certain intermittency of employment for all <b>specialised</b> <b>labour,</b> {{and in this way}} the trouble of an 'unemployed' problem is altogether anticipated.

6000|$|Such is Syndicalism, {{the cheap}} Labour Panacea, {{to which the}} more passionate and less {{intelligent}} portion of the younger workers, impatient of the large constructive developments of modern Socialism, drifts steadily. It is the direct and logical reaction to our present economic system, which has counted our workers neither as souls nor as heads, but as hands. They are beginning to accept the suggestions of that method. It is the culmination in aggression of that, at first, entirely protective trade unionism which the individual selfishness and collective short-sightedness and State blindness of our owning and directing and ruling classes forced upon the working man. At first trade unionism was essentially defensive; {{it was the only}} possible defence of the workers, who were being steadily pressed over the margin of subsistence. It was a nearly involuntary resistance to class debasement. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn has expressed it as that in a recent article. But his paper, if one read it from beginning to end, displayed, compactly and completely, the unavoidable psychological development of the <b>specialised</b> <b>labour</b> case. He began in the mildest tones with those now respectable words, a [...] "guaranteed minimum" [...] of wages, housing, and so forth, and ended with a very clear intimation of an all-labour community.|$|E

Socrates says he could give more examples, but thinks his point is sufficiently established. [...] Protagoras says his claim that virtue can be taught is better made by a story than by reasoned arguments, and he recounts a myth about the origins of living things. He says that Epimetheus (whose name means [...] "Afterthought") who was assigned the task of passing out the assets for survival, forgot to give mankind anything so his twin brother Prometheus (whose name means [...] "Forethought") stole fire from Hephaestus and practical wisdom from Athena and gave them to man. However, man was never granted civic wisdom which belonged to Zeus or the art of politics, so the race was initially in danger of extinction. Zeus, however, sent Hermes to distribute shame and justice equally among human beings. To Protagoras, this answers Socrates' question why people think that wisdom about architecture or medicine is limited to the few while wisdom about justice and politics is thought to be more broadly understood (322d).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{work has}} shown that there exists a negative relation between wages and unemployment estimated across regions. Our model recognises the spatial dimension of the so-called wage curve by using a Hotelling/Salop framework in which {{a finite number of}} firms compete for heterogeneous workers. We incorporate this set-up into an efficiency-wage framework. In setting wages firms perceive their influenae on the wage-unemployment trade-off, thus taking the employment decisions of their competitors as an externality. The model predicts that in larger local labour markets with firms demanding more <b>specialised</b> <b>labour,</b> workers receive higher wages and face lower unemployment...|$|E

This model is able to reproduce many of the empirical regularities that have been identified in studies of industrial dynamics on the basis of causal mechanisms that are absent from most theoretical models, and it shows to be a useful tool in understanding some features of the evolution of real world industries. ...|$|E

40|$|Poor {{infrastructure}} and high transport costs {{are among the}} major constraining factors for Africa’s global competitiveness and economic growth (World Bank 2009, Bloom and Sachs 1998). Transport costs in Africa are indeed {{among the highest in}} the developing world. Recently, many African countries have begun to address this problem through large-scale investment programmes in infrastructure. Existing studies associate improvements in transport networks with a range benefits including poverty reduction, international competitiveness and economic growth (Banerjee et al. 2012, Hendersen 2000, Buys et al. 2010). More explicitly, lower transport costs imply improved market access for firms, economies of scale and integration across geographic locations (Lall et al. 2004, Graham 2007, Holl 2006, 2011). Reduced transport costs may also lower input prices, facilitate access to <b>specialised</b> <b>labour,</b> and promote agglomeration economies.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework linking products to innovation processes {{in order to show}} how knowledge, technology and organisation are all interrelated. These interactions create specific innovation management problems for companies developing complex, systemic capital goods. Firms can reduce development schedules and costs by efficiently allocating resources to reduce uncertainty about the implications of different design options. The paper proposes that technologies are constructed by following a set of interrelated problem solving tasks that constrain the range of possible innovation processes. The dynamic interactions between these interrelated tasks and the organisation of <b>specialised</b> <b>labour</b> influences the success of problem solving (as does problem-solving technology) and consequently the number and extent of redesign feedback loops in the innovation process. These redesign feedback loops have implications for the schedule, cost and quality of the project.

40|$|Rarely {{does one}} come across {{critical}} analysis which looks at islands as the strategic and candid promoters {{of a role}} as political and economic usufructuaries over external resources. This paper is premised on the proposition that a small territory is especially obliged to use extra-territorial resources as its hinterland for economic success. Such resources extend over {{a whole range of}} goods and services and include access to investment, welfare, security, stable currency, international relations, <b>specialised</b> <b>labour</b> power, transfers, markets and higher education. The MIRAB syndrome is one way of articulating this condition. This paper proposes a second cluster of features that are, or can be, deployed by small territories in a manner somewhat different from MIRAB; this second cluster has a more proactive policy orientation and a disposition towards carving out procedural and jurisdictional powers.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a general {{consensus}} that teachers are important for student learning, there is little discussion of the process by which teachers are employed by schools: the teacher labour market. We argue, based on a mix of a priori and inductive reasoning, that inflexible attitudes about comparative wages have contributed toward chronic shortages of qualified teachers in <b>specialised</b> teacher <b>labour</b> markets and poor incentives for excellent teachers to remain teaching. Overseas studies indicate that chronic shortages occur because fewer science and mathematics graduates, compared to humanities and social science graduates, are attracted to teaching. Higher wage rates for teachers with scarce skills will alleviate shortages and reduce attrition of the most able teachers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The local {{learning}} {{paradox is}} about the continued importance of regional resources for innovation processes in the more globalised economy. This paper conducts detailed investigations of learning and innovation processes in the cluster of electronics firms {{in the small town}} of Horten, Norway and it discusses how knowledge from this case may inform our theoretical understanding of innovation and learning in clusters. This paper demonstrates that history and context matter; local learning becomes no paradox when unravelling how this specific cluster developed. The core competence of the firms originated from national R&D-institutes when the pioneer firms and main spin-offs were established during the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1980 s. Regional resources have become much more important for innovation processes the last 20 years through the creation of a <b>specialised</b> <b>labour</b> marked, dedicated local suppliers and local cluster organisations. This study demonstrates that categorical statements about decreasing importance of the regional level in learning and innovation processes at least need to be specified, that is, limited to particular types of clusters and contexts...|$|E

40|$|The {{formative}} {{influence on}} Frances Burney’s {{work of the}} artistic-professional context of her upbringing has only recently begun to be recognised. As I argue elsewhere, early experiences in her father’s musical household informed Burney’s construction of a literary identity that balanced her professionally <b>specialised</b> <b>labour</b> with an aesthetic of domestic privacy. In Memoirs of Doctor Burney, Burney apparently collapses this separation by using her professionally specialised abilities in combination with her own intimate, domestic experience to construct a public version of her father, Charles Burney, as a polite, sociable man-of-letters rather than a musical professional. In Memoirs, Burney uses biography {{as a vehicle for}} the establishment of her own literary authority. In rewriting her father from artisanal musician to man-of-letters, she establishes an artistic-professional genealogy in which to site her own literary genius. Most significantly, Burney enacts final creative authority over her father, re-casting inheritance as evolution. Burney simultaneously invokes and obscures her family history in a biography of her father that is indistinguishable from the narrative of her own creative development...|$|E
