40|$|In {{contrast}} to energy analysis, {{the analysis of}} exergy allows {{the evaluation of the}} quality of different energy flows and enables a comprehensive assessment of inefficiencies within a system and its individual components by accounting for exergy consumption. While exergy analysis methods have been applied to a variety of conventional and renewable energy supply systems, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the exergy flows and exergy efficiency of hybrid ground-source heat pump systems with a <b>supplementary</b> <b>boiler.</b> In this study, we develop a thermodynamic model for each subsystem in a hybrid heating and cooling system of an existing building by applying the concept of cool and warm exergy. A comparison of the exergy consumption of the hybrid system in heating and cooling reveals that there are significant differences regarding the components that attribute most to the overall exergy consumption in the system. Due to these differences the true exergy performance of the system in heating mode (~ 30 %) is twice as high as for cooling mode (~ 15 %), while the natural exergy performance is considerably better in cooling mode (~ 26 % to ~ 3 %). Potential measures to enhance the exergy performance based on changes in the operational settings of the system and the improvement of the building envelope were found to have a more significant effect on heating performance than on cooling performance. In general, measures that affect the amount of thermal energy delivered by the system appear to be more effective than changes to the operational settings of energy supply systems...|$|E
50|$|Increased {{efficiency}} was sought, four-loom weavers {{were encouraged}} to work six or more looms. This was the more looms system, which {{reduced the number of}} weavers required. The looms were slowed from 220 picks per minute to 180 by changing the diameter of the pulleys. Elsewhere this caused industrial action, but here management maintained the four loom system in most of the mill. Additional power was required in the 1940s and a <b>supplementary</b> Cornish <b>boiler</b> was installed. In 1935, 450 people were working at the mill running 1,152 looms for 50 hours a week making 200000 yd of grey cloth.|$|R
40|$|In hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, sport centres, {{block of}} flats and apartments {{buildings}} the annual energy demand for heating of domestic hot water (DHW) typically range from 25 to 60 % of the total annual heating demand of the building. Due to the considerable DHW heat load, a centralized DHW system that covers the entire demand {{can be a very}} profitable installation. Possible heating systems include electric immersion heaters, solar collectors in combination with electric immersion heaters for <b>supplementary</b> heating, gas-fired <b>boilers,</b> pellet-fired boilers and heat pump water heaters (HPWH) utilizing e. g. ambient air, exhaust ventilation air, groundwater, boreholes in crystalline rock or grey water as heat source. This papers shows that HPWH systems using carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) as working fluid will typically achieve 20 % higher COP than the most energy-efficient HPWH systems on the market using HFC or propane as working fluid. In terms of energy efficiency and utilization of renewable heat it even outperforms state-of-the-art solar heating systems. Air-to-water and water-to-water CO 2 HPWHs in the capacity range from about 5 to 60 kW have now become commercially available in Japan and Europe from a number of Japanese manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{appearance}} of marketing and implementation of marketing concept in practice, {{the importance of the}} marketing mix, through which organizations adapt their offer to targeted customer segments, was emphasized. Regardless {{of the fact that the}} product is commonly referred to as the basic (key) instrument of the marketing mix, in the last ten years, due to the rapid and strong development of science, technology, especially information technology, business and society in general, integrated marketing communications (IMK) are becoming increasingly important, without which organizations can not even begin, or end, any significant marketing activity. In this context, the aim of the authors of this study was to investigate the importance of integrated marketing communications on the placement of gas boilers, i. e. on the market share of individual producers in the market of Vojvodina, which also represents the basic hypothesis of the research. Research results confirmed the basic hypothesis as well as an extraordinary influence of IMK to the market share of producers in the placement of gas <b>boilers.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> hypothesis was not confirmed, advertising is not a key promotional instrument. Thanks to the specific characteristics, primarily the high technical complexity of gas boilers, a key promotional instrument are education and training of sales and installation staff in the marketing channels, which operate on the market of Vojvodina...|$|R
40|$|In the strive against {{climate change}} the {{reduction}} of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is a key factor. The building sector is the largest consumer of primary energy which comes mainly from burning fossil fuels. The main share of buildings energy demand is represented by space heating and cooling. For this reason, improving buildings heating and cooling systems efficiency {{is one of the}} most effective ways towards sustainability. Ground Coupled Heat Pump (GCHP) systems are the most efficient systems for heating and cooling of buildings. However, the high installation cost and the associated long payback period for such systems prevent them from being widely installed. Introducing Hybrid Ground Coupled Heat Pump (HyGCHP) systems in combination with Model Predictive Control (MPC) substantially reduces this drawback. The aim of this doctoral research is to find the optimal control strategy for a considered HyGCHP system with MPC and to guarantee its robustness to uncertainties. For the purpose of this work an integrated dynamic model of the HyGCHP system is composed, based on models of the system components—building, Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE), primary heating and cooling devices (heat pump and ground coupled passive cooling heat exchanger) and <b>supplementary</b> devices (gas <b>boiler</b> and air coupled active chiller). The system operation is controlled by means of an optimization problem including short term objectives—achieving desired thermal comfort by minimized system operation cost. The optimization problem is solved for a time horizon of one year with imposing cyclic boundary conditions on the ground node temperatures to incorporate long term objectives—thermal balance of the ground for unbalanced heating and cooling loads—integrated with the short term objectives. The optimization problem is also solved for shorter time horizon and without cyclic boundary conditions with two intentions: (1) to see in what conditions the long term optimal operation profile can be reproduced with a more realistic short term control strategy; (2) to analyze whether in the long-term optimal solution the ground is exploited for Seasonal Underground Thermal Energy Storage (SUTES) or as a heat source/sink. Robustness analysis for state estimation uncertainty in the case of a HyGCHP system is performed for the most commonly used short term MPC strategy for heating and cooling systems in buildings (prediction horizon of one day, sampling time of one hour and control horizon of one time step). For that purpose an existing off-line method for robustness analysis is reproduced and clarified, then extended and applied to the HyGCHP system with MPC. This dissertation presents the integrated short-and-long-term optimization approach to analyze HyGCHP system operation, the short term MPC strategy to reproduce the long term optimal system operation profiles, and the extended robustness analysis method applied to the HyGCHP system with state estimation uncertainty in the MPC. The results show that the integrated short-and-long-term optimal operation profile with cyclic ground temperatures compensates the cooling dominated loads by annually mean ground node temperatures higher than the undisturbed ground temperature. The cooling dominated loads are mostly covered by passive cooling up to hitting the upper bound on the outlet BHE fluid temperature. The remaining peak cooling loads are covered by the chiller. On the short term a weekly optimal strategy reproduces the long term optimal annual profiles. For a single BHE this leads to the conclusion that because of high thermal dissipation the ground is not used as a thermal storage medium on the long term but as a heat source/sink on the short term. For the investigated borefield this conclusion changes. For realistically low ground thermal conductivity the optimal system operation includes using the borefield as a seasonal thermal storage medium on the annual term. The results for maximum allowed state estimation uncertainty computed with the robustness analysis method correspond to the performed HyGCHP system simulations with MPC. In conclusion, the method gives a reliable estimation of the maximum allowed state estimation uncertainty for guaranteed robustness. Improving HyGCHP systems with MPC can continue in two directions. First, towards investigating the SUTES ability of systems with other borefield drilling configurations. More compact borefields of more BHEs are expected to more efficiently operate as seasonal thermal storage mediums. This would enable SUTES in cases of higher ground conductivities, which is an opportunity of wider applications of HyGCHP systems. Second, the efficient implementation of optimal SUTES in short-term MPC strategies is an important research direction. The improved exposition of the robustness analysis method and the developed subsidiary method for application of the robustness analysis to the investigated HyGCHP system with MPC represent a fast offline computation to check and guarantee system robustness to state estimation uncertainty. The developed framework enables determining key boundary conditions for further system design and control: temperature measurement accuracy, model accuracy, MPC prediction horizon length. HyGCHP systems of the type presented in this dissertation which are characterized by bounded uncertainties can be controlled by conventional MPC provided that the level of the incorporated uncertainties is not higher than the guaranteed level computed using the presented method. nrpages: 156 + xxxviiistatus: publishe...|$|R
