5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I <b>show</b> <b>him</b> wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign <b>show</b> <b>him</b> for the first time wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Theodosius {{does not}} appear {{on most of the}} regular coinage of Maurice's reign, with two exceptions: the copper nummi of the Cherson mint, which <b>show</b> <b>him</b> along with his father and mother, and a special silver siliqua issue (apparently cut in 591/592 to {{celebrate}} his proclamation as co-emperor) from the Carthage mint.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tolkien was {{bitten by}} a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, {{although}} he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> off, returning him the next morning.|$|E
6000|$|They also <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> some of {{the engines}} with which some of his {{servants}} had done wonderful things. They <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> Moses' rod; the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers, trumpets, and lamps too, with which Gibeon put to flight the armies of Midian. Then they <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar slew 600 men. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> also, the jaw-bone with which Samson did such mighty feats. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> moreover, the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword, also, with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in {{the day that he}} shall rise up to the prey. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> besides, many excellent things, with which Christian was much delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.[80] ...|$|R

5|$|Chesney {{was active}} in his diocese; more than 240documents {{relating}} to his episcopal career survive. They <b>show</b> <b>him</b> mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney {{bought a house in}} London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert died on 26 October 760, and {{was later}} {{considered}} a saint with a feast day of 26 October. He was buried in his church of St. John, {{and was the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury that was not buried in St Augustine's Abbey. His letters to the Anglo-Saxon missionaries on the European continent <b>show</b> <b>him</b> to have been highly educated.|$|E
5|$|Robert of Melun (c. 1100– 27 February 1167) was an English {{scholastic}} Christian theologian {{who taught}} in France, {{and later became}} Bishop of Hereford in England. He studied under Peter Abelard in Paris before teaching there and at Melun, which gave him his surname. His students included John of Salisbury, Roger of Worcester, William of Tyre, and possibly Thomas Becket. Robert {{was involved in the}} Council of Reims in 1148, which condemned the teachings of Gilbert de la Porrée. Three of his theological works survive, and <b>show</b> <b>him</b> to have been strictly orthodox.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, when Tony first comes to therapy, Dr. Melfi {{opens the door}} to her office and <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> in. In this episode, after {{dropping}} him, she opens the doors and <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> out.|$|R
5000|$|One source <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> as a {{follower}} of the casuistry of Quintus Cervidius Scaevola, another <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> to have been his pupil. [...] A concurring (but dubious) passage in the Augustan History claims that he studied law with Severus under Scaevola.|$|R

One of them <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> {{walking around the}} countryside. Another one <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> walking in the cold forests of Idaho. The last one <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> driving in a car taking stops {{along the way to}} an unknown destination. He sings and plays the guitar in all three places at some point.|$|R
5|$|Rupert was {{appointed}} to the King's Privy Council in 1662, taking roles on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Admiralty Committee and the Tangier Committee. Accounts vary of Rupert's role in all these committees of government. Samuel Pepys, no friend of Rupert's, sat on the Tangier Committee with him and later declared that all Rupert did was to laugh and swear occasionally: other records, such as those of the Foreign Affairs Committee, <b>show</b> <b>him</b> taking a full and active role in proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Space Cavern was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo. Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a Consumer Electronics Show to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> the Imagic video game Demon Attack. Impressed with Imagic's game, Roper {{decided he wanted to}} produce one similar to it. He told developer Dan Oliver what he wanted in the game without disclosing his inspiration. Space Cavern was released in 1982. Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space Cavern under the name Space Canyon the following year, and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed.|$|E
5|$|They {{contain a}} wide array of physiognomical representations. Van Gogh's mental and {{physical}} condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some <b>show</b> <b>him</b> with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.|$|E

50|$|On 19 January 2016 in the ISIL {{magazine}} Dabiq, {{the group}} confirmed that Emwazi {{had been killed}} by a drone strike in Raqqa. The obituary <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> unmasked and referred to him as Abu Muharib al-Muhajir. Further photographs <b>showing</b> <b>him</b> unmasked in Syria were released on 26 January 2016.|$|R
5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Azamat {{abandons}} Borat, {{taking his}} passport, {{all of their}} money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator). Borat's truck runs out of gas, and he begins to hitchhike to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, they <b>show</b> <b>him</b> the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E
5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, two bronze statues, one {{depicting}} Aparicio, {{the other}} depicting former White Sox second baseman Nellie Fox, were unveiled on the outfield concourse of U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. Fox's statue <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> flipping a baseball toward Aparicio, while Aparicio's statue <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> preparing {{to receive the}} ball from Fox.|$|R
50|$|Ray Hyman {{believes}} that {{he was responsible for}} getting Andrus interested in optical illusions. Hyman <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the Mach-Eden illusion using an index card.

5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records <b>show</b> <b>him</b> sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and <b>show</b> <b>him</b> a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records <b>show</b> <b>him</b> pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Most of the pamphlet's {{illustrations}} feature an archetypal cartoonist {{working at}} his drawing board. Several are exaggeratedly pessimistic in tone; the cover image <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> surrounded by collapsing buildings, while another <b>shows</b> <b>him</b> slitting his wrists. It is unclear if the drawings are in any sequence that would qualify them as sequential art.|$|R
5|$|Jared {{tells the}} police that he was with Ricko; {{when he tries to}} suggest Tracy's death may have been an accident, the police <b>show</b> <b>him</b> the photos of Tracy's {{battered}} body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E
5|$|Krishna is {{also known}} by {{numerous}} names, such as Govinda, Mukunda, Madhusudhana, Vasudeva, and Makhan chor. The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects these legends, and <b>show</b> <b>him</b> in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, {{a young man with}} Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century {{reference}} to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students, but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, it is unclear what exactly was meant by this. Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta <b>show</b> <b>him</b> to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E
