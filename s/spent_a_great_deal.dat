5|$|Ferguson <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> {{of time at}} Pitfour {{but also}} had an {{apartment}} in St James Place, Westminster, Middlesex. Ferguson became the third Laird of Pitfour {{on the death of}} his father, Lord Pitfour, in 1777.|$|E
5|$|Chu <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time {{preparing}} in {{the month}} before his first appearance on Jeopardy! He studied tapes of former Jeopardy! contestants and created study guides based {{on the advice of}} Roger Craig. He also read about game theory and Jeopardy! strategy online. As a student at Swarthmore College, he also played quiz bowl, in which he has said he was an aggressive player despite having limited knowledge.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of {{his time}} and fortune {{on a series of}} {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
60|$|Jasper <b>spent</b> {{that day}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> {{of time with}} his mother. She had told me how much she had lacked {{hitherto}} proper opportunity to talk over with him their movements after disembarking. Everything changes a little {{the last two or}} three days of a voyage; the spell is broken and new combinations take place. Grace Mavis was neither on deck nor at dinner, and I drew Mrs. Peck's attention to the extreme propriety with which she now conducted herself. She had spent the day in meditation and judged it best to continue to meditate.|$|R
60|$|We {{passed the}} end of June here, and {{experienced}} the same violent weather, thunder, lightning, gales, and rain, which prevailed during every midsummer I <b>spent</b> in India. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of Coix (Job's tears) is cultivated about Moflong: it is of a dull greenish purple, and though planted in drills, and carefully hoed and weeded, is a very ragged crop. The shell of the cultivated sort is soft, and the kernel is sweet; whereas the wild Coix is so hard that it cannot be broken by the teeth. Each plant branches {{two or three times}} from the base, and from seven to nine plants grow in each square yard of soil: the produce is small, not above thirty or forty fold.|$|R
60|$|He {{went home}} dazed, and {{feeling as if}} it were a bad joke that had been put upon him. At least the affair went so deep that it estranged the aspect of his {{familiar}} studio. Some of the things in it were not very familiar; he had <b>spent</b> lately <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> on rugs, on stuffs, on Japanese bric-a-brac. When he saw these things in the shops he had felt that he must have them; that they were necessary to him; and he was partly in debt for them, still without having sent any of his earnings to pay his father. As he looked at them now he liked to fancy something weird and conscious in them as the silent witnesses of a broken life. He felt about among some of the smaller objects on the mantel for his pipe. Before he slept he was aware, in the luxury of his despair, of a remote relief, an escape; and, after all, the understanding he had come to with Alma was only the explicit formulation of terms long tacit between them. Beaton would have been puzzled more than he knew if she had taken him seriously. It was inevitable that he should declare himself in love with her; but he was not disappointed at her rejection of his love; perhaps not so much as he would have been at its acceptance, though he tried to think otherwise, and to give himself airs of tragedy. He did not really feel that the result was worse than what had gone before, and it left him free.|$|R
5|$|Hunter {{traveled}} {{again to}} the South of France {{on a number of}} occasions between 1927 and 1929, and based himself at Saint-Paul-de-Vence. He sent paintings back to Reid to be exhibited in Glasgow and London, but he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time sketching and his output of finished oil paintings was low. One exhibition in London had to be postponed due to a lack of paintings. The France trips culminated in 1929 with a critically acclaimed exhibition at the Ferargil Galleries in New York.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> {{of time in the}} reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull was {{appointed}} as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series. The Australian board had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time arguing over whether Woodfull or Victor Richardson should be Ryder's deputy, before realising that he selectors had omitted the latter. With {{six members of}} the team that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired, Australia would field and young and inexperienced team. Woodfull prepared for the Tests with an unbeaten 67 for Victoria in a drawn tour match against Percy Chapman's touring Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time {{away from each other}} and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E

5|$|The third Playford, Thomas Playford II, {{was born}} at Bethnal Green, London in 1837 to the second wife of Pastor Playford. He was raised on the Mitcham {{property}} in South Australia, was intellectual and bookish, and wished to go the prestigious St Peter's College to study law. He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at Norton Summit and growing vegetables, plums and apples. He {{was elected to the}} local East Torrens Council in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the State Parliament in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet formed), representing the constituency of Onkaparinga. He became known as 'Honest Tom' for his straightforward and blunt ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of his term absent in India. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as Agent General to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was thrice offered a knighthood, but declined it each time.|$|E

He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of money, {{making it one of}} the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.|$|E
