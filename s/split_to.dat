He arrived just as the AIF began a period of reorganisation and expansion, which saw the experienced units of the 1st Division being <b>split</b> <b>to</b> provide cadres to the newly formed 5th Division; {{as a part of}} this, the 6th Battalion was <b>split</b> <b>to</b> help form the 58th Battalion in late February.|$|E

Before leaving for Africa, Bond visits Gabriel Adeka—the rebel leader's brother—who runs AfriKIN, a London-based charity who send aid to Dahumni children; Gabriel tells Bond that he is not in contact with his brother Solomon, as the pair have fallen out.|$|E

The road crosses Route 68 at a grade-separated junction about two miles (three km) later, followed {{by a series of}} junctions about half a mile (0.8km) apart each: an interchange with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (at exit 66), a <b>split</b> <b>to</b> the left where Route 71 begins and a merge from the left where Route 150 ends.|$|E

5|$|Evacuation of the JNA {{facilities}} and surrender of the confiscated Territorial Defence weapons {{stored in the}} ŠibenikSplit area was agreed on 21 November. Throughout the process, tensions remained high, and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to Šibenik and <b>Split</b> <b>to</b> relieve the siege of its forces therecodenamed Operation Coast-91 (Operacija Obala-91) and Operation Hurricane-91 (Operacija Orkan-91) respectively.

Following the river south, I-84 exits the forest and enters the county seat of Morgan. Leaving the city the highway turns back east, passing Devil's Slide, an unusual rock formation just off the freeway.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the protest, the JNA {{increased}} combat readiness of its garrison in Split and elsewhere in Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from <b>Split</b> <b>to</b> its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up potable water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut. The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is <b>split</b> <b>to</b> follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E

Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who.

5|$|Tătărescu {{returned}} to the PNL later in 1944 — after the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, Tătărescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brătianu, and <b>split</b> <b>to</b> form his own group in June–July 1945. Dinu Brătianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Tătărescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.|$|E
5|$|After Gallipoli the 7th Battalion was {{withdrawn}} to Egypt, where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to Europe. The 7th Battalion was <b>split</b> <b>to</b> provide a cadre for the 59th Battalion which was being raised {{as part of the}} doubling of the Australian forces. In March 1916, they sailed to France where for the next two and half years they would take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Upon arrival, the battalion was sent to the Somme, where its first major action came in July during the Battle of Pozières. Throughout July and into August, the battalion was committed to the fighting twice, losing 55 men killed in the first battle and another 83 in the second.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway <b>split</b> <b>to</b> the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|For the 1920 season, Maryland {{played in}} the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) were locked in a heated debate over whether first-year {{students}} should be eligible to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA <b>split</b> <b>to</b> form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland.

Hill subsequently began a relationship with him, while still also involved with Jean. Hill became pregnant, and in August 1997, Marley and Hill's first child, Zion David, was born.

5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward and approaches I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route <b>split</b> <b>to</b> follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, the {{battalion}} sailed to Alexandria on the Empress of Britain. From Alexandria, it travelled by train to bivouac at Tall al Kabir. At this time, {{the battalion}} received 367 reinforcements from Australia before undertaking defensive duties around Gebel Habieta, guarding the Suez Canal. In February, the AIF was re-organised and expanded. This saw the veteran battalions <b>split</b> <b>to</b> provide cadres for new battalions {{and as a}} part of this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 51st Battalion, by transferring the even numbered sections to the new battalion. At this time, the battalion received four Lewis Guns for organic direct fire support.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of Croatia, the HV {{deployed}} to protect the Dubrovnik area against the VRS Herzegovina Corps and the Yugoslav Army situated in and around Trebinje and the Bay of Kotor. The plan, codenamed Operation Maestral, entailed deployment of the 114th, 115th and 163rd Brigades, the 116th and 156th Home Guard Regiments, the 1st Home Guard Battalion (Dubrovnik), the 16th Artillery Battalion, the 39th Engineers Battalion and a mobile coastal artillery battery. The area was reinforced on 8 August with the 144th Brigade as the unit completed its objectives in Operation Storm and moved to Dubrovnik. The CAF committed two MiG-21s and two Mi-24s based in <b>Split</b> <b>to</b> Operation Maestral. The Croatian Navy supported the operation deploying the Korčula, Brač and Hvar Marine Detachments, as well as missile boats, minesweepers, anti-submarine warfare ships and coastal artillery.
