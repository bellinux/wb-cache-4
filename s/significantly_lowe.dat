Although parents ’ knowl-edge {{about child}} {{development}} and child rearing is rele-vant to pediatric practice, {{very little is}} known about immigrant parents ’ knowledge. To fill this gap in re-search, this study investigated parenting knowledge in 2 groups of mothers who had immigrated to the United States. Design. Japanese and South American immigrant mothers of 2 -year-olds completed a standardized survey of parenting knowledge and provided information about sociodemographic and infant health status. Their data were compared with European American mothers in the United States. Results. Immigrant mothers scored 70 % on the evaluation of parenting knowledge, <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E

One of the major bottlenecks that has impeded the commercialization of biomass to bioenergy plants is the high cost of transporting biomass (due to typical low density of biomass) from place of generation/production to bioenergy plants. This project investigated the minimum pressure/moisture content that will produce stable compacts from four biomass feedstocks – poultry litter, switchgrass, peanut hull and pine wood.

40|$|Background: There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{reliability}} of various lower abdominal flaps for breast reconstruction. The authors evaluate in vivo perfu-sion of these flaps to objectively determine which techniques and which skin island zones had better perfusion. Methods: A prospective study was performed on 77 single-pedicle breast re-constructions [pedicled transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM), n 22; muscle-sparing free TRAM, n 37; deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP), n 18]. Perfusion was measured intraoperatively using indocyanine green angiography following flap harvest and before transfer. Flow quantification was performed at 12 standardized data points {{in each of the}} four zones of the skin island. Patient risk factors for flap ischemia were assessed, perfusion was quan-tified, and comparisons weremade between the various flaps and between zones. Results: Mean perfusion was significantly higher in the 37 free muscle-sparing flaps (24. 9) and the 18 DIEP flaps (21. 8) when compared with the 22 pedicled TRAM flaps (19. 6) (p 0. 001).

There has been a marked increase in multiple job holding, rising from 5. 6 percent overall in 1992 to 10. 1 percent in 1996. Economic conditions prevalent in Russia’s labor market are found to strongly affect secondary job activity. Workers who have experienced wage arrears, been placed on involuntary leave, or are working less than full-time are all significantly more likely to take on second jobs.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abnormal {{apparent}} {{diffusion coefficient}} (ADC) values in injured spinal cord white matter and fibroblast transplants {{have been shown}} to correspond with qualitative histologic findings of axonal loss or regeneration. We proposed that ADC values would correlate with quantitative axonal tracing in the transected rubrospinal tract (RST). METHODS: Eleven rats received right-sided lateral funiculus lesions at C 3 – 4 (disrupting the RST) and transplantation of fibroblasts that were unmodified or modified to secrete brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Behavioral tests measured hindlimb function at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks after injury. At 12 weeks after injury, the antegrade axon tracer biotinylated dextran amine was stereotactically injected into the red nucleus to label the injured RST axons. Animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the excised, fixed spinal cord specimens was then performed at 9. 4 T. RESULTS: In white matter surrounding transplants, ADC values transverse to axons were elevated and ADC values longitudinal to axons were decreased. These ADC values were more abnormal closer to the transplant, and this correlated with decreases in numbers of labeled RST axons.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise {{in being able to}} detect this infiltration. This study aims to detect a difference in diffusion properties between GBM (infiltrative) and brain metastases (noninfiltrative). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 49 tumors (30 GBM, 19 metastases), DTI measures (p, q, L, and fractional anisotropy [FA]) were calculated for regions of gross tumor (excluding hemorrhagic and necrotic core), peritumoral edema, peritumoral margin (edema most adjacent to tumor), adjacent normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and contralateral white matter. Parametric and nonparamet-ric statistical tests were used to determine significance, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean values of p, L, and FA from regions of signal-intensity abnormality differed from those of normal brain in both tumors. The mean q value did not differ significantly compared with that in normal brain in any region in metastases or in adjacent NAWM of GBM. For GBM compared with metastases, q and FA were significantly lower in gross tumor (P. 001) and q was <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E

40|$|If trade {{affects the}} costs of conflict, does it also {{influence}} the likelihood of mediation attempts? This article argues that dense bilateral trade between antagonists yields high opportunity costs since it is expensive to seek alternative markets and the belligerents will be highly vulnerable to sanctions from their counterpart. This creates incentives for combatants to limit hostility and settle conflicts through mediation. By contrast, {{the extent to which}} belligerents trade with other states decreases the likelihood of mediation since antagonists with alternative partners can mitigate the consequences of sanctions and substitute for markets, which may be at risk or even lost because of the outbreak of a dispute.

The in situ preparation proved durable and stable. At 15 ˚C and a spontaneous heart rate of 23. 4 beats min � 1, maximum stroke volume was 2. 54 ml kg � 1 body mass, maximum cardiac output was 62. 5 ml min � 1 kg � 1 and maximum cardiac myocardial power output was 1. 50 mW g � 1 ventricular mass. There was good agreement between these values and those previously obtained in vivo. Furthermore, since the maximum stroke volume observed here was numerically {{equivalent to that}} observed in ventilating C. scripta in vivo, {{it seems likely that}} C. scripta has little scope to increase stroke volume to a level much beyond that observed in the resting animal through intrinsic mechanisms alone.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{remains one}} of the major killers in modern society. One strong risk factor of CVD is {{cigarette}} smoking that causes myocardial injury and leads to the genesis of pathological cardiovascular events. However, the exact toxic component(s) of cigarette smoke (CS) and its molecular and cellular mechanisms for causing myocardial injury leading to heart damage and its prevention are largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a guinea pig model, here we show that chronic exposure to CS produces myocardial injury that is prevented by vitamin C. Male guinea pigs were fed either vitamin C-deficient (0. 5 mg/day) or vitamin C-sufficient (15 mg/day) diet and subjected to CS exposure from 5 Kentucky Research cigarettes (3 R 4 F) /day (6 days/ week) in a smoke chamber up to 8 weeks. Pair-fed sham controls were subjected to air exposure instead of CS exposure under similar conditions. Myocardial injury was produced in CS-exposed marginal vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs as evidenced by release of cardiac Troponin-T and I in the serum, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, thrombosis and collagen deposition in the myocardium. Treatment of rat cardiomyocyte cells (H 9 c 2) in vitro and guinea pigs in vivo with p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) in amounts derived from CS revealed that p-BQ was a major factor responsible for CS-induced myocardial damage. A moderately large dose of vitamin C (15 mg/day) prevented CS/p-BQ-induced myocardial injury.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in ApJ We present near-IR spectra of Hα emission from 13 galaxies at z ∼ 2 in the GOODS-N field. The galaxies were selected primarily because {{they appear to have}} elongated morphologies, and slits were aligned with the major axes (as determined from the rest-frame UV emission) of 11 of the 13. If the galaxies are elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and major axis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, if present. In spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shear in only two galaxies. We show that the seeing makes a large difference in the observed velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information to place limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in the sample: we find that all 13 have v 0. 5 ≤ 110 km s − 1, where v 0. 5 is the velocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) that would be observed under our best seeing conditions of ∼ 0. ′ ′ 5. When combined with previous work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the major axis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line. We then focus on the one-dimensional velocity dispersion σ, which is much less affected by the seeing, and see that the elongated subsample exhibits a <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Context A {{major role}} of the {{pancreas}} in zinc homeostasis has been suggested. Objective To assess erythrocyte zinc status in chronic pancreatitis and to correlate it with pancre atic exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Patients One hundred and one patients with chronic pancreatitis (34 alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, 67 tropical chronic pancreatitis) were prospectively studied. Main outcome measure Disease characteristics and imaging features were recorded. Erythrocyte zinc was estimated by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Exocrine insufficiency wa s assessed using polyclonal antibody ELISA for pancreatic stool elastase 1. Endocrin e insufficiency was assessed by serum gl ucose levels and insulin requirement. Results Erythrocyte zinc was significantly lower in chronic pancreatitis patients than in the controls (26. 5 ± 9. 5 μ g/g Hb vs. 38. 0 ± 6. 6 μ g/g Hb; P< 0. 001), and in tropical chronic pancreatitis than in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (25. 0 ± 10. 4 μ g/g Hb vs. 29. 6 ± 6. 5 μ g/g Hb, P= 0. 001). In chronic pancreatitis patients who had exocrine insufficiency, erythrocyte zinc pos itively correlated with stool elastase 1 (r= 0. 587, P< 0. 001). Erythr ocyte zinc levels were <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe</b> r in diabetic patients as comp ared to non-diabetics (P= 0. 036). Conclusions This study demonstrates zinc deficiency in chronic pa ncreatitis patients, and that zinc deficiency correlates with exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Further studies may clarify the possible bene fits of zinc supplementatio n in chronic pancreatiti...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A serial {{prospective}} study of cellular immunity to HBsAg and liver-specific membrane lipoprotein was undertaken in 21 adults with acute hepatitis type B. Cellular immunity to HBsAg {{as determined by}} leucocyte migration inhibition with partially purified HBsAg as antigen was detect-ed in all the patients during the recovery phase of the illness and was already detectable {{at the time of}} admission in 13 (62 %) of the cases. In five of the remaining eight the titre of HBsAg in the serum at this time was high and in the whole series there was an inverse correlation between the degree of migration inhibition on admission and the peak HBsAg titre suggesting that antigen or possibly antigen/antibody complexes might be interfering with the demonstration of cellular immunity in vitro. Using a combination of minimum migration index recorded during the recovery period and peak HBsAg titre, it was possible to compute the peak aspartate aminotransferase level with reason-able accuracy, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that the severity of the illness is related to both the number of infected hepatocytes and the vigour of the immune response to HBsAg. Evidence of an immune response to the liver-specific hepatocyte membrane lipoprotein was present in 50 % 0 of the patients tested at the time of admission, but was transient, having disappeared in every case by four weeks. The minimum migration index recorded with HBsAg as antigen was <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and test a novel method of regional seismic event location based on exploiting Empirical Green's Functions (EGF) that are produced from ambient seismic noise. Elastic EGFs between pairs of seismic stations are determined by cross-correlating long ambient noise time-series recorded at the two stations. The EGFs principally contain Rayleigh and Love wave energy and our focus is placed on utilizing these signals between 5 - and 15 -sec period. Our approach and the results of several tests based exclusively on Rayleigh waves were described in detail by Barmin et al. (2011). During the past year we have refined the method and have continued to evaluate its capabilities. The main refinement is the introduction of EGFs for Love waves. The database of Love wave EGFs for the Western USA has been constructed following the methodology described in Lin et al. (2008). This database consists of more than 365, 000 EGFs obtained from more than 1700 stations of stationary networks and the EarthScope USArray. Love wave group time delays are less sensitive to event depth than Rayleigh wave group time delays. They are also less sensitive than Rayleigh waves, on average, to the source mechanism. Thus, everything else being equal, Love wave EGFs are expected to provide better epicentral accuracy than Rayleigh waves. We demonstrate this with numerical simulations of the location capabilities based on Love wave EGFs, which confirms <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic {{resection}} for primary Crohn's disease in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized for laparoscopic-assisted or open surgery. Primary outcome parameter was postoperative quality of life (QoL) during 3 months of follow-up, measured by SF- 36 and GIQLI questionnaire. Secondary parameters were operating time, morbidity, hospital stay, postoperative morphine requirement, pain, and costs. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were not different. Conversion rate was 10 % (n= 3). Median operating time was longer in laparoscopic compared with open surgery (115 versus 90 minutes; P < 0. 003). Hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (5 versus 7 days; P= 0. 008). The number of patients with postoperative morbidity within the first 30 days differed between the laparoscopic and open group (10 % versus 33 %; P= 0. 028). There was no statistically significant difference in QoL between the groups during follow-up. Significant time effects were found on all scales of the SF- 36 (P < 0. 001) and the GIQLI score (P < 0. 001). QoL declined in the first week, returned to baseline levels after 2 weeks, and was improved 4 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Median overall costs during the 3 months follow-up were significantly different: euro 6412 for laparoscopic and euro 8196 for open surgery (P= 0. 042). CONCLUSIONS: Although QoL measured by SF- 36 and GIQLI questionnaires was not different for laparoscopic-assisted compared with the open ileocolic resection, morbidity, hospital stay, and costs were <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Soybean (Glycine max. L. Merrill) {{production}} in Paraguay {{has increased dramatically}} {{during the last decade}} and the country is now the fourth largest soybean exporter in the world, producing about 3 % of the world’s soybean production. This paper explored associations between soybean yield in eastern Paraguay and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. Historical soybean yield data from official government sources were detrended to remove the effects of technological advances, and yield residuals were computed. In addition, differences in mean precipitation among ENSO phases were investigated under the context of crop development phases. The CSM-CROPGRO soybean model was used to simulate soybean development for two locations representing the most important soybean producing areas in Paraguay. Influences of ENSO phases on mean precipitation during planting and blooming, blooming and seed podding, and from young pods to physiological maturity were explored through tests of differences in the central tendency. Relative yield residuals during El Niño years were positive six out of seven events and varied from − 9. 4 to + 24. 2 % for the 1991 / 1992 and 2002 / 2003 cropping seasons, respectively. During La Niña years, calculated residuals were negative for three out of four events and varied from − 37. 9 to + 1. 5 % for the 2005 / 2006 and 1988 / 1989 cropping seasons, respectively. Analysis of precipitation records showed significantly lower precipitation levels between planting and blooming during La Niña years than during El Niño years. Differences in mean precipitation during blooming and beginning of seed formation were found to be not significant. Mean precipitation between seed podding and crop maturity was found to be <b>significantly</b> <b>lowe...</b>|$|E
