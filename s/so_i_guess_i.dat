I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust.

500|$|Grigorieva {{had signed}} with Gibson's music label {{prior to the}} album's release. The music project {{was made by the}} film {{production}} company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> was drawn to that notion for the album title." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year. My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> clearly <b>I</b> have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|R
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{attempted}} to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at , despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare. Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, Kasich {{acknowledged}} that his stance on immigration has [...] "evolved" [...] because [...] "maybe I'm a little smarter now," [...] stating: [...] "I don't {{want to see}} anybody in pain. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> when <b>I</b> look at this now, I look at it differently than I did in '10. ... When I look {{at a group of}} people who might be hiding, who may be afraid, who may be scared, who have children, I don't want to be in a position of where I make it worse for them." [...] That year, Kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, saying at a Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting in Florida, [...] "I don't like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line, but we may have to do it." [...] Kasich was the only governor at the RGA conference [...] "to express openly a willingness to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "You Make Me Want to Be a Man" [...] {{was directed by}} anime director Kōji Morimoto and Kiriya. Utada stated that because the song itself featured electro and dance genres, [...] "it fits well with visuals. I {{have a lot of}} electronic elements with machines and stuff like that." [...] Utada said she was influenced by her Japanese heritage, anime and otaku culture, and Japan's advances in technology during the early 2000s. She commented, [...] "We wanted to play with the Japanese side of my existence. Japan is well know sic for these kinds of technological things, like Anime and the futuristic things, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> think that is what started off the whole thing." [...] Utada revealed that she shared her creative input with Kiriya because [...] "It's very difficult, but a bit of companionship was exactly what I needed. With most of my work I mostly just say yes or no, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> what <b>I</b> needed was someone that I could trust the taste and opinions of and have the guts to tell me about things. Somebody that I could trust with the creative side of things a little more, so that is when he came into the picture." ...|$|R

60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well, though my bed was {{comfortable}} enough, for I had {{all sorts of}} queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may {{have had something to}} do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty.

500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can only tell you what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop <b>so</b> low again/ <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|R

[...] This was said by a woman of about four or five-and-twenty, tall, thin and spare, with a high colour, sharp black eyes, and a waist which the long stiff stays, laced in front, had pinched in till it was {{not much bigger than}} a wasp's, while her quilted green petticoat, {{standing}} out full below it, showed a very trim pair of ankles encased in scarlet stockings, and a pair of bony red arms came forth from the full short sleeves of a sort of white jacket, gathered in at the waist. She was clattering backwards and forwards, removing the dinner things, and talking to the children as she did so in a sharp shrill tone: [...] "Such a racket as you make, to be sure, and how you can have the heart to do <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>guess,</b> not <b>I,</b> considering what may be doing this very moment." ...|$|R
40|$|Once upon a time, not <b>so</b> long ago, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> {{lived in}} a {{ramshackle}} house perched perilously on a bank of the Malang River. By day, I trekked to the city's outskirts to interview members of Laskar Jihad, the earliest and most notorious of the Islamic militias that burgeoned like wildflowers {{after the fall of}} Suharto. The young men wore white robes and cultivated patchy beards and waved their machetes to shrieks of "jihad. " Malang nights, by contrast, were quiet, and I would slip out to the local internet café, which stayed open as long as there were glassy-eyed customers to patronize it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> often found myself {{in the wee hours of}} the morning, tracing a potted path home along the accordion shutters of the city's Chinese shop-fronts.

40|$|This {{article is}} the third in an {{occasional}} series intended for graduate students. The series is coordinated by Associate Editor Lisa Traynor. In today’s world, most any math department wants each of its faculty to have a scholarly profile. If you wish to establish yourself in the profession, {{if you want to}} make your reputation, if you want to achieve tenure status, then you must publish. While it is okay to publish a “Letter to the Editor” in the Notices, or a recreational problem in the American Mathematical Monthly, the hard fact of the matter is that the publishing that really counts is that of a research article in a peer-reviewed mathematics journal. The purpose of this article is to tell you how to perform that task. I have published more than 150 articles myself. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>I</b> know how to do it. I have never written an article and then been unable to publish it. The notion—that one reads about in stories or sees in popular movies—of a forlorn scholar languishing away because he/she cannot get his/her ideas in print is mostly nonsense. You cannot succeed at anything in life unless you understand what it is that you are trying to achieve. Once you understand what mathematical research is about, and how the publication process works, then you should be able to get your work into print. We shall lay out all the essential moves here.
