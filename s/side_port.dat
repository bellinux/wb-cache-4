500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two <b>side</b> <b>Port</b> Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to give them something to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
2500|$|After the war Bookman {{was bought}} by Luton Town for £875, where despite being over thirty, he enjoyed the most {{successful}} spell of his football career. The [...] "Hatters" [...] could only post a 20th-place finish in the Southern League in 1919–20, but were nevertheless elected into the Football League. Luton then finished ninth in the Third Division in 1920–21, before reaching fourth and then fifth in the Third Division South in 1921–22 and 1922–23. He left Kenilworth Road in September 1923, when he was signed by Second Division <b>side</b> <b>Port</b> Vale for a £250 fee. He lost his first team place in December that year, and was released {{at the end of}} the 1923–24 season. Bookman then returned to Ireland and re-signed for Shelbourne.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The <b>side</b> <b>port</b> trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|After making {{just one}} {{substitute}} appearance for Stevenage, Madjo joined League Two <b>side</b> <b>Port</b> Vale on loan on 24 November 2011. He aimed to [...] "prove himself" [...] at the club, having previously had a trial at Vale Park {{before he turned}} professional at Bristol City in 2005. He made his debut for the club a day after signing, playing 80 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United; he was praised for his performance despite being 'rusty' and short of match fitness. In his second appearance for the club, he scored only his fourth league goal in the Football League, as he [...] "displayed quick feet, an assured touch and deadly instincts in front of goal" [...] to net the winning goal of a 2–1 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge. He dedicated the goal to coach Geoff Horsfield, after the pair spent many hours on the training ground working on Madjo's finishing skills. For his performance, Madjo was named on the League Two Team of the Week. He scored a 60-minute hat-trick in his third appearance for the club, a 4–0 home win over Aldershot Town; despite this he stated that [...] "I didn't play that well in the first half. I feel I can give a lot more." [...] For this achievement he was named on the League Two Team of the Week for a second time. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored four goals in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
