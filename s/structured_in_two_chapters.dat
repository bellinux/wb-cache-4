O primeiro capítulo explora os retrotransposons com LTR (LTR-RT) em cana-de-açúcar e grande parte de seus resultados foram publicados no artigo Analysis {{of plant}} LTR-retrotransposons at the fine-scale family level reveals {{individual}} molecular patterns. Nossos resultados mostraram que as diferentes famílias de LTR-RT em cana-de-açúcar possuem estruturas e regulação distintas. O segundo capítulo desta tese visa responder a perguntas que surgiram durante a primeira metade deste trabalho, mas ao invés de focar no genoma de uma planta optamos por trabalhar com linhagem Del de LTR-RT em dez genomas de angiospermas sequenciados. Os resultados desta parte do trabalho foram submetidos para publicação no artigo intitulado Virus-like attachment sites and plastic CpG islands: landmarks {{of diversity in}} plant Del retrotransposons. Os resultados mostraram que a LTR é uma região dinâmica e importante para a evolução dos LTR-RTs. Nós especulamos que mudanças nas LTR atuem como gatilhos para a diversificação dos LTR-RTs. This doctoral thesis is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>chapters.</b> In the first chapter we explore the LTRretrotransposons (LTR-RT) in sugarcane, these results were published in an article entitled Analysis of plant LTR-etrotransposons at the fine-scale family level reveals individual molecular patterns. In this paper we show that different sugarcane LTR-RT families have distinct structure and are differentially regulated. In the second chapter we try to find answers to questions that {{came up in the}} first half of this work, but instead of focusing in one plant genome we chose to work with the Del lineage of LTR-RT in tem angiosperm sequenced genomes. These results are submitted to publication as an article entitled Virus-like attachment sites and plastic CpG islands: landmarks of diversity in plant Del retrotransposons. Our results indicate that the LTR region is dynamic and important in the evolution of LTR-retrotransposons, we speculate that it is a trigger for retrotransposon diversification...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a body of}} eight original musical compositions inspired by the phenomenology of mental imagery, together with a written commentary which describes in depth the compositional process undertaken whilst composing them, defines the concept 'mental imagery' as applied to this process. and sets the concept within a broad theoretical framework which addresses cognitive sciences, the philosophy of meaning and perception, and music historiography. The study codifies a new and original methodology for music composition based on the author's personal account of mental imagery and its influence or permeation into his practice as a composer. The written commentary is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>chapters.</b> Chapter One begins with {{a detailed description of}} the author's notion of mental imagery, which arose as a natural outcome of his subjective compositional practice. Mental imagery is then compared with ideas, concepts and arguments that address extrinsic elements in music and cross-modal categories in perception. The concept of 'mental imagery' proposed by the author, and therefore the whole compositional process described, is discussed through the lens of the ecological theory of perception and the virtual representation of music, which places mental imagery squarely within contemporary accounts in the field of cognitive sciences and the philosophy of perception. A discussion on the topic of musical meaning follows, addressing arguments that define meaning as a multiform, interdisciplinary concept. Chapter One ends with an insight into music analysis research from the second half of the 20 th century, leading to the statement that mental imagery might have been neglected by some music theorists in the recent past. It is argued that this is due to a prevailing epistemological framework that gave priority to formal and technical features of musical material. Chapter Two of this written commentary undertakes a deep and detailed analysis of four of the compositions presented. This analysis gives mental imagery a central role in the descriptive discourse, being sensitive to all the arguments discussed in Chapter One. The analytical style resonates with other accounts such as 'performative analysis' by Nicholas Cook (2002) and 'analog mode of discourse' by John Rahn (1979), and borrows key terms from 'vitality affects' by David Stern (1985). The whole thesis aims to be a valuable example of compositional process inspired by an original, unique and well-described concept: mental imagery. This compositional process codifies new methods or models for compositional practice that may be disseminated to fellow composers. Moreover, the study could also inform performers, theorists and listeners, who may approach their practice in a different light through reflection on the topic of mental imagery and all the associated processes that are here described...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>Chapters,</b> each {{aimed at}} {{contributing}} to the existing literature by exploring the effects of ambiguity aversion on two classical equilibrium asset pricing problems: the term structure of interest rates and two-agents equilibrium. In both cases, ambiguity aversion is modeled {{by means of a}} Max-Min expected utility representation that falls within the Recursive Multiple Priors class - thereby delivering dynamic consistency of the optimal policies of the agents. The set of likelihood used in the preference orderings representation is identified by means of a bound on the maximum 'distance' between admissible probability measures and a reference one, interpreted as approximate description of the true data generating model. The first Chapter of the Thesis, 'A General Treatment of Equilibrium under Ambiguity' considers a continuous-time pure exchange economy populated by two agents, whose decisions rely on a whole set of possible contaminations of a reference probabilistic model. Given that they adopt a form of max-min expected utility representation, agents select the worst-case model among those considered as relevant. The methodology applied in order to characterize equilibrium equity premia and stock returns volatility is based on a weak notion of aggregation of the single agents into a representative agent, whose preferences depend on an additional state variable acting as a proxy for the stochastic shifts of the cross-sectional wealth distribution due to the different beliefs selected in equilibrium by agents. Closed form solutions for key equilibrium quantities are detailed for markovian specifications of the stochastic opportunity set. This modelling framework suggests a possible explanation of the equity premium puzzle; what is more, endogenous cycles of restricted stock market participation are obtained, without imposing exogenous policy restrictions on agents. The second Chapter, 'Ambiguity aversion, bond pricing, and the non robustness of some affine term structures', develops a continuous time general equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates where economic agents are averse to model uncertainty and consider the possibility of a misspecified dynamic model for the latent random factors driving interest rates. A small concern for ambiguity significantly affects the implied term structures in equilibrium and drives the prices of common derivative securities toward the patterns observed in fixed income markets. Indeed, equilibrium risk premia and interest rates have a different functional form than in the standard model, due to an ambiguity aversion premium. Moreover, otherwise unpriced factors in the standard model receive a premium for model uncertainty which is of a particularly rich structure in the multiple factors setting. Examples of the impact of ambiguity aversion on popular factor models of the term structure are derived, both in cases for which the `level of concern' ambiguity is time- varying and in cases for which it is time invariant...|$|E

The methodological perspective included probit regression and log-linear models, as well as cluster analysis. The main results refer to testing the concept of lifestyle calibration, that we proposed in the paper, on the selected population of young European graduates. A total of four groups, two exhibiting a good lifestyle calibration, {{and the other two}} a poor lifesyle calibration, were obtained. Each family of two groups constitutes a lifestyle type, which is characterized in the paper according to values-behaviours coordination, time allocation and its relation to life satisfaction, defined as an estimator of lifestyle calibration.

40|$|This {{research}} explores questions {{relating to}} ornamentation in North Indian classical vocal music with particular reference to ba 1 khayil. At a technical level it addresses the question, "What is 'ornamentation' in khayal. ?" and subsequently approaches the question, "How does ornamentation transform simple melodic ideas into aesthetic experiences?" The study re-examines the possible origins {{and evolution of}} khayl as a context for subsequent examination and analysis of ornamentation in performance practice. The study examines the components of rga <b>structure</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> stages; <b>Chapter</b> II discusses the tripartite structure of ruti, svara and phrase {{with reference to the}} sastraic tradition as well as to twentieth century sources. The components are found to represent different levels of melodic activity. The discussion is continued in Chapter III where additional components of rga are introduced. 'Ornamentation' proves to be inadequate as a term to describe the many aspects of melodic movement which take place in performance. Consequently this term has to be redefined in the context of khayil and the problem of terminology addressed. The study shows the presence of an accumulative process whereby components of rãga, including gamaka and alaipkra, work at different levels. Their combination expands simple melodic ideas thus creating the melodic texture of performance. Transcription and analysis of a three-level demonstration of ãipa illustrates this process. Additional aspects of gamaka in relation to phrasal structures are subsequently discussed. The last <b>two</b> <b>chapters</b> expand the frame of reference for the discussion relating to amaka and alaqikira. Chapter VI relates the findings of the foregoing chapters to the musical context of lãpa while Chapter VII discusses gamaka within a wider cultural context...|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} supramolecular {{chemistry}} is a detailed knowledge of fundamental molecular properties and non-covalent interactions, which {{is dedicated to}} the preparation of novel structures as functional materials. Here we discuss the design and synthesis of such new molecular self-assemblies. Based on the structures and properties of these molecules, this dissertation describes the two types of supramolecular <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different <b>chapters.</b> Chapter 1 deals with the design, preparation, characterization and applications of chiral, bio-degradable, guest-specific and environment-friendly nanoporous crystalline dipeptides. In the hydrogen-bonded networks, dipeptides with hydrophobic L-amino acid residues are known to form pores of different diameters, ranging from 3 - 10 Å. The hydrophobic bulk and orientations of the side chains of these dipeptides provide further scope for structure-based modifications to fine-tune their pore dimensions. Thus, towards the liberation of space occupied by bulky hydrophobic terminals of the amino acid side chains from the periphery of channels, a series of dipeptides from non-proteinogenic and proteinogenic amino acids have been synthesized, crystallized and analyzed by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The majority of these dipeptides were obtained as porous structures. As nanoporous materials, a few of these dipeptides were studied for CO 2 and methane gas absorption and selectivity. Chapter 2 demonstrates the supramolecular synthesis of charge-assisted complexes from binary acid-base components. The well-directed hydrogen bond formation between acids and bases is a very useful tool in designing new supramolecular assemblies. Here we pursued an approach to use 1, 5, 7 triazabicyclo[4. 4. 0]-dec- 5 -ene, a guanidine derivative, with di- or monocarboxylic acids to generate guanidinium-carboxylate complexes. These molecular structures were designed to explore the effects of limited hydrogen-bond forming ability of guanidinium moiety and carboxylate group, and to check the propensity of guanidinuimcarboxylate complexes for the inclusion of guest molecules, for instance the water molecules. In fact, these complexes in crystals have interacted with the water molecules or carboxyl groups {{in the absence of any}} other potential donors and formed different water networks and 1 D molecular pattern, which as organic materials may find various future applications as proton conductors, selective ion channels and gelators etc...|$|R
40|$|Nos dias atuais, muito se tem falado sobre o aquecimento global e suas possÃveis causas, mas o consenso cientÃfico identifica os nÃveis aumentados de gases de efeito estufa produzidos pela atividade humana como a {{principal}} influÃncia. Uma das alternativas para se reduzir as emissÃes de gases-estufa Ã substituir os combustÃveis fÃsseis por fontes renovÃveis, como o biodiesel. O processo de produÃÃo de biodiesel Ã composto das seguintes etapas: preparaÃÃo da matÃria-prima, reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo, separaÃÃo de fases, recuperaÃÃo e desidrataÃÃo do Ãlcool, destilaÃÃo da glicerina e purificaÃÃo desse combustÃvel renovÃvel, tendo como subproduto a glicerina e como resÃduo Ãgua de purificaÃÃo. Uma vez que, para cada 100 L de biodiesel sÃo produzidos 10 kg de glicerina bruta e gera em mÃdia 60 L de Ãgua residuÃria, estudar alternativas para o aproveitamento economicamente viÃvel da glicerina e tratamento da Ãgua residuÃria tornou-se um aspecto importante nessa cadeia produtora. Com o intuito de atender estes pressupostos, esta tese estruturouse em dois capÃtulos. No CapÃtulo 1 foi abordado o Tratamento da Ãgua residuÃria da produÃÃo de biodiesel em sistema de flotaÃÃo por ar dissolvido (FAD), no qual foram testados dois coagulantes (sulfato de alumÃnio e cloreto fÃrrico) e dois auxiliares de floculaÃÃo (polifloc e tanfloc). O experimento foi realizado no LaboratÃrio de Saneamento Ambiental da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do ParanÃ, utilizando-se um Jar Test adaptado para realizaÃÃo dos ensaios de flotaÃÃo. A combinaÃÃo que mostrou melhor eficiÃncia na clarificaÃÃo do efluente com remoÃÃo de cor e turbidez e tambÃm melhor eficiÃncia na remoÃÃo de Ãleos e graxas e DQO foi sulfato de alumÃnio combinado ao polÃmero sintÃtico polifloc em pH 6 e taxas de recirculaÃÃo de 15 %. No CapÃtulo 2 foi estudada a produÃÃo de metano na co-digestÃo anaerÃbia de glicerina e Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Durante o processo foi testado o incremento na produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano com o aumento da carga orgÃnica inicial, efetuada pela adiÃÃo de glicerol como substrato. O experimento foi realizado na Universidade TÃcnica de Lisboa/Instituto Superior de Agronomia, num reator anaerÃbio de mistura completa de escala laboratorial. A adiÃÃo de glicerol na razÃo 3 % v/v se mostrou eficiente no incremento da produÃÃo de metano. Nowadays, {{much has been}} said about global warming and its possible causes, but the scientific consensus identifies increased levels of greenhouse gases produced by human activity as the main influence. One alternative to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases is to replace fossil fuels with renewable sources such as biodiesel. The process of biodiesel production is composed of the following steps: preparation of raw material, the transesterification reaction, phase separation, recovery and dehydration of alcohol, glycerine distillation and purification of this renewable fuel, with the byproduct glycerin and water as waste purification. Since, for each 100 liters of biodiesel, 10 kg of crude glycerin are produced, generating on average 60 liters of wastewater. Therefore, studying alternatives to the use of glycerin and economically viable treatment of wastewater has become an important aspect of this production chain. In order to meet these assumptions, this thesis is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>chapters.</b> In Chapter 1, we tackle the treatment of wastewater from biodiesel production system in dissolved air flotation (DAF), which was tested in two coagulants (aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride) and two auxiliary of flocculation (polifloc and tanfloc). The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Environmental Sanitation of the State University of ParanÃ, using a Jar Test adapted for testing of flotation. The combination showed better efficiency in the clarification of the effluent to remove color and turbidity and also better efficiency in removing oil and grease and COD was combined with aluminum sulfate polifloc synthetic polymer at pH 6 and recirculation rates of 15 %. In Chapter 2 we studied the production of methane in anaerobic co-digestion of glycerin and swine wastewater. During the process tested the increment in biogas production and methane with increasing initial organic load, performed by the addition of glycerol as substrate. The experiment was conducted at the Technical University of Lisbon/ Institute of Agronomy, in a complete mix anaerobic reactor of laboratory scale. The addition of glycerol in the ratio of 3 % v / v proved effective in increasing the production of methane...|$|E

This thesis details the attempt to design and synthesis a range of ligands and organocatalysts based on a common backbone design. Initial results were promising {{with a number of}} ligands being generated from our common C 2 -symmetric backbone. Unfortunately none of the molecules synthesises gave promising results in test reactions. Variations on the initial design also failed to give any encouraging results. More positively, work on phosphorus-nitrogen (P,N) ligands was successful, with a number of different ligands being synthesised and metal complexes prepared. Pleasingly we were able to obtain X-ray crystallography of one of these complexes indicating that the ligand was complexed to the metal via the phosphorus moiety. Work using the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction for coupling aryl bromides to both 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinoline was successful, with methodology being developed which we believe {{can be applied to the}} synthesis of Ancistrocladinium A. In particular the coupling between 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline and 1 -bromonaphthalene afforded us the full carbon skeleton of the ring system of the natural product in one step, from which we were able to generate the iminium salt.

It is with considerable trepidation that I am passing along this manuscript online, because I am altogether too aware of its many flaws and imperfections. At times, cognitive linguists will find the diversions into obscure philosophical debates, and so are hereby advised that chapter 5 is most central to their concerns, though I lay important groundwork on the theory of disanalogous metaphoric inferences and on recursive metaphoric <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> <b>chapters</b> <b>two</b> and three respectively. Philosophers—especially those {{who are interested in}} my analysis of the Greeks—are similarly advised that chapter 5 contains a long and summary of cognitive linguistics, but they have the advantage that the manuscript is organized so that I begin by addressing their concerns. And to those of you who also have dual inclinations, I can only apologize for the incessant recapitulations and highly technical prose whose infelicities cannot aid the clarity of my argument. I had hoped to write something as clear and straightforward as Macchiavelli’s The Prince, but instead I am afraid you find herein more of Joyce’s Ulysses.

40|$|The thesis {{attempts}} to analyse both theoretically and empirically {{the relationship between}} firm performance and organizational structure. The chosen measure of performance is profit. To this end <b>Chapter</b> <b>Two</b> reviews the work of Williamson (103, 104, 109) {{and others on the}} classification of the structure of large firms. Hypotheses concerning superiority are considered. However, {{it may be that the}} <b>structures</b> considered <b>in</b> <b>Chapter</b> <b>Two,</b> are only appropriate to stable environments. Hence Chapter Three develops a simple model of optimal decentralization under differing environmental conditions and considers existing organizational structures that may be most appropriate to the highly unstable environment of research and development. Chapter Four reports empirical analysis involving the use of organizational structure as an independent (dummy) variable. The sample consists of 82 companies in five industries where the environment is considered stable. Hence the classification scheme of Williamson and Bhargava (109) seems to be appropriate. Equations are presented using both price-cost margins and a rate of return on capital as the measure of profitability. The organizational dummy is highly significant in all cases, seemingly indicating that organizational <b>structure</b> matters <b>in</b> determining performance. However little evidence is found of specification bias in previous studies which excluded the organizational dummy. Possible important omissions from the equations are reviewed. A comparison is made of the variations in the results between those equations using price-cost margins as the dependent variable and those using a rate of return. No conclusions are drawn about superiority. In order to exclude non-divisionalized enterprise which cause problems in Chapter Four, Chapter Five considers a sample of 36 conglomerates. However, although positive, the organizational dummy failed in general to reach statistical significance. Possible explanations are considered which, if correct, may require public policy to be essentially ad hoc in nature...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Carson College of Business, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} takes a {{two-pronged approach}} into exploring best practices to optimize supply chains through procurement and distribution. Specifically, I develop three models to help managers make better business decisions regarding their procurement policies when facing quantity discounts and their usage of different distribution channels {{when there are}} varying types and levels of retail competition. <b>Chapters</b> <b>Two</b> and Three develop solution techniques to the shared resource allocation problem {{in the presence of}} quantity discounts and with the opportunity to expand or reduce the capacity level. This type of multi-item inventory system has two common ordering structures. The first considers each item independently, and thus the firm must keep their capacity level such that they can handle a situation where all items are ordered simultaneously. The second ordering structure links the timing of orders for all items to avoid a situation where all items are ordered simultaneously. I develop models to determine efficient procurement policies when facing these <b>two</b> ordering <b>structures</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chapters</b> <b>Two</b> and Three, respectivelyIn Chapter Four I develop a model to help manufacturers determine their equilibrium distribution policy. More specifically, whether they should sell their product directly through a manufacturer-owned retailer or online, or indirectly through an intermediary such as an independent retailer. Introducing asymmetries in product substitutability and brand equity as well as different forms of competition causes the equilibrium channel structure to vary widely. Depending on the levels of asymmetry and competition, there are multiple equilibrium channel structures, including a case where it is beneficial to utilize both, or dual channels. Outside of the modeling chapters, in Chapter Five I utilize two managerial surveys related to common practices of quantity discounts from both buyers' and sellers' perspectives. The benefits of these surveys are two-fold: first, it provides an up-to-date perspective into industry's usage of quantity discounts, and second, it identifies research gaps that can help unify the interests of researchers and practitioners. A major area for future exploration is the development of quantity discount training scenarios. The survey results indicated a lack of fundamental understanding of the basic guidelines associated with quantity discounts. Carson College of Business, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} thiadiazolidine 1 -oxides and structurally related compounds as ligands in palladium catalysis. The introduction will provide background information on subjects related {{to the work of}} the main project. Palladium catalysed cross couplings, namely the Heck and Tsuji-Trost reactions, will feature prominently and will be discussed in basic detail. A general outline of different classes of ligands used in palladium catalysis will also be put forward. Extraneous factors which affect catalyst reactivity will also be discussed, including the use of microwave irradiation and the effect of additives. Special attention is paid towards sulfur containing ligands. As their use has been relatively limited this will also include other areas of catalysis. Investigations into the synthesis of esermethole prompt a general background of methods of synthesising oxindoles and also examples of previous syntheses of the compound. The second chapter begins by describing the initial exploratory work, the testing of a thiadiazolidine 1 -oxide compound as a ligand for the Heck reaction. Aryl iodides are successfully coupled to a range of styrenes and α,β-unsaturated esters in excellent yields under microwave conditions. Aryl bromides are also successfully coupled after some optimisation. In many cases the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide is required to prevent shattering of the sealed microwave vial. A range of differently substituted thiadiazolidine 1 -oxides were synthesised in order to establish a pattern of reactivity based on steric and electronic factors. Structurally related chiral compounds were also synthesised, including the first reported enantiomerically pure thiadiazol- 3 -one 1 -oxide and thiatriaza-indene 3 -oxide systems chiral at the sulfur atom. The synthesis of oxindoles using palladium mediated and non-catalytic chemistry was also investigated. Investigations into the synthesis of esermethole were undertaken; the key stereoinducing reaction, the decarboxylative asymmetric allyic alkylation reaction, achieved a 46 % ee. A formal synthesis of esermethole was outlined in 8 steps from commercially available material. The third chapter is the experimental section and is dedicated to the methods of synthesis and characterization of the compounds mentioned in the previous chapter.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of olefins mediated by chiral iminum salts. The first chapter introduces {{some of the}} most novel and effective catalytic asymmetric methods for preparing chiral oxiranes. The second chapter is divided into three sections. The first section of <b>chapter</b> <b>two</b> is dedicated to our efforts to develop new aqueous oxidative conditions using both hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite as efficient, green oxidants that remove the temperature boundaries observed with the use of Oxone® as the stoichiometric oxidant. A wider range of available temperatures was examined allowing optimization of both oxidative systems. Ethereal hydrogen peroxide was observed to mediate asymmetric epoxidation within an acetonitrile monophasic co-solvent system giving enantioselectivities of up to 56 %. When sodium hypochlorite was used in a biphasic solvent system in conjunction with dichloromethane; it was observed to mediate oxidation of the substrate alkenes in up to 71 % ee. The second and third sections of <b>chapter</b> <b>two</b> are dedicated to our efforts to synthesize chiral iminium salts as catalysts for asymmetric epoxidation based on a biphenyl azepinium salt catalyst structure. From previous work within the Page group, the asymmetric synthesis and subsequent defined stereochemistry of a chiral carbon atom α to the iminium nitrogen atom was shown to have significant effect on the enantiocontrol of epoxidation using the iminium salt catalyst. Work was completed on biphenyl azepinium salt catalysts, inserting an alkyl or aryl Grignard reagent into the iminium bond using a pre-defined dioxane unit as a chiral auxiliary. Oxidation of the subsequent azepine gave a single diastereoisomerically pure azepinium salt. The methyl analogue of this sub-family of azepinium catalysts has been shown to give up to 81 % ee for epoxidation of 1 -phenylcyclohexene, furthermore, the binaphthalene azepinium salt with an additional methyl group was also synthesized and was shown to give up to 93 % for epoxidation of 1 -phenylcyclohexene. Continuation of the substitution α to the nitrogen atom gave rise to an interesting tetracyclic (biphenyl) azepinum salt catalyst. Construction of an asymmetric oxazolidine ring unit encapsulating the azepinium nitrogen and one of the methylene carbon atoms was achieved. <b>In</b> doing so <b>two</b> chiral centres α to the nitrogen atom were generated. The azepinium chiral carbon atom was populated by an addition methyl group with variation in the substitution on the oxazolidine chiral carbon atom. The benzyl analogue of this sub-family of tetracyclic azepinium catalysts has shown to give up to 79 % ee for epoxidation 1 -phenylcyclohexene.

40|$|Finding the {{numerical}} solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations of nonlinear nature has become somewhat possible, {{during the last}} few decades, due to the evolution of efficient computing. However, the governing equations for fluid flow are difficult to address in terms of finding analytical solutions. This difficulty lies in the highly nonlinear nature of these equations. Thus, it has always been a challenging task for mathematicians and engineers to find possible exact/approximate analytical and numerical solutions of these equations. The analytical results have great advantage in the sense that; it helps to make comparison with exact numerical solution ensuring the reliability of the two results and also helps to explain the underlying physics of fluid. The analytical solutions are further useful to develop an insight for the development of new analytical techniques and for the modeling of new exciting fluid flow problems in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. There has been a continuously increasing interest of the researchers to investigate the boundarylayer fluid flow problems over a stretching/shrinking surface. It is now known that surface shear stress and heat transfer rate for both viscous and non-Newtonian fluid are different. These stretching and shrinking velocities can be of various types such as liner, power law and exponential. Thus our main objective in this thesis is to analyze some boundary layer flow problems due to stretching/shrinking sheet with different types of velocities analytically. Both transient and steady forced and mixed convection flows are considered. The present thesis is mainly <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> parts. <b>Chapters</b> 3 to 5 consist of transient and steady mixed convection boundary layer flow of Newtonian and some classes of non-Newtonian fluids with linear stretching and shrinking cases. Chapters 6 to 8 present the investigation of exponential stretching case. The chapters of the thesis are arranged in the following fashion. Chapter 1 dealt with the previous literature related to boundary layer stretched flows of viscous and non- Newtonian fluids. Chapter 2 includes the basic equations of fluid flow and heat transfer. Definitions of dimensionless physical parameters are also presented here. Chapter 3 explores unsteady mixed convection flow of a viscous fluid saturating porous medium adjacent to a heated/cooled semi-infinite stretching vertical sheet. Analysis is presented {{in the presence of a}} heat source. The unsteadiness in the flow is caused by continuous stretching of the sheet and continuous increase in the surface temperature. Both analytical and numerical solutions of the problem are given. The effects of emerging parameters on field quantities are examined and discussed. The magnetohydrodynamic boundary layer flow of Casson fluid over a shrinking sheet with heat transfer is investigated in Chapter 4. Interesting solution behavior is observed with multiple solution branches for a certain range of magnetic field parameter. Laminar twodimensionalunsteady flow and heat transfer of an upper convected, an incompressible Maxwell fluid saturates the porous medium past a continuous stretching sheet is studied in Chapter 5. The velocity and temperature distributions are assumed to vary according to a power-law form. The governing boundary layer equations are reduced to local non-similarity equations. The resulting equations are solved analytically using perturbation method. Steady state solutions of the governing equations are obtained using the implicit finite difference method and by local nonsimilarity method. A good agreement of the results computed by different methods has been observed. Chapter 6 addresses the steady mixed convection boundary layer flow near a two-dimensional stagnation- point of a viscous fluid towards a vertical stretching sheet. Both cases of assisting and opposing flows are considered. The governing nonlinear boundary layer equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations by similarity transformation. Implicit finite difference scheme is implemented for numerical simulation. The features of the flow and heat transfer characteristics for different values of the governing parameters are analyzed and discussed. Chapter 7 examines the boundary layer flow of a viscous fluid. The flow is due to exponentially stretching of a surface. Unsteady mixed convection flow in the region of stagnation point is considered. The resulting system of nonlinear partial differential equations is reduced to local non-similar boundary layer equations using a new similarity transformation. A comparison of the perturbation solutions for different time scales is made with the solution obtained for all time through the implicit finite difference scheme (Keller-box method). Attention is focused to investigate the effect of emerging parameters on the flow quantities. Chapter 8 aims to investigate the boundary layer flow of nanofluids. The flow here is induced by an exponentially stretching surface with constant temperature. The mathematical formulation of this problem involves the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis. Numerical solution is presented by two independent methods namely nonlinear shooting method, and finite difference method. The effects of embedded parameters on the flow fields are investigated.

40|$|In 2000, the United Nations {{committed}} to the Millennium Declaration (UN 2000), a global partnership to eradicate poverty and foster development, which embodied eight time-bound targets covering various aspects of human deprivations, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The first MDG focus on poverty and food insecurity, {{with the aim of}} halving their proportions, as measured by the World Bank $ 1 dollar-a-day headcount and by the FAO Prevalence of Undernourishment, by 2015. Despite the broad agreement on the overall objective, however, the dispute on how to measure poverty and food insecurity is, as of yet, as pervasive and impassioned than ever in both academic and policy circles. Many commentators have in fact questioned whether the two resource-based metrics used to track progress in the MDG 1 can satisfactory capture the inherent complexities characterising the concepts of poverty and food insecurity. Implicitly, such a stark disagreement emphasises the fundamental role that evaluative assessments play in policy-making, from design and formulation to monitoring and evaluation. The present Thesis aims at assessing poverty and food insecurity by grounding the evaluative exercise in the overall theoretical framework of the Capability Approach (CA). Specifically, the present work is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> three main Parts: while Part A provides the conceptual and methodological framework for rest of the dissertation, Parts B and C respectively focus on the analysis of food security and childhood poverty. In particular, Part A is <b>structured</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> main <b>chapters,</b> which, respectively, address the three basic steps that are required in any measure of deprivation: choice of the space of the analysis on the one hand, and identification and aggregation in multidimensional spaces on the other. Later, Part B of the dissertation focuses on the measurement of food security. Chapter 3 provides an original conceptual framework for the assessment of the following chapters, while Chapter 4 reviews available measures of food security. In turn, Chapter 5 presents an original methodology to select indicators in multidimensional assessments and in turn applies it to the choice of a suite of indicators of food security, and Chapter 6 develop a multidimensional measure of food security based on the latent variable methodology. In this framework, countries’ “capability to be food secure” {{can be seen as a}} latent construct that is manifested through a vector of measurement indicators and in turn is influenced by some economic, social, and institutional factors. Finally, Part C of the dissertation is concerned with the measurement of multidimensional childhood poverty and the modelling of its medium-term effects. By grounding the analysis in the CA, the Chapter attempts for the first time to bridge the gap between the literatures on the measurement of children’s multidimensional poverty and the one on Early Child Development (ECD), which scrutinises the effects of deprivations experienced in utero and in the first three years on later achievements. By using data from Young Lives, an innovative longitudinal study on childhood poverty in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam, the Chapter empirically addresses the critical question of whether the experience of multiple deprivations is dynamically associated to worse cognitive attainments at different development stages (i. e. the preschool and primary school years). In doing so, it takes a step beyond the measurement of multidimensional poverty by scrutinising its potential effects on children’s cognitive development in various domains at age 5 and 8. Also, it asks whether the interaction across multiple dimensions of deprivations is dynamically complementary in leading to worst cognitive attainments. Despite the many difficulties that any operationalisation of the approach entail, the Thesis shows that there are theoretical, methodological and empirical advantages when the evaluative exercise is framed in the CA. On a theoretical basis, the conceptualisation of poverty and food insecurity as deprivations of critical capabilities sheds new light on their meaning and on the role they assume in the field of international development. Now, poverty and food insecurity are the worst forms of human unfreedoms conceivable. If, as in the CA, the ultimate end of development relates to the removal of the substantive unfreedoms that constrain the flourishing of human beings, the reduction of poverty and food insecurity is definitely a key priority in the development agenda, as also pointed out by the MDG framework. In the CA, capabilities are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. The empirical analysis of Chapters 6 and 7 shows such interconnectedness very well. In the case of the former, the empirical results show that countries’ food security is strongly and significantly associated to their levels in three critical capabilities: health, female education and income poverty. By the same token, the estimates included in Chapter 7 not only show that early childhood poverty matters in children’s later cognitive development, but also that other capabilities related to the children themselves, their care-givers and households reinforce the effect of early deprivation and amplify it over children’s life-course. This evidence underlines that a truly multidimensional approach to the analysis of childhood poverty and its dynamic repercussions is needed. This conclusion is also reinforced at the light that the empirical analyses show that a multidimensional approach to measurement is able to seize more effectively the complex nature of food insecurity and childhood poverty than single indicators. Finally, the empirical results show that country-specific institutional, social and environmental characteristics are fundamental factors in the determination of well-being outcomes. Sen refers to these elements as ‘instrumental freedoms’ (Sen 1999), and they represent the “enabling environment” that allows for the determination of the capabilities. This Thesis provides evidence-based research to critically inform the post-MDG agenda, as the goal is not to measure poverty and food insecurity – but to reduce them...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the effects}} of local, {{landscape}} and spatial variables on composition, abundance, functional traits and phylogeny of stream ichthyocenoses were analyzed. Based on fish species, environmental and spatial datasets from 52 (2012 samples) and 75 (2011 and 2012 samples) stream reaches located in the Machado River basin, {{in the state of}} Rondônia, three chapters were organized. The highlight of the chapter one was the ecological patterns of all species of entire metacommunity and fish assemblages according to their degree of habitat specialization (habitat generalists and habitat specialists). The three cenoses were environmentally structured, suggesting that the niche-based processes explain their <b>structure.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>chapter</b> <b>two,</b> the ecological processes that probably explain the obtained patterns were explored more deeply. Both functional and phylogenetic clustering was confirmed. Environmental variables, such as the proportion of ultisol in the microbasin and of grasses and bared soil in the riparian buffer, structure the assemblages that are associated with degraded streams (DS). On the other hand, the proportion of forest and of oxisoil in the microbasin; coarse litter, shrubs and trees in the stream riparian buffer, structure the assemblages that are associated with the preserved streams (PS). The environment also influences through environmental filter mechanisms, the consumption of algae and the nektonic position in the water column in DS, whereas influences the consumption of invertebrates debris and the nektobenthic position in the water column in PS. The DS and PS position is coincident with the different land uses. DS are concentrated in the central portion of the basin, where the soil is covered by pastures, and PS are in the extremes of the basin, where there are greater proportions of forests. Most species of Siluriformes and of Characidae are associated with DS, on the other hand, Gymnotiformes, some species of [...] . Na presente Tese, foram analisados os efeitos de variáveis locais, de paisagem e espaciais sobre a composição, abundância, traços funcionais e filogenia das ictiocenoses de riachos. Foram organizados três capítulos a partir da coleta da ictiofauna e dos dados ambientais e espaciais em 52 (coletas de 2012) e 75 (coletas de 2011 e 2012) trechos de riachos localizados ao longo da bacia do rio Machado, no estado de Rondônia. O foco do capítulo 1 foram os padrões ecológicos de todas as espécies da metacomunidade e das assembleias de peixes segundo a especialização do hábitat (hábitat especialistas e hábitat generalistas). As três cenoses foram estruturadas ambientalmente, sugerindo que são os processos baseados em nicho os que explicam a sua estrutura. No capítulo 2, exploramos mais a fundo os processos ecológicos que provavelmente explicam os padrões obtidos. Foi comprovado que há agrupamento nos traços funcionais e na filogenia. Variáveis ambientais, tais como a proporção de ultisolo na microbacia e gramíneas e barranco nu no buffer ripário, estruturam as assembleias associadas aos riachos degradados (RD). Por outro lado, a proporção de floresta e de oxisolo na microbacia; litter grosseiro, arbustos e árvores no buffer ripário do riacho estruturam as assembleias associadas aos riachos preservados (RP). O ambiente também influencia, através de mecanismos de filtros ambientais, o consumo de algas e a posição nectônica na coluna d'água nos RD, ao passo que influencia o consumo de restos de invertebrados e a posição nectobentônica na coluna d'água nos RP. A posição dos RD e RP é coincidente com os diferentes usos do solo, sendo os primeiros mais concentrados na porção central da bacia, onde o solo é usado para pastagens, e os RP nos extremos da bacia, onde há maiores proporções de florestas. A maioria das espécies das famílias Loricariidae e Characidae está associada aos RD, por outro lado, [...] ...|$|R
