5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E

The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the interim government, restored Saavedra's military rank and honours, but the rule was abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, the following supreme director. He moved then to the countryside, to live with his brother Luis. He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. <b>Sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that his}} wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto.

5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds.

The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased.

She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others <b>sympathetic</b> <b>to</b> the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes.

According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E

40|$|Media sources brought {{international}} attention to dog fighting during the Michael Vick case. Although {{a significant number}} of people who watched footage of the abused dogs used in the Vick case may have felt sympathy for them, the characteristics associated with those types of individuals are not known. The current study examined personality and gender as predictors of <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> the mistreatment of a bait dog depicted in a film clip. The results supported the predictions that animal-oriented sympathy, trait sympathy, agreeableness, and gender would predict <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> the bait dog. The analyses showed that trait sympathy could not explain unique variance beyond animal-oriented sympathy, however, and that agreeableness fully mediated the relation between gender and <b>sympathetic</b> reactions <b>to</b> the bait dog. Unexpectedly, emotional stability was also a unique predictor. Implications and limitations of these results are discussed...|$|R
