25|$|Sometimes SPI {{is called}} a {{four-wire}} serial bus, contrasting with three-, two-, and one-wire serial buses. The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous <b>serial</b> <b>interface,</b> but it {{is different from the}} Synchronous <b>Serial</b> <b>Interface</b> (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous serial communication protocol. SSI Protocol employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> which included GeoPort – a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to make a major change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E
25|$|Hayes Microcomputer Products was a U.S.-based {{manufacturer}} of modems. The company {{is well known}} for the Smartmodem, which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> to the data terminal equipment, in contrast to manual operation with front-panel switches. This smart modem approach dramatically simplified and automated operation. Today almost all modems use a variant of the Hayes command set.|$|E
25|$|Micron Technology's Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) stacked memory uses a <b>serial</b> <b>interface.</b> Many other {{computer}} buses have migrated towards replacing parallel buses with serial buses, {{for example}} by {{the evolution of}} Serial ATA replacing Parallel ATA, PCI Express replacing PCI, and serial ports replacing parallel ports. In general, serial buses are easier to scale up and have fewer wires/traces, making circuit boards using them easier to design.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{physical}} {{versions of}} SCSISerial Attached SCSI (SAS), SCSI-over-Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), and USB Attached SCSI (UAS)break {{from the traditional}} parallel SCSI standards and perform data transfer via serial communications. Although much of the SCSI documentation talks about the parallel interface, all modern development efforts use <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{have a number of}} advantages over parallel SCSI, including higher data rates, simplified cabling, longer reach, and improved fault isolation. The primary reason for the shift to <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> is the clock skew issue of high speed parallel interfaces, which makes the faster variants of parallel SCSI susceptible to problems caused by cabling and termination. [...] iSCSI preserves the basic SCSI paradigm, especially the command set, almost unchanged, through embedding of SCSI-3 over TCP/IP, predominantly on Ethernet which is also of serial nature.|$|R
50|$|Differential pairs {{generally}} carry differential or semi-differential signals, such as high-speed digital <b>serial</b> <b>interfaces</b> including LVDS differential ECL, PECL, LVPECL, Hypertransport, Ethernet over twisted pair, <b>Serial</b> Digital <b>Interface,</b> RS-422, RS-485, USB, Serial ATA, TMDS, FireWire, and HDMI etc. or else {{high quality}} and/or high frequency analog signals (e.g., video signals, balanced audio signals, etc.).|$|R
25|$|Computers: The {{on-board}} equipment centered around a 2-of-3 computer system. The original LZB 80 design used 8085 microprocessors programmed in assembly language. The programs were interrupt driven, with interrupts {{generated by a}} 70 ms clock, the track receivers and transmitters, the <b>serial</b> <b>interface,</b> and also within the program itself. Interrupts triggered comparison and output programs. Peripheral equipment was arranged around the computers with all interfaces electrically separated and all grounds tied to the cabinet frame which was tied to the vehicle chassis.|$|E
25|$|Jerold Kaplan of Walt Disney Imagineering {{designed}} and engineered the Earth Globe and supporting barge. The detailed engineering for the barge and its propulsion and control systems {{were provided by}} Glowacki Engineering of Orange Park, FL. The Earth Globe Barge was built by Sun State Marine Services in Green Cove Springs, FL and was delivered in four major components which were assembled on site. The LED video display {{is run by a}} Pentium II server running Microsoft Windows 95/8 using a Serial ATA drive. There are two servers constantly running the same programs at the same time for fail-safe support. If one goes down, they can instantly switch to the other server which presumably will still be running. The video control software, written by Derek Brown for Hitech Electronic Displays of Clearwater, Florida, communicates with on-board PLCs using two interfaces. The <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> is used to receive the 4 character command codes separated by spaces to signify the end of each command. The NIDAQ (National Instrument Data Acquisition) card is used to provide status back to the PLCs. There are 8 optically isolated status channels. One channel is used to provide a heartbeat signal to tell the PLC that the software is on and functioning. The file formats are uncompressed AVIs passed through a masking filter to put the pixels in the spots for the countries.|$|E
2500|$|MITS {{offered a}} {{complete}} Altair system with two MITS 4K Dynamic RAM boards, a <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> board and Altair BASIC for $995. However the $264 MITS RAM boards were unreliable due to several component and design problems. An enterprising Homebrew Computer Club member, Robert Marsh, designed a 4K static memory that was plug-in {{compatible with the}} Altair 8800 and sold for $255. His company was Processor Technology, {{one of the most}} successful Altair compatible board suppliers. Many Altair 8800 computer owners skipped the bundled package; purchased their memory boards from a third party supplier and used a [...] "borrowed" [...] copy of Altair BASIC.|$|E

2500|$|Synthesizers became {{easier to}} {{integrate}} and synchronize with other electronic instruments and controllers {{with the introduction}} of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in 1983. First proposed in 1981 by engineer Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits, the MIDI standard was developed by a consortium now known as the MIDI Manufacturers Association. MIDI is an opto-isolated <b>serial</b> <b>interface</b> and communication protocol. It provides for the transmission from one device or instrument to another of real-time performance data. [...] This data includes note events, commands for the selection of instrument presets (i.e. sounds, or programs or patches, previously stored in the instrument's memory), the control of performance-related parameters such as volume, effects levels and the like, as well as synchronization, transport control and other types of data. [...] MIDI interfaces are now almost ubiquitous on music equipment and are commonly available on personal computers (PCs).|$|E
