40|$|Bone {{ingrowth}} in porous {{surfaces of}} human joint implants is a desired condition for long-term fixation {{in patients who}} are physically active (such as in sport or work). It is generally recognized that little actual bone ingrowth occurs. The best clinical results report between 10 and 20 % of the total prosthetic surface in contact with bone will feature good bone ingrowth. One inhibiting factor is the relative motion of the bone {{with respect to the}} implant during load-bearing. This study investigated mathematically the interface micromotion (transverse reversible relative motion) between a flat metal tibia 1 prosthetic surface of a prototype implant, and the bone at the resection site. The aim was to assess the effect of perimeter fixation versus midcondylar pin fixation and the effect of plate thickness and plate stiffness. Results showed that in the prototype design the largest reversible relative bone motion occurred at the tibia 1 eminence. By design, the skirt fixation at the perimeter would prevent bone motion. A PCA (Howmedica Inc.) prosthesis has been widely used clinically and was chosen for a control because its fixation by two pegs beneath the condyles is a common variation on the general design of a relatively thick and stiff metal tibia 1 <b>support</b> <b>tray</b> wit...|$|E

40|$|Sustainability and environmentology are {{becoming}} important issues because {{the natural resources}} have been heavily consumed {{in the past century}} and major parts of them have been wasted on some one-time-use type of applications such as packaging. As an engineer, and more basically as a resident of our only earth, one is obligated to preserve the natural resources for the coming generations. One should not selfishly consume the limited natural resources found on the earth but should use these with appreciation of what we have been given. Designs for sustainability and environmentology in industrial packaging are studied in this research by means of reducing unnecessary usage of material, increase structure strength under limited amount of material and replacing plastics with environmentally friendly materials. These ideas are accomplished by incorporating some design concepts on generating new packaging structures. These designs include design of the core structures of sandwich board, design of <b>supporting</b> <b>tray</b> efficiently, and design of molded pulp with better reinforcements. Topology optimization of packaging structures utilizing environmental friendly materials is also studied in this dissertation to determine a set of packaging with less material whil...|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS Inner Detector {{comprises}} {{three different}} technologies: the Pixel detector (Pixel), the silicon strip tracker (SCT), and the transition radiation drift tube tracker (TRT). The {{material in the}} ATLAS Inner Detector is studied with several methods, using the pp collision sample collected at √(s) = 13 TeV in 2015. The material within the innermost barrel regions of the ATLAS Inner Detector is studied using reconstructed hadronic interaction and photon conversion vertices from samples of minimum bias events. It {{was found that the}} description of the Insertable B-Layer, which is the new, innermost Pixel layer installed in 2014, in the geometry model was missing some material components. After updating the model, data and simulation show good agreement at the barrel region. The Pixel services (cables, cooling pipes, <b>support</b> <b>trays)</b> were modified between the Pixel and SCT detectors in 2014. The material in this region is also studied by investigating the efficiency with which tracks reconstructed only in the Pixel detector can be matched to tracks reconstructed in the Pixel and SCT detectors. The track extension efficiencies in samples of minimum bias events in data and simulation are observed to agree well in the barrel region. Some discrepancies are observed in the Pixel service region at forward pseudorapidities.

40|$|Abstract – A {{new type}} of high {{precision}} electromagnetic suspension (EMS) which can <b>support</b> heavy <b>tray</b> along long stroke rail is proposed in this paper. Compared with the conventional EMS, the suggested moving-core typed EMS has the levitation electromagnets (EMs) on the fixed rail. This scheme has high load capability caused by iron-core and enables simple tray structure. Also {{it does not have}} precision degradation caused by heat generation from EMs, which is a drawback of conventional EMS. With these merits, the proposed EMS can be an optimal contactless linear bearing in next generation flat panel display (FPD) manufacturing process if the ability of long stroke movement is proved. So a special Section Switching Algorithm (SSA) is derived from the resultant force and moment equations of the levitated tray which enables long stroke movement of the tray. In order to verify the feasibility of the suggested SSA, a simple test-setup of the EMS with 2 Section-changes is made up and servo-controlled in the simulation and experiment. The simulation shows the perfect changeover the EMs, and the experiment shows overall control performance of under ± 40 μm gap deviations. These results reveal that the newly suggested contactless linear bearing can simultaneously achieve high load capability and precision gap control as well as long stroke...|$|R

40|$|Pipe racks are {{steel frame}} {{structures}} used to <b>support</b> piping, cables, <b>trays</b> etc. at {{oil and gas}} facilities onshore and offshore. Pipe racks may vary in design but thefundamental principals are the same. The geometry is therefore suitable for automate design. The main goal of this thesis was to establish a geometric foundation for onshorepipe rack implementation in knowledge based engineering (KBE) design. Loadsand geometry is based on models and design briefs from the onshore Ormen Langefacility at Nyhamna, Norway and Eurocodes for steel structures. Four heights, three widths, three lengths and two support conditions are combinedto make the models presented in this work. These parameters are chosen basedon observations of existing onshore pipe racks and specifications from the provideddesign briefs. Combined with 11 load cases these parameters results {{in a total of}} 36 analyses. All structures have been designed according to ultimate limit state (ULS), accidental limit state (ALS) and service ability limit state (SLS) design codes, where it is placed emphasis on ULS design codes. The results from this work is found in appendix D. Profile types have been chosen based on both geometric properties and capacity,where the geometric properties are governed by a design hierarchy. All calculations and assumptions are {{based on the fact that}} this is an early stagedesign. Results from the work carried out in this assignment is hence not a finalproduct.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} utility of {{piezoelectric}} transduction to assess the structural health of a system through impedance analysis, with application {{to the field of}} ‘smart’ orthopaedic implants. The work is motivated by the high proportion of orthopaedic implant failures that occur due to loosening of the bond between the implant and the corresponding bone surface. The ultimate aim is to prove that piezoelectric sensors embedded within orthopaedic implants have the potential identify implant loosing before it would be shown in imaging techniques. Orthopaedic knee implants were selected as a case study for proof of concept for the proposed health monitoring system. Three distinct experiments were conducted: 1) Small piezoelectric sensors are attached to model tibial trays which are in turn attached with bone cement to sawbone blocks. The measured sensor impedance over a range of input frequencies is measured and analysis of the frequency impedance traces is carried out to determine what changes in the trace are indicative of the bone cement between the sawbone and aluminium curing; 2) Commercially available tibial trays cemented to sawbone tibias are progressively loosened under a fatigue load in a compressive testing rig. Results from three Linear Variable Differential Transducers (LVDTs) measuring the micromotion between the implant and sawbone are compared with frequencyMimpedance traces taken from a piezoelectric sensor attached to the top side of the tibial tray; and 3) Varying amounts of bone cement is used to cover the surface between a sawbone block and model tibial tray. Frequency-impedance readings are taken from a piezoelectric sensor adhered to the top side of the <b>tray.</b> <b>Support</b> vector machines are used to classify between the varying amounts of cement on each test sample. Experimental results and data analysis demonstrate the potential of piezoelectric sensors ability to provide information on the integrity of bone cement bond. Findings include: 1) Piezoelectric sensors can determine at what point bone cement bond between sawbone and an aluminium plate has cured; and 2) It is possible to identify different levels of cement coverage between sawbone and aluminium plate with an accuracy of up to 92...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of a {{contoured}} foam seat (CFS) on postural alignment and on a functional upper extremity activity of engagement with toys in infants with neuromotor impairments. Parental perceptions regarding the use and effects of the CFS at home were also assessed. The participants were four infants, ages 9 to 18 months, with diagnoses including cerebral palsy and Down syndrome who were unable to sit independently. An individualized, contoured foam seat was fabricated for each participant. A randomized, alternating treatments design was employed which included the following three interventions: (1) Treatment A was a commercial highchair; (2) Treatment B was the commercial highchair with a thin foam liner on the seat; and (3) Treatment C was the CFS used as an insert in the commercial highchair. Infants were videotaped for 5 -minute observation periods, alternating Treatment A during the baseline phase and alternating Treatments B and C during the intervention phase. Using momentary time sampling, postural alignment was rated from videotapes by blinded raters using anatomical markers and visual guides placed on the highchair back. Engagement with toys was rated by recording the number of hands in contact with a toy and the number of hands or forearms in contact with the highchair tray. A semi-structured interview was conducted with mothers of the participants following three weeks of CFS use at home. Results indicated a clear, sustained effect of the CFS on improving postural alignment for all participants. The data did not support an effect of the CFS on increasing bimanual play for any participants. For two participants, increased ability to play with toys while arms were free from <b>support</b> of the <b>tray</b> was observed when using the CFS. All four mothers reported that they liked using the CFS, and that they believed the CFS had beneficial effects for themselves and their infants. These findings supported the efficacy of a low-cost seating intervention for infants with a variety of neuromotor impairments. Suggestions for other dependent measures reflective of functional skills for infants and ideas for future efficacy studies of adaptive seating devices were described...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{packings}} trays {{are more}} cost effective column internals because {{they create a}} large interfacial area for mass transfer by {{the interaction of the}} vapour on the liquid. The <b>tray</b> <b>supports</b> a mass of froth or spray which on most trays (including the most widely used sieve trays) is not in any way controlled. The two important results of the gas/liquid interaction are the tray efficiency and the tray throughput or capacity. After many years of practical experience, both may be predicted by empirical correlations, despite the lack of understanding. It is known that the tray efficiency is in part determined by the liquid flow pattern and the throughput by the liquid froth height which in turn depends on the liquid hold-up and vapour velocity. This thesis describes experimental work on sieve trays in an air-water simulator, 2. 44 m in diameter. The liquid flow pattern, for flow rates similar to those used in commercial scale distillation, was observed experimentally by direct observation; by water-cooling, to simulate mass transfer; use of potassium permanganate dye to observe areas of longer residence time; and by height of clear liquid measurements across the tray and in the downcomer using manometers. This work presents experiments designed to evaluate flow control devices proposed to improve the gas liquid interaction and hence improve the tray efficiency and throughput. These are (a) the use of intermediate weirs to redirect liquid to the sides of the tray so as to remove slow moving/stagnant liquid and (b) the use of vapour-directing slots designed to use the vapour to cause liquid to be directed towards the outlet weir thus reducing the liquid hold-up at a given rate i. e. increased throughput. This method also has the advantage of removing slow moving/stagnant liquid. In the experiments using intermediate weirs, which were placed in the centre of the tray. it was found that in general the effect of an intermediate weir depends on the depth of liquid downstream of the weir. If the weir is deeper than the downstream depth it will cause the upstream liquid to be deeper than the downstream liquid. If the weir is not as deep as deep as the downstream depth it may have little or no effect on the upstream depth. An intermediate weir placed at an angle to the direction of flow of liquid increases the liquid towards the sides of the tray without causing an increase in liquid hold-up/ froth height. The maximum proportion of liquid caused to flow sideways by the weir is between 5 % and 10 %. Experimental work using vapour-directing slots on a rectangular sieve tray has shown that the horizontal momentum that is imparted to the liquid is dependent upon the size of the slot. If too much momentum is transferred to the liquid it causes hydraulic jumps to occur {{at the mouth of the}} slot coupled with liquid being entrained, The use of slots also helps to eliminate the hydraulic gradient across sieve trays and provides a more uniform froth height on the tray. By comparing the results obtained of the tray and point efficiencies, it is shown that a slotted tray reduces both values by approximately 10 %. This reduction is due to the fact that with a slotted tray the liquid has a reduced residence time Ion the tray coupled also with the fact that large size bubbles are passing through the slots. The effectiveness of using vapour-directing slots on a full circular tray was investigated by using dye to completely colour the biphase. The removal of the dye by clear liquid entering the tray was monitored using an overhead camera. Results obtained show that the slots are successful in their aim of reducing slow moving liquid from the sides of the tray, The net effect of this is an increase in tray efficiency. Measurements of slot vapour-velocity found it to be approximately equal to the hole velocity...|$|R
