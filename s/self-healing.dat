This passivation and the <b>self-healing</b> properties by the chromate stored in the {{chromate conversion}} coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and <b>self-healing</b> in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E

The seeds of Common <b>self-heal</b> were investigated for proteins, fatty acid compositions and polyphenolic compounds. The protein content was analyzed according to Dumas method, the extraction of oil was done using a cold extraction technique employing 2 : 1 chloroform/methanol as solvent, the fatty acid composition was determined using the gas chromatography and the amount of polyphenolic compounds were estimated using the method as described in European Pharmacopoeia, 8 th edition.

40|$|Abstract Functional microcirculatory {{aspects of}} burned sites were {{examined}} including areas of <b>self-healed</b> burns, and grafted areas. Donor areas were also examined. In 10 patients with burns {{in the lower}} limbs, both <b>self-healed</b> and with grafts, the microcirculatory response was evaluated by Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measuring for each site the resting flux at 36 degrees, the postural venular-arteriolar reflex (VAR) and the flux at 41 degrees (heating). The first evaluation was carried out on discharge, and subsequently at approximately 45 day intervals during uniform therapy follow-up (elastocompression). The burn-affected area (<b>self-healed,</b> graft) and those donor areas present should increase resting flux by comparison with control areas. This was particularly so in the <b>self-healed</b> burn, which does however tend to converge in time towards control values. Response to stress tests (VAR and heating) presents percentage variations similar to normal skin in the various areas, {{with the exception of}} the grafted areas which present a reduced response in the 1 st weeks following engraftment. No significant differences in response to heating were detected. It can be suggested that these differences are due to anatomic variations in revascularization and healing in the different areas as well as to alterations in microvascular innervation and local response to vasoactive substances...|$|R

25|$|In this case, it {{may happen}} that the {{hydroxide}} {{formed in the}} first step becomes mechanically detached from the metallic aluminum surface {{and will not be}} transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The initial <b>self-healing</b> process for building a new oxide layer is prevented by a defect or a weak dielectric point, and generated hydrogen gas escapes into the capacitor. Then, at the weak point, further formation of aluminum hydroxide is started, and prevented from converting into stable aluminum oxide. The <b>self-healing</b> of the oxide layer inside the electrolytic capacitor can't take place. However, reactions do not come to a standstill, as more and more hydroxide grows in the pores of the anode foil, and the first reaction step produces more and more hydrogen gas in the can, increasing the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Metallized film {{capacitors}} have <b>self-healing</b> properties, {{and small}} imperfections do {{not lead to}} the destruction of the component, which makes these capacitors suitable for RFI/EMI suppression capacitors with fault protection against electrical shock and flame propagation, although repeated corona discharges which self-heal can lead to significant loss of capacitance.|$|E

In previous work, an algorithm is given that allows a simulated collective of robots to self-assemble and <b>self-heal</b> a desired shape, keeping the shape sized proportional to the number of robots in the collective. In this abstract, the current work of producing a robotic collective that can demonstrate that algorithm is presented...|$|R
