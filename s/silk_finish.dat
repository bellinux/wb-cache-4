5000|$|Coelan Marine Coatings come in {{transparent}} gloss and <b>silk</b> <b>finish</b> {{with the}} primer coming in pigmented colors. They {{can be used}} on wood, fiberglass, and metal deck surfaces. They are also used to restore inflatable dinghies, boating fenders, and rub rails. Once applied, it is both flexible and resilient and able to bridge hair line cracks and stop leaks. [...] Colean Marine Coatings are water vapor permeable so they allow moisture to dissipate and are resistant to high wear and abrasion. They are used to refurbish wood such as teak, oak, mahogany and red ironwood but can also be used for softwoods such as pine, fir, larch, and spruce. They can also be used on many other surfaces including steel, fiberglass, and rubber. Colean Marine Coatings are designed to be “antislip” and are also often used on home furnishings as well as boats. Coelan Marine Coatings are rated {{among the best in the}} industry as they retain a good level of gloss and translucency.|$|E

The November 1, 1944, issue emphasized workers' rights as citizens. The issue stated “The Spotfinder has no political affiliations and has no intentions to talk politics. It is, however, the duty of self and country of all who are eligible to vote to cast their ballot on November 7th, and may the best man win. On our local state ticket, we have, as most of us know, one of our own fellow workers who is running for State Representative on the Democratic ticket.

50|$|All silk {{produced}} by the worm is composed of two substances: fibroin, the true thread, and sericin, which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called schappe. The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the <b>silk</b> when <b>finished</b> is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; {{but it is very}} clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in velvet manufacture.|$|R

50|$|The {{years between}} 1815 and 1820 were ones of recession, {{followed}} by the boom of the 1820s. Twenty six throwing mills were established, and the throwsters often attached weaving sheds. The workforce was divided equally between the employed and outworkers and weaving was all done by hand. In 1821 the population was 21,819, and about 10,000 were employed in the silk factories- some of course would {{come in from the}} surrounding villages. They worked a 62-hour week, men earning eleven shillings. Duties on <b>finished</b> <b>silk</b> and raw silk were reduced in 1824, 1825 and 1826. Firms went bankrupt and while there were 70 silk mills in 1826 by 1832 there were only 41. Wages halved, and workers were put on short time. Recessions continued on a ten yearly cycle and as fewer firms survived, the techniques were refined, new products were produced, and management became more adept. Brocklehursts was the largest of these firms.|$|R

An aunt of hers was a member of that order. The German Kulturkampf - which sought to subjugate the church to state control - made religious life impossible so she had to put her plans to become a religious on hold. She promised to look after her father and siblings to her mother who was on her deathbed and later died on 1 December 1878. This - to her - was a sure sign that she would have to renounce the religious life.|$|R

40|$|By {{employing}} <b>finishing</b> {{techniques to}} <b>silk</b> fabric alongside a shibori or resist process, areas of different densities can be formed within the cloth; creating textured, puckered and distorted effects. One process: salt shrinking is {{unknown in the}} western world but has evolved over the centuries within Japan. It is a tradition originally used for <b>finishing</b> <b>silk</b> crepe, where by soaking the fabric in seawater the silk fibres contracted to create more density. The effects tended to be unstable so today; calcium chloride or calcium nitrate solutions are now employed. A second process relies upon sericin or the silk gum present within a silk fibre to create texture. During the manufacturing the sericin is left on {{in order to protect the}} fibre but is then removed during scouring in order to create a soft lustrous fabric. With both processes if silk fabrics are patterned with shibori techniques, prior to the salt treatment or scouring, the resulting fabrics will contain, areas of different densities and texture with visible contrast occurring between the areas protected by the resists and those that were affected by the finishing. The textures that are produced are said to be almost permanent, but break down with severe washing...|$|R

40|$|Four {{different}} architectural {{acrylic paint}} formulations were tested {{by exposure to}} weathering for 7 years in the urban site of Sao Paulo and the coastal site of Ubatuba, South-East Brazil. Surface discolorations and detachment of coatings were assessed and {{the components of the}} biofilms were identified by standard microbiological methods. The painted surfaces of the mortar panels were much more discolored in Ubatuba, where major components of the biofilms were the cyanobacteria Gloeocapsa and Scytonema. In two of the four paint films, a pink coloration on the surface at this coastal site, caused mainly by red-pigmented Gloeocapsa, produced high discoloration ratings, but low degradation (as measured by detachment). Biofilms in Sao Paulo contained the same range of phototrophs, but in lesser quantity. However, fungal numbers, as determined by plating, were higher. Detachment ratings in this urban site were only slightly lower than in Ubatuba. The matt paint performed worst of the four, with <b>silk</b> and semi-gloss <b>finishes</b> giving lowest biodeterioration ratings. The matt elastomeric paint performed well at both sites, apart from becoming almost 100 % covered by the pink biofilm in Ubatuba. Unpainted mortar panels became intensely discolored with a black biofilm, showing that all the paints had achieved one of their objectives, that of surface protection of the substrate. The value of PVC (pigment volume content) as an indicator of coatings biosusceptibility, is questioned. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
