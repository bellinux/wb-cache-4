50|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> varies widely between devices. Typically, <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> are reasonably accurate at a walking pace {{on a flat}} surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip).Although traditional <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> are affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> falsely count <b>steps</b> when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day. This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work. Accuracy also depends on the step-length the user enters.|$|R

50|$|Used {{originally}} by {{sports and}} physical fitness enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday exercise counter and motivator. Often worn on the belt {{and kept on}} all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps × step length). Some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one's shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these 'false steps'. <b>Step</b> <b>counters</b> can give encouragement to compete with oneself in getting fit and losing weight. A total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to 8 km, is recommended {{by some to be}} the benchmark for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts. Thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer. <b>Step</b> <b>counters</b> are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, and mobile phones.|$|R

50|$|In recent decades, the University District has {{suffered}} commercial decline, due {{at least in}} significant part to the more competitive planning, capital investment, and popularity of the University Village shopping center east of the campus, and Northgate Mall about 1-1/2 miles (2-1/2 km) north beside I-5. From 2002 to 2004, {{the city and the}} neighborhood have made some <b>steps</b> <b>countering</b> this trend by giving the Ave a repaving facelift including the addition of benches, bus bulbs, and period lighting. The addition of benches represented the reversal of a decades-long neighborhood trend away from providing free places to sit.|$|R

The Ave remains at the heart of campus life for university students, and is filled with busy restaurants (mostly inexpensive), new and used book and record stores, clothing stores, and movie theatres, most densely between NE 41st and NE 50th Streets. Among these are the Varsity Theatre (1940) and the University Book Store (1924).|$|R

The W710 is a clamshell phone and displays the user's steps on the external display. The W710 must be closed in order for it to count steps. When the <b>step</b> <b>counter</b> is activated, it counts detected steps during the day, and at midnight it stores the counter in a day-by-day history and resets it to zero.|$|E
50|$|Notable new {{hardware}} features also include two new composite sensors: a step detector and a <b>step</b> <b>counter.</b> These new sensors allow applications to easily track steps when the user is walking, running, or climbing stairs. Both sensors are implemented in hardware for low power consumption. Like its predecessors, the Nexus 5 {{does not have}} a microSD card slot, while it features a multi-color LED notification light.

5000|$|The {{technology}} for a pedometer includes a mechanical sensor and software to count steps. Early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps {{together with a}} simple counter. If one shakes these devices, one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth, or a pendulum striking stops as it swings. Today advanced <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> rely on MEMS inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps. These MEMS sensors have either 1-, 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration. The use of MEMS inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives. The software technology used to interpret {{the output of the}} inertial sensor and [...] "make sense of accurate steps" [...] varies widely.

50|$|A {{wide array}} of {{technologies}} are now available that allow data to be collected on various components of wellness many of them using {{a variant of the}} Health Scoring system. Devices for measuring physical attributes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol are also commonly used by patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, devices that can be used by healthy individuals to monitor exercise and energy expenditure are increasingly popular, and range from simple heart rate monitors or <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> to more elaborate computerized exercise machines. These tools provide data on the user’s performance and many can upload the data to further systems to be processed. Undoubtedly, the largest growth area has been in apps, facilitated by the widespread use of tablets and smartphones. Although some of these apps may be gimmicks, many are said to be validated genuine tools to assist in improving health and wellness.|$|R

The last HouseGuest to ring in will be eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing {{will be the new}} Head of Household. Dillon was the winner. Bruno, Jackie, and Kevin became Have-Nots for the week, and William won safety for the week. On Day 35, Dillon nominated Demetres and Jackie for eviction. On Day 36, Dillon, Demetres, Jackie, Ika, William, and Sindy rolled in the Out of Orbit Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests must roll their ball up and around the loop and catch it on the other side. Each time they catch it, they will complete one rotation. If they drop the ball, their counter will drop to zero. The first person to complete three hundred consecutive rotations will win the Power of Veto. Demetres was the winner. On Day 37, the HouseGuests were given the task to clean the House. During the task, William found a clue to a secret power in the House. After following the clues, William found a secret Power of Veto that can be anonymously used at one of the next two veto meetings. On Day 38, Demetres took himself off the block and Sindy was named as the replacement nominee. On Day 40, the HouseGuests were given a task, sponsored by ParticipACTION. Each HouseGuest was given a <b>step</b> <b>counter,</b> with the task to reach 1,500 steps. The first HouseGuest to accomplish this goal will receive an advantage in the upcoming Head of Household competition. Karen received the advantage. On Day 41, Sindy was evicted by a 6-1 vote, with Kevin voting to evict Jackie. She became the second member of the jury.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A shoe insole pedometer, which {{consists}} of a piezo-electric energy harvester and a 2 V organic pedometer circuit, has been developed {{as a first step}} toward the application of flexible large-area energy harvesting.

40|$|Objective: Cardiovascular disease, obesity, {{and lack}} of {{physical}} fitness are increas-ingly common and negatively affect people’s health, requiring medical assistance and decreasing people’s wellness and productivity. In the last years, researchers as well as companies have been increasingly investigating wearable devices for fitness applications {{with the aim of}} improving user’s health, in terms of cardiovascular benefits, loss of weight or muscle strength. Dedicated GPS devices, accelerometers, <b>step</b> <b>counters</b> and heart rate monitors are already commercially available, but they are usually very limited in terms of user interaction and artificial intelligence ca-pabilities. This significantly limits the training and motivation support provided by current systems, making them poorly suited for untrained people who are more interested in fitness for health rather than competitive purposes. To better train and motivate users, we propose the Mobile Personal Trainer (MOPET) system.

40|$|Sensor {{measurements}} {{can be used}} in {{dairy farming}} for the detection of heat and diseases. A new model has been developed to process the measured variables in a combined way. It is based on time series models for yield, temperature, conductivity and activity, and a probability distribution for the concentrates leftovers. The parameters of the time series models and the probabilities are fitted on-line for each cow after each milking by Kalman filters. This makes it possible to combine the variables and to generate cow-specific alerts. Some results are given. 1.
