5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done {{to protect them from}} bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E

To explain how individuals could be harmed by poison without holding beliefs about it, she referred {{to the power of}} majority opinion. Eddy allowed exceptions from Christian Science prayer, including for dentistry, optometry and broken limbs; she said she had healed broken bones using [...] "mental surgery," [...] but that this skill would be the last to be learned. But for the most part (then and now), Christian Scientists believe that medicine and Christian Science are incompatible. Medicine asserts that <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fixed, while Christian Science asserts that spiritual reality is perfect and beliefs to the contrary need to be corrected.|$|E

Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released. [...] {{is a mixture of}} [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E

Buxton said that Skye [...] "really shined this episode", and called her {{one-shot}} fight [...] "worthy of a rewind or two", while highlighting [...] "one of the biggest character moments" [...] in the episode with Simmons' decision to kill Ward. Rob Leane, also at Den of Geek, was more positive of the Age of Ultron tie-in, calling it [...] "the next best allusion to the movies we’ve ever had" [...] following the series' connections to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and praising the use of List and Hill. He positively compared Skye's one-shot fight sequence to the well known single-take sequences in The Avengers and Daredevil, calling it [...] "the very welcome TV equivalent" [...] of the [...] "air-punching fan-pleasing moments" [...] often found in Marvel's films. Leane also compared Coulson's [...] "real mission-within-a-mission" [...] reveal to a similar moment in The Winter Soldier, and summarized [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] as [...] "a thoroughly entertaining episode, thanks in equal part to the tie-in stuff, some solid action and several strong character moments. Ward’s return was handled well, too, although <b>something</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done about Simmons’ growing unlikeable-ness." ...|$|E
