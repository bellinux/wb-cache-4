Further, relations are analysed according to Relational Concept Analysis which allows a representation of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> consisting of relational components and quantificational tags. This representation utilizes mathematical properties of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations.</b> The quantificational tags imply inheritance rules among <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> {{that can be used to}} check the consistency of relations and to reduce the redundancy in implementations by storing only the basis elements of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations.</b> The research presented in this paper [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to semi-automatically obtaining <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> in Swiss German Sign Language (Deutschschweizerische Gebärdensprache, DSGS). We use a set of keywords including the gloss to represent each sign.

In addition, definitions found in specialised texts are a good starting point to search for different types of definitions where other <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> occur. The extraction of definitional knowledge from specialised corpora represents another interesting approach for the extraction of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations.</b> Here, we present a descriptive analysis of definitional verbal patterns in Spanish and the first steps towards the development of a system for the automatic extraction of definitional knowledge...|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{construction}} of a lexicon for natural language understanding, we are preparing a hierarchical semantic network using the Roget's thesaurus as a starting database. This work was undertaken because examination of the Roget shows that there are <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> considered important for linguistic expression which are not defined in other publicly available semantic networks, such as WordNet. In the process of conversion of the Roget to a semantic network, the first stage has been to reorganize the hierarchy and specify the set of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> necessary to express those conceptual relations which are implied by the relative location of the words within the thesaurus. The explicit marking of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> which are only implied in the original Roget has converted that reference work into a semantic network with a flexible multiple inheritance, which should greatly enhance the utility of the Roget for semantic information processing. We also expect that the resulting set of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> will specify a minimum set required for definitions of words and logical representation of linguistic expressions at a human level of understanding. At the present stage, approximately 170 <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> have been defined to express the observed relations. It was found that many <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> observed in the Roget could not be expressed with the simple binary predicates often used for <b>semantic</b> <b>relations,</b> and it was found necessary to extend the notation to allow ternary and higher relations, as well as simple frames. At this stage the <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> thus defined have not yet been reduced to the first-order logical relations required to allow detailed inferencing, and the resulting semantic network has not yet been evaluated for its utility in practical applications. In future work, the semantic network must be enhanced by defining the <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> themselves in logical format, and additional semantic links must be added to distinguish non-synonymous words within paragraphs. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{semantic}} network, or frame network, is {{a network}} that represents <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> between concepts. This is often used {{as a form of}} knowledge representation.

50|$|In {{this theory}} he proposes the {{division}} into grammatical and concrete cases. According to Kuryłowicz, {{the case is}} a syntactic or <b>semantic</b> <b>relation</b> expressed by the appropriate inflected form or by linking the preposition with a noun, so it is the category based on a relation inside the sentence or a relation between two sentences.|$|E
50|$|Grammatical {{case is a}} {{category}} of inflectional morphology. The comitative case {{is an expression of}} the comitative <b>semantic</b> <b>relation</b> through inflectional affixation, by prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes. Although all three major types of affixes are used in at least a few languages, suffixes are the most common expression. Languages which use affixation to express the comitative include Hungarian, which uses suffixes; Totonac, which uses prefixes; and Chuckchi, which uses circumfixes.|$|E
5000|$|In Joy, {{the meaning}} {{function}} is a homomorphism from the syntactic monoid onto the semantic monoid.

It is a homomorphism rather than an isomorphism, because it is onto but not one-to-one; that is, no symbol {{has more than one}} meaning, but some sequences of symbols have the same meaning (e.g. [...] "dup +" [...] and [...] "2 *").|$|E
30|$|Among {{the works}} studied, several {{focus on the}} {{extraction}} of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations</b> between words or lexical items. The studies on the extraction of hyponymic relations from text, pioneered by Hearst [30] and continued in [31 - 33], were built on a prerefined number of patterns that give origin to rules. Our proposal is also rule based, but it captures a wider spectrum of <b>semantic</b> <b>relations.</b> As in [5, 7, 25 - 27], {{most of these are}} non-named <b>semantic</b> <b>relations,</b> generally represented by verbs and lack a fine-grained categorization.|$|R
