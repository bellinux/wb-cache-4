25|$|Danish {{archaeologist}} Thorkild Ramskou {{posited that}} the <b>sunstone</b> {{could have been}} one of the minerals (cordierite or Iceland spar) that polarize light and by which the azimuth of the sun can be determined in a partly overcast sky or when the sun is just below the horizon. The principle is used by many animals and polar flights applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available. Ramskou further conjectured that the <b>sunstone</b> could have aided navigation in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular, and research as to how a <b>sunstone</b> could be used in nautical navigation continues.|$|E

25|$|Vikings used {{polarization}} and the <b>Sunstone</b> {{to allow}} navigation of their ships by locating the Sun {{even in a}} completely overcast sky. This special mineral was talked about in several 13th–14th century written sources in Iceland.|$|E
25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings {{to guide their}} boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a <b>sunstone</b> can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a <b>sunstone</b> {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than a magnetic compass.|$|E
25|$|Ciri and Geralt {{travel to}} Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid their fight. They {{learn about the}} <b>Sunstone,</b> a relic which can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan island of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the <b>Sunstone</b> to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, and Geralt defeats Eredin in combat. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. She enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. The game ending varies, {{depending}} on previous choices. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with Yennefer or Triss or remain a lone witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and brings Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become empress; if Ciri {{does not meet the}} emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake; surrounded by monsters when he finds it, his fate is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the {{original}} Nauvoo Temple commenced April 6, 1841, and its final dedication was in May 1846. The temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by Mormon architect William Weeks, {{under the direction of}} Joseph Smith, Jr. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter-day Saint motifs, including <b>sunstones,</b> moonstones, and starstones, representing the Three Degrees of Glory in the Mormon conception of the afterlife (D 76: 70-81). The placement of the symbols on the building in descending order—starstones, <b>sunstones,</b> and moonstones—does not support the above assertion, but rather a reflection of Revelation 12:1.|$|R

25|$|Latter-day Saint scholar Brant Gardner, after {{investigating}} {{the link between}} Quetzalcoatl and Jesus, concluded that the association amounts to nothing more than folklore. In a 1986 paper for <b>Sunstone,</b> he noted that during the Spanish Conquest, the Native Americans and the Catholic priests who sympathized with them felt pressure to link Native American beliefs with Christianity, thus making the Native Americans seem more human and less savage. Over time, Quetzalcoatl's appearance, clothing, malevolent nature, and status among the gods were reshaped to fit a more Christian framework.|$|E

One meteorite is the Gibeon meteorite which weighs 210 pounds (95kg) and came from the African nation of Namibia. The world's largest known opal-filled thunderegg, weighing 1.75 tons (1600kg), is housed at the museum. The thunderegg is Oregon's state rock.

5000|$|The Danish {{archaeologist}} Thorkild Ramskou {{suggested in}} 1967 that the [...] "sun-stones" [...] {{referred to in}} some sagas might have been natural crystals capable of polarizing skylight. The mineral cordierite occurring in Norway has the local name [...] "Viking's Compass." [...] Its changes in colour would allow determining the sun's position (azimuth) even through an overcast or foggy horizon. The <b>sunstones</b> are doubly refracting, meaning that objects viewed through them {{can be seen as}} double because of positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged carbonate ions. When looking at the sun the stone, it will project two overlapping shadows on the crystal. The opacities of these shadows will vary depending on the <b>sunstone’s</b> direction to the sun. When the two projected shapes have exactly the same opacity, it means the stone’s long side is facing directly toward the sun. Since the stone uses light polarization, it works the best when the sun is at lower altitudes, or closer to the horizon. It makes sense that Norsemen were able to make use of <b>sunstones,</b> since much of the area they traveled and explored was near polar, where the sun is very close to the horizon for a good amount of the year. For example, in the Vinland sagas we see long voyages to North America, the majority sailed at over 60 degrees north.|$|R

25|$|The Nauvoo Temple was {{designed}} in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, {{under the direction of}} Joseph Smith. Weeks' design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including <b>Sunstones,</b> Moonstones, and Starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the Three Degrees of Glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be “a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb’s wife” (Wandle Mace, Autobiography 207 (BYU Special Collections)). In this regard Mace references John’s statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the “woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” This explains why the Starstones are {{at the top of the}} temple (“crown of twelve stars”), the <b>Sunstones</b> in the middle (“clothed with the sun”) and the Moonstones at the bottom (“moon under her feet”).|$|R
