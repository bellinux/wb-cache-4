These systems have the advantages of portability and lesser space requirements. This paper deals with PV-water hybrid energy system.

A comparison is done between the outputs obtained for the system without cooling and with cooling for different types.

40|$|The {{heliostat}} {{technology has}} been developed in solar energy utility mainly for the application in the central receiver system and solar furnace. The function of heliostat is to harness the solar energy by reflecting the sunray onto a receiver or second stage concentrator. However, the heliostat remains as a reflector rather than a concentrator for most application. Variable focusing heliostat is a new technique used to concentrate the sunray to achieve high concentration by using single stage reflection. With a different rotational method employed for the sun-tracking operation, the mirror facets can be controlled in groups. In order to achieve higher concentration, mirror distortion method has been studied in this research {{to come out with}} a flexible technique for adjusting the focusing distance of <b>single</b> <b>mirror.</b> The design of the mirror attachment also gives flexibility in aligning the mirror during pre-setting process.
