5000|$|The 550 (and the 380 [...] ) have a ram-air {{cooling system}} for the {{one-piece}} cylinder head. Two-stroke engines lose power after the engine reaches its critical temperature, so Suzuki used a system from its 500 cc two stroke twin cylinder racer, the T500. This system consisted of a two piece aluminum shroud bolted to the cylinder head to duct ambient air over the cylinder head finning. The centre part of the head had an increased fin area and a larger <b>shroud</b> <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> {{in an effort to}} keep the centre cylinder running at the same temperature as the naturally more exposed outboard cylinders.|$|E

40|$|In {{automotive}} applications radial {{gas turbines}} are commonly {{fitted with a}} twin-entry volute connected to a divided exhaust manifold, ensuring a better scavenge process owing to less interference between engines’ cylinders. This paper {{is concerned with the}} study of the unsteady performances related to the pulsating flows of a twin-entry radial turbine in engine-like conditions and the hysteresis-like behaviour during the pulses period. The results show that the aerodynamic performances deviate noticeably from the steady state and depend mainly on the time shifting between the actual output power and the isentropic power, which is distantly related to the apparent length. The maximum of efficiency and output shaft power are accompanied by low entropy generation through the <b>shroud</b> <b>entry</b> side, and their instantaneous behaviours tend to follow mainly the inlet total pressure curve. As revealed a billow is created by the interaction between the main flow and the infiltrated flow, affecting the flow incidence at rotor entry and producing high losses...|$|R
5000|$|The main elevation, which {{faces to}} the north-east, {{features}} a protruding <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> and a parapet wall which extends {{for most of}} the length of the building. These are formed from timber sheeting. Narrow lengths of corrugated metal sheeting have been fixed to form column- like details within the parapet wall, framing each end and the <b>entry</b> <b>area.</b> The exterior is clad with chamferboards at the base with fibre- cement sheeting with timber cover strips to the remainder. A cantilevered street awning is located above the <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> with [...] "Port Curtis Sailing Club" [...] in lettering fixed along its front edge and [...] "Gladstone Yacht Club" [...] in lettering adjacent to the entry door. Narrow window hoods cover each of the window bays. Timber casement windows are located above the street awning. A verandah space on the upper level has exposed steel posts and balustrades with a small enclosed area clad with fibre-cement sheeting. Recent aluminium windows are located adjacent to the entry on the second level and on the lower level.|$|R

50|$|Fully {{automated}} parking systems operate {{much like}} robotic valet parking. The driver drives {{the car into}} an APS <b>entry</b> (transfer) <b>area.</b> The driver and all passengers exit the car. The driver uses an automated terminal nearby for payment and receipt of a ticket. When driver and passengers have left the <b>entry</b> <b>area,</b> the mechanical system lifts the car and transports it to a pre-determined parking space in the system. More sophisticated fully automated APS will obtain the dimensions of cars on entry in order to place them in the smallest available parking space.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{design a}} V 2 V-based fast handoff scheme using IP address passing for VANETs in this thesis. The {{proposed}} scheme allows a leaving {{vehicle in the}} exit area to pass an IP address which has been identified by the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure to the vehicles in the <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> directly. In addition, the leaving vehicle in the exit area can also pass an IP address to the vehicles in the middle area {{if there is no}} vehicles in the <b>entry</b> <b>area.</b> Therefore, our scheme can reduce the use of DHCP to obtain an IP address. Because DAD results in the largest delay of the whole DHCP procedure, our scheme can thus improve the utilization of IP address, reduce the time of acquiring an IP address, and reduce the whole handoff time. ...|$|R

40|$|Teams of robots offer {{potential}} {{reductions in}} risk for rescuers and improved rescue rates for {{search and rescue}} in collapsed buildings and other restricted environments. However, one aspect of deployment of such teams that is often overlooked is the initial entry of the robots into the building. If many robots enter the building from the same entrance, {{they are likely to}} interfere with each other and dramatically slow the initial phase of exploration. In this paper, we use a low fidelity simulation to evaluate several approaches to overcoming this initial congestion and identify heuristics that might allow the robots to most quickly clear the <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> and begin their actual mission. Our results show that unless the exits to the initial <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> are small, over a wide range of parameters, the most effective technique was for every robot to move {{in the direction of the}} longest open space it senses. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|A useful {{feature of}} data base systems {{is to allow}} the user to change {{the order in which}} fields appear in the columns of a table. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the {{usability}} of seven different user interfaces for performing this task in the Microsoft Windows environment. The fields to be reordered were file name, file number, size, and creation date. The seven approaches studied covered a range of interaction styles, including dragging and dropping, menu selection, text entry, and button pressing. Fifteen Windows users completed a set of two practice trials using each approach, followed by a set of twelve main trials. For each trial, the user was shown the current order of the fields and a target order to change to. The completion times showed significant differences according to the approach used. Overall, a data-selection technique using radio buttons and a data-entry technique using a single <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> were significantly faster than all of the others. Another data-entry technique, involving multiple <b>entry</b> <b>areas,</b> was consistently the slowest. Somewhat surprisingly, given the current trend toward direct-manipulation interfaces, the two approaches involving dragging and dropping were not among the most effective approaches...|$|R
