2500|$|After the inventions of the {{combination}} lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the [...] "theft proof lock." [...] This {{was a combination}} lock that worked on a timer. The vault or <b>safe</b> <b>door</b> could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock {{in the middle of}} the night even under force. Time locks became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves levered the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be levered open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid nitroglycerin. Professional bank robbers learned to boil dynamite in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid into the door grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, tapered plug. The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.|$|E

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{cracking}} a safe generally involve damaging the safe {{so that it}} is no longer functional. These methods may involve explosives or other devices to inflict severe force and damage the safe so it may be opened. Examples of penetration tools include acetylene torches, drills and thermic lances. This method requires care as the contents of the safe may be damaged. Safe-crackers can use what are known as jam shots to blow off the <b>safe's</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Flames {{were spotted}} above upper campus around 5:30 p.m. on November 13. Students {{were led to}} Murchison Gymnasium, where they {{remained}} until the situation outside was <b>safe.</b> <b>Doors</b> and openings were sealed with masking tape to prevent smoke entry and a ventilation system was activated. The American Red Cross provided blankets and pillows {{to the hundreds of}} Westmont students, neighbors, and Preview/Visiting students. In the early morning after the immediate danger had passed, students were allowed to access their cars in certain parking lots and leave the campus. Others remained in the gymnasium until they found a ride off campus. Friends, family, local churches, and other sources provided temporary housing to refugees.|$|R

50|$|McCurdy {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} his training with nitroglycerin into his robberies. This often caused problems {{as he was}} overzealous and failed to correctly determine the proper amount to use. By March 1911, McCurdy had again relocated to Lenapah, Oklahoma. He and three other men decided to rob the Iron Mountain-Missouri Pacific train after McCurdy heard {{that one of the}} cars contained a safe with $4,000. They successfully stopped the train and located the safe. McCurdy then put nitroglycerin on the <b>safe's</b> <b>door</b> to open it but used too much. The safe was destroyed in the blast as was the majority of the money. McCurdy and his partners managed to net $450 in silver coins, most of which were melted and fused to the safe's frame.|$|R

6000|$|And {{next the}} visitor meets the shell coming up upon a little trolley to the gun. He sees the gunners, as drilled and precise {{as the men}} he saw at the forges, swing out the breech block and run the shell, which has met and {{combined}} with its detonators and various other industrial products since it left the main dump, into the gun. The breech closes like a <b>safe</b> <b>door,</b> and hides the shell from the visitor. It is [...] "good-bye." [...] He receives exaggerated warning of the danger to his ears, stuffs his fingers into them, and opens his mouth as instructed, hears a loud {{but by no means}} deafening report, and sees a spit of flame near the breech. Regulations of a severe character prevent his watching from an aeroplane the delivery of the goods upon the customers opposite.|$|E
60|$|A fat roll {{of bills}} {{and a handful}} of jewelry he {{transferred}} to the pockets of his coat. Some papers which his hand brushed within the safe he pushed aside as though preadvised of their inutility to one of his calling. Then he closed the <b>safe</b> <b>door,</b> closed the tapestry upon it and turned toward a dainty dressing table. From a drawer in this exquisite bit of Sheraton the burglar took a small, nickel plated automatic, which he slipped into an inside breast pocket of his coat, nor did he touch another article therein or thereon, nor hesitate an instant in the selection of the drawer to be rifled. His knowledge of the apartment of the daughter of the house of Prim was little short of uncanny. Doubtless the fellow was some plumber's apprentice who had made good use of an opportunity to study {{the lay of the land}} against a contemplated invasion of these holy precincts.|$|E

60|$|He {{pulled down}} his window blinds and lighted his candle. He laid {{off his coat}} and hat and began his preparations. He {{unlocked}} his trunk and got his suit of girl's clothes {{out from under the}} male attire in it, and laid it by. Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket. His plan was to slip down to his uncle's private sitting room below, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe key from the old gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob the safe. He took up his candle to start. His courage and confidence were high, up to this point, but both began to waver a little now. Suppose he should make a noise, by some accident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the safe? Perhaps it would be well to go armed. He took the Indian knife from its hiding place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage. He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak. When he was halfway down, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light. What could that mean? Was his uncle still up? No, that was not likely; he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed. Tom crept on down, pausing at every step to listen. He found the door standing open, and glanced in. What he saw pleased him beyond measure. His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table {{at the head of the}} sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old man's small cashbox, closed. Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil. The <b>safe</b> <b>door</b> was not open. Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances, and was taking a rest.|$|E

60|$|But what {{interested}} {{the boys}} {{most of all}} was the appearance of the two old <b>safes.</b> The <b>door</b> to each had been blown asunder and lay in a twisted mass on the floor.

50|$|The event cloak is a {{means of}} {{manipulating}} electromagnetic radiation in space and time {{in such a way that}} a certain collection of happenings, or events, is concealed from distant observers. Conceptually, a safecracker can enter a scene, steal the cash and exit, whilst a surveillance camera records the <b>safe</b> <b>door</b> locked and undisturbed all the time. The concept utilizes the science of metamaterials in which light can be made to behave in ways that are not found in naturally occurring materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} rate of crime, {{attacks by}} thieves, intruders and vandals, despite {{all forms of}} security gadgets and locks still need the attention of researchers to find a permanent solution to the well being of lives and properties of individuals. To this end, we design a cheap and effective security system for buildings, cars, <b>safes,</b> <b>doors</b> and gates, so as to prevent unauthorized person from having access to ones properties {{through the use of}} codes, we therefore experiment the application of electronic devices as locks. However, a modular approach was employed in the design in which the combination lock was divided into units and each unit designed separately before being coupled to form a whole functional system. During the design, we conducted Twenty tests with the first eight combinations being four in number, the next seven tests being five and the last five combinations being six. This was done because of the incorporation of 2 dummy switches in the combinations. From the result obtained, combinations 8, 11, 13 gave the correct output combination. However, 8 being the actual combination gave the required output. The general operation of the system and performance is dependent on the key combinations. The overall system was constructed and tested and it works perfectly. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, 1 Tabl...|$|R
