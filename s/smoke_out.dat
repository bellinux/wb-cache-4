5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E

25|$|Romans used tubes {{inside the}} walls to draw <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> of {{bakeries}} but chimneys only appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. The earliest extant example of an English chimney is at the keep of Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, which dates from 1185 AD. However, they did not become common in houses until the 16th and 17th centuries. Smoke hoods were an early method of collecting the smoke into a chimney (see image). Another step {{in the development of}} chimneys was the use of built in ovens which allowed the household to bake at home. Industrial chimneys became common in the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|After Michael returns, {{he becomes}} the new Don, with Vito retiring, and shortly thereafter, dying. Michael {{promotes}} Aldo to Caporegime. Learning the FBI are conducting {{an investigation into the}} Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk {{to find out what they}} know. When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before fleeing. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo he knew there was an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> the culprit. Aldo pursues Monk, who explains he became disillusioned in the Corleones after Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Furious with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{authorities}} {{responded with}} unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and Governor General Eizo Ishizuka ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops {{to be sent}} to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan's army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> the rebels, dropping mustard gas bombs in violation of the Geneva Protocol in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia. The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders. Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonor.|$|E

Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, [...] "My wife and I watch him every night. Jon {{is the epitome of}} a perfect host — smart, engaging, irreverent and funny." [...] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, [...] "Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice.

50|$|Dokha is {{commonly}} <b>smoked</b> <b>out</b> of an elongated wooden pipe called a midwakh (alternatively spelled 'medwakh'). The traditional midwakh has no filter, but more recent variations contain a stem-mounted filter to reduce heavy particulate matter entering the lungs while smoking.|$|R
500|$|In 1733 a new Excise and Customs Bill was introduced, restricting {{imports and}} {{raising taxes on}} many luxury items. Christchurch rapidly became a hot-bed for smugglers, where they were known as [...] "freetraders", {{and much of the}} town was {{involved}} in the trade. The [...] "Double Dykes" [...] are said to have been used to hide contraband, while Mudeford spit is rumoured to have been used in the construction of [...] "Guinea boats" [...] (cheaply built galleys sometimes capable of outrunning the day's steamships). One apocryphal story is that the black house acquired its distinctive black colour when customs officers tried to <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> some holed-up smugglers by lighting fires around the base. The house was constructed in 1848 and used by shipwrights as a dwelling and workshop, smuggling was in decline with the introduction of a free-trade policy and more effective measures being implemented by the Coast Guard by this time, so the house may not in fact have had much involvement in smuggling. The spit has a long association with shipbuilding with two large ships being built in the mid-19th century, the Viscountess Canning of 193 tons and the Enterprise 253 tons.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970). Kenneth blows white <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> while referencing bringing back something from [...] "the other side" [...] (death) echoes the same look when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked [...] "I see dead people" [...] in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).|$|E
500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film. The make-up artists who worked on [...] were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation, which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky [...] "not [...] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, {{and we talked about}} how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E

2500|$|The three tunnels contain [...] of {{air that}} needs to be {{conditioned}} for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from ventilation buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists {{on either side of the}} tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at , using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Finland is generally characterised by the predominant use of wooden construction. The oldest known dwelling structure {{is the so-called}} kota, a goahti, hut or tent with a covering in fabric, peat, moss, or timber. The building type remained in use throughout Finland until the 19th century, and is still in use among the Sami people in Lapland. The sauna is also a traditional building type in Finland: the oldest known saunas in Finland were made from pits dug into a slope {{in the ground and}} primarily used as dwellings in the wintertime. The first Finnish saunas are what nowadays are called [...] "smoke saunas". These differed from modern saunas in that they had no windows and were heated by heating up a pile of rocks (called kiuas) by burning large amounts of wood for about 6–8 hours, and then letting the <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> through a hatch before entering to enjoy the sauna heat (called löyly).|$|E

2500|$|Trudi is Jody's {{friend who}} does little but <b>smoke</b> <b>out</b> of a bong during {{the scene where}} Vincent has to put a needle in Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke.
