5|$|Beef <b>steak</b> can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through.

5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried.

Uncooked beef <b>steak</b> can be served raw, such as in <b>steak</b> tartare.|$|E

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to examine the}} effects of prerigor excision and rapid chilling vs. conventional carcass chilling of two muscles on proteolysis and tenderness during the postmortem storage, as well as the effects of fast and slow rates of cooking on myofibrillar characteristics and tenderness. The longissimus thoracis (LT) and triceps brachii (TB), long head muscles were removed 45 min after exsanguination from the left side of 12 carcasses and chilled in an ice bath to induce cold shortening (excised, rapidly chilled). At 24 h postmortem, the corresponding muscles were removed from the right side (conventionally chilled). All muscles were cut into 2. 54 -cm-thick <b>steaks</b> and assigned to one of two postmortem times (1 or 14 d), and to raw and cooking treatments. <b>Steaks</b> were cooked at 260 °C(FAST) or 93 °C(SLOW) in a forced-air convection oven to an internal temperature of 70 °C. Cooking loss, cooking time, and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) were measured on cooked <b>steaks.</b> Sarcomere length (SL) and the extent of proteolysis of desmin were measured on raw and cooked <b>steaks.</b> As expected, the excised, rapidly chilled muscles had a much more rapid (P 0. 05) on SL of rapidly chilled <b>steaks.</b> Generally, TB <b>steaks</b> required longer (P < 0. 05) cooking times and had higher (P < 0. 05) cooking losses than LT <b>steaks,</b> and FAST-cooked <b>steaks</b> had greater (P < 0. 05) cooking losses than SLOW-cooked <b>steaks.</b> Rapidly chilled <b>steaks</b> had less (P < 0. 05) degradation of desmin than conventionally chilled <b>steaks</b> (31 vs. 41 %). Aging for 14 d increased (P < 0. 05) desmin degradation. Rapid chilling of muscles resulted in much higher (P < 0. 05) WBSF values, whereas aging resulted in lower (P < 0. 05) WBSF values. The SLOW-cooked TB <b>steaks</b> were more tender (P < 0. 05) than FAST-cooked TB <b>steaks</b> and LT <b>steaks</b> cooked at either rate.

All cooking treatments allowed differences to be detected (P< 0. 05) in Warner-Bratzler shear force, although the differences were inconsistent. Shear force values of strip <b>steaks</b> and eye of round <b>steaks</b> were similar across cooking treatments; however, shear force values of bottom round, brisket, and top sirloin <b>steaks</b> were different (P< 0. 05) among cooking treatments. Based on poor repeatability, shear force values for top sirloin <b>steaks</b> appear unreliable. Poor repeatability for shear force values from <b>steaks</b> cooked by the forced-air convection oven are a result of drastic temperature changes that occur when the doors are opened to remove <b>steaks.</b> We do not recommend using a forced-air convection oven to test treatment effects on shear force values when cooking multiple <b>steaks</b> simultaneously.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJohn A. UnruhForty-eight Brahman-cross male calves {{were fed}} to 26 mo {{of age and}} used to {{determine}} carcass cutability and meat quality characteristics of four muscles from intact bulls and steers castrated at 3, 7, or 12 mo of age grown under tropical pasture conditions. Longissimus lumborum (LL), Psoas major (PM), Gluteus medius (GM), and Semitendinosus (ST) <b>steaks</b> were aged for 2, 7, 14, or 28 d for Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) analysis. Live weight, carcass traits, and total subprimal yields were not affected by male sex condition. For PM, GM, and ST <b>steaks,</b> WBSF values were similar for <b>steaks</b> from intact bulls and steers castrated at all ages. For both PM and GM muscles, <b>steaks</b> aged for 28 d had the lowest (most tender) WBSF values and <b>steaks</b> aged for 2 d had the highest WBSF values. For the ST, WBSF values were highest for <b>steaks</b> aged 2 d. A treatment × aging interaction was detected for LL WBSF values. At 14 d of aging, LL <b>steaks</b> from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have lower WBSF values than those from intact bulls. At 28 d of aging, <b>steaks</b> from steers had lower WBSF values than <b>steaks</b> from intact bulls and <b>steaks</b> from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have lower WBSF values than <b>steaks</b> from steers castrated at 12 mo.

Although all sensory panel data collected were not statistically different, LL <b>steaks</b> from steers castrated at 3 mo tended to have higher (more tender) scores for overall tenderness than <b>steaks</b> from intact bull. This study indicates that castration at 3 mo would be the recommended production practice as it provided the greatest improvement of LL tenderness over intact bulls with no differences in carcass traits or subprimal yields.
