Though he finished his first 16mm film, Wild Gunman, in 1978, he had explored his (rather Situationist) desires to eradicate the borderlines between fine and popular art, public and private imagery, the political and the purely aesthetic in several film and photo-essay projects, notably <b>Flick</b> <b>Skin</b> (1977), a Super-8 film that Baldwin made while living in the projectionist booth at a porn theater. Pieced together from the scraps of film that were left lying around the theater, it was with this film that Baldwin began to really develop his style of rebranding images.|$|R

Ebert stated that [...] "in terms of its genre (softcore <b>skin</b> <b>flick),</b> it's very well done: lushly photographed on location in Thailand, filled with attractive and intriguing people, and scored with brittle, teasing music. Now that hardcore porno has become passe, it's a relief to see a movie that drops the gynecology and returns to a certain amount of sexy sophistication."

In 1960, Ron Rice released The Flower Thief, starring Taylor Mead, to a positive reception. The film was produced for less than $1000 using black-and-white 16mm 50' film cartridges left over from aerial gunnery equipment used during World War II. In the early 1960s, filmmaker Jack Smith used discarded color-reversal film stock to film Flaming Creatures.

Craig Baldwin's <b>Flick</b> <b>Skin</b> is entirely made from discarded film, or [...] "found footage", retrieved from a projectionist's booth. The No Wave Cinema movement of the late 1970s, represented by filmmakers such as Vivienne Dick, produced many notable no-budget films shot on Super 8, such as Beauty Becomes The Beast. In 1993, Sarah Jacobson's first film, I Was a Teenage Serial Killer, was made with [...] "one camera, one tape recorder, one mic and, like, four lights". G.B. Jones took 13 years to film, direct and edit on Super 8mm the feature film The Lollipop Generation, which was filmed whenever she could afford to buy a roll of film, and finally released in 2008. In 2012, first-time director Shawn Holmes shot his debut film Memory Lane with non-professional actors and a budget of less than $300. In the same year Goodbye Promise, the first movie ever to be distributed online directly to its audience via a crowdfunding platform. was released.

5000|$|Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} straightforward sequel to the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls. Jacqueline Susann, author of the novel Valley of the Dolls, {{had been asked to}} write a screenplay but declined. Susann herself had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel The Love Machine. 20th Century Fox rejected two screenplay drafts, and the final version, written by director Russ Meyer and novice screenwriter Roger Ebert in six weeks, was not only a spoof of the original film, but, in Ebert's words [...] "a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy". [...] Meyer's intention was for the film to [...] "simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a <b>skin</b> <b>flick</b> and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'".|$|E

[...] But he also noted that the film was not without its problems, the first being the [...] "film’s deluge which felt a little drowned out at times and a little like gap fillers for the most part, but nothing too harmful that would seriously hurt the film in any real way though," [...] and the second being the film's audio dubbing which was [...] "off" [...] in certain parts. He also commented that while the pacing might have been too slow for some viewers, it managed to [...] "tell a very adequate story about a young woman living life in its whole realism form." [...] Speaking toward the writer/director, the reviewer wrote [...] "Holt is {{a breath of fresh air}} and projects an unique and somewhat uncanny style of filmmaking that reminded me of the late 80’s and early 90’s of filmmaking". He also commended the cast when writing [...] "most of the cast did an equally fair job in their performances." [...] In summation he noted that he first viewed the film with low expectations, and was surprised that [...] "the film came out very enjoyable and was a terrific experience." ...|$|E

The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by first-time American director Barbara Loden won the international critics prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and ... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E

In narrating the transformation of the original skinhead as a subcultural youth type to its present re-signification as a fetish and sexual identity within gay male subculture, Fault Lines reveals a tripartite problem of fetishism, sadomasochism and fascism. Through an analysis of Bruce LaBruce's film Skin Gang / <b>Skin</b> <b>Flick</b> (1999) these problems are contextualised within a discourse of gay male pornography, broadening the investigation to consider how problems of masculinity, violence and race manifest within a distinctly gay male sexual imaginary. Examining the representational function of the Queer skinhead, Fault Lines seeks to speculate on how notions of a gay male subject and subjectivity can be established at the intersection of an aesthetic, political and social experience...|$|E
