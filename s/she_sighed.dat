2500|$|... "Well", <b>she</b> <b>sighed,</b> [...] "you {{see what}} we have been reduced to. We are now in a time when a Szell is {{considered}} a master. How small he was next to Furtwängler." [...] Reeling this disbelief -- not at her verdict, with which I agreed, but from the unvarnished acuteness of it -- I stammered, [...] "But how do you know Furtwängler? You never sang with him." [...] "How do you think?" [...] she stared at me with equal disbelief. [...] "He started his career after the war in Italy [...] I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he was Beethoven." ...|$|E
60|$|Caroline was not unhappy that evening--far otherwise; but as {{she gazed}} <b>she</b> <b>sighed,</b> and as <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> a hand circled her, and rested quietly on her waist. Caroline thought she knew who had drawn near; she {{received}} the touch unstartled.|$|E
6000|$|Who is she, {{the poor}} Maniac, whose wildly-fix'd eyes [...] Seem a heart {{overcharged}} to express? She weeps not, yet often and deeply <b>she</b> <b>sighs,</b> <b>She</b> never complains, but her silence implies [...] The composure of settled distress.|$|R
5000|$|When Ian asks to use Barbara's {{cardigan}} in Episode 2, <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> and says, [...] "Not again." [...] The companions had unravelled {{another of}} her cardigans in The Space Museum.|$|R
6000|$|... "What game? Why, Asika-game of course. If <b>she</b> <b>sigh,</b> you sigh; if {{she look}} at you, {{you look at}} her; if she squeeze hand, you squeeze hand; if she kiss, you kiss." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> bitterly, {{and turned}} again toward the red-brick house.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> {{deeply and}} changed the subject of conversation.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had {{his hands}} touched her head when <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> deeply.|$|E

6000|$|After {{some talk}} about nuns, Ethel says, [...] "There were convents in England. She often thinks {{she would like}} to retire to one;" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> as if her heart were in that scheme.|$|R
60|$|Sheila paused. 'Could ANY woman answer such a question?' <b>she</b> almost <b>sighed</b> at last.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> once more. The {{incident}} {{seemed to}} have shaken her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> and the Vicomte's face {{became one}} of pale anxiety.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed.</b> Pamela {{just then}} {{was a picture}} of {{engaging}} humility.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Trust,' said <b>she,</b> <b>sighing.</b> 'Maybe, {{my pride}} {{ought to be}} broken; and I may have to lay aside all my hopes and plans, and become a mere serving sister, to learn true humility. Anyhow, I verily trust to my Heavenly Spouse to guard me for himself. If the Duke of Burgundy still {{maintains}} Boemond's suit, then in the dissension I see an escape.|$|R
6000|$|Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome, And in a vapour reach'd {{the dismal}} dome.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> {{a little}} petulantly. She was half-convinced, but against her will.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> {{and walked}} dizzily beside him. They {{went on in}} silence.|$|E
6000|$|The gods, {{to curse}} Pamela with her prayers, Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares, [...] 50 The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state, And, to {{complete}} her bliss, a fool for mate. She glares in balls, front boxes, and the Ring, A vain, unquiet, glittering, wretched thing! Pride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part: <b>She</b> <b>sighs,</b> {{and is no}} duchess at her heart.|$|R
6000|$|Chill'd by the night, the {{drooping}} rose of May [...] Mourns {{the long}} {{absence of the}} lovely day: [...] Young Day returning at her promised hour, [...] Weeps o'er the sorrows of the fav'rite flower,-- [...] Weeps the soft dew, the balmy gale <b>she</b> <b>sighs,</b> [...] And darts a trembling lustre from her eyes. [...] New life and joy th' expanding flow'ret feels: [...] His pitying mistress mourns, and mourning heals! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>sighing</b> {{after a short}} pause; [...] "if {{you think}} it will do him any good, of course I'll put up with it. And then I know Louis would be mad if I talked of such a thing. But, Miss Thorne, dear, a woman like me don't like to have to be made a fool of all the days of her life if she can help it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> deeply, and {{her look}} of weariness was painful to see.|$|E
60|$|Eve's {{eyes were}} lit with laughter. A moment later, however, <b>she</b> <b>sighed.</b>|$|E

60|$|Solitary {{hotel in}} {{mountain}} pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. <b>She</b> writes. <b>She</b> <b>sighs.</b> Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He {{comes from his}} dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary.|$|R
60|$|Janet, impelled by {{the fascination}} akin to disgust, read thus far, and flinging the {{newspaper}} on the floor, began to tidy herself for supper. But presently, when <b>she</b> heard Lise <b>sigh,</b> <b>she</b> could contain herself no longer.|$|R
6000|$|Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome, [...] And in a vapour reach'd {{the dismal}} dome.

6000|$|She danc'd {{along with}} vague, {{regardless}} eyes, [...] Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: [...] The hallow'd hour was near at hand: <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> [...] Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort [...] Of whisperers in anger, or in sport; [...] 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, [...] Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, [...] 70 [...] Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn, [...] And all the bliss {{to be before}} to-morrow morn.|$|R
