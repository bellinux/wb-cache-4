50|$|As the FCC {{meetings}} {{evolved into}} the NTSC, other researchers at RCA were {{hard at work on}} the competing shadow mask concept. By the time the next set of presentations was ready, <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> <b>tubes</b> using one or three guns were available. These did not fare any better in viewing tests, but critically, it was due to the signaling system, not the tubes. By that point, RCA had abandoned further development of the Triniscope.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{arranging}} the guns, and phosphors, in a triangle, their system arranged them side-by-side. This {{meant that the}} phosphors {{did not have to}} be displaced from each other in two directions, only one, which allowed much-simplified convergence adjustments of the three beams, compared to the conventional delta <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> <b>tube.</b> This differed sufficiently from RCA's design to allow GE to circumvent the patents. It is important to realize that the GE 11" [...] tube still had round mask holes and phosphor dots, not rectangular ones as in the later slot-mask tubes. The innovation here was with the in-line guns as opposed to the triad arrangement.|$|R
50|$|In the {{avionics}} {{role the}} penetron had other advantages as well. Its use of phosphors in layers instead of stripes {{meant that it}} had higher resolution, three {{times that of the}} RCA system. This was very useful for radar display and IFF systems, where the images were often overlaid with textual cues that required high resolution to be easily readable. Additionally, since all of the signal reached the screen in a penetron, as opposed to 15% of it in a <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> <b>tube,</b> for any given amount of power the penetron was much brighter. This was a major advantage in the avionics role where power budgets were often quite limited, yet the displays were often hit with direct sunlight and needed to be very bright. The lack of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> also meant the penetron was much more robust mechanically, and didn't suffer from color shifting under g-loads.|$|R
2500|$|Color tubes use three {{different}} phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in aperture grille designs) or clusters called [...] "triads" [...] (as in <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> CRTs). Color CRTs have three electron guns, {{one for each}} primary color, arranged either {{in a straight line}} or in an equilateral triangular configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called [...] "delta-gun", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta Δ.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor. A <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> <b>tube</b> uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors {{on the face of the}} tube; the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an aperture grille of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.|$|R
5000|$|General Electric's Porta-Color was {{the first}} [...] "portable" [...] color {{television}} introduced in the United States. The Porta-Color set introduced a new variation of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> display <b>tube</b> invented by RCA. It had the electron guns arranged in an in-line configuration, rather than RCA's delta arrangement. The GE tube otherwise used {{the same kind of}} round dot phosphors as RCA, The main benefit of the in-line gun arrangement is that it simplified the convergence process, thus making true portability possible. There were many variations of this set produced from its introduction in 1966 until 1978, all using GE's Compactron vacuum tubes (valves).|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to utilize the Shadow Volume Algorithm by Crow and Williams without using a stencil buffer. We show that the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> can be {{generated}} in the alpha channel {{or even in the}} screen buffer, if a hardware accelerated stencil buffer is not available. In comparison to the original stencil buffer method, a small speed up can be achieved, if the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is computed in the alpha buffer. The method using the screen buffer requires the scene to be rendered a second time after the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> has been computed. Both methods are less restrictive with respect to hardware requirements, since we use only standard color blending and depth testing. In general, rasterization bandwidth is the main bottle neck when generating the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> at high screen resolutions. In order to overcome this bottle neck we propose a way to compute the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> at a resolution that is lower than the resolution of the screen buffer. Then the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is applied to the scene by utilizing texture mapping. The latter method might be reasonable especially in interactive entertainment, where rendering speed is traded in favour of image quality...|$|R
2500|$|If the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> becomes magnetized, its {{magnetic}} field deflects the electron beams passing through it, causing color purity distortion as the beams bend through the mask holes and hit some phosphors of a color {{other than that}} which {{they are intended to}} strike; e.g. some electrons from the red beam may hit blue phosphors, giving pure red parts of the image a magenta tint. (Magenta is the additive combination of red and blue.) This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is localized. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is unmagnetized. (A magnetized aperture grille has a similar effect, and everything stated in this subsection about <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> applies as well to aperture grilles.) ...|$|R
50|$|Doming is a {{phenomenon}} found on some CRT televisions in which parts of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> become heated. In televisions that exhibit this behavior, it tends to occur in high-contrast scenes {{in which there is}} a largely dark scene with one or more localized bright spots. As the electron beam hits the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> in these areas it heats unevenly. The <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> warps due to the heat differences, which causes the electron gun to hit the wrong colored phosphors and incorrect colors to be displayed in the affected area.|$|R

Better focusing allowed {{the size of the}} holes in the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> to increase in proportion to the opaque area, which improved display brightness.

40|$|The {{application}} of a three dimensional, self-aligning <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> in (110) -oriented silicon for thin-film metal deposition is discussed. This <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> {{is used for the}} deposition of metal tracks on the bottom of structures with vertical sidewalls, i. e., the patterning of metal catalytic patches underneath the membrane that covers the deep flow channel of a high-temperature gas microreactor. The accuracy of this patch definition—pattern spreading—is investigated for rhodium and platinum {{as a function of the}} mask-to-substrate distance. The pattern of sputter-deposited patches is subject to pattern spreading when the gap between the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> and the substrate is nonzero. The experimental patch widening shows a square root dependency on the gap size. Via numerical simulations of molecular gas flows using a direct simulation Monte Carlo method, it is shown that there is excellent agreement between the observed experimental data and this model taking into account values for the sticking () and accommodation () coefficients of the atoms on the walls of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> below unity (i. e., = 0. 5 and = 0. 1), and a baseline shift due to curvature and/or bending of the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> and/or substrate...|$|R

The coating thickness is accurately {{represented by a}} function composed of basic thickness, self-shadow effect, and <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> function. A type of mask with parabolic contours is proposed, and the thickness uniformity of coatings on spherical substrates can be improved in a large range of ratios of clear aperture (CA) to radius of curvature (RoC) by optimizing <b>shadow</b> <b>masks</b> using a numerical optimization algorithm. Theoretically, the thickness uniformity improves to more than 97. 5 % of CA/RoC from - 1. 9 to 1. 9. Experimentally, the thickness uniformities of coatings on a convex spherical substrate (CA/RoC = 1. 53) and on a concave spherical substrate (CA/RoC=- 1. 65) improve {{to be better than}} 98. 5 % after corrected by the <b>shadow</b> <b>masks...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{tool and}} method for {{flexible}} and rapid surface patterning technique beyond lithography based on high-resolution <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> method, or nanostencil, is presented. This {{new type of}} miniaturized <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> is fabricated {{by a combination of}} MEMS processes and focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Thereby apertures in a 100 - 500 nm thick low-stress silicon nitride membrane in the size range from 100 mum were made. The stencil device is mechanically fixed on the surface and used as miniature <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> during deposition of metal layers. Using this method, aluminum micro- and nanostructures as small as 100 nm in width were patterned. The deposited micro- and nano-scale structures were used as etch mask and transferred into a sub-layer (in our case silicon nitride) by dry plasma etching. High-resolution <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> can be used to create micro/nanoscale patterns on arbitrary substrates including mechanically fragile or chemically active surfaces.

50|$|In {{comparison}} to early <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> designs, the Trinitron grille cuts off {{much less of}} the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA sets built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the incoming signal, while the grille cuts off about 25%. Improvements to the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> designs continually narrowed this difference in the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> {{is one of}} the {{technologies}} used to manufacture cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer displays that produce color images. Another approach is the aperture grille, better known by its trade name, Trinitron. All early color televisions and the majority of CRT computer monitors used <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> technology. Both of these technologies are largely obsolete, having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display (LCD).|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{used the}} spark {{discharge}} method to generate catalytic aerosol nanoparticles for CNT synthesis and patterned the particle-deposited area using a <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> and the thermophoresis effect [12, 13]. With the patterned nanoparticles, site-specific growth of CNTs was demonstrated. Moreover, the blurring effect caused by adjusting the gap distance between the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> and the substrate allowed us to deposit the catalytic nanoparticles with adjustable and location-specific densities so that the density of synthesized CNTs could be controlled differently on a single substrate. The spark discharge technique is performed using simple equipment without any high-vacuum system, and it generates and deposits the catalytic nanoparticles under dry conditions and atmospheric pressure. In addition, the <b>shadow</b> <b>mask</b> can be used repeatedly without clogging or chemical damage, and all the fabrication steps including thermophoresis are scalable to wafer scale. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} integrate CNTs directly onto microstructures with high aspect ratios utilizing the <b>shadow</b> <b>masking</b> technique, which is difficult with conventional photolithographic patterning of a catalytic layer.|$|R
