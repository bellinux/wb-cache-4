A stoichiometric ethylene–oxygen mixture gas and five types of rectangular-cross-section curved channels with different inner radii of curvature were employed. The detonation waves propagating through the curved channels were visualized using a high-speed video camera. Multi-frame short-time open-shutter photography (MSOP) was developed in the present study to simultaneously observe the front <b>shock</b> shape <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> wave and the trajectories of triple points on the detonation wave. The detonation wave became more stable under the conditions of a higher filling pressure of the mixture gas and/or a larger inner radius of curvature of the curved channel. The critical condition under which the propagation mode <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> wave transitioned from unstable to stable was having an inner radius of curvature of the curved channel (ri) equivalent to 21 – 32 times the normal detonation cell width (λ).

The arrival time <b>of</b> the <b>shock</b> front was recorded at different locations along the test charge and the light emitted in the cases where detonation was initiated in the test explosive was monitored.

It is also found that for a given shock strength, the minimum charge radius that permits initiation corresponds to the distance necessary to establish detonation. In charges with small diameters, interactions between the input shock and the charge capsule walls permit initiation for input shock strengths that would normally not be sufficient to cause initiation.

We find that the characteristic critical lengths associated with the initial or boundary conditions are larger than the reference CJ characteristic chemical length by several orders of magnitude, a well-established experimental feature <b>of</b> gaseous <b>detonations.</b> We identify subcritical and supercritical limits which, respectively, give necessary and sufficient conditions for detonation. Below the subcritical limit, the combustion front cannot be coupled to the shock front because the volumetric expansion rate behind the shock is too large. Above the supercritical limit, the relaxation from an overdriven detonation regime to the self-sustained regime is a continuous process, without decoupling and recoupling of the combustion and shock fronts. We interpret the critical domain between these limits as the parametric zone in which experiments show successive decouplings and transverse recouplings of the combustion and shock fronts before the final self-sustained CJ regime...|$|R

40|$|Emulsion {{explosives}} are non-ideal explosives. The composition, rheological {{structure and}} its detonation properties {{were presented in}} previous ICT Conferences. Emulsion matrix is only detonable if it is sensitized (generally by hollow microspheres dispersed in the emulsion gelatin phase). Two kinds of spheres were used in experiments - expanded dry micro-spheres of 50 µm mean diameter (DE) and 5 mm expanded polystyrene spheres (EPS). The last big EPS spheres were successively dispersed in emulsion gelatin (emulsion matrix) and in emulsion explosive sensitized with DE microspheres. This sensitization mechanism {{can be explained by}} the deformation and collapse of the hollow microspheres, under shock detonation transmission, generating compressed hot gas and very high shear stress conditions in two lateral pockets. These two hot spot zones insure ignition of the outside emulsion matrix, generating, by the progress of reaction, cells and compressed layers, very well recorded in experimental tests, by the printed figures in copper witness plates. The experimental micro dynamic measurements were performed using optical techniques, using optical fibers and fast opto-electronic converters (presented previously in ICT Conferences). Two kinds of optical multimode fibers can be used in these measurements: PMMA and silica fibers. In a similar way, two kinds of opto-electronic receivers were used, as a function of optical range (maximum sensibility at 650 nm and 850 nm). Rise time is less than 50 ns. Silica fibers of 60 µm present more precise experimental measurements, due its reduced diameter and its more difficult ignition behavior with atmospheric air, when <b>shocked</b> from expansion <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> products.
