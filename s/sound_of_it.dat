Queen Mary originally had three whistles tuned to 55Hz, a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the extremely loud <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> would not be painful to human ears.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} these incidents, a friend of Lead Belly's, variously identified as either Lomax or Mary Elizabeth Barnicle joked that Washington was a [...] "bourgeois town." [...] Though Lead Belly did not know what the word [...] "bourgeois" [...] meant, he was fascinated by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip. The song came together quickly; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead Belly to write it. Lomax liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did {{a lot better than}} I {{thought it was going to}} do...From the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|Fear of a Black Planet was {{recorded}} in sessions held during June to October 1989 at Greene St. Recording in New York City, The Music Palace in West Hempstead, and Spectrum City Studios in Hempstead. It was produced entirely by The Bomb Squad, which included Chuck D, Eric [...] "Vietnam" [...] Sadler, and brothers Hank and Keith Shocklee. The sessions {{marked the first time}} that Keith was credited {{as a member of the}} team, playing a significant role in composing the main tracks and music for the album. Hank Shocklee directed them and was referred to by Chuck D as [...] "the Phil Spector of hip-hop". For Fear of a Black Planet, they sought to expand on the dense, sample-layered [...] "wall of noise" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, [...] "Black Coffee" [...] was {{included}} in the competitive music video game series SingStar. According to Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman, the [...] "smart-pop attack" [...] of the song [...] "paved the way" [...] for later girl groups Girls Aloud and the Sugababes. Neil Hannon of the Irish band The Divine Comedy expressed admiration for [...] "Black Coffee", commending its production-heavy sound which [...] "adds to the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> rather than taking anything away", and noted that its sound later became apparent in singles by Girls Aloud: [...] "Girls Aloud do pop like that now: songs like 'Biology' are a bit weird, and they flout the general rules, and I admire that. But 'Black Coffee' is better." [...] Writing for Metro in 2013, Seamus Duff stated that [...] "Black Coffee" [...] still sounded as [...] "fresh and relevant".|$|E
500|$|The film's soundtrack, marketed by Aditya Music, was {{released}} on 4 April 2006, at Hotel Viceroy in Hyderabad with Mahesh's father Krishna attending the event as the guest of honour. Sify called the soundtrack a peppy one and chose [...] "Gala Gala" [...] as the pick of the album. IndiaGlitz called it a [...] "run of the mill" [...] album that lacks freshness. The reviewer chose [...] "Devuda", [...] "Gala Gala" [...] and [...] "Ippatikinka" [...] as the picks of the album, rating each 3.5 out of 5. Cinegoer rated the soundtrack 3 out of 5 stars and stated: [...] "The first time you hear Pokiri, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is good; it doesn't start to grow on you after a while, {{but a few of}} the numbers are hummable and ring in your ears", calling it a [...] "mixed bag for Mani Sharma". The reviewer chose [...] "Dole Dole" [...] and [...] "Gala Gala" [...] as the picks of the album, rating each 3.5 out of 5.|$|E

500|$|Beecham {{had died}} in 1961, and Fenby writes that it [...] "seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other {{conductors}} have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of [...] "develop a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius". [...] The music has never become fashionable, [...] a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an [...] "acquired taste", Fenby answers: [...] "The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy {{an appeal to the}} many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few." [...] Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the Guardian journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as [...] "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it [...] "recollects emotion in tranquillity... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event".|$|E
2500|$|When Walter Hooper asked [...] {{where he}} found the word 'Narnia', Lewis showed him Murray's Small Classical Atlas, ed. G.B. Grundy (1904), which he {{acquired}} when he was reading the classics with Mr Kirkpatrick at Great Bookham [...] On plate 8 of the Atlas is a map of ancient Italy. Lewis had underscored {{the name of a}} little town called Narnia, simply because he liked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Narnia— or 'Narni' in Italian— is in Umbria, halfway between Rome and Assisi.|$|E
2500|$|In 1888 Heinz {{bought out}} his other two {{partners}} and reorganized {{the company as}} the H. J. Heinz Company. Its slogan, [...] "57 varieties", was introduced by Heinz in 1896. Inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting [...] "21 styles"), Heinz picked the number more or less at random because he liked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> selecting [...] "7" [...] specifically because, as he put it, of the [...] "psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones {{was also}} {{famous for his}} {{peculiar}} skill with the train whistle. His whistle was made of six thin tubes bound together, the shortest being half {{the length of the}} longest. Its unique sound involved a long-drawn-out note that began softly, rose and then died away to a whisper, a sound that became his trademark. The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was variously described as [...] "a sort of whippoorwill call," [...] or [...] "like the war cry of a Viking." [...] People living along the IC line between Jackson and Water Valley would turn over in their beds late at night upon hearing it and say [...] "There goes Casey Jones" [...] as he roared by.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Iwata {{composed}} music for titles from a number of different companies, including Quest. On several of these titles he was credited by the nickname REZON. The nickname comes from the name of the car the hero drove in a show he watched as a child, and he picked it up as he liked the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Iwata's first encounter with mainstream success in Japan came about in 1993 when he composed [...] along with Sakimoto. The soundtrack included a wide variety of instrumentation in its orchestral score, which was new to the composers who chose some instruments from a musical instrument description book Iwata had found. This collaboration led to Iwata co-composing several titles with Sakimoto over {{the next few}} years, culminating with his first brush with international success with Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. On these collaborations, the two typically divided up the work and worked on their own tracks, rather than co-compose each piece. Iwata also collaborated with several other artists during this period in his career, including Toshiaki Sakoda and Masanobu Tsukamoto.|$|E
