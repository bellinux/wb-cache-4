5|$|A film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Doctor Strange was initially listed as being in development at New World Pictures, with a <b>script</b> dated January 21, 1986 by Bob Gale. For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production. By 1989, Alex Cox had co-written a <b>script</b> with Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee. The <b>script</b> had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain Dormammu on Easter Island, Chile. A film using this <b>script</b> was almost made by Regency, but the company's films were distributed by Warner Bros. at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising. By December 1992, Wes Craven had signed to write and direct Doctor Strange for release in either 1994 or 1995, with Savoy Pictures distributing. In 1995, David S. Goyer had completed a <b>script</b> for the film. By April 1997, Columbia Pictures had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch {{was working on a}} new screenplay, with Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey producing.|$|E

5|$|By the 9th century CE, {{literature}} {{written in}} Sinhalese <b>script</b> had emerged and the <b>script</b> {{began to be}} used in other contexts. For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used the Sinhalese alphabet.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the <b>script</b> of Barfi!. The film <b>script</b> that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. He said that the <b>script</b> required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri <b>script</b> {{starting}} becoming dominant, and {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli <b>script.</b> Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri <b>script,</b> Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In December 1994, Alan Parker {{signed on}} to write and direct the film after being {{approached}} by Stigwood and Vajna. Parker also produced the film, with his Dirty Hands Productions banner enlisted as a production company. While drafting his own <b>script,</b> Parker researched Eva's life, compiling newspaper articles, documentaries and English-language books. He refused to borrow elements from Stone's <b>script</b> or the stage play, instead opting to model his <b>script</b> after Rice and Lloyd Webber's concept album. Stone had a falling out with Parker over {{the content of the}} <b>script,</b> claiming that he had made significant contributions. A legal dispute and arbitration by the Writers Guild of America resulted in Parker and Stone sharing a screenwriting credit.|$|E
30|$|Significant {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on document analysis and recognition problems in different Indian <b>scripts.</b> Several hundred languages are spoken and written in India with Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada and Gujrati being the popular ones. Some of the languages share common <b>scripts</b> while others have unique <b>scripts</b> of their own. Well-known Indian <b>scripts</b> include Devanagari, Telugu, Tamil and Kannada. These diverse <b>scripts</b> offer a variety of interesting and challenging problems to the document recognition community. Despite a rich diversity of <b>scripts</b> and languages, the number of standard databases on Indian <b>scripts</b> is relatively small. We discuss the databases developed on different Indian <b>scripts</b> in the following sections.|$|R
50|$|Server-side <b>scripting</b> is a {{technique}} used in web development which involves employing <b>scripts</b> on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website. The alternative is for the web server itself to deliver a static web page. <b>Scripts</b> can be written in any {{of a number of}} server-side <b>scripting</b> languages that are available (see below). Server-side <b>scripting</b> is distinguished from client-side <b>scripting</b> where embedded <b>scripts,</b> such as JavaScript, are run client-side in a web browser, but both techniques are often used together.|$|R

5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with the Khmer <b>script,</b> an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava <b>script</b> of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer <b>script</b> is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer <b>script</b> is also distantly related to the Mon <b>script,</b> the ancestor of the modern Burmese <b>script.</b> Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The <b>scripting</b> {{model of}} {{generators}} was originally developed for faster development of application generators in <b>scripting</b> languages. It was shown later that {{this model is}} not restricted only on <b>scripting</b> languages, so the appropriate library for generator development was developed in C++. For {{the purpose of this}} paper, the simple generator of PHP <b>scripts</b> for remote administration of database using web interface was developed. The application generators <b>scripting</b> model properties, like aspect orientation {{and the fact that the}} generators <b>scripting</b> model is typeless (which is the property of <b>scripting</b> languages like PHP) were important for this generator development...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the AppleScript implementation is the Open <b>Scripting</b> Architecture (OSA). Apple provides OSA for other <b>scripting</b> languages and third-party scripting/automation products such as QuicKeys and UserLand Frontier, to function on an equal status with AppleScript. AppleScript was implemented as a <b>scripting</b> component, and the basic specs for interfacing such components to the OSA were public, allowing other developers to add their own <b>scripting</b> components to the system. Public client APIs for loading, saving and compiling <b>scripts</b> would work the same for all such components, which also meant that applets and droplets could hold <b>scripts</b> in any of those <b>scripting</b> languages.|$|R
5|$|Meyer found {{writing the}} <b>script</b> to be a smooth process. He would write a few pages, {{show it to}} Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the <b>script</b> to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites. The {{completed}} <b>script</b> was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian {{has been}} written {{in a variety of}} alphabets, making it a {{language}} with one of the largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic <b>script</b> as indicated by Chinese sources. The Khitan large <b>script</b> adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) <b>script.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to their}} conquest of north China and the {{establishment}} of the Liao dynasty, the Khitans had no written language. In 920 the first of two Khitan scripts, the Khitan large <b>script,</b> was developed. A second <b>script,</b> the Khitan small <b>script,</b> was developed in 925. Both scripts are based on the same spoken language, and both contain a mix of logographs and phonographs. Despite the similarities to Chinese characters, the Khitan scripts were functionally different from Chinese.|$|E
