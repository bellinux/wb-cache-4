5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{first task}} is to polish Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand {{too close to the}} urinal and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|In December 1993, Morrison {{was charged}} with assault and public {{intoxication}} when he allegedly punched a University of Iowa student. Morrison said that the student had been <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Morrison pleaded guilty and paid a $310 fine, but said he was innocent.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday 23 March Seely {{had a meeting with}} Gough, with Paget, French and Spencer Ewart in attendance. Seely, who – by Gough’s account – {{attempted}} unsuccessfully to browbeat him by <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> accepted French’s suggestion that a written document from the Army Council might help to convince Gough’s officers. Seely took over a draft document to a Cabinet meeting for approval. Seely had to leave the meeting for an audience with the King, and in his absence the Cabinet agreed a text, stating that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was “the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands”.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year in}} Santo, Speck {{moved with}} his mother, his stepfather, and his sister Carolyn to the East Dallas section of Dallas, Texas, living at ten {{addresses}} in poor neighborhoods over the next dozen years. Speck loathed his often drunk and frequently absent stepfather, who psychologically abused him with insults and threats. Speck, a poor student who needed glasses for reading but refused to wear them, struggled through Dallas public schools from fourth through eighth grade, repeating eighth grade at J. L. Long Jr. High School, {{in part because he}} refused to speak in class because of a lifelong fear of people <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In autumn 1957, Speck started ninth grade at Crozier Technical High School, but failed every subject and did not return for the second semester in January 1958, dropping out just after his 16th birthday.|$|E

Returning to her home, she phones Mark telling him to come and asks a neighbour, Carlo (Gabriele Lavia), to keep her company. The lights suddenly go out and both Sara and Carlo are stabbed to death by a gloved killer. Mark discovers the bodies and two torn fragments from Rose's letter. After the police arrive, he walks out of Sara's apartment and sees a taxi slowly driving by.

After <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.|$|E

500|$|Other {{characters}} catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, {{the widow}} {{who runs the}} carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. [...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> while everyone else at the fair is swaying {{to the rhythm of}} Billy's spiel. [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. [...] They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.|$|E
500|$|Following the song's success, California rapper Mario [...] "Chocolate" [...] Johnson, an {{associate}} of record producer Suge Knight, claimed that he had helped in writing the song, and had not received credit or royalties.

In 2012, Mario [...] "Chocolate" [...] Johnson told to LA Weekly that this story is false.|$|E
500|$|On May 22, {{four days}} {{after the fall of the}} Muong Khoua {{garrison}}, three of its soldiers—the garrison radio operator Novak and two Laotians—reached the only remaining French outpost in northern Laos, Phong Saly. Bernard Fall recorded in Street Without Joy: [...] "he was only twenty-five years old, but he looked fifty; he kept on walking like an automaton to the centre of the post before he was stopped by some of the men <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as at a ghost." [...] Novak and the two other soldiers had spent the four days moving through the jungle of Laos following the defeat of their unit. Two days later, Sergeant Pierre Blondeau also arrived at the outpost. His account detailed 57 hours spent hiding from the Viet Minh before a three-day march without food or navigational aids and then encountering native tribesmen who provided food and a pony, with which he reached the French forces.|$|E
