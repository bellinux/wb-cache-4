5000|$|With {{problems}} with cancellations due to poor weather on the Snaefell Mountain Course the pole {{time for the}} Superbike TT race was set by John McGuinness in 17 minutes, 32.24 seconds an average speed of 129.085 mph. The 6 lap (226.38 miles) Superbike TT Race was scheduled for mid-day start on Saturday 31 May 2008 and the first competitor away from the TT Grandstand was Guy Martin who was delayed by 10 seconds from his designated start-time due to confusion in the pre-stage area. The next competitor, Conor Cummins riding a 1000cc Yamaha with a <b>start</b> <b>interval</b> of 10.00 seconds was delayed by about 4 seconds and John McGuinness at number 3 was delayed by 7 seconds and McGuinness said;- [...] "....still pulling one of my gloves on when I heard Martin's bike going down towards Bray Hill. I screamed at the boys to get the warmers off. I think everyone {{thought there was a}} delay. No one had called us forward." [...] The delays were accounted for in the lap-timing, although John McGuinness and 1000cc Honda was sidelined with an electrical mis-fire and pulled-in at Glen Helen on lap 2 and Guy Martin retired on lap 4 at Sulby with an oil-leak to his Honda motor-cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{first race}} on Monday 2 June 2008 was the 4 lap (150.92 miles) Superstock TT Race for 1000cc motor-cycles {{conforming}} to the 2008 MCRCB Superstock Regulations. The practice leaderboard for the Superstock TT Race was headed by Ryan Farquhar riding a 1000cc Kawasaki motor-cycle {{with a time}} of 17 minutes and 52.41 seconds an average speed of 126.657 mph set on Thursday evening practice. With low mist on the Mountain Section course the 2008 Superstock TT Race went ahead without a delay in the start-time and race officials cleared the grid at the 2-minute race-start signal to prevent the problems that occurred {{at the start of the}} Superbike TT Race. At Glen Helen in mixed road conditions on lap 1, the 1000cc Honda motor-cycle of John McGuinness led Gary Johnson with a race number 16 and a <b>start</b> <b>interval</b> of 2 minutes 30 seconds, by 2.3 seconds from the Suzuki of Bruce Anstey in 3rd place. By the time that McGuinness arrived at Ramsey Hairpin on lap 1 the other competitors had increased their race pace and he now only led by 0.16 seconds from the Suzuki of Cameron Donald. With further damp patches between Ramsey Hairpin and the Water Works Corner and mixed weather including mist on the Mountain Section, it was Cameron Donald that seized the initiative and now led McGuinness at the Bungalow by a narrow margin of 1.10 seconds. The first lap was completed in 17 minutes and 53.12 seconds an average speed of 126.573 mph by Cameron Donald to lead John McGuinness by 1.75 seconds in 2nd place, the Kawasaki of Ryan Farquhar in 3rd place and the Honda of Gary Johnson relegated to 4th place.|$|E
5000|$|The 2009 Superbike TT Race was {{scheduled}} for mid-day start on Saturday 6 June 2009 and to be flagged away by the former world motorcycling champion Giacomo Agostini and was delayed 48 hours due to inclement weather conditions. The pole time for the Superbike TT race was set by the Australian Cameron Donald in 17 minutes, 13.25 seconds an average speed of 131.457 mph riding a 1000 cc Suzuki motorcycle. The hot weather of TT practice week returned for the 6 lap (226.38 miles) Superbike TT Race held on Monday 9 June 2009. The first competitor flagged away at the start at the TT Grandstand was the 1000 cc Honda of Gary Johnson from Brigg followed by the 1000 cc Honda of John McGuinness with a 10-second starting interval. Starting at number 5 with a 40-second <b>start</b> <b>interval,</b> Bruce Anstey the Suzuki team-mate of injured Cameron Donald {{was the first to}} hit mechanical problems with a slight engine mis-fire at the bottom of Bray Hill and Bruce Anstey retired his 1000 cc Suzuki at Ballacraine on lap 1 with a fuel sensor problem. [...] It was the 1000 cc Honda of John McGuinness that led lap 1 at the first official timing point at Glen Helen by 1.91 seconds from Conor Cummins riding a 1000 cc Kawasaki motorcycle followed by the Honda brigade of Ian Hutchinson in 3rd place, Gary Johnson, Steve Plater and Guy Martin in 6th place. The lead at Parliament Square, Ramsey was increased by McGuinness to 5 seconds over Conor Cummins and Guy Martin leap-frogging the other competitors to 3rd place and the leading group was joined by the 1000 cc Yamaha of Ian Lougher in 7th place making his 100th Isle of Man TT race start. Over the Mountain Section of the course, John McGuinness maintained a 5.14 second lead over Conor Cummins at the end of lap 1in a time of 17 minutes, 26.61 seconds an average speed of 129.779 mph.|$|E

40|$|In {{the winter}} sport of luge {{successful}} start {{is a prerequisite}} for a good total run result. Athletes train their starting technique not only at luge tracks themselves, but also on specially built start ramps, both iced and for roller sleds. Lugers begin their movement along the track by pushing from the start grips and then continue accelerating by pushing off the ice surface with both hands several times before laying down on the sled. Before leaving the start grips athletes perform forth-and-back rocking motion, whilst holding the handles. Measurement of <b>start</b> <b>interval</b> time begins at a certain distance from the start grips, when athletes had already left the handles. The last preparation phase before taking-off the handles was analyzed in the study. During this phase athletes first move as far forward as possible (position “a”), then push themselves maximally backward (position “b”), and then again move forward, using their arms and body force to achieve maximal acceleration, and finally leave the handles (position “c”). Data were collected during start trainings at a specially built artificial skeleton-luge-bobsleigh iced start ramp, and compared to data achieved from competition at National Federation level that took place at the same ramp after the training camp. Three junior athletes (one male and two female) performed 4 starts during the competition, these starts and first 4 out of 10 starts during the training were analyzed. Total start time, time at which athletes changed their position from “a” to “b”, and time from position “b” to “c” were measured. Total start time was measured with accuracy up to 1 / 100 th of second using photocells. Other times were detected from video records performed with Casio EX-FH 20 digital camera at 210 Hz recording frequency. Angle between right thigh and torso at position “a” (angle α), torso inclination angle to horizontal line (angle β 1) and right thigh inclination angle to horizontal line (angle β 2) at position “b”, and maximal angle between right thigh and torso when moving from position “b” to “c”(angle γ) were also estimated from video records. Start time for male athlete (athlete C) was significantly shorter during competition, than during training (2, 16 s (± 0, 01) and 2, 19 s (± 0, 01) respectively). Start times did not differ significantly between female athletes and were similar both for competitive and training events (2, 39 s (± 0, 01) and 2, 37 s (± 0, 02) respectively for athlete A, and 2, 39 s (± 0, 01) in both cases for athlete B). Despite differences in the start time between male and female athletes, time from position “b” to “c” showed to be similar for all athletes both in training and competitive events. Athlete C and athlete A were significantly faster in changing position from “a” to “b” during competition than during training; for female athlete this time improvement was accompanied with decrease in angle α and increase of angle β 1, and opposite was the case for male athlete. All athletes tended to have angles γ larger during competition than during training. Athlete A, who tended to be slower during competition than during training, also showed a trend to be less stable in measured angles during competition if compared to other athletes...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{of athletes}} in sliding sports is track-specific and {{influenced}} by various factors, including environmental conditions and choice of equipment. During this study track-specific influence of interval {{times on the}} outcome of the run was examined for men single events in luge and skeleton. Lake Placid sliding track is thoroughly familiar to elite athletes due to its long traditions in hosting international competitive events, and therefore it was chosen for the study. Correlation analysis was performed in order to determine which intervals of the track have a strong influence on the run time over the whole distance. Ratio of the interval times to the total run time was determined. Correlation was computed between interval times and remaining run times, in order to obtain independent variables for analysis. Results of the correlation analysis from Lake Placid track were compared to results obtained from competitions at Whistler track. This track, in contrary to Lake Placid track, has been opened recently and hosted just a few competitive events, therefore being new to athletes. Results of the study had shown that <b>starting</b> <b>interval</b> at Lake Placid track influences the outcome of the run in luge more than in skeleton. Overall interval time influence at Lake Placid track is weaker for luge athletes that for athletes of skeleton. At Whistler track, however, correlation coefficients between interval times and remaining run times were at the same level both for skeleton and luge athletes. It was found that intervals that athletes cross at shorter times influence the result as much and even stronger than intervals that take longer time to pass. Interval times demonstrated stronger correlation with the remaining times for top- 10 results in luge than for results from 11 th to 25 th place. A similar tendency was found for the sport of skeleton: correlation coefficients for top- 10 athlete’s group were slightly higher than for athletes at ranked from 11 th to 20 th place. It was concluded that results of competitive runs at Lake Placid track for luge athletes are influenced by <b>starting</b> <b>interval</b> and the 3 rd interval time stronger than by other intervals. For skeleton athletes interval between curves 12 and 15 have a major importance. Since just two luge and one skeleton competition took place at Whistler track, only preliminary conclusions can be done for this track. During skeleton competition athletes were mostly influenced by the part of the track including curves 9 and 10, but no conclusions can be done about correlation between <b>starting</b> <b>interval</b> and remaining rune time. Correlation coefficient of 0. 46 was found between starting time and remaining run time for lugers at Whistler track...|$|R
