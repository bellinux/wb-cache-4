40|$|Baited remote {{underwater}} video stations (BRUVS) {{are used}} for monitoring fish assemblages and assessing management effectiveness in reef environments but are infrequently used in estuaries. A review of the BRUVS literature found that most adopted sampling designs from other studies were rarely designed from pilot studies. This potentially compromises their value for monitoring natural and anthropogenic variation. The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the suitability of BRUVS for sampling fishes in estuarine habitats (seagrass beds and unvegetated sediments) and (ii) to develop an optimal and cost effective sampling methodology for each habitat. Fishes in both habitats were sampled independently using BRUVS with <b>soak</b> <b>times</b> of 30, 60, 90 min (n = 4). Thirty five species of fishes were recorded including 18 species of economic importance. Mean number of species, mean total Max N and mean Max N of species did not differ among <b>soak</b> <b>times.</b> Precision was generally greater in seagrass and in both habitats it improved with increasing <b>soak</b> <b>time.</b> Bootstrapping revealed that greater improvements in precision occurred from increasing <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> rather than increasing replication. A sampling design with n = 5 replicates of 90 min <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> was optimal for most variables. This sampling effort is greater than many current applications of BRUVS. The results highlight the importance of pilot studies to optimise sampling methods and develop cost effective and statistically-robust monitoring programs...|$|R
50|$|Rice {{is often}} rinsed and soaked before cooked. Unpolished brown rice {{requires}} longer <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> than the milled white rice does. The {{amount of water}} added can vary depending on many factors. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water, and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling. This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on high heat until a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass.|$|E
50|$|Although whole {{mung beans}} are also {{occasionally}} used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used; but in Kerala & Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans are commonly boiled {{to make a}} dry preparation often served with rice gruel (kanji கஞ்ஞி). Dehulled mung beans {{can also be used}} in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups. Mung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung dal. In Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and fresh grated coconut in a preparation called sundal சுண்டல். In south and north Indian states, mung beans are also eaten as pancakes. They are soaked in water for six to 12 hours (the higher the temperature, the lesser <b>soaking</b> <b>time).</b> Then they are ground into fine paste along with ginger and salt. Then pancakes are made on a very hot griddle. These are usually eaten for breakfast. This provides high quality protein that is rare in most Indian regional cuisines. Pongal or kichdi is another recipe that is made with rice and mung beans without skin. In Kerala, it is commonly used to make the parippu preparation in the Travancore region (unlike Cochin and Malabar, where toor dal, tuvara parippu,துவரப்பருப்பு is used). It is also used, with coconut milk and jaggery, to make a type of payasam. Soaked Moong (both full or split) called Hesaru in Kannada is one of ingredient in Kosambari a salad.|$|E

The permeation tests on the GCL, submerged using different kinds of solutions with different concentrations, were carried out systematically by taking these chemical solutions as permeant liquids. Based on seasonal variations of ion concentrations in Chenjiachong landfill leachate (Wuhan Province), CaCl 2, MgCl 2, NaCl, and KCl were selected as chemical attack solutions to carry out experimental investigations under three concentrations (50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM) and <b>soak</b> <b>times</b> (5, 10, and 20 days). The variation law of the GCL hydraulic conductivity under different operating conditions was analyzed. The relationship between GCL hydraulic conductivity, chemical solutions categories, concentrations, and <b>soak</b> <b>times</b> were further discussed. The GCL hydraulic conductivity, when soaked and permeated with high concentration chemical solutions, increases several times or exceeds two orders of magnitude, as compared with the permeation test under normal conditions that used water as the permeant liquid.
