5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once {{again by the}} Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E
25|$|Katarina {{first met}} the Seventh Doctor when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> As the Doctors looked different, she was unaware {{that they were}} the same person. She spoke to him of her {{ambition}} to serve as a handmaid to a priestess because her poor family could not afford to feed her any longer. The Doctor gave her family a gold coin, which would feed them for a year.

25|$|Because {{of these}} romantic feelings, Bianca helps JR win Marissa back by {{suggesting}} romantic dates and gifts {{that he can}} give to Marissa. Bianca does all this because she realizes that Marissa may never reciprocate the same feelings for her. One of the gifts that Bianca gives to JR for Marissa is a music box. This music box plays a song that Marissa's adoptive father used to sing to her when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> JR gives the music box to Marissa while at the park with the kids. While Marissa is listening to the music box, Bianca watches from afar how much Marissa enjoys the gift and walks away.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Bensenville, Illinois, and began to play sandlot ball with the boys of her {{neighborhood}} when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> At age 15, she attended Bensenville Community High School, where she heard about Philip K. Wrigley and his remarkable experiment in creating a women professional baseball league during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball. By then, the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. The league started its first season in 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Wagner was allocated to the Kenosha Comets, where she played her entire career in the circuit.|$|E
500|$|Min grew up {{mostly in}} Littleton, Colorado, where her family moved {{just before she}} started first grade.

At the end of the episode, a crack is shown in the wall behind where the TARDIS had been parked. The crack, having first appeared in Amy's bedroom when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> has been a recurring theme; in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] the Doctor discovers it has the power to erase things from existence, the reason Amy cannot remember the Daleks.|$|E
500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the way she did when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E

Strengthened by her parents confidence, she never considered the possibility her dream wouldn't come true. If so she'd have quite a problem, having nothing in reserve. The only moment she had her doubts was at the academy. She noticed her teachers did not share her parents' trust. They {{had no idea what to}} make of her and as a result she had to do the year all over again. Though being very disappointed, she was strong an resilient and finally graduated in 1997. On her time at the Amsterdamse Toneelschool she commented: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} {{name of the}} cove was Eastern Point Harbour or Peggs Harbour in 1766. The village is likely named after Saint Margaret's Bay (Peggy being the nickname for Margaret), which Samuel de Champlain named after his mother Marguerite. There has been much folklore created to explain the name. [...] One story suggests the village may have been named after the wife of an early settler. The popular legend claims that the name came from the sole survivor of a shipwreck at Halibut Rock near the cove. Artist and resident William deGarthe {{said she was a}} young woman while others claim <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> too young to remember her name and the family who adopted her called her Peggy. The young shipwreck survivor married a resident of the cove in 1800 and became known as [...] "Peggy of the Cove", attracting visitors from around the bay who eventually named the village Peggy's Cove, after her nickname.|$|E

2500|$|Ung's {{father was}} born in the small village of Tro Nuon in Kampong Cham {{province}} in 1931. [...] Her mother was from China and moved with her family to Cambodia when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> They married against her family's wishes, and eventually came to live with their children in a third-floor apartment {{in the center of the}} bustling capital city of Phnom Penh. [...] Due to his record of service in the previous government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Ung's father was conscripted into the government of Lon Nol, and became a high-ranking military police officer. Ung's mother supported her family as a homemaker. The family was relatively well-off and owned two cars and a truck, and their house used running water, a flushable toilet, and an iron bathtub. [...] They also had telephones as well as the daily services of a maid, and often enjoyed films at the nearby theater and swimming in the pool at a local club. By her own account, Loung lived a happy and carefree life in a close-knit loving family, until April 17, 1975, when the Khmer Rouge gained control of Cambodia and evacuated Phnom Penh.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrianne León was {{announced}} {{to become a}} recast {{for the role of}} Colleen. Leon wanted to portray Colleen as more grown up and a little different from Fonseca's take on the role, saying she would be [...] "coming back with a whole new determination to get what she wants" [...] and that [...] "she didn't have any expectations set in stone, but it's always hard to see your first love with someone else". When Colleen returned, she acted as an obstacle in J.T.'s romance with Mackenzie Browning (then Rachel Kimsey). When Kimsey was let go and Mackenzie exited, J.T. and Colleen reunited, and another obstacle designed to break them up {{came in the form of}} a new character, Adrian Korbel (Eyal Podell). León theorized that while Colleen felt an attraction to Korbel, her heart belonged to J.T., saying: [...] "She absolutely loves him and adores him, but she's going through that change where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and now she's not. She's growing up and evolving. The bad boy was interesting to her when she was a teenager, but now she's more interested in the intellectual." [...] Leon portrayed the character as confused while she conflicted between her love for J.T. and her attraction to Korbel. Colleen later cheated on J.T. with him, and they separated for the final time.|$|E
2500|$|Lucinda's Secret was {{published}} on October 1, 2003. The novel opens upon an argument among the Grace children {{on whether or}} not to destroy the Field Guide, Jared alone insisting that they keep it. They eventually agree to consult their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who is now staying in a psychiatric hospital and is the only person whom they know to have been in contact with Arthur Spiderwick, who was her father. When they ask her about Arthur, it is revealed that the last she saw him was one day when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> on which Arthur had set out from the house on foot and never returned. She is horrified that the Grace family is staying at the Estate, which she says is not safe, and even more worried when she hears that they have the Guide, believing her father to have taken it with him when he disappeared. However, when Jared takes the book from his backpack to show her, it has been replaced with another book, presumably by Thimbletack. Once home, the Grace children decide {{to find out what happened}} to their great-great uncle, and set out from the Estate with a map of the area on which is written [...] "September 14th. Five O'clock. Bring the remains of the book." [...] On their journey they meet a Phooka: a creature that talks only in riddles. They finally reach a river grove inhabited by thieves, who threaten to trap one of the children there unless the guide is given to them. The children flee, however, promising to bring the Guide as soon as they can. On passing by the Phooka again, one of his riddles leads them to think that Arthur is still alive, but imprisoned in Faerie with the elves.|$|E
