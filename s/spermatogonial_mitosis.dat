40|$|Abstract 27 microRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small {{endogenous}} RNAs, 19 to 25 28 nucleotides in size, which {{play a role in}} the regulation of gene expression at 29 transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Spermatogenesis is a complex process 30 through which spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) proliferate and differentiate into 31 mature spermatozoa. Huge amount of miRNAs are abundantly expressed in 32 Spermatogenic cells. Growing evidence supports the essential role of miRNA 33 regulation in normal spermatogenesis and male fertility and cumulative research has 34 shown that this form of regulation contributes to the etiology of 35 testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). In this review, we addressed recent 36 advancements of miRNA expression profiles in testis and focused on the regulatory 37 functions of miRNA in the process of SSC renewal, <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis,</b> 38 spermatocyte meiosis, spermiogenesis and the occurence of TGCTs. 39 40 1 miRNA overview 4...|$|E
40|$|There {{are always}} more evidences {{indicating}} that 17 beta-estradiol (E- 2) {{is to be}} necessary for normal male fertility. Here we report {{the expression of the}} most ubiquitously expressed member of the akt family of genes, akt 1, in the lizard (Podarcis s. sicula) testis. We have used a nonmarnmalian vertebrate model (the lizard P. s. sicula) to investigate the regulation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt activity, implicated in the control of cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism, in the testis during the annual sexual cycle and to study whether E- 2 exerts a role in the spermatogenesis through Akt- 1 activity. Immunocytochemistry analysis show that Akt- 1 proteins are present in the spermatogonia (SPG), and spermatocytes (SPC), and spermaticls (SPT). The annual E- 2 profile shows a progressive increase during the active spermatogenesis (from April to June) and a peak in the month of August (<b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis).</b> In parallel, Akt- 1 (molecular weight 60 kDa) are highly phosphorylated during the period of active spermatogenesis and in post-refractory period (August) compared with the winter stasis (from November to March). Present results demonstrate that E- 2 treatment induces the activation of Akt- 1, and this effect is counteracted by the anti-estrogen ICI 182 - 780. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{administration}} of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) on proliferation and apoptosis of male germ cells were evaluated on Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) reared in captivity. Fish (n = 19) {{were treated with}} a sustained-release delivery system loaded with GnRHa during the natural spawning season of 2004 and 2005 (June–July). Untreated Control fish (n = 17) and adult wild spawners were used for comparison. Fish were sacrificed 2 – 8 d after GnRHa implantation and body weight and gonadweightwere recorded, and gonads and bloodwere taken. Germ cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated through the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the terminal doxynucleotidyl transferasemediated d’UTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) method, respectively. Plasma 11 ketotestosterone (11 -KT) levels were measured using an ELISA method. Mean gonado-somatic index and seminiferous lobule diameter did not differ between GnRHa-treated and Control fish, and were significantly lower in captive-reared ndividuals than in wild spawners. Significant increases in 11 -KT plasma levels and <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis,</b> along with a reduction of germ cell apoptosis were demonstrated in GnRHa-treated fish compared to Controls. The results suggest that GnRHa administration was effective in enhancing germ cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis in captive males through the stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) release and testicular 11 -KT production...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogenesis can {{be divided}} into three stages: <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis,</b> meiosis of spermatocytes, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, {{spermatids}} undergo dramatic morphological changes including formation of a flagellum and chromosomal packaging and condensation of the nucleus into the sperm head. The genes regulating the latter processes are largely unknown. We previously discovered that a bi-functional gene, Spag 16, is essential for spermatogenesis. SPAG 16 S, the 35 kDa, testis-specific isoform derived from the Spag 16 gene, was found to bind to meiosis expressed gene 1 product (MEIG 1), a protein originally thought {{to play a role in}} meiosis. We inactivated the Meig 1 gene and, unexpectedly, found that Meig 1 mutant male mice had no obvious defect in meiosis, but were sterile as a result of impaired spermatogenesis at the stage of elongation and condensation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the manchette, a microtubular organelle essential for sperm head and flagellar formation was disrupted in spermatids of MEIG 1 -deficient mice. We also found that MEIG 1 associates with the Parkin co-regulated gene (PACRG) protein, and that testicular PACRG protein is reduced in MEIG 1 -deficient mice. PACRG is thought to play a key role in assembly of the axonemes/flagella and the reproductive phenotype of Pacrg-deficient mice mirrors that of the Meig 1 mutant mice. Our findings reveal a critical role for the MEIG 1 /PARCG partnership in manchette structure and function and the control of spermiogenesis...|$|E

Here we report {{the effects of}} LL on gene expression and levels of hormones of the brain-pituitary-gonad axis during this period. Results show that the extended release of GnRH 1 and GnRH 2 likely favors the early surge (September) of plasma FSH in controls. On the contrary LL shortens GnRHs release delaying the surge plasma FSH. Also this early FSH plasma rise coincided with the first increase of <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis</b> (SPGA), supporting the proliferative role of FSH. The inverse correlation between Anti Müllerian Hormone (Amh) gene expression and mitosis of SPGA cells supports the claimed inhibitory role of Amh on cell proliferation which in turn seems to be upstream regulated by the FSH. Besides, high levels of plasma estradiol, testosterone and 11 -KT appear to be maintained by the increasing levels of FSH. In conclusion apparently high levels of GnRHs, rising plasma FSH and high plasma sexual steroids during early or mid September are key factors to elicit SPGA cells mitotic proliferation. This concurrence of factors is lessen or delayed by LL being responsible {{for the prevention of}} male precocious puberty.

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of mammalian seminiferous tubules {{can be divided}} into three phases: <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis,</b> sper-matocyte meiosis, and a postmeiotic phase in which drastic mor-phological changes occur in spermatids (spermiogenesis). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in spermiogenesis, we have applied a differential display method to identify genes that are developmentally up-regulated during rat testis development. One of the cDNA fragments isolated by differential display turned out to be iba 1, an ionized calcium binding adapter molecule- 1, that contains two EF hand-like mo-tifs. Expression of iba 1 mRNA in the rat testis was detected first at 4 wk in postnatal development and then increased up to adulthood. Using the antibody against a synthetic peptide cor-responding to the N-terminal Iba 1 protein, we discovered that Iba 1 protein was not detectable by immunohistochemistry in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids in adult rat testis but was specifically expressed in the cytoplasm of elon-gate spermatids (steps 10 – 19) as well as in residual bodies that are ultimately engulfed by Sertoli cells. In situ hybridization, on the other hand, revealed that iba 1 mRNA is present in round spermatids as well as early elongate spermatids (steps 1 – 12) but not in late spermatids, suggesting that iba 1 mRNA undergoes post-transcriptional regulation. Because Iba 1 protein is specifi-cally expressed in the cytoplasm of elongate spermatids, which is finally engulfed as residual bodies into Sertoli cells, we suggest that Iba 1 may be involved in the final stage of spermiogenesis (i. e., in elimination of the residual cytoplasm from spermatids). sperm, spermatid, spermatogenesis, teste...|$|E
40|$|Many {{germ cell}} studies {{over the last}} century have focused on {{testicular}} cell culture (Wolff and Haffen, 1965; Russell and Steinberger, 1989; Kierszenbaum, 1994). The first germ cell culture systems were directed at studying gonadal embryogenesis and male germ cell differentiation. Today’s culture systems are powerful tools that bring about new knowledge and applications to the study of spermatogenesis. The culture of Sertoli cells is mentioned only as a coculture process with germ cells. The main focus of this review is the differentiation of male germ cells, and more precisely, the meiotic step of that differentiation. The various studies can be divided into 3 main categories depending on the historical advancement (early attempts at gametogenesis in vitro, intermediate progress, and latest refinements). Examples highlighting the strong and weak points of each period are summarized in this review. Early Attempts at Gametogenesis In Vitro Tissue culture—Champy (1920) first described differentiation of male germ cells in vitro in his cultures of small parts of testis from adult rabbits in blood plasma. But this basic method appeared to be inadequate for the survival of cultured germ cells. Indeed, although somatic and undifferentiated germ cells survived for 1 week at best, differentiating germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids) degenerated within 2 to 7 days. Yet, Champy observed <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis</b> in the first week and newly formed leptotene primary spermatocytes after 9 days. It was the first report of male germ cells having entered meiotic prophase in vitro. Michailow (1937) reported that seminiferous tubules from immature rabbits could surviv...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) {{and levels of}} polyamines were measured in the testes of Asterias vulgaris  collected throughout an annual spermatogenic cycle. Samples of the testes were prepared for light and electron microscopy to observe the associated changes in the cytology of germinal cells. The specific {{activity of}} ODC increased {{at the onset of}} testicular growth, decreased during the coldest period of the winter when testicular growth was minimal, and increased again early in the spring when testes grew maximally. Increased activity of ODC resulted in increased levels of polyamines and was correlated with either mitotic or meiotic germinal cell divisions, or both. Spermine levels were always greater than putrescine, followed by spermidine. Highest levels of polyamine synthesis coincided with the onset of spermatogonial proliferation during the fall and with the period of meiotic differentiation and spermiogenesis in the spring. Mid-summer (July) testes were small (0. 3 – 0. 5 gonad index (GI)) and contained amitotic spermatogonia arrested in G 1  of the cell cycle. Mitotic and pre-meiotic testes (October/November) increased slightly in size (0. 3 – 1. 4 GI) and contained actively dividing spermatogonia, most of which differentiated into primary spermatocytes. Testes from February and March were large (1 – 6. 75 GI), but the proliferative status of their spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes varied. Spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes from early February testes were not dividing. In testes obtained in March, both <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis</b> and meiosis of spermatocytes resumed, coincident with increased field water temperatures. </span...|$|E
40|$|Chromatin {{structure}} and function are for a large part determined by the six members of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family, which form three heterodimeric complexes: Smc 1 / 3 (cohesin), Smc 2 / 4 (condensin) and Smc 5 / 6. Each complex has distinct and important roles in chromatin dynamics, gene expression and differentiation. In yeast and Drosophila, Smc 6 is involved in recombinational repair, restarting collapsed replication forks and prevention of recombination in repetitive sequences such as rDNA and pericentromeric heterochromatin. Although such DNA damage control mechanisms, as well as highly dynamic changes in chromatin composition and function, are essential for gametogenesis, knowledge on Smc 6 function in mammalian systems is limited. We therefore have investigated the role of Smc 6 during mammalian spermatogonial differentiation, meiosis and subsequent spermiogenesis. We found that, during mouse spermatogenesis, Smc 6 functions as part of meiotic pericentromeric heterochromatin domains that are initiated when differentiating spermatogonia become irreversibly committed toward meiosis. To our knowledge, we {{are the first to}} provide insight into how commitment toward meiosis alters chromatin {{structure and}} dynamics, thereby setting apart differentiating spermatogonia from the undifferentiated spermatogonia, including the spermatogonial stem cells. Interestingly, Smc 6 is not essential for <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis,</b> whereas Smc 6 -negative meiotic cells appear unable to finish their first meiotic division. Importantly, during meiosis, we find that DNA repair or recombination sites, marked by γH 2 AX or Rad 51 respectively, do not co-localize with the pericentromeric heterochromatin domains where Smc 6 is located. Considering the repetitive nature of these domains and that Smc 6 has been previously shown to prevent recombination in repetitive sequences, we hypothesize that Smc 6 has a role in the prevention of aberrant recombination events between pericentromeric regions during the first meiotic prophase that would otherwise cause chromosomal aberrations leading to apoptosis, meiotic arrest or aneuploidie...|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en el 9 th International Symposium on Reproductive Physiology of Fish celebrado en Cochin (India) del 9 al 14 de agosto de 2011 Small fish {{displayed}} a remarkable {{delay in the}} progression of testicular development that prevented them from achieving spermiation in February. Large fish entered in <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis</b> towards meiosis in September, almost 1. 5 month earlier than S group attaining full spermiogenesis in February. The highest FSH plasma levels were observed in L fish which almost doubled the FSH values of S fish at this time (p< 0, 05). These high levels of FSH were linked to spermatogonial proliferation and associated {{with the onset of}} gametogénesis, as in other teleost, [5]. A transient FSH peak (p< 0. 05) was observed at mid December in L fish coincident with increasing levels of LH suggesting a possible collaborative role of both gonadotropins in eliciting the 11 KT surge observed at this time that in turn would drive active spermatogenesis forward and meiosis of germinal cells [2, 4,]. Finally, in L fish LH increased from mid October onwards peaking in February coinciding with full spermiation, revealing its prominent role at late gametogenesis. In S fish levels of LH were lower, started to increase one month later and peaked in February but with about half of the value shown by L fish at this date. In both groups 11 -KT exhibited the highest levels by middle of December although values of L doubled those of S (p< 0. 05). In L fish a transient but significant elevation of 11 KT was observed by the end of September coincident with the highest levels of FSH observed at this date, confirming the steroidogenic role of FSH in sea bass [6] and its mediation in stimulating early stages of spermatogenesis as previously suggested in other fish [5]. Though small fish had similar endocrine profiles as L fish, their amplitude were much lower being most likely the reason why functional competence of the BPG axis in former fish did not occur. Apparently fish size is a permissive condition to guaranty full effectiveness of the hormonal actions. The ELISA for sea bass FSH showed a high degree of parallelism between the standard curve and serially diluted plasma and pituitary samples of this species. The assay has a high sensitivity and reliability. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} morphometric {{study was}} to obtain {{quantitative}} information on the seminiferous tubules of Sprague-Dawley rats, including changes seen at various stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Tissue from perfusion-fixed testes was embedded in Epon-Araldite; and sections were subjected to morphometric measurements at the light microscopic level, using point counting for volume densities and the Floderus equation for numerical densities. Changes occur in {{the diameter of the}} seminiferous tubule, {{as well as in the}} volume of the seminiferous epithelium and tubule lumen, from stage to stage during the cycle. A significant constriction of the seminiferous tubule accompanies spermiation. The volume of the seminiferous epithelium per unit length of the tubule begins to increase after stage XIV, and peaks at stage V of the next cycle. The tubule lumen increases dramatically from stages V to VII, at the expense of the epithelium. The number of Sertoli cells is constant per unit length of the seminiferous tubule at all stages of the cycle. This is also true for primary spermatocytes of various developmental phases and for round spermatids from step 1 through step 10 of spermiogenesis. The average number of younger (preleptotene, leptotene, zytgotene) primary spermatocytes per Sertoli cell is 2. 34 ± 0. 082 (SEM), the number of older (pachytene, diplotene) primary spermatocytes per Sertoli cell is 2. 37 ± 0. 064, and the ratio of step 1 – 10 spermatids to Sertoli cells is 7. 89 ± 0. 27. By studying tangential views of serially sectioned seminiferous tubules at stage V, it is shown that the number of step- 17 spermatids associated with each Sertoli cell averages 8. 35 ± 0. 128, although the counts ranged from 6 to 11. The only appreciable occurrence of cell death after the last <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis</b> appears to be a 15 % loss during the first meiotic division. From our morphometric results, corrected for volume changes during preparation for microscopy, there are 15. 7 million (± 0. 99 million) Sertoli cells per gram of fresh rat testis. The length of seminiferous tubule per gram of testis is estimated to be 12. 4 ± 0. 56 meters, and the tubule surface area per gram testis is 119. 7 ± 2. 57 cm 2.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{colchicine}} upon the spermatogenesis of Triatoma infestans, (Hemipt. Heteroptera), {{has been studied}} and the different categories of giant spermatids that appear during the treatment have been compared with the nuclear volumes of the whole series of normal spermatogenetic stages. The following facts have been ascertained: 1) 4 hours after the treatment the gonial mitotic metaphases, and the 1 st. and 2 nd. metaphases of meiosis are stopped. The prophasic stages of meiosis and diakynesis appear to be normal. After 9 days of treatment, all the tetrads are broken in the meiotic metaphases and the cells appear with 44 and 22 chromosomes respectively, scattered in the cytoplasm. 2) At 9 days, practically all spermatogenetic stages have disappeared {{except for a few}} cysts of spermatogonia, and practically the whole testicle is full of cysts of spermatozoa and spermatid, with some large zones of necrosis with pycnotic nuclei. The spermatids appear to be of different sizes and the statistical analysis of the nuclear volumes gives a polymodal hystogram with 4 modes, whose volumes are in the ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 : 8. Ripe spermatozoa seem to have a certain volume variability, that has not been possible to analyse quantitatively. All these facts confirm what DOOLEY found in the colchicinized Orthoptera testicle. 3) The caryometric analysis conducted statistically on the normal stages of the spermatogenesis (resting spermatogonia, gonial prophases, leptotene, "confused stage", diakynesis, and spermatid) revealed the following facts: a) Considering the volume of the resting, spermatogonia as 1, their mitotic prophases have a volume of 2. Some rare prophases appear to have a volume of 4 and probably belong to tetraployd spermatogonia normally present in the testicle of Hemiptera. b) The first spermatocyte {{at the beginning of the}} auxocitary growth (leptotene) has a volume of 2, which is equal to that of them gonial prophase. It grows further during the "confused stage" and reduplicates, reaching thus the volume of 4. Diakynesis has a rather variable nuclear volume and it is higher than volume 4. This is probably of physico-chemical nature and not a growth increase. c) The spermatid at the beginning of the spermiogenetic process has a volume of 1 which is very constant and homogeneous. 4) These results can be summarized concluding that the meiotic process begins from a spermatogonium at the end of his mitotic interphasic growth (vol. 2) and instead of entering into the mitotic prophase transforms itself into the leptotene spermatocyte. During the diplotene ("confused stage") the volume of the nucleus doubles once more and reaches volume 4. In consequence of the two successive meiotic divisions the spermatid, although having an haploid number of chromosomes, has a nuclear volume of 1, just like the diploid spermatogonium. The interpretation of this strange result probably comes from the existence of the "tertiary split" in the chromosomes of the haploid set, that has been illustrated in the Hemiptera by HUGUES SCHRADER and in Orthoptera by MICKEY and co-workers. The tertiary split indicates that the chromosomes of the haploid set are constituted from almost two chromonemata, and this double constitution corresponds to the double cycle of reduplication that takes place during the spermatogenesis starting from the resting gonia. In Triatoma infestans the tertiary split appears in the chromosomes in the 1 st. and 2 nd. metaphases and in the diakynesis. In the blocked metaphases at the 9 th. day of colchicinization some of the 44 elements scattered in the cytoplasm, show, when properly oriented, the split very clearly. Some new and strange facts revealed by SCHRADER and LEUCHTEMBERGER in Arvelius suggest the possibility of other interpretations of the rhythmic growth in special cases. There appears the necessity of more knowledge about the multiple or simple constitution of the chromosomes in somatic and <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>mitosis...</b>|$|E
