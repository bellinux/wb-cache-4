5|$|Maha Chakkraphat saw the Burmese army's retreat as an {{opportunity}} {{take advantage of their}} weakness, so he ordered Princes Ramesuan and Thammaracha to follow and harass the enemy out of Siamese territory. For three days, the Siamese chased the invaders, inflicting great losses upon them. Once the forces of Ramesuan and Thammaracha closed in, Tabinshwehti made a stand near Kamphaeng Phet, dividing his forces on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The Siamese in their eagerness fell into the trap. The Burmese captured both Prince Ramesuan and Maha Thammaracha as prisoners of war.|$|E

The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, {{both of which were}} repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E

5|$|Route 27 crosses into Rahway, Union County and intersects the {{northern}} terminus of Route 35. Route 27 continues north using four-lane St. Georges Avenue. The route passes through Rahway, passing by residences and businesses. In Rahway, the route sees about 25,022 cars a day. It continues northeast and crosses into Linden, where the route heads through a more commercial setting with businesses lining both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> At the intersection with County Route 617 (Wood Avenue), Route 27 forms {{the border of}} Roselle {{to the west and}} Linden to the east, with about 23,081 vehicles using the road on a daily basis. It passes by Warinaco Park and forms the border between Elizabeth to the west and Linden to the east before entirely entering Elizabeth at the Richford Terrace intersection.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of this}} portion, {{the road}} is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth in the last few years.|$|E
5|$|On the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between the hamlet of Asch and Stockach. A third charge succeeded in taking the road, but the Austrian forces reformed the line and the artillery, now {{at the head of}} a wedge, bombarded the French troops. In a bayonet charge, the French took the hamlet of Wahlweiss, but Ferino's troops could not hold it and withdrew during the night. Jourdan then ordered a general withdrawal from the region, instructing his divisions to retreat along the lines of march they had followed into the region, and himself establishing a command post at Hornberg. He sent the cavalry to the western side of the Black Forest, where the horses could expect to find better forage.|$|E

5|$|Skleros {{eventually}} set {{out from}} the city, and divided his forces into three groups: two divisions were placed in ambush on the wooded <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> leading towards the Rus' camp, while another, probably some 2,000–3,000 men, was placed under himself (or Alakaseus in Skylitzes' account) and went forth to attack the Rus' host. The Byzantine detachment quickly {{came into contact with}} the Rus' army, and charged the Pecheneg contingent. The Byzantines executed a gradual orderly retreat, turning at intervals to charge back at the pursuing Pechenegs, who had thus become separated from {{the main body of the}} Rus' army. This conflict was fierce and bloody, taxing the discipline and endurance of the small Byzantine force. According to Leo the Deacon, at one point one of the Pechenegs charged Bardas himself and delivered a sword blow on his helmet, which was deflected by the metal without doing harm. Bardas' young brother Constantine came to his rescue, killing the Pecheneg.|$|E
5|$|The 738th Regiment of the 718th Infantry Division was {{reinforced}} by pioneers, four NDH battalions, four NDH artillery batteries and two-and-a-half German mountain gun batteries. It pushed east from Sarajevo along the Prača valley then through the Romanija mountains towards Rogatica. Fighting in very difficult terrain, it captured 240 insurgents and significant amounts of weapons and ammunition. It also freed 10 Italian and 57 NDH soldiers. The other regiment of the 718th Infantry Division, the 750th Regiment, {{was reinforced}} by a German artillery battery, an NDH infantry battalion and an NDH mountain battery. It moved south from an assembly area southwest of Tuzla towards Olovo. It reached Kladanj on 16 January, and spent the following days clearing both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> west towards Vlasenica. It had been planned that the Italian 3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna would provide a cordon to the south, blocking any southerly withdrawal by the insurgents. This did not occur, as the Italians claimed the railroad near Mostar had been damaged, resulting in several weeks delay.|$|E
5|$|While {{maintaining}} a cordon between the Austrian forces approaching from Switzerland, under command of Baron von Hotze, most of Ferino's division {{participated in a}} simultaneous assault in the first hours of the engagement at Stockach. With part of Joseph Souham's Center (the II. Division of the Army of the Danube), they assaulted the Austrian left, but were stopped by overwhelming numbers. Ferino tried to attack again, initiating his assault with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, {{both of which were}} repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond, because he had run out of artillery ammunition, but his troops fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwiess, capturing it despite the heavy fire and massive numbers. They were forced to relinquish the village at darkness.|$|E

5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at the two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E
5|$|Around 15:00, {{masses of}} Russian troops started {{preparations}} for the assault on Polish positions near the Jerozolimskie Gate. A strong force under Muraviev and Nostitz occupied positions on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> towards Cracow, near Rakowiec. The screening force included the Grenadier Brigade (ca. 1700 infantry, 16 guns), Cuirasseur Brigade (ca. 1,300 cavalry, 16 guns), Guard Uhlans Regiment (392 cavalry) and three cavalry regiments (ca. 1,700 cavalry, 16 guns). Between the screening forces two columns were formed. The left column commanded by Col. Nikolai Lukash was composed of Lutsk and Samogitian Infantry Regiments (1989 men altogether), with the Finland Guard Regiment in reserve (1,374 men). The column was to storm the Fort 74. The right column was commanded by Col. Roth and was composed of a reinforced Nieśwież Infantry Regiment (1278 men), with the 4th Jäger Regiment (900 men), Guards Rifle Regiment (1,353 men) and the Finland Rifles (142 men) in reserve. This column was to assault Fort 72. On the southern front the forces of Strandmann were to attack in force towards Królikarnia and elsewhere, to pressure the Poles {{on more than one}} front.|$|E
5|$|M-85 {{starts a}} {{directional}} interchange with I-75 in near Rockwood; traffic {{to or from}} southbound I-75 must use Gibraltar Road instead. M-85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard. There are many businesses directly adjacent to Fort Street in the Downriver area with residential subdivisions {{on either side of}} them. The trunkline parallels lines of the Norfolk Southern and Canadian National railways. In this area, M-85 is also running parallel to, but inland from, {{the southern part of the}} Detroit River. The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton, where it turns due north. Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center between King and Silbey Roads; north of here, Riverview extends along both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> At Pennsylvania Road, Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast near the Southgate Tower office building.

5|$|Meanwhile, two battalions {{of volunteers}} from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, led by Generals Oswald H. Ernst and James H. Wilson, settled on {{opposite}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Coamo. On August 9, 1898, the Americans began their offensive, opening cannon fire {{against the city}} and completing their attack with artillery fire, the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, damaging the resort. The Americans intended to encircle and defeat the defenses in the city. A group of soldiers entered the city from the backside, having advanced through a river nearby. The rear assault was reinforced by Wilson's army under General Ernst, attempting to trap the allied soldiers in a crossfire, employing a tactic known as the pincer movement. Martínez Illescas {{was surprised by the}} attack and led an improvised attack, but he was killed in the crossfire along with his second-in-command, leaving Captain Hita in charge; he ordered his men to surrender. Half of the allied troops ignored the order, and continued the attack, Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. Hita's men were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp located at Río Descalabrado, while the men who continued to attack retreated to Aibonito when they realized that the Americans were using a pincer movement.|$|E
25|$|The Reds {{were aware}} of the {{oncoming}} offensive. For example, the newspaper Työmies wrote a day before how the Whites had gathered their troops in the Länkipohja area. In the night before the battle, a large number of civilians fled the village. The Reds had built their main defensive line to the Hirsikangas Hill, two kilometres north of Länkipohja. They had brought down a large number of trees, then piled the cut logs on the both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and soaked them with water. In the below zero temperature, the stacks of wood were now covered by thick ice. The structure extended more than 50 meters on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> As the trees in the slopes were cut, the attacking Whites had to cross a wide open ground covered in deep snow.|$|E
