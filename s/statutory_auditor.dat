40|$|This article {{presents}} three factors affecting {{the development of}} auditing services market and its oligopoly. The binding provisions of law concerning discretionary powers of auditing companies proprietary rights, to some extent, petrify the current auditing market structure. By means of numerous capital access deterrents they {{make it impossible to}} compete with the most influential entities on the market. Bearing in mind the vital influence of <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> on companies functioning, and allowing the companies access to capital, it is advisable to abolish all binding restrictions and simultaneously strengthen the internal control mechanisms facilitating high quality of financial review and <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> independence. The auditing services market is, most of all, subject to price competition. The binding requisition of <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> (including auditing companies) salary disclosure intensifies mutual chain of audit pricing dependence and restricts competition. Properly utilized rotation principle, by strengthening the competence, might positively influence functioning of the auditing services market. It increases an opportunity of collaborating with new entities, while enforcing constant improvement of qualifications required to perform financial reviews.

40|$|<b>Statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> are of {{critical}} importance to the efficient operation {{of the economy and}} capital markets. They perform the public assurance role, by giving credibility to audited financial statements and by acting in the public interest. In Ireland, regulations affecting <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> have been evolving since 1963. However, recent years have characterised a significant escalation of the regulations affecting <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors.</b> On the one hand, legislators have imposed many new ‘whistle - blowing’ obligations on <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> in order to protect investors and {{in the name of the}} public interests. On the other hand, the APB, driven by a need of harmonisation and also investors’ protection has introduced the universal set of the ISAs. This study has shown that all of the new regulations were designed for audits of large, often multinational companies and they are not necessary appropriate for small audit practices. It also reveals that the volume, complexity and rigidity of these regulations put an unnecessary burden and pressure on small practitioners. This research further presents the views of small audit practitioners on the new regulations and also assesses the effectiveness of these provisions taking into account the special relationship between small practitioners and their clients. In addition, this thesis discusses the proposals concerning different concessions for small practitioners such as: de minimis provisions, an introduction of a separate set of standards and also exemptions from certain provisions. Furthermore, it evaluates and recommends how the small practitioners can cope with the high burden of regulations in the fast changing regulatory framework. Finally, this study anticipates the potential future of small audit firms in light of the current project of the European Commission considering an increase of the audit exemption threshold to € 10 millio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the consequences, in Denmark between 1984 and 2006, of {{the implementation}} of the European EU Eighth Directive on the qualification of <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors.</b> Although the Eighth Directive envisaged one group of <b>statutory</b> <b>auditors</b> in each Member State, there were two groups of auditors in Denmark, and {{the implementation of the}} Directive triggered a long conflict between the two groups about the education of the second-tier auditors. The analysis is {{based on the work of}} Abbott ((1988)) on professional jurisdictional disputes and shows how the local implementation of the Eighth Directive on auditor qualifications disturbed the balance of the 'system of professions' in Denmark and gave rise to an intra-professional conflict over the statutory audit jurisdiction. The jurisdictional dispute dragged on for two decades because of the complexity of the Danish regulatory system, where audit regulation takes place in overlapping committees between the profession, the state and the educational institutions. It was finally settled by educational differentiation of the two groups, and we discuss the implications of this settlement for the process of audit harmonisation in Europe. ...|$|R
