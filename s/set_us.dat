25|$|That year {{stands out}} in the American Civil Rights Movement as Omaha became the {{location}} of the pivotal 1876 trial of Standing Bear v. Crook. In that trial a U.S. district court judge at Fort Omaha <b>set</b> <b>U.S.</b> legal precedent by recognising the personhood of Native Americans, thereby granting American Indians the rights of citizens. With Standing Bear, a Ponca chief on trial, local journalist Thomas Tibbles, Omaha Susette LaFlesche and General Crook himself testified on behalf of acknowledging Native American rights. For the first time, a U.S. court had ruled that an Indian was, officially, a person. Standing Bear won the case, securing the right of his tribe to leave their Indian Territory reservation and return to their Nebraska homelands.|$|E

We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed {{from the face of the}} earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this wrong food is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He {{declared that}} he would heal us and <b>set</b> <b>us</b> in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.|$|E

500|$|To escape their {{reputation}} for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, [...] "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what <b>set</b> <b>us</b> up for Zoo TV. We decided {{to have some fun}} being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves." [...] The Edge said, [...] "We were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing U2 and starting all over again." [...] The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.|$|E
500|$|Sozin's Comet has {{received}} {{its share of}} criticism as well. Reviewers commented about the difficulty in understanding {{the voice of a}} new character: the Lion Turtle. The Lion Turtle was designed by Bryan Konietzko and character designer Jae Woo Kim. Konietzko disliked how the Lion Turtle turned out; he felt that the art was not up to standards of the original design he had received. CraveOnline felt that because [...] "the series was for children, the writers were at a loss of ideas to work around the murder angle," [...] and the decision not to kill the Fire Lord introduced [...] "so many convenient plot twists [...] <b>set</b> <b>us</b> up for a humongous deus ex machina that allows the Fire Lord to be thwarted without dying".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 1899 revival, The Athenaeum {{managed to}} praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's {{critique}} of Sullivan. On the one hand, [...] "The Pinafore... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character... it is delicately scored, {{and in many ways}} displays ability of a high order". On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his symphony, [...] "he would have produced still higher results; in like manner Pinafore <b>set</b> <b>us</b> wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts".|$|E

His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have <b>set</b> <b>us</b> to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that <b>set</b> <b>us</b> all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up {{to the point where we}} were standing erect".|$|E
500|$|According to Karim biographer Sushila Anand, the Queen's own letters {{testify that}} [...] "her {{discussions with the}} Munshi were wide-ranging—philosophical, {{political}} and practical. [...] Both head and heart were engaged. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien, and a confidant who would not feed her the official line." [...] Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts. Victoria praised him in her letters and journal. [...] "I am so very fond of him" [...] she wrote, [...] "He is so good & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me." [...] She admired [...] "her personal Indian clerk & Munshi, who is an excellent, clever, truly pous & very refined gentle man, who says, 'God ordered it'... God's Orders is what they implicitly obey! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness <b>set</b> <b>us</b> a gt. example." [...] At Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish estate, Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by John Brown, a favourite servant of the Queen's who had died in 1883. Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world, the Queen wrote that [...] "he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen's maids and laughs and even jokes now—and invited them to come and see all his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat".|$|E

2500|$|At the Hallé orchestral concert... I was inhumanly {{tormented by}} a quadrille band which the proprietors of St James's Hall (who {{really ought to}} be {{examined}} by two doctors) had stationed within earshot of the concert-hall. The heavy tum-tum of the basses throbbed obscurely against the rhythms of Spohr and Berlioz all the evening, like a toothache through a troubled dream; and occasionally, during a pianissimo, or in one of Lady Hallé's eloquent pauses, the cornet would burst into vulgar melody in a remote key, and <b>set</b> <b>us</b> all flinching, squirming, shuddering, and grimacing hideously.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Catholics {{distinguish}} between {{two types of}} sin. Mortal sins are a [...] "grave violation of God's law" [...] that [...] "turns man away from God".
