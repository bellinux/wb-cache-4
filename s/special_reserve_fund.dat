40|$|Managing an {{institutional}} portfolio – be it a defined benefit pension plan, a university endowment, or a <b>special</b> government <b>reserve</b> <b>fund</b> – requires a careful balancing act of regulating active contributions, paying {{current and future}} liabilities, and growing a fund’s principal over 20, 30, 40 or more years. While there are many decisions fund managers and board trustees must make to meet these objectives, {{perhaps the most important}} is a plan’s strategy for investing its portfolio across major asset classes – or the asset allocation policy. A landmark study – conducted in 1986 and updated in 1991 – found that asset allocation determines 92 percent of total pension plan returns. Active investment decisions by sponsors and managers – including short-term tactical asset allocation shifts and individual security selection – accounted for another five percent of overall returns, with sheer luck explaining the remaining three percent. 1 Yet, a great deal of confusion continues to surround the asset allocation decision among fund managers and trustees.
