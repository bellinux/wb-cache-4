40|$|During the {{qualification}} of Frit 202 {{samples for}} the `DWPF Cold Runs`, {{the need for}} a reliable chemical frit standard became apparent. A standard was prepared by obtaining a quantity of Frit 202 and grinding into a fine powder. This material was homogenized as one slurry material volume, spray dried to prevent segregation, and hydraulically pressed into discs. These discs were fired and packaged into eleven sub-lots containing approximately 2, 000 discs per <b>sub-lot.</b> A number of samples were obtained and analyzed by two analytic laboratories. The chemical analyses were carefully reviewed and evaluated by several statistical means. While there were several statistically significant variations between the sub-lots, it is believed that those variations are partially caused by the variability of the analytic method. These discs should provide a reliable standard for future chemical analyses of DWPF Frits similar in comparison to Frit 202. It is recommended that these discs be used as a standard material included with the representative frit sample to the independent chemical analysis laboratory, and the order of use of these standards be from <b>sub-lot</b> eleven to <b>sub-lot</b> four. It is further recommended that the NIST standard material (93 a) be employed along with the 202 standard until confidence in the new standard is gained. The NIST standard should also be used when initial use of a new <b>sub-lot</b> is begun. this procedure should continue {{to the end of the}} DWPF program or such time as the chemical composition of the frit is extensively modified...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to solve Equal Size Lot Streaming (ESLS) in Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is proposed. LS {{refers to a}} situation that a lot can be split {{into a number of}} smaller lots (or sub-lots) so that successive operation can be overlapped. By adopting the proposed approach, the <b>sub-lot</b> number for different lots and the processing sequence of all sub-lots can be determined simultaneously using GAs. Applying Just-In-Time (JIT) policy, the results show that the solution can minimize both the overall penalty cost and total setup time with the development of multi-objective function. In this connection, decision makers can then assign various weightings so as to enhance the reliability of the final solution. © 2004 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The experiment was arranged in a randomised block design into <b>sub-lots</b> with three replications, giving a total of 48 experimental units. Four levels of irrigation (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the available water) were randomly assigned to the lots; the type of seedling (grown in bags or tubes) were randomly assigned to the <b>sub-lots,</b> and the use or not of the water-retaining polymer randomly assigned to the sub-sub-lots. In the treatments with water-retaining polymer, a dilution of 1. 5 Kg of polymer to 400 litres of water was used at a dose of 1. 5 litres of solution per plant. The following were evaluated at intervals of 60 days during the experiment (360 days from planting) : stem diameter, plant height, leaf area, number of leaves and number of plagiotropic branches on the coffee plants.

Individual bag-samples were taken from each seed lot. Factors considered were percentage purity, annual ryegrass, perennial ryegrass, weed, other crop, inert matter, and germination. Number of rattail fescue (Festuca myuros) seeds and number of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) seeds in a purity sample were counted, and number of noxious weed seeds were also totaled. Uniformity in 30, 000 kilogram lots was measured by an H-test, heterogeneity value, state seed law labeling tolerance tables, and by a Chi-square test for homogeneity of a binomial distribution on each <b>sub-lot.</b> Subdivisionsof each seed lot were examined for uniformity by use of an analysis of variance test. The analysis used within sublot variance of lot size approximately 1, 500 kilograms as an acceptable level of variation and used an analysis of variance test to examine variance among sub-lots of approximate size 1, 500, 3, 000, 6, 000, and 12, 000 kilograms. The greatest potential for violation in labeling and nonuniformity in ryegrass seed lots was found in percentage perennial ryegrass and annual ryegrass factors calculated by formula from fluorescence. Changing seed lot size had no effect on lot uniformity. Reducing the lot size below the current 24, 947 kilogram limit did not significantly reduce the number of violations in labeling.

But, the method of synchronizing between one customer and two vendors while accumulating the inventory of each of buyer, with liberal-sized limited capacity transporters have not been studied. Here we develop a generalized single-vendor two-buyers supply chain model with one transporter available to deliver the identical products from the customer to the buyers. the delivery times and the costs are varied from one customer to the other. Two models are developed, in the first assumption, the transporter serves every buyer separately and in the second assumption, the transporter delivers to the two buyers consecutively. In both assumptions, jobs are first processed in the production stage, and then gathered in batches. The resource of products is a number of available machines that produce according to a simple customer command. Each job has a due date specified by the buyers. Moreover, it is supposed that a job that arrives at the customer before its due date will incur a customer inventory cost. The objective is to compare the two different proposed methods by finding the minimized total cost, while guaranteeing a certain customer service level. A mathematical formulation of the problem is given as a nonlinear model in a general way.

Conventional fissure {{detection}} instruments {{cannot be used}} to observe fissures in rough rice kernels, the form in which rice in normally dried and stored. X-rays can penetrate hulls allowing visualization of the internal structure of a rough rice kernel. This study evaluated the capability of X-ray imaging to adequately detect fissures in rough rice and established a correlation between HRY and the fissured kernel percentage (FKP) in a rough rice sample. Fifteen long-grain rice cultivars, harvested in Arkansas in 2015 and 2016 were dried using heated air at 60 ºC, 10 % relative humidity (RH) for various combinations of drying durations and post-drying treatments that resulted in varying degrees of fissuring and HRYs. Fissure detection was conducted using an X-ray system with rough rice and {{compared to that of}} a grainscope, a conventional fissure detection instrument, with brown rice. A strong correlation (R^ 2 = 0. 95) was shown to exist between sample HRY and the FKP of the rough rice sample after drying, resulting in a regression equation {{that could be used to}} estimate HRY. Having confirmed the impact of fissured kernels on HRY, the X-ray system, with an augmented drying apparatus, was used to evaluate the impact of kernel thickness and moisture content (MC) on rice fissuring. Two long-grain rice cultivars were harvested in Arkansas in 2016, each at two MC levels (high and low), and fractionated into three thickness fraction sub-lots (thin, medium, and thick). The fissuring susceptibility of kernels from each <b>sub-lot</b> was evaluated during drying. Generally, with increase in kernel thickness, the FKP increased for high-MC lots. In regards to MC, high-MC had greater FKPs than the low-MC lots. Overall, these findings show the importance of kernel fissuring to the rice industry, and highlights the role of kernel properties on fissuring during drying...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Ülkemizde kömür ithalatı, 1970 ’li yıllarda özellikle sanayinin ihtiyacı nedeniyle başlamıştır. İlk defa ev yakıtı olarak kömür ithalatı ise 1980 yılı başlarında Zonguldak’tan yeterli kömürün gelememesi nedeniyle yapılmıştır. Mozambik’ten İstanbul’a getirilen kömür, şehrin bir miktar ihtiyacını karşılamıştır. Kömürlerin gittikçe artan sanayi ve ev yakıtı olarak kullanım ihtiyacı nedeniyle de 1990 yıllarında ithalatının artmaya başladığı görülmektedir. Özellikle Sovyet Bloku, diğer deyişle eski Demir Perde ülkelerinden yüksek kalorili ve düşük kükürtlü parça kömürler ithal edilerek ülkemizdeki hava kirliğinin önlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Kömür ticaretinin hızla gelişmesine karşın, kalite belirlemesinde önemli rol oynayan “standartlara göre numune alma” konusunun taşıdığı önemin anlaşılması epeyce zaman almıştır. SGS’ deki çalışmalar ve diğer gözetme firmalarının da daha sonra katılımı ve desteği ile önce standartlar elde edilmiş ve ardından yurt dışında çalışma ve teknik eğitimlerle bu konu öğrenilmiş ve bilahare geliştirilmiştir. Yine bu çalışmada numunenin nasıl alınması gerektiği ve hazırlanması hususlarındaki standartların uygulanması ile ilgili ayrıntılı bilgiler sunulmuştur. Kömürlerin yurdumuza ithalinde karşılaşılabilecek kalite, ebat ve miktar problemlerinde nasıl hareket edilmesi gerektiği anlatılmıştır. Ayrıca ithalatta problemlerle karşılaşıldığında, gözetme firmalarının talimatlandırılarak bu tespitlerin sağlıklı ve isabetli bir şekilde yapılması hakkında bilgiler verilmiştir. Bu nedenle kömürden numune alma ve hazırlamanın yöntemleri ile ilgili bilgiler örneklerle beraber verilmiştir. Böylelikle kömür ticareti yapan/yapacak firmaların ithalat kontrollerinde bağımsız denetimcilerin çalışmalarını makul bir şekilde takip etmeleri de sağlanmak istenmiştir. Bu şekilde kömür ticaretiyle uğraşan firmaların standartlara uygun numune alım ve hazırlama ile doğru kalite teşhis ve tespitini kolaylıkla yapmaları amaçlanmıştır. Son yıllarda ithal edilen kömürlerin tek ocak ürünü olmaması ve ihracatçıların gerek sanayi gerekse ev yakıtı parça kömürlerde karışık ocak kömürlerini gemilere yüklemesi nedeniyle kömürden numune alımı ve hazırlanması konusu gayet önem kazanmıştır. Mağdur duruma düşen ithalatçıların bilimsel tespitlerle kömürdeki kalite problemlerini ortaya çıkarması için bağımsız uluslararası gözetim firmalarından ne şekilde yararlanacağı hakkında bilgiler de çalışma içerisinde yer almaktadır. Bununla beraber kömürlerin Türkiye’ye ithalinde Çevre ve Şehircilik Bakanlığı’nın en son uygulanmakta olan genelgesine göre yapılacak işlemler ve ithal edilecek kömürlerde aranacak özelliklerden bahsedilmiştir. Sonuç olarak; kömür ticaretinde, kömürün yükleme ve tahliye limanlarında ne gibi hususlara dikkat edilmesi gerektiği, oluşabilecek problemlerin ne şekilde çözümleneceği yönünde yol gösterici bir çalışma hazırlanması amaçlanmıştır. Coal import in Turkey {{began in}} the 1970 s {{especially}} due to the requirement of the industry. Coal was first imported as residential fuel in the early 1980 s due to failure of Zonguldak to provide sufficient coal. Coal imported from Mozambique to Istanbul partially met the need of the city. It is seen that the coal importation increased in the 1990 s to meet increasing demand for use of coal as industrial and residential fuel. Aimed at preventing air pollution, especially, high-calorie and low sulphurous coal was imported from the Soviet Block, {{also known as the}} Iron Curtain, countries. In spite of the rapid growth in coal trade, it took time to understand the importance of ‘sampling in accordance with the standards’, which plays a crucial role in quality control. First, the standards are obtained, and then this subject is learned by studies and trainings abroad with my personal efforts and then participation of other supervision firms. Besides the quality determination of the coal, it has been aimed to give short information about the physical and chemical parameters of the coal. Also important role of the inspection companies mentioned for coal trade. It is important to inform coal traders in order to be sure about the quality of coal. Also information has been provided for coal production and coal trade in World and Turkey. Sampling at the mine site, at stock and during discharge from the vessel or from the wagon/truck is explained in detail. Coal which imported for home heating has named regarding their size therefore such given names (i. e nut coal, orange coal etc.) and explained to coal trader that today coal purchase is effected with those names. In addition to those information some terms which are used for coal has been given. Also in this study, brief information is provided on coal formation and its types, and coal sampling locations and sampling methods are explained. This study also offers detailed information on complete definition of sample and standard practices of sampling and preparation. Coal imported for industry has even more importance and therefore sampling and sample preaparation is critical for quality determination. Industrial coal transactions have huge quantities and is loaded generally by mixing different quality of coal. Therefore sampling must occure for each <b>sub-lot</b> and sample preparation must be effected for each lot separately in order to define exact quality of product. Therefore lot system sampling is explained according to the international standard in this study. Coal for home heating generally imported in larger sizes has also another importance due to Turkish market consumption. Mostly home heating coal has big size unable to be be sampled with the recommended standard scoop. Due to their size, special iron frame is used for sampling of big size coal and sampling with this frame is also explained in the study. The international sampling standard was prepared for size below 75 mm. However home heating coal contains coal generally 300 mm in size which can not be sampled with standard scoop. This study also mentions that the nominated coal sampler must be experienced in order to visually determine the percentage of coal which is lower than 75 mm and bigger than 75 mm in size, during sampling operation. This will help the sampler to mix those fraction of coal sampled by frame, according to their fraction. Furthermore, information is provided on the courses of actions to be conducted for the problems related to quality, size, and amount, which may be encountered during coal importation, and on how to instruct supervision firms for sound and accurate controls when encountered with such issues. For this purpose, correct sampling methods are specified with conducted examples. Thus, it is aimed to inform the coal trading companies to follow works of independent inspectors during import controls in an informed manner. Most of all, it is aimed to have the coal trading companies to sample and prepare samples in accordance with the standards and to make accurate quality controls. Recently coal sampling and preparing samples have become more important owing to the fact that imported coal is not from a single colliery and that exporters ship mixed coals from different collieries either for industrial fuel or residential lump coal. Also in this study detailed information is provided on sample preparation including place, apparatus and some physical test regarding screening for size determination, HGI,and moisture test. This study also includes information on how coal importers suffer from such issues may benefit from independent international supervision firms in order to detect quality issues for coal with correct evaluations. Also, procedures and required specification for coal to be imported are mentioned pursuant to the recent applicable memorandum of the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning. In this study information is provided to the coal purchasers on actions to take when low quality coal is received. The calorific value is most important factor generally considered for coal imported for industrial use. Fines and foreign matters such as shist and stones, in imported coal for home heating are not accepted. Therefore the study explains the role of inspection companies for claiming such items to supplier. In addition to the quality, safety transportation and stocking of the coal and associated burning risk are explained in details. Some information has given about the oxidation and self combustion of coal. The factors which are the reason of self combustion are mentioned in details in order to take necessary precautions. Also it has been mentioned how it can be detected in early stages. As a case study, one burning of the coal case in the vessel holds during transportation is examined. Also standards which declared in the IMO regulation for the vessel which is carried coal are mentioned in details. On the other hand it has been mentioned how coal must be stocked in order to prevent burning. It also emphaises the stock height for each size of the coal types mentioned. In the light of above explanation it is remarked again that inspection company and inspectors must have experiment for sampling and sample preparation of coal for determination of quality in coal trading. In conclusion, it is aimed to be a guiding study for issues to be taken into consideration in the port of loading and port of discharge, and for solution of problems, which may arise during coal trade.

Using transfer lots, we can overlap {{the processing of}} a batch on several consecutive machines, and thus reduce the makespan considerably. This in turn promotes work-in-process reduction. In this paper we investigate the transfer lots sizing problem for a given batch size under two operating procedures. Our objective is to minimize the makespan subject to a transferring budget. An {{important part of the}} solution involves partitioning the problem to subsets of machines without losing optimality.

The first operating procedure we consider calls for the lots to be identical across all machines in each subset. The second operating procedure allows <b>sub-lots</b> for some of the machines or for some of the lots. Through more elaborate, the second operating procedure yields demonstrably superior results.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of the Caipira and Pakovan Ken cultivars of the banana (Musa spp.), resistant to black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet), both with and without low-density polyethylene wrapping and together with refrigeration {{during the period of}} post-harvest storage. The experiment was carried out in 2012, in a randomised block design and an arrangement of lots split over time. A 3 x 2 factorial scheme was used for the lots, consisting of fruit with no wrapping and fruit wrapped in 10 and 16 µm polyethylene film, and two cultivars, Caipira and Pakovan Ken. The <b>sub-lots</b> consisted of evaluations made at intervals of six days (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24) and of two days (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8), for fruit stored at temperatures of 12, 15 and 25 ºC respectively. The following variables were evaluated: soluble solids, titratable acidity, ratio of soluble solids to titratable acidity, hydrogen potential, total soluble sugars, fruit colouration and sensory analysis. The polyethylene film together with the refrigeration enabled the fruit to be stored for 24 days, maintaining post-harvest characteristics suitable for consumption. The Pakovan Ken cultivar stood out when compared to the Caipira, with higher values for the fruit attributes under evaluation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The cowpea {{is one of}} {{the main}} crops of {{economic}} and social importance in the northeast of Brazil. However, the growing need to increase crop yield has prompted the use of irrigation water with high levels of salts. The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation depths and rates of liquid biofertilizer on growth and gas exchange in cowpea plants under saline conditions. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, using a scheme of split lots consisting of four irrigation depths with saline water (75, 100, 125 and 150 % of crop evapotranspiration - ETc) and <b>sub-lots</b> of four different doses of biofertilizer (0; 5, 000; 10, 000 and 15, 000 L ha- 1). At 75 days after sowing (DAS), readings were taken of gas exchange in the plants (photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, internal CO 2 concentration and transpiration), and growth analyses were carried out (plant height, leaf area and total dry matter). An increase in irrigation depth gives an increase in total dry weight and leaf area. Increasing irrigation depth causes a significant increase in gas exchange, with quadratic behavior noted for photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and linear behavior for internal CO 2 concentration and transpiration. The application of high doses of biofertilizer gives increased stomatal opening of the cowpea leaves...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The cowpea is {{of great}} {{socioeconomic}} importance in the North, Northeast and Mid-West of Brazil, and its irrigated farming has recently been on the increase in these regions. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the agronomic performance of the cowpea 'BRS Tumucumaque' for different row spacings and irrigation depths, under the conditions of soil and climate of Teresina, in the State of Piauí. The experiment was carried out from August to November 2014, in a Yellow Argisol at the Experimental Area of Embrapa Meio-Norte in Teresina. The experimental design was of randomised blocks in subdivided lots, with four replications. The treatments consisted of five irrigation depths (40 % ETo, 70 % ETo, 100 % ETo, 130 % ETo and 160 % ETo) in the main plot, and four spacings between rows (0. 36 m, 0. 45 m, 0. 60 m and 0. 90 m) in the <b>sub-lots.</b> Leaf area index, pod length, number of grains per pod, number of pods per plant and grain productivity were evaluated. There was significant interaction (. < 0. 01) between irrigation depth and row spacing for grain productivity only. There was a significant increasing linear effect (. < 0. 01) from irrigation depth on pod length, number of pods per plant and number of grains per pod. The larger irrigation depths at the smaller row spacings give the greatest grain productivity. With leaf area index, there was a significant effect from irrigation depth and row spacing for the periods under evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of three milling techniques (MT 1 : industrial roller-grinder, MT 2 : grain hammer crasher, and MT 3 : traditional millstone) and two baking methods (BM 1 : industrial oven, BM 2 : traditional ceramic stove heated by wood (log fire oven)) on mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) levels in bread were investigated. The DON and NIV concentrations in wheat grain, flour, and bread were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with UV-detection methods. The 2 500 kg lot of wheat grain containing 1 400 – 1 900 μg kg− 1 deoxynivalenol and 130 – 200 μg kg− 1 nivalenol {{was divided into}} <b>sub-lots</b> which were processed to get three types of flour (F 1 : industrial bread flour, F 2 : industrial wholegrain flour and F 3 : traditional wholegrain flour). The concentrations of DON and NIV measured after milling the grain according to MT 1 (yielding F 1) amounted to 310 – 370 kg− 1 and < 50 – 70 μg kgt 1, respectively. After applying MT 2 to the grain (yielding F 2), the DON and NIV levels were measured to be 1 060 – 1 400 μg kg− 1 and 60 – 87 μg kg− 1, respectively. Applying MT 3 (yielding F 3) produced a DON level of 1 100 – 1 770 μg kg− 1 and a NIV level of 80 – 95 μg kg− 1. Six types of bread were baked from {{the three types of}} flour according to BM 1 or BM 2, and the mycotoxin levels were analysed. The average reduction in DON concentration after baking (70 min at 195 – 235 °C) was 47. 2...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 California brome {{and blue}} wildrye are {{important}} native grass {{species in the}} Pacific Northwest. However, both species {{have been reported to}} have low emergence under less than favorable field conditions. Seed coating is used to improve emergence and stand establishment of various crops. Three studies were carried out {{to determine the effects of}} biochar-based seed coatings on seed and seedling performance of two lots each of California brome and blue wildrye. Seeds of each lot were divided into seven <b>sub-lots</b> and were coated with coating treatments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, plus one un-coated control. The first study was conducted in the growth chamber to evaluate viability and vigor of the seeds coated with the above treatments. Standard germination (SG), tetrazolium (TZ), accelerated aging (AAT), and cold soil (CST) tests were used for evaluating seed quality of uncoated seeds. The CST was used to evaluate seed performance of coated seeds in both species. The second study was conducted in the greenhouse to compare the effect of seed treatments on seed and seedling performance under two irrigation regimes: water stress, plants watered every 10 -days, and normal watering, every 3 -days. The third study was conducted in the field to evaluate seed treatments under field conditions. When coated with combinations of biochar, lime, hydrophilic polymers and macronutrients, seed from both lots of both species showed equal or slightly higher germination over the untreated control. No consistent pattern was observed for increasing or decreasing final germination, speed of germination, length of seedlings or dry matter contents of any of the treatments over the untreated controls in both crops under 3 - or 10 -day watering regime. Although under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, seed coated with either lime or a combination of lime, biochar, hydrophilic polymers, and macronutrients improved seed performance over untreated control in some cases, under field conditions no improvement was observed for any of the seed coating treatments over the untreated controls. Changes in seed and seedling performance in this study were species specific, and depended mainly on the initial seed quality, and to a less extent on the irrigation regimes used and the seed coating formulation.
