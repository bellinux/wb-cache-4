5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Michael {{continually}} tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and jump off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E

5000|$|In social psychology, a <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> is a parent, uncle/aunt, grandparent, {{guardian}} {{or teacher}} — {{the person who}} guides and takes care of a child during primary socialization. The <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> protects, rewards, and punishes the child {{as a way of}} aiding the child's development. This usually takes about six or seven years, after which the <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> is no longer needed, and the child moves on to a general [...] "other" [...] which is not a real person, but an abstract notion of what society deems good or bad.|$|R
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E
25|$|Two {{groups of}} {{individuals}} were investigated, those concerned with personal power, achievement, and independence (agentic group) or those concerned with relationships, interdependence, and others (communion group). Agentic types consistently recalled emotional memories {{of events that}} involved issues of agency such as those involving mastery, dominance, and humiliation. In contrast, communal types showed a recollection bias for emotional memories featuring others, often <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> in acts of love and friendship.|$|E

25|$|Conclusively, {{affective and}} {{cognitive}} emotions and responses both {{play a key}} role in the first stage of infidelity. Whether it is jealousy, feeling of incompetence that leads to resentment, or anger they all can take on both forms of emotions and help to drive the emotional reactions towards infidelity. The affective states of partners determine how they react to secrets or feelings they have not learned to expect from one another which later transforms into cognitive responses as the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> begin to anticipate the actions and feelings of themselves and their partners.|$|E
25|$|These {{researchers}} presented cue-words in {{the form}} of common locations (restaurants, markets, parks), objects (chair, table, television), positive emotions (happy, joy, cheerful), negative emotions (frustration, pain, sad), and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (father, mother, friend). Participants were asked to retrieve a memory that reminded them of the cue- word, recall memories from across their lifespan, and recall memories that were at least a year old. Then participants were asked to date the memory to the nearest month and year. The results were graphed on a lifespan retrieval curve, and the reminiscence bump was observed.|$|E
25|$|Homophobia in the Black British {{community}} is {{prevalent in the}} United Kingdom. Many gay people {{in the black community}} get married or have <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of the opposite sex to hide their sexual orientation. In 1998, Justin Fashanu, a gay black footballer, killed himself after publicly coming out to his brother. There has been hate music written in the black community towards LGBT people; campaigns such as Stop Murder Music have tried to counteract this. Some have regarded this, alongside other anti-homophobia efforts aimed at the Black British community, as racist, which makes many social critics reluctant to criticize homophobia in the Black British community.|$|E

25|$|Non-possessiveness: Many polyamorists view {{excessive}} {{restrictions on}} other deep relationships {{as less than}} desirable, as such restrictions {{can be used to}} replace trust with a framework of ownership and control. It is usually preferred or encouraged that a polyamorist strive to view their partners' other <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (often referred to as OSOs) in terms of the gain to their partners' lives rather than a threat to their own (see compersion). Therefore, jealousy and possessiveness are generally viewed not so much as something to avoid or structure the relationships around, but as responses that should be explored, understood, and resolved within each individual, with compersion as a goal.|$|E
25|$|It is {{acceptable}} to transfer food to closely related people (e.g. grandparents, parents, spouse, children, or <b>significant</b> <b>others)</b> if they are having difficulty picking up the food. Also {{it is a sign}} of respect to pass food to the elderly first before the dinner starts. Often, family members will transfer a choice piece of food from a dish to a relative's bowl as a sign of caring. A variation of this is to transfer the food whilst using one's own bowl as a support, underneath the food and chopsticks to keep food from falling or dripping, then transferring from there to a relative's bowl.|$|E
25|$|The Liars team up {{with their}} <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> to prove Alison killed Mona. Through the clues Mona left for them, {{they were able to}} prove that not only she was {{responsible}} for Mona's murder, but for Bethany's murder as well, clearing Spencer of the charges in the process. However, the girls realize someone is still helping Alison, who they now believe was trying to drag them down with her in jail. Their initial suspect was Detective Holbrook, but Holbrook reveals to Hanna that Alison cut him off. They later discover that Mike, Aria's brother, has been secretly visiting Alison in jail, leading the girls to suspect that he was helping Ali. Subsequently, they learn that Mona was working with 'A' to have Alison arrested by faking her death, although the actual possibility that Mona may be dead remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|According to the Deloitte 2007 Holiday Survey, for {{the fourth}} {{straight}} year, gift cards {{are expected to be}} the top gift purchase in 2007, with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of consumers surveyed planning to buy them, compared with 66 percent in 2006. In addition, holiday shoppers are planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give gift cards because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they are hesitant to buy them for spouses or <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus was {{inspired}} by the loneliness he experienced while on tour; while his bandmates had <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> to return home to, he was single. He was also influenced by a teen suicide letter he read in a magazine. The song {{takes the form of a}} suicide note, and contains lyrical allusions to the grunge band Nirvana. [...] "Adam's Song" [...] was one of the last songs to be written and recorded for Enema of the State, and it was nearly left off the album. Though Hoppus worried the subject matter was too depressing, his bandmates were receptive to its message. The song was produced by Jerry Finn.|$|E
