5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was not <b>something</b> <b>she</b> had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Turner was {{introduced}} to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1973 by a friend of Ike's named Valerie Bishop. Turner wrote in her autobiography I, Tina that after Valerie taught her to recite the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, Tina observed that Ike, instead of hitting her for singing supposed wrong notes during recording sessions, would give her money to go shopping, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> regarded as a benefit of her newfound spiritual practice.|$|E
5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was <b>something</b> <b>she</b> had not done before. Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses <b>something,</b> <b>she</b> goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do <b>something</b> <b>she</b> thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to harm the children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> never did during her childhood.|$|E
50|$|Back in Azalea Springs, Spencer's lover Bruce dies of AIDS-related complications. At his funeral, Alex's father comforts {{her and her}} mother, {{while still}} upset over Alex's lesbianism, shows that she still loves her {{daughter}} (by insulting her shoes, <b>something</b> <b>she's</b> done repeatedly through the film).|$|R
50|$|The girls {{receive their}} makeovers at a Newmarket Salon. Christobelle {{complains}} that her platinum blonde weave looks grey, Lucy cries over her hair being dyed brown, <b>something</b> <b>she's</b> not used to, and Ajoh and Laura {{have a hard}} time getting used to their new short pixie cuts.|$|R
5000|$|As Carrie {{is in the}} lobby, {{trying to}} obtain a room for the night, Big walks in. They see each other and he tells her she's [...] "the one" [...] (<b>something</b> <b>she's</b> been waiting for their entire relationship) and he takes her home to New York.|$|R
5|$|For {{her next}} project, Moore {{actively}} looked for another comedy. She had {{a supporting role}} in Crazy, Stupid, Love, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film Game Change, a dramatization of Sarah Palin's 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was <b>something</b> <b>she</b> found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although {{the response to the}} film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore's performance. For {{the first time in her}} career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E
5000|$|Artist and {{art dealer}} Nicolas Wilder {{is quoted as}} saying about Leavin and her gallery [...] "She works very hard and it's run as a business. It's not a thing that's there for some {{lifestyle}} change or for a tax write-off or <b>something.</b> <b>She's</b> a very good dealer." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> felt {{she was unable to}} do well when the manga's {{serialization}} began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{and again}} in 1986, Dickinson {{appeared}} in two of Perry Como's Christmas specials for the ABC television network, in both of which she did <b>something</b> <b>she</b> was not known to have done before: singing. Dickinson later denied having sung on camera since then {{in an interview with}} Larry King conducted at the approximate time of her appearance in Duets.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the dwindling}} numbers on Rachel Lang's series Mercy Peak, she decided {{one way to}} attract an {{audience}} was to feature abrasive and in-your-face characters, <b>something</b> <b>she</b> promised herself would feature in her next show. When Lang heard a radio report on the low median number of women's income, she pondered why they did not turn to crime and realised {{the potential for a}} television show.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{as she sat}} {{in church}} her face had a pathos and poignancy. Was this what {{she had come to}} hear: how by doing this thing and by not doing that, she could save her soul?

25|$|The Taming of the Screw (1997); {{written and}} {{directed}} by Jim Powers, starring Mila Shegol and Tony Martino; a pornographic adaptation in which a young lawyer is told he will be made partner in the law firm for which he works if he marries the boss' tempestuous daughter.
