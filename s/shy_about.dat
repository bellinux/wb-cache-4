However, this bird is not <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> performing in public, and partly because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E

5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
25|$|Citing {{contractual}} obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the American release, blocking out graphic sexuality by inserting additional figures {{to obscure the}} view, avoiding an adults-only NC-17 rating that limited distribution, as some large American theaters and video store operators disallow films with that rating. This alteration antagonized film critics and cinephiles, as they argued that Kubrick had never been <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> ratings (A Clockwork Orange was originally given an X-rating). The unrated version of Eyes Wide Shut was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E

They are all very curious about him and not <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E

Cavaliers are not <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses {{with more than one}} breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.|$|E

Although the deed of cession recognized his authority and gave him the title of Acting Governor, as far as the United States government was concerned, he was officially responsible only for the naval station. As the first naval governor, Tilley laid the groundwork for much of the future governance of the territory, which did not yet even have a formal name. The American Samoa government includes Tilley and the other pre-1905 station commandants in its list of territorial governors.|$|E

But when, throwing one arm round her waist, he sought to kiss her lips, not like a lover indeed, not because he wanted to do so, but as a desperate man who puts his fortunes to the touch, she drew away from him, with a knot in her forehead, backed and <b>shied</b> <b>about</b> fiercely with her head, and pushed him from her with her hand.

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was skeptical of the lyrical content presented in the song, commenting, [...] "unlike teen-pop stars a whole {{two or three years}} older than he is, Mr. Bieber isn’t <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> planting the seeds of corruption". Marc Hirsh of the Boston Globe said that the song combines the Disney route of songs comparing love to a fairytale, and unintentional comedy in the lines [...] "'Ain’t no chaperones[...] [...] Girl, I promise I’ll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly’ in a song literally about prom." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{garnered}} positive critiques from critics and music publications. Julie Aspinall complimented Minogue's sexual appeal in the clip, {{and believed that}} the song itself was overshadowed by its visual presentation. William Baker also commended Minogue's fashion styling and loose portrayal of Fonda's Barbarella character. Sean Smith further analysed the visual more and found that Minogue, both {{at the time of}} the video's release and retrospectively, [...] "was never <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> removing her clothes for the sake of her art [...] She suffered for her art." [...] Jude Rogers from The Guardian labelled the clip [...] "cheeky", whilst Erika Brooks Adickman from Idolator listed it as one of Minogue's most iconic and sexy music videos. At the 1995 ARIA Music Awards, Minogue won the award for Best Video. In retrospect, Minogue has cited the clip amongst one of her favourites.|$|E

Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> it and certainly without courage regarding it.

6000|$|Probably Chatteris {{remained}} in this attitude {{for a considerable}} time--half an hour, perhaps, or more. Slowly, it would seem, his mood underwent a change. At some definite moment {{it must have been}} that his lethargic meditation gave way to a strange activity, to a sort of hysterical reaction against all his resolves and renunciations. His first action seems to me grotesque--and grotesquely pathetic. He went into his dressing-room, and in the morning [...] "his clo'es," [...] said the valet, [...] "was <b>shied</b> <b>about</b> as though 'e'd lost a ticket." [...] This poor worshipper of beauty and the dream shaved! He shaved and washed and he brushed his hair, and, his valet testifies, one of the brushes got [...] "shied" [...] behind the bed. Even this throwing about of brushes seems to me to have done little or nothing to palliate his poor human preoccupation with the toilette. He changed his gray flannels--which suited him very well--for his white ones, which suited him extremely. He must deliberately and conscientiously have made himself quite [...] "lovely," [...] as a schoolgirl would have put it.|$|R

While a lifelong opponent of slavery and, for time, a proponent of socialism, Greeley's attitudes were never exactly fixed: [...] "The result was a potpourri of philosophical inconsistencies and contradictions that undermined Greeley's effectiveness as both logician and polemicist." [...] However, his moralism appealed to rural America; with six months of beginning the Tribune, Greeley combined The New-Yorker and The Log Cabin into a new publication, the Weekly Tribune. The weekly version circulated nationwide, serving as a digest of news melded with agriculture tips. Offering prizes like strawberry plants and gold pens to salesmen, the Weekly Tribune reached a circulation of 50,000 within 10 years, outpacing the Heralds weekly edition.|$|R

Hands All Over continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single [...] "Moves like Jagger", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. [...] "It {{was one of those}} songs that was definitely a risk," [...] Levine said. [...] "It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that.

Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church.

500|$|Emily Berman, {{counsel at}} the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law commented that [...] "' {{potential}} consequences are as predictable as night following day: Police will interrogate criminal suspects {{who do not}} explicitly invoke their rights—often, those will be suspects who are unsophisticated, poorly educated or mentally ill—for hours on end. This will lead, just as inevitably, to more coerced—and therefore unreliable—confessions... the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate." [...] She noted the attorney general's comment that Miranda warnings had not deterred terrorism suspects such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad from talking and providing [...] "valuable intelligence". The positive observation was a reflection upon attempts by Congress to amend Miranda legislatively, that the decision [...] "sends a strong signal" [...] that [...] "the Supreme Court is not <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress". She concluded that [...] "hile it might look with hostility on congressional attempts {{to rein in the}} scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants.

500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began {{to reflect the}} changes {{prompted}} by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. [...] Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called [...] "the New Wave," [...] a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in [...] "inner space" [...] instead of outer space. They were less <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential New Worlds), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch and Samuel R. Delany.|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not <b>shy</b> <b>about</b> what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E
