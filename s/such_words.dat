5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of <b>such</b> <b>words</b> toward Ann.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of <b>such</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E

60|$|It {{is still}} more curious that when I look for more {{definite}} instruction on such points to the higher ranks of botanists, I find in the index to Dr. Lindley's 'Introduction to Botany'--seven hundred pages of close print--not {{one of the four}} words 'Volatile,' 'Essence,' 'Scent,' or 'Perfume.' I examine the index to Gray's 'Structural and Systematic Botany,' with precisely the same success. I next consult Professors Balfour and Grindon, and am met by the same dignified silence. Finally, I think over the possible chances in French, and try in Figuier's indices to the 'Histoire des Plantes' for 'Odeur'--no <b>such</b> <b>word!</b> 'Parfum'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> 'Essence'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> 'Encens'--no <b>such</b> <b>word.</b> I try at last 'Pois de Senteur,' at a venture, and am referred to a page which describes their going to sleep.|$|R

25|$|During the 13th century, when German {{settlers}} {{were invited}} to Ukraine by the princes of Galicia-Vollhynia, German words {{began to appear in}} the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under Poland not only through German colonists but also through the Yiddish-speaking Jews. Often <b>such</b> <b>words</b> involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include dakh (roof), rura (pipe), rynok (market), kushnir (furrier), and majster (master or craftsman).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{expressed}} in terms of base- 2 expanions, balanced words are majorized by other words of the same slope.

25|$|In {{rendering}} {{this book}} – originally composed in a tongue {{that has not}} achieved existence – into English, I might easily have saved myself {{a great deal of}} labor by having recourse to invented terms; in no case have I done so. Thus in many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents. <b>Such</b> <b>words</b> as peltast, androgyn, and exultant are substitutions of this kind, and are intended to be suggestive rather than definitive.|$|E
25|$|Haiku are a short, 3-line verse form, {{which have}} {{achieved}} significant global popularity, and the haiku form has been adapted from Japanese into other languages. Typical of the haiku form is the metrical pattern of 3 lines with a distribution of 5, 7, and 5 on (also known as morae) within those lines. Other features include {{the juxtaposition of}} two images or ideas with a kireji ("cutting word") between them, and a kigo, or seasonal reference, usually drawn from a saijiki, or traditional list of <b>such</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most nouns have {{singular}} and plural numbers. There {{are some}} words that have only singular (e.g., pienas – milk, auksas – gold, gripas – flu, laimė – happiness) or only plural (e.g., lubos – ceiling, miltai – flour, kelnės – trousers) forms. Most <b>such</b> <b>words</b> are abstract (i.e., represent concepts like luck or love and not tangible {{things such as}} table or house), describe material or name a disease. However, in some instances, for example poetic language, {{it is possible to}} use singular nouns in plural form.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} Nirukta deals with ascertaining {{the meaning of}} words, {{particularly}} of archaic words no longer in use, ones created long ago and even then rarely used. The Vedic literature from the 2nd millennium BCE has a very large collection of <b>such</b> <b>words,</b> with nearly 25% of the words therein being used just once. By the 1st millennium BCE, interpreting and understanding what the Vedas meant had become a challenge, and Nirukta attempted to systematically propose theories on how words form, and then determine their meaning {{in order to understand}} the Vedas.|$|E
25|$|In this respect, Kalaw Lagaw Ya {{appears to}} be a classic case of shift, whereby {{speakers}} of one language, {{over a long period of}} time, retained multilingualism while taking over aspects of the target language. The Austronesian and Papuan overlay changed the originally Australian phonology and syntax profoundly. The contrast of Australian laminal nh/ny and lh/ly and apical n and l has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and s, z, t, d, o and òò have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, such that these 'foreign' sounds occur in <b>such</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} other purposes, it is {{insufficient}}, as an outcome of the Zipfian nature of word frequencies. Because {{the bulk of the}} lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about <b>such</b> <b>words.</b> Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.|$|E

She {{received}} a pace-pressing trip under jockey Jose Lezcano while following longshot Khancord Kid through opening splits of :23.7 and :47.5. Tidal Pool, the third-place finisher in the grade one Kentucky Oaks, was also tracking the leader. Meanwhile, Khancord Kid, Tidal Pool, and Acting Happy were heads apart coming off the final turn. After Acting Happy wore down a stubborn Tidal Pool approaching the sixteenth-pole, she had enough to hold off a late charge from No <b>Such</b> <b>Word,</b> hitting the wire 1-1/2 lengths in front. The final time was 1:50 flat over a fast track. No <b>Such</b> <b>Word</b> and jockey Terry Thompson were 2-1/4 lengths clear of third-place Tidal Pool.|$|R
25|$|English {{is one of}} the few European {{languages}} {{that does}} not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French and, increasingly, Spanish; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from <b>such</b> <b>words.</b> Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include café, résumé or resumé (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb resume), soufflé, and naïveté (see English terms with diacritical marks). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as élite, mêlée and rôle.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{denounced the}} {{reporting}} on these newsletters as “old news {{that has been}} rehashed {{for over a decade}} … once again being resurrected for obvious political reasons.” In a statement put out by his campaign, Paul said further that “the quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do not represent what I believe or have ever believed. I have never uttered <b>such</b> <b>words</b> and denounce such small-minded thoughts.” He blamed the articles on several ghostwriters who had contributed to the newsletters, which {{he said he did not}} edit, while he was busy practicing medicine full-time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-established}} words, such as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do {{not require}} a hyphen because they are fully fused {{to the point that}} their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all <b>such</b> <b>words</b> were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.|$|E

25|$|During {{more than}} 600 {{years of the}} Ottoman Empire, the {{literary}} and administrative language of the empire was Turkish, with many Persian, and Arabic loanwords, called Ottoman Turkish, considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many <b>such</b> <b>words</b> were exported to other languages of the empire, such as Albanian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Greek, Hungarian and Ladino. After the empire fell after World War I and the Republic of Turkey was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive language reform led by the newly founded Turkish Language Association, during which many adopted words were replaced with new formations derived from Turkic roots. That {{was part of the}} ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of Atatürk's Reforms, which also included the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} various {{differences}} between the spoken Chinese varieties, such as Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien, such as variations in vocabulary and grammatical particles, meaning that Vernacular Chinese is less suited for writing texts spoken in Hokkien. Various expressions in Hokkien, as with other Chinese varieties, do not have associated Chinese characters in Vernacular Chinese, meaning that some words originally could not be written. In the case of Cantonese, a vernacular system specifically for writing Cantonese was developed in Hong Kong, then a British colony. On the other hand, since Hokkien was never standardized, different people began to use various separate methods to solve the issue of Hokkien-specific words, where <b>such</b> <b>words</b> would eventually be written using either a Latin-based script, phonetically using bopomofo, or {{through the use of}} a Chinese character chosen phonetically with no relation to the original word via meaning.|$|E
