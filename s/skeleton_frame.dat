500|$|In comparison, New York trailed behind Chicago, {{having only}} four {{buildings}} over 16 stories tall by 1893. Part of the delay {{was caused by}} the slowness of the city authorities to authorize metal-frame construction techniques; it was not until 1889 that they relented and allowed Bradford Gilbert to construct the Tower Building, an 11-story iron-framed skyscraper. This encouraged the building of more skyscrapers in New York, although the city remained cautious about the technology for some years. Finally, in 1895 a breakthrough was made with the construction of the American Surety Building, a twenty-story, [...] high-steel development that broke Chicago's height record. From then on, New York thoroughly embraced <b>skeleton</b> <b>frame</b> construction. In particular, New York newspaper companies adopted the skyscraper, building several along Park Row, sometimes termed [...] "Newspaper Row", in the 1880s and 1890s. A few early skyscrapers were also constructed in Baltimore, Boston, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Buffalo, including the Wainwright and the Guaranty Buildings. Early examples on the West Coast include the Old Chronicle Building and the Call Building in San Francisco, as well as the Luzon Building in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E

50|$|As the bonnet de {{police had}} no visor, {{it could not}} shield wearers' eyes {{from the sun and}} alternative, visored, caps were being experimented with. One variety resembled a modern peaked cap with wide crown and {{horizontal}} visor, with dark blue band and crimson top and undersides. Other styles appeared, cylindrical in shape, with slightly sunken crimson top, crimson sides (flamme), national red/white/blue cockade top front, and dark blue band (turban) with flat rounded visor and retractable leather neckflap. Early models had stiff lining, but other models had cane (rattan) <b>skeleton</b> <b>framing</b> for weight-reduction. Obviously influenced by the old bonnet de police, this cap became known as the casquette d'Afrique (African cap) and became universal wear amongst France's European troops. Later models were more stylish and lightweight, one definitive trend being to taper the flamme/body toward the top, so the round top had a smaller diameter than the bottom of the cap and to tilt the flamme/body toward the front. Apart from being lighter, this also gave the cap a rakish, elegant appearance.|$|R
