40|$|Culture as {{a concept}} impacts {{organization}} development (OD) in two fundamental ways.

Dealing with cultures and <b>sub-cultures</b> requires conceptual models and intervention skills that deal realistically with what culture is and how culture works. Second, OD as an occupational community has developed a culture and <b>sub-cultures</b> within itself and has to learn what the strengths and weaknesses are of those occupational cultures and <b>sub-cultures.</b> Of particular importance is the recognition that the <b>sub-cultures</b> within OD may be in conflict with each other and not be aware of this.

A qualitative research design was utilised that sampled employees (n = 455) within a large South African ICT company who completed the South African Culture Instrument (SACI). The data was statistically analysed to determine employees’ perceptions of organisational culture and to establish if generational <b>sub-cultures</b> exist within the organisation. This study indicates that generational <b>sub-cultures</b> can be identified within the organisation based on significantly different perceptions of five of the seven dimensions of organisational culture examined. Identifying generational <b>sub-cultures</b> within an organisation can lead to the development of an organisational talent management strategy for effectively attracting, managing and retaining generationally-diverse employees.

Lisbon's city council made extensive remodelling and repairs to the district, resulting in the opening of new restaurants, clubs and trendy shops. While cars were restricted in the district (except for residents and emergency vehicles), many young people began to live in the Bairro; it is generally a youth-oriented heart of the <b>sub-culture</b> and nightlife of Lisbon.|$|E

Aside from the reggae music and Rastafari influences seen ever more on Thailand's islands and beaches, a true reggae <b>sub-culture</b> is taking root in Thailand's cities and towns.

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, several {{thousand}} Caribbean migrants {{settled in the}} United Kingdom, some of whom brought Rastafari with them. In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in Brixton, South London, and by {{the latter part of}} the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the Notting Hill area of Northwest London. By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced. It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in Birmingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol. Its spread was aided by the gang structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the rudeboy subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes. This social structure allowed for the promotion of in-gang associations and the restrictions of contacts with Babylon. British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s as a result of reggae's popularity. In that same decade it also faced increasing opposition, being regarded as a criminal <b>sub-culture</b> by both much of the press, and by the police, resulting in complaints of police harassment.|$|E
25|$|The {{folk music}} of England is {{traditionally}} based music, which has existed since the later medieval period. It is often contrasted with courtly, classical and later commercial music. Folk {{music has been}} preserved and transmitted orally, through print and later through recordings. The term is {{used to refer to}} English traditional music and music composed, or delivered, in a traditional style. English folk music has produced or contributed to several important musical genres, including sea shanties, jigs, hornpipes and dance music, such as that used for Morris dancing. It can be seen as having distinct regional and local variations in content and style, particularly in areas more removed from the cultural and political centres of the English state, as in Northumbria, or the West Country. Cultural interchange and processes of migration mean that English folk music, although in many ways distinctive, has particularly interacted with the music of Scotland. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and rock music, influencing musical styles and producing musical fusions, such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal. There remains a flourishing <b>sub-culture</b> of English folk music, which continues to influence other genres and occasionally to gain mainstream attention.|$|E

25|$|Aina, {{released}} on 18 March 1977, marked a distinct symbolic break between the so-called liberal Zulfikar Ali Bhutto {{years and the}} increasingly conservative cum revolutionary Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq regime. The film stayed in cinemas for over 400weeks, with its last screening at 'Scala' in Karachi where it ran {{for more than four}} years. It is considered the most popular film ever. Films dropped from a total output of 98 in 1979, of which 42 were in Urdu, to only 58 films of which 26 were in Urdu in 1980.. The film industry by now {{was on the verge of}} collapse as people began turning away from cinema. The filmmakers that remained in the industry, employed flaccid story lines to produce Punjabi cult classics like Maula Jatt in 1979, telling the story of a gandasa-carrying protagonist waging a blood-feud with a local gangster. Growing censorship policies against displays of affection, rather than violence, came as a blow to the industry. As a result, violence-ridden Punjabi films prevailed and overshadowed Urdu cinema. The middle class neglected the 'increasingly dilapidated and rowdy cinemas'. This film <b>sub-culture</b> came to be known as the gandasa culture. In Punjabi cinema Sultan Rahi and Anjuman became iconic figures of this culture. In Pashto cinema, filmmakers were able to get around the censor policies and filled their films with soft-core pornography to increase viewership. This was done by the backing by powerful politicians.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it seemed to come from outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod <b>sub-culture.</b> Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E
