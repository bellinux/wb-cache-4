40|$|Roger <b>Schank's</b> {{research}} in AI takes seriously {{the ideas that}} understanding natural language involves mapping its expressions into an internal representation scheme and that these internal representations have a syntax appropriate for computational operations.

500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger <b>Schank</b> were trying to solve problems like [...] "story understanding" [...] and [...] "object recognition" [...] that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] {{they had to make}} all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that [...] "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise." [...] <b>Schank</b> described their [...] "anti-logic" [...] approaches as [...] "scruffy", as opposed to the [...] "neat" [...] paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.|$|E
500|$|The {{captains of}} Maria, Inflexible, and Loyal Convert {{wrote a letter}} criticizing Captain Pringle for making Arnold's escape {{possible}} by failing to properly blockade the channel, and for not being more aggressive in directing the battle. [...] Apparently the letter did not cause any career problems for Pringle or its authors; he and John <b>Schank,</b> captain of Inflexible, became admirals, as did midshipman Pellew and Lieutenant Dacres. Carleton was awarded the Order of the Bath by King George III for his success at Valcour Island. On December 31, 1776 {{one year after the}} Battle of Quebec, a mass was held in celebration of the British success, and Carleton threw a grand ball.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, in {{a seminal}} paper, Minsky noted {{that many of}} his fellow [...] "scruffy" [...] {{researchers}} were using the same kind of tool: a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be [...] "logical", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures [...] "frames". <b>Schank</b> used a version of frames he called [...] "scripts" [...] to successfully answer questions about short stories in English. Many years later object-oriented programming would adopt the essential idea of [...] "inheritance" [...] from AI research on frames.|$|E

Roger <b>Schank</b> described their [...] "anti-logic" [...] approaches as [...] "scruffy" [...] (as opposed to the [...] "neat" [...] paradigms at CMU and Stanford).

40|$|Knowledge graphs are a {{new form}} of {{knowledge}} representation. They are closely related to semantic networks and can be looked upon as in line with <b>Schank's</b> conceptual dependency theory and Sowa's conceptual graphs.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the need {{in a natural}} language understanding system for {{a model of the}} speaker and of the conversation process itself. Most current programs use models of the domain of discourse to supply the knowledge necessary to understand what is being talked about. (See, e. g., Schank[1973] or Charmak [1972 J.) For example, <b>Schank's</b> system might contain a restaurant &quot;script&quot;, listing all of the actions one normally does at a restaurant, from entering and being seated to paying the check and leaving.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} a way in which the concept of cognitive modelling can be applied to studies of intertextuality. The paper suggests a fresh way of looking at intertextuality – from the perspective of the cognitive processes involved in decoding intertextual references, namely, analogical mapping across different domains. Our knowledge of cognitive processes is largely based on the study of cognitive processing of texts, but texts with intertextual references have until now been a less well-studied area of cognitive research. I define three different ways in which texts relate to each other: hard modelling, soft modelling and loose association. From a cognitive perspective, I suggest that mental processing of these texts involves different knowledge structures which I describe using <b>Schank’s</b> (1982, 1986, 1999) theory of dynamic memory...|$|R
40|$|Originally, case-based {{reasoning}} emerged from <b>Schank's</b> theory of dynamic memory. It has then been presented as an artificial intelligence methodology for processing empirical knowledge. Nevertheless, more recent {{case-based reasoning}} systems study {{how to take}} advantage from theoretical knowledge to process empirical knowledge more effectively. In order to reach this goal, they propose memory models faithful to the ideal of dynamic memory, for which reasoning and learning are inseparable. The memory model presented here is composed of two parts, an experimental and a theoretical memory, expressed in a unified knowledge representation language, and organization. The components of the memory are cases and concepts, in the experimental part, and prototypes and models, in the theoretical part. The reasoning supported by this memory model can be various, and takes advantage of all the components, whether experimental or theoretical. It is strongly constrained by some specialized models in the [...] ...|$|R
