Analysis of Nile River deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the Blue Nile, suggesting higher rainfall also in the Ethiopian Highlands.

50|$|The {{breakup of}} the {{northern}} polar vortex occurs between mid March to mid May. This event signifies the transition from winter to spring, and has impacts on the hydrological cycle, growing seasons of vegetation, and overall ecosystem productivity. The timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloudiness. Early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred, due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere. As a result of increased waves into the vortex, the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal, resulting in an earlier breakup and spring. When the breakup comes early, it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex. When the breakup is late, the remnants dissipate rapidly. When the breakup is early, there is one warming period from late February to middle March. When the breakup is late, there are two warming periods, one January, and one in March. Zonal mean temperature, wind, and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups, while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups. Scientists are connecting a delay in the Arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities, few stratospheric <b>sudden</b> <b>warming</b> events, and depletion of ozone.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} stratospheric {{variability}} on the dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and the tro-posphere is explored {{in a relatively}} simple atmospheric general circulation model. Variability of the model’s stratospheric polar vortex, or polar night jet, is induced by topographically forced stationary waves. A robust relationship is found between {{the strength of the}} stratospheric polar vortex and the latitude of the tropo-spheric jet, confirming and extending earlier results in the absence of stationary waves. In both the clima-tological mean and on intraseasonal time scales, a weaker vortex is associated with an equatorward shift in the tropospheric jet and vice versa. It is found that the mean structure and variability of the vortex in the model is very sensitive to the amplitude of the topography and that Northern Hemisphere–like variability, with a realistic frequency of stratospheric <b>sudden</b> <b>warming</b> events, occurs only for a relatively narrow range of topographic heights. When the model captures <b>sudden</b> <b>warming</b> events with fidelity, however, the exchange of information both upward and downward between the troposphere and stratosphere closely resembles that in observations. The in-fluence of stratospheric variability on variability in the troposphere is demonstrated by comparing integra-tions with and without an active stratosphere. A realistic, time-dependent stratospheric circulation increases the persistence of the tropospheric annular modes, and the dynamical coupling is most apparent prior to and following stratospheric <b>sudden</b> <b>warming</b> events. 1...|$|E
