5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and unsettled weather indicated that a storm was forming in the vicinity. The disturbance strengthened into a tropical storm on October 12 to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a high pressure area building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale.</b> <b>That</b> same day it passed just east of Bermuda. It weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical near Newfoundland {{a couple of days}} later.|$|E
5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale.</b> <b>That</b> same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E

5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale,</b> <b>that</b> same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a pinhole eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification. During this intensification phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the intensification. Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to a very intense tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

5|$|The new European {{states that}} had {{formed in the}} second half of the 19th century {{typically}} had traditions of war memorials, but nothing on the <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> would later emerge from World War I. Italy built various war memorials after unification in the 1860s, but there was little agreement about who should be responsible for these within the new Italian state. Romania erected a number of heroically styled memorials after the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 and 1878, usually celebrating famous leaders associated with Romanian independence, but also including the occasional modest local monuments Bulgaria and Serbia constructed many war memorials after the end of the First Balkan War in 1913. The public played little role in these eastern European memorials, however, which were typically constructed by the central state authorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} organized steadily {{that evening}} {{and into the}} morning of September18. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast. Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes, Bonnie was embedded in a larger-scale cyclonic circulation at first, which minimized shear (allowing it to develop) and provided weak steering currents. The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but well-defined eye formed late that morning. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean. The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane. In addition, Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September19 as steering currents slowly developed. Bonnie strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> morning as well, peaking at 105mph (165km/h) with a 970mbar central pressure. The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September20, when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly, although remaining a Category2 hurricane. Early on September21, the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion. That afternoon, the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of 965mbar, just under Category3 intensity. Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22, when it began to weaken very gradually and level off. Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking mid-latitude ridge of high pressure, which stalled the motion.|$|E
