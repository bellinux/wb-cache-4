5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal.

However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
