5|$|A <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} falsifiable {{if there}} is an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|Processing fluency – A <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> {{more likely}} to be {{considered}} true if it is easier to process.|$|E
5|$|Truthiness is {{the belief}} or {{assertion}} that a particular <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true based on the intuition or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts. Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions.|$|E

5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Manetho's Epitome {{states that}} Amenhotep I ruled Egypt {{for twenty years}} and seven months or twenty-one years, {{depending}} on the source. While Amenhotep I's highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10, Manetho's <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by a passage in the tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet. This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 Years. Thus, in the high chronology, Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and, in the low chronology, from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC, though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years.|$|E
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
50|$|Iteration <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> <b>statements</b> that <b>are</b> {{repeatedly}} executed when a given {{condition is}} evaluated as true. Since J2SE 5.0, Java has four forms of such statements.|$|R

5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> inference as their diet isn't described. All that is known is that it sticks to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{function}} and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide {{the ability to}} interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace {{in the manner of}} a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser.|$|E
5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army {{to join forces}} with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion this {{suggests}} that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler mentioned this. Because of the lack of sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E
50|$|Most states {{recognize}} that some categories of <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> {{considered to be}} defamatory per se, such that people making a defamation claim for these statements {{do not need to}} prove that the <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> defamatory.|$|R

25|$|However, the Washington Supreme Court {{reinstated}} the conviction, {{ruling that}} the witness's <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> reliable under Roberts. In particular, the court noted that Michael and Sylvia Crawford's statements interlocked, and therefore concluded that Sylvia’s <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> admissible.|$|R
5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E

50|$|The next {{question}} was {{whether or not these}} <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> protected by qualified privilege. To establish privilege, the appellants had to show that they had a reciprocal right and duty to make and receive the report, and that the defamatory <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> relevant or germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion. One of the recognised occasions that enjoys qualified privilege <b>is</b> where such <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> published in the discharge of a duty or in the exercise of a right.|$|R
40|$|The {{process by}} which an organisation's {{financial}} <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> audited by external auditors {{can be described as}} a risk-based, systematic approach in which the nature, extent and timing of the audit procedures and audit evidence required, are determined by assessing and evaluating the risk that the financial <b>statement</b> assertions <b>are</b> materiality misstated. In fact, when the external auditor issues a standard unqualified audit report on the financial <b>statements,</b> he/she <b>is</b> confirming, {{with a high degree of}} assurance based on persuasive evidence gathered during the audit, that the financial <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> free of material misrepresentations, taking cognisance of the fact that the financial <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> presented in accordance with a specified set(s) of criteria...|$|R
