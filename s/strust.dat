In Pakistan, it was also said that Musharraf eye-blindly trusted Aziz and sometimes, Musharraf's approvals did not needed for the projects that required permission. Aziz quietly and more quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine Musharraf which may have been a factor that Musharraf had eye-blindly trusted Aziz.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{sustainability}} of social networks using <b>STrust,</b> our social trust model. The novelty of the model is that it introduces the concept of engagement trust and combines it with the popularity trust to derive the social trust of the {{community as well as}} of individual members in the community. This enables the recommender system to use these different types of trust to recommend different things to the community, and identify (and recommend) different roles. For example, it recommends mentors using the engagement trust and leaders using the popularity trust. We then show the utility of the model by analysing data from two types of social networks. We also study {{the sustainability}} of a community through our social trust model. We observe that a 5 % drop in highly trusted members causes more than a 50 % drop in social capital that, in turn, raises the question of sustainability of the community. We report our analysis and its results...|$|E
40|$|In his {{introduction}} to Shakespeare in the Present, Terence Hawkes reclaims, {{in the face of}} historicist <b>strust,</b> “presentism” as a critical strategy in Shakespeare Studies. It must be, he argues, a theorized strategy, not a simple assumption or assertion that Shakespeare is our contemporary. It must be a strategy which “will not yearn to speak with the dead [but will aim] to talk to the living” (4). 1 I find Hawkes’ words heartening, since in performance theatre is always and necessarily presentist. Hawkes recognizes this, and goes on to stipulate that “placing emphasis on the present can’t help but connect fruitfully with the current realignment of critical responses that stresses the performance of a play as much as its ‘reference’… Presentism thus highlights what has been termed drama’s ‘performative’ function” (5). Hawkes’ broader thesis—that presentism makes it possible to reverse the chronology of causality, to ask questions about the influence of the present upon the past—resonates with the re-creative act of making theatre, which has always needed to negotiate the influence of the present upon the past as well as vice versa, in its search for what Milhouse and Hume call “producible interpretations”. 2 In {{his introduction}} to Shakespeare in the Present, Terence Hawkes reclaims, in the face of historicist <b>strust,</b> “presentism” as a critical strategy in Shakespeare Studies.
