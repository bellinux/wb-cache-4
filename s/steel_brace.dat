500|$|Prior to the 1922 season, Goebel [...] "threw out his knee" [...] and {{was fitted}} with a steel hinge – {{an early version of}} a knee brace. However, the steel contraption {{required}} oiling and overheated when the oil dried, thus limiting Goebel's ability to play a complete game in 1922. One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel's knee brace this way: [...] "To enable Goebel to play, the Michigan trainers devised a <b>steel</b> <b>brace</b> – a hinge. This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge. Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action because of the hinge." [...] Goebel's playing time was limited because [...] "the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing." [...] During the 1922 game against Illinois, Goebel's skin was burned by the steel.|$|E
500|$|Welles usually worked 16 to 18 {{hours a day}} on the film. He often {{began work}} at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's {{shooting}} with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle. The injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks. He eventually wore a <b>steel</b> <b>brace</b> to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word [...] "Rosebud" [...] consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. [...] "Orson was delighted with the commotion", he said.|$|E

In the present study, the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings rehabilitated using concentric <b>steel</b> <b>bracing</b> is investigated.

In this study, in order to evaluate behaviors of "Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames" types defined in TEC- 2007 under lateral loads, dimensional analysis of Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames designed with different scales and dimensions was conducted, the results were controlled according to TEC- 2007, and after conducting static pushover analysis, behavior and load capacity of the Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames and hinges sequence of the elements constituting the Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames were tested. Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames that were tested analytically consist of 2 storey and one bay, and are formed as two groups with the scales 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. In the study, Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames described in TEC- 2007 were designed, which are 7 types in total being non-braced, X-braced, V-braced, Λ-braced, braced, /-braced and K-braced. Furthermore, in order to verify accuracy of the analytic studies performed, the 1 / 2 scaled concentrically steel X-braced frame test element made up of box profiles and 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frame with insufficient earthquake resistance were tested individually under lateral loads, and test results were compared with the results derived from analytic studies and interpreted. Similar results were obtained from both experimental studies and pushover analyses. According to pushover analysis results, load-carrying capacity of 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frames increased up to 7, 01 times as compared to the non-braced specimen upon strengthening. Results acquired from the study revealed that reinforced concrete buildings which have inadequate seismic capacity can be strengthened quickly, easily and economically by this method without evacuating them...|$|R

Comparing with traditional steel frame-RC core wall structure, this new type of hybrid structure presents better coorporative working performance since mega <b>steel</b> <b>braced</b> frame provides larger stiffness and composite steel plate shear wall provides a fairly ductile response.
