40|$|Given the {{evidence}} of significant numbers of red-light violations, {{one of the most}} effective ways for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians to protect themselves against this safety issue is by improving their awareness of when it is most likely to occur. While red-light <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> can help to catch offenders and make everyone – from drivers to pedestrians – more cautious on or near the road, red-light running is a continuing public safety hazard in all of the analyzed municipalities and states. This report examined the frequency of violations by the day of the week. Friday proved to be the worst day for intersection safety in 2013 – <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> caught 570, 122 total red-light violations.

40|$|Trafikverket or Trafikverket’s {{contractors}} are considering {{the use of}} several products {{that in some way}} have to do with nanotechnology for sealing and impregnating various types of surfaces, for example road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras.</b> It has been noted that the potential health and environmental risks of nanomaterials should be evaluated over their entire life cycle. Further to previous risk assessments made on the nano-products considered by Trafikverket, it is therefore relevant to analyse the product’s impacts from a life cycle perspective. The aims of this project are to (i) Provide a state-of-the-art background on the types, production processes, uses and current debates on the classification, and human and eco-toxicity of nano-silica and silane based nanofilms, (ii) To analyse if there are any arguments, from an environmental perspective, for the application of self-cleaning coatings to speed cameras compared to conventional practice, (iii) To qualitatively discuss the potential importance of nanoparticle emissions from self-cleaning coatings in the context of other sources of nanoparticle emissions. A life cycle assessment is performed for maintenance of road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> in Sweden in a business as usual (BAU) scenario and in a scenario where the cameras have been coated with a self-cleaning silane based nanofilm (Nano ProHard). The functional unit is the maintenance of road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> in Sweden to allow for an acceptable speed camera picture quality over one year. The life cycle impact assessment methods ReCiPe Midpoint (Hierarchist) and Cumulative Energy Demand have been used. All life cycle phases from extraction of raw materials to end-of-life have been included. Inventory data is gathered from Ecoinvent 2. 2. The detergent used in the business as usual scenario is approximated with the Ecoinvent process "Soap, at plant/RER S" and the alkoxysilanes in NanoProHard with "Tetrachlorosilane, at plant/GLO S". Results show that the biggest impacts in the BAU-scenario are related to operation of vehicles for inspection of the road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> in the maintenance phase, and to the production of soap. The biggest impacts in the Nano-scenario are related to operation of vehicles in the maintenance phase, and to production of soap, Nano ProHard Clean and Nano ProHard, mainly due to the ethanol in the product. Comparing the two scenarios (excluding operation of vehicles in the maintenance phase) it was seen that BAU had a bigger contribution than Nano in all impact categories except for fossil depletion, due to use of ethanol in the Nano-scenario. However, a sensitivity analysis revealed that this may not always be the case. It {{should also be noted that}} the toxicity in the use phase has not been assessed. In cases where very little detergent is used for cleaning, for example in those cases where only water is used in the BAU-scenario, it may not be beneficial to use a nanofilm. However, in case the road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> are usually washed very often, and/or with big amounts of detergent, use of nanofilm could have lower GHG-emissions than maintenance in BAU-scenario. However, it can again be emphasised that the toxicity of the products in the use phase has not been assessed, and that this is an aspect that must also be considered when concluding on which maintenance regime to choose. It must also be noted that soap is not the commonly used detergent in maintenance, and that results could vary significantly depending on detergent used. It can be concluded that there are no clear environmental benefits if Trafikverket were to apply self-cleaning coatings to their road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras,</b> compared to conventional practice. The main source of impacts from maintenance of the road <b>safety</b> <b>cameras</b> is vehicle operation and this cannot be reduced by application of a nanofilm due to the current requirement of inspecting the cameras once per week. Considering the lack of knowledge on the product, and the possible toxicity of its components, it is not recommended that the product is used without further investigations into the type of chemicals used.

50|$|Since April 2007 {{the funding}} for <b>safety</b> <b>camera</b> {{partnerships}} has been significantly altered; all funding is now passed to local authorities {{in the form of}} an enhanced road safety grant. <b>Safety</b> <b>camera</b> partnerships must bid annually for funding to council budget holders along with other local authority funded organisation for carry out their operations; the funding, while a road safety grant can be used for any local authority expense that is not connected to road safety, ring-fencing of local authority funds not being allowed.|$|E

50|$|In a study {{conducted}} by TRL for the UK Department for Transport one of the conclusions was that vehicle activated signs appear to be very effective in reducing speeds; in particular, they are capable of reducing the number of drivers who exceed the speed limit and who contribute disproportionately to the accident risk, without the need for enforcement such as <b>safety</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R

50|$|As of April 2006 {{there were}} thirty eight <b>Safety</b> <b>Camera</b> Partnerships in England and Wales {{covering}} forty-one police force areas {{out of a}} total of forty-three. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced new legislation relating to Road safety grants, the application of surplus income from <b>safety</b> <b>camera</b> enforcement and regualation relating to fixed fines. From April 2007 authorities received a 'Road Safety Grant' which was no longer related to the number of fines issued locally and was instead given directly to those Local Authorities responsible for road safety regardless or not of whether they operate traffic enforcement cameras.|$|E
