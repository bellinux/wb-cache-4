A small tree, it grows up to 5 m in height, has papery bark and narrow, tapered leaves up to 20 mm in length and flowers in summer. Melaleuca alternifolia is unique to Australia and its natural habitat is a relatively small area around the Clarence and Richmond rivers in the north‐east coastal area of New South Wales where the terrain is generally low lying and swampy.

30|$|Gas {{flooding}} such as CO 2 flooding may {{be effectively}} applied to ultra-low permeability reservoirs, but gas channeling is inevitable due to low viscosity and high mobility {{of gas and}} formation heterogeneity. In order to mitigate or prevent gas channeling, ethylenediamine is chosen for permeability profile control. The reaction mechanism of ethylenediamine with CO 2, injection performance, swept volume, and enhanced oil recovery were systematically evaluated. The reaction product of ethylenediamine and CO 2 was a white solid or a light <b>yellow</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid,</b> which would mitigate or prevent gas channeling. Also, ethylenediamine could be easily injected into ultra-low permeability cores at high temperature with protective ethanol slugs. The core was swept by injection of 0.3 PV ethylenediamine. Oil displacement tests performed on heterogeneous models with closed fractures, oil recovery was significantly enhanced with injection of ethylenediamine. Experimental results showed that using ethylenediamine to plug high permeability layers would provide a new research idea for the gas injection in fractured, heterogeneous and ultra-low permeability reservoirs. This technology {{has the potential to}} be widely applied in oilfields.|$|R

After 30  min, graphene dots were made and stored in a refrigerator (4  °C). 60  ml of egg white was poured into a beaker and mixed with 40  ml of distilled water.

30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale <b>yellow</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that castor seeds from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17]. Malaysian castor seeds for instance, contain total lipids (castor oil) reaching up to 43.3  % per dry weight and a saponification value of 182.96  mg KOH/g [14] while for the Nigerian castor seeds, the total lipids (castor oil) is 48  % per dry weight with a saponification value of 178.00  mg KOH/g [15].|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of our work to prepare inhibitors of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, we desired to prepare sulfone analogues of some {{previously}} reported sulfides [1, 2]. The previously reported nitrosulfone [3] was not able to be reduced to the amine by using catalytic hydrogenation with a palladium on carbon catalyst, with tin and hydrochloric acid [4], or with iron and acetic acid in ethanol [5]. Therefore, the nitrosulfone, 1, was converted into the acetamide, 2, using iron in acetic acid [5]. The acetamide, 2, was hydrolyzed to the desired aniline, 3, using concentrated hydrochloric acid and ethanol. Unfortunately for us, the aniline was not able to be converted into the desired triazine by the reported procedure [2]. In round bottom flask 1 -nitro- 3 -[(phenylsulfonyl) methyl]benzene, 1 (2. 453 g, 8. 85 mmoles), iron filings (2. 019 g, 36. 2 mmoles), and 25 mL of concentrated acetic acid were combined and refluxed overnight. After allowing the flask to cool, 200 mL of water and 100 mL of dichloromethane were added to the mixture. The unreacted iron was then removed by vacuum filtration. The aqueous and organic layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted two more times with 45 mL portions of dichloromethane.

The microstructures of the obtained copolymers were characterized by 19 F and 1 H NMR spectroscopy and by elementary analysis and these techniques enabled one to assess the contents of both comonomers in the produced copolymers. VDF was shown to be more incorporated in the copolymer than BDFE. From the extended Kelen and Tudos method, the kinetics of the radical copolymerization led to {{the determination of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers (rVDF ¼ 1. 20 6 0. 50 and rBDFE ¼ 0. 40 6 0. 15 at 75 °C) showing that VDF is more reactive than BDFE. Alfrey-Price's Q and e values of BDFE monomer were calculated to be 0. 009 (from QVDF = 0. 008) or 0. 019 (from QVDF = 0. 015) and þ 1. 22 (vs. eVDF = 0. 40) or þ 1. 37 (vs. eVDF = 0. 50), respectively, indicating that BDFE is an electron-accepting monomer. Statistic cooligomers were produced with molar masses ranging from 1, 800 to 5, 500 g/mol (assessed by GPC with polystyrene standards). A further evidence of the successful copolymerization was shown by the selective reduction of bromine atoms in poly(VDF-co-BDFE) cooligomers that led to analog PVDF. The thermal properties of the poly(VDF-co-BDFE) cooligomers were also determined and those containing a high VDF amount exhibited a high thermal stability...|$|R
