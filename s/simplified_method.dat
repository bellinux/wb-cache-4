5|$|The game also {{received}} an international demo titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The idea behind Episode Duscae {{was to give}} players a personal look at the game due to its long absence from the public eye, as well as demonstrate its gameplay {{and the fact that}} it was being actively developed. It was named after one of the regions in the game. The demo is set during the opening segment of XV, where the party temporarily lose their car and must gather funds for its repair by taking on jobs in the region. Gameplay and main story elements were tailored for a demo experience. One of the features left out was the ability for players to rent Chocobos, while the battle system was a slimmed-down version of what was planned for the final game, using the originally planned preset weapon deck feature. The character Cindy was also included. A summon with a <b>simplified</b> <b>method</b> of acquirement was also put into the game: originally intended to be Titan, it was replaced with Ramuh due to the former being a key character in the story.|$|E

25|$|Once Thomas Hobbes and Spinoza {{had applied}} Cartesian {{approaches}} to political philosophy, {{concerns about the}} inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, Shaftesbury and, much less known at the time, Giambattista Vico, both presented new arguments {{for the importance of}} the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after Hans-Georg Gadamer, as a humanist interpretation of the term. Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately <b>simplified</b> <b>method</b> that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals (methodological individualism), ignoring the sense of community that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering common good sense as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.|$|E

40|$|The Natsal-SF is a psychometrically {{validated}} {{measure of}} sexual function {{for use in}} community health surveys, derived from 17 questions reflecting three components of sexual function. Scoring requires knowledge of complex statistical modeling and, given the methodological complexities, we assessed the validity of two <b>simplified</b> scoring <b>methods</b> calculated using the factor loadings produced when originally modeling the Natsal-SF items. Method 1 uses these factor loadings to three decimal places, while method 2 assigns whole numbers to each item based on the factor loadings. Scores from these <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> are compared to the original score using correlation coefficients, by comparing the distributions and the scores of each method in a linear regression model with key variables. We found scores from the <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> both correlate highly with the original score, and the distributions of scores closely match. The <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> result in different regression coefficients for gender and relationship context but estimate the coefficients of all other variables similarly to the original method. While the Natsal-SF should ideally be scored using latent variable modeling, the <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> perform well so {{can be used in}} similar contexts, increasing the utility of the Natsal-SF and enabling future studies to measure sexual function more comprehensively...|$|R

40|$|An {{objective}} of the European Commission’s 6 th Framework Research Project, Sustainable Bridges, is to advance {{our understanding of the}} behaviour of existing railway bridges and develop tools to assess their ability to safely handle future traffic demands and extend their service lives. This paper presents the findings of a study that reviews structural safety models applicable to the assessment of existing bridges. The study proposes the use of simplified probabilistic non- linear structural analysis methods to provide more accurate assessments of the load capacity of bridge systems than traditional <b>methods.</b> The <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> use the results of a limited number of deterministic non-linear structural analyses and apply these results into a reliability framework. The application of the proposed methods is illustrated by assessing the safety of an existing bridge. The accuracy and efficiency of the <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> are verified by comparing the results of the <b>simplified</b> <b>methods</b> to those obtained from full probabilistic non- linear analysis procedures.

Effects of applied voltage difference and chloride source concentrations on chloride diffusion coefficients are presented. Migration due to the non-linear electric potential effectively overwhelms diffusion due to concentration gradients. A comparison between diffusion coefficients obtained from sophisticated analyses (i. e., NP-EN) {{and a variety of}} commonly used <b>simplifying</b> <b>methods</b> to estimate chloride diffusion coefficients is made.

40|$|A novel fast {{simplification}} {{method for}} point-sampled statue model is proposed. <b>Simplifying</b> <b>method</b> for 3 d model reconstruction {{is a hot}} topic {{in the field of}} 3 D surface construction. But it is difficult as point cloud of many 3 d models is very large, so its running time becomes very long. In this paper, a two-stage <b>simplifying</b> <b>method</b> is proposed. Firstly, a feature-preserved non-uniform simplification method for cloud points is presented, which simplifies the data set to remove the redundancy while keeping down the features of the model. Secondly, an affinity clustering <b>simplifying</b> <b>method</b> is used to classify the point cloud into a sharp point or a simple point. The advantage of Affinity Propagation clustering is passing messages among data points and fast speed of processing. Together with the re-sampling, it can dramatically reduce the duration of the process while keep a lower memory cost. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that after the simplification, the performance of the proposed method is efficient as well as the details of the surface are preserved well...|$|R
