The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the <b>superstructure</b> in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft <b>superstructure</b> about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the <b>superstructure</b> were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets.

About 1902–03 the 6-pounders on the main deck were removed; two were remounted on the <b>superstructure,</b> but the other two were not replaced.

30|$|In summary, sub- 20 -nm IONPs with spherical {{shape and}} {{polyhedral}} shape were chemically synthesized, and self-assembly of these IONPs into anisotropic <b>superstructures</b> under the in-plane magnetic field was demonstrated. The solvent-evaporation assembly process expedited by an {{external magnetic field}} produced nanoparticle <b>superstructures</b> at sub- 10 -μm sizes with homogeneous morphology and controlled spacing. The experimental conditions exhibit influence on the size and spacing of the <b>superstructures,</b> while {{the shape of the}} building nanoparticles affects the morphology and alignment of the <b>superstructures.</b> Well-aligned rod-shaped <b>superstructures</b> were obtained using spherical IONPs, and loosely aligned spindle-shaped <b>superstructures</b> were prepared with polyhedral IONPs. The two types of <b>superstructures</b> both show magnetic easy axes along the applied field direction, and they also show enhancement of coercivity and saturation magnetization along their easy axes. The enhanced magnetism in the <b>superstructures</b> is associated with magnetic anisotropy and dipole interactions of the nanoparticles and shape anisotropy of the <b>superstructures.</b> This low-cost technique of magnetically directed nanoparticle assembly could be used for fabricating nanomaterial-based structures with controlled geometric dimensions and enhanced magnetic properties for magnetic and energy storage applications. The anisotropic <b>superstructures</b> prepared here are promising for studying fundamental physics related to magnetic interactions and collective behaviors of magnetic nanomaterials.|$|R
30|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticle}} <b>superstructures</b> with controlled magnetic alignment {{and desired}} structural anisotropy hold promise for applications in data storage and energy storage. Assembly of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles under {{a magnetic field}} could lead to highly ordered <b>superstructures,</b> providing distinctive magnetic properties. In this work, a low-cost fabrication technique was demonstrated to assemble sub- 20 -nm iron oxide nanoparticles into crystalline <b>superstructures</b> under an in-plane magnetic field. The gradient of the applied magnetic field contributes to the anisotropic formation of micron-sized <b>superstructures.</b> The magnitude of the applied magnetic field promotes the alignment of magnetic moments of the nanoparticles. The strong dipole-dipole interactions between the neighboring nanoparticles lead to a close-packed pattern as an energetically favorable configuration. Rod-shaped and spindle-shaped <b>superstructures</b> with uniform size and controlled spacing were obtained using spherical and polyhedral nanoparticles, respectively. The arrangement and alignment of the <b>superstructures</b> can be tuned by changing the experimental conditions. The two types of <b>superstructures</b> both show enhancement of coercivity and saturation magnetization along the applied field direction, which is presumably associated with the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic dipole interactions of the constituent nanoparticles and the increased shape anisotropy of the <b>superstructures.</b> Our {{results show that the}} magnetic-field-assisted assembly technique could be used for fabricating nanomaterial-based structures with controlled geometric dimensions and enhanced magnetic properties for magnetic and energy storage applications.|$|R

5|$|The Navy Department {{conducted}} an international design competition for Texas {{and the winner}} was the Naval Construction & Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed Texass forward turret {{on the port side}} and her aft turret to starboard. The need for cross-deck fire caused the <b>superstructure</b> to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the <b>superstructure.</b> This significantly limited the gun's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the <b>superstructure</b> still restricted each gun's arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the <b>superstructure</b> was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, there is no report on the {{synthesis}} of inorganic <b>superstructures</b> capped with conductive donor polymer for BHJ solar cells. In this report, we employed P 3 HT as the ligands to synthesize P 3 HT-capped CdSe <b>superstructures</b> in a mixed solution of 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This synthetic procedure yielded homogeneous CdSe <b>superstructures</b> that were constructed by 5 - to 10 -nm CdSe nanoparticles. These P 3 HT-capped CdSe <b>superstructures</b> can be dissolved in many kinds of solvents, such as 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene and chloroform, from which thin films can be readily cast to fabricate BHJ solar cells.|$|R

5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the <b>super{{structure}}</b> were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the <b>superstructure</b> and the bridge structure was enlarged {{around the base of}} the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward <b>superstructure</b> was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns.

40|$|We analyse {{properties}} of galaxy {{groups and their}} dependence on the large scale environment as defined by <b>superstructures.</b> We find that group galaxy cross correlations depend only on group properties regardless the groups reside in <b>superstructures.</b> This indicates that the total galaxy density profile around groups is independent of the global environment. At a given global luminosity, a proxy to group total mass, groups have a larger stellar mass content by a factor 1. 3, a relative excess independent of the group luminosity. Groups in <b>superstructures</b> have 40 per cent higher velocity dispersions and systematically larger minimal enclosing radii. We also find that the stellar population of galaxies in groups in <b>superstructures</b> is systematically older as infered from the galaxy spectra Dn 4000 parameter. Although the galaxy number density profile of groups is independent of environment, the star formation rate and stellar mass profile of the groups residing in <b>superstructures</b> differs from groups elsewhere. For groups residing in <b>superstructures,</b> {{the combination of a}} larger stellar mass content and star formation rate produces a larger time scale for star formation regardless the distance to the group center. Our results provide evidence that groups in <b>superstructures</b> formed earlier than elsewhere, as expected in the assembly bias scenario. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figures.

40|$|Biomacromolecules usually form complex <b>superstructures</b> {{in natural}} biotissues, such as {{different}} alignments of collagen fibres in articular cartilages, for multifunctionalities.

The control of localized orientation of rigid molecules, which are sensitive to the internal stress field of the gel, is achieved by tuning the swelling mismatch between masked and unmasked regions of the photolithographic patterned gel.

The stabilization of zinc ions with polysaccharides wrapped chains along {{with the support of}} proteins, lipids and physterols of aloe vera gel followed by combustion derives the ZnO <b>superstructures.</b> The obtained ZnO <b>superstructures</b> show a hexagonal crystal phase and exhibit a semiconducting behavior with the energy band gap varies from 2. 92 to 3. 08 eV. The aloe vera gel derived ZnO <b>superstructures</b> exhibit unique and strong orange-red emission centered at 600 nm. The better structural, morphological and photoluminescence results are obtained for ZnO prepared with 16. 6 W/V of zinc nitrate with aloe vera content compared to other concentrations of aloe vera. The prepared compounds are tested for antimalassezial activity against Malassezia furfur, dermatologically prevalent yeast, and were found to have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 8 to 125 mL. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that yeast cells treated with ZnO <b>superstructures</b> have the chromatin as orange instead of green, showcasing the cell aggregation suggests that ZnO <b>superstructures</b> have an immense potential as an antifungal agent.
