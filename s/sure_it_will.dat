But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E

"For a {{long period}} of time I've been trying to get better and better, but clearly the longer you don't play, the {{likelihood}} of playing again gets smaller and smaller each day, especially at my age," [...] Öhlund told the Tampa Tribune in April 2013.

500|$|During Microsoft's early history, Gates was {{an active}} {{software}} developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role {{in most of the}} company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, [...] "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do that), but because it's a neat hack." ...|$|E
500|$|Other food {{critics have}} written {{positively}} about [...] "The Food Wife". Lesley Balla of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog listed her ten favorite {{quotes from the}} episode, placing the entire hip hop song about foodies and food blogging at the top. She commented that [...] "Plenty of insider jokes at foodies' expense season the episode. So was it as funny to a non-food-world person {{as it was to}} someone who could identify each culinary personality in Marge's dream ? Safe to say, yes; it is still The Simpsons, after all. For foodists, the whole episode is entirely quotable — we're <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be in the food blogosphere for years to come." [...] Laine Doss, a food blogger for the Miami New Times and New Times Broward-Palm Beach, commented that she [...] "loved Lisa Simpson's list of cutest vegetarians , which included Paul McCartney, Russell Brand, and Edward Cullen." [...] Doss, as well as Elizabeth Gunnison of Esquires Eat Like a Man blog, also commended the hip hop song.|$|E
500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us to be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

[...] Its MP Jassim Hussein said that [...] "I don't think the regime is willing to meet most of our demands.

For now, she keeps plenty of reminders of the country in her fourth-floor home office [...] a statue of Buddha, a photograph of a palm tree and rice field that she feels captures the country's beauty. Her office overlooks a wood deck that has been painted rusty red to remind her of the soil of her native home. She's working on her first novel, set in 1148 in Cambodia.

[...] I am <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> succeed and I congratulate whoever has been {{responsible}} for framing it." [...] Stopford's chief-of-staff, Brigadier General Hamilton Reed was not so supportive and his doubts and prejudices succeeded in swaying Stopford. [...] Reed was an artillery officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Boer War. [...] Having served on the Western Front, he believed no assault on entrenched positions could be made without artillery support. [...] Reconnaissance had revealed no prepared fortifications at Suvla and yet Stopford proceeded to limit the objectives of the landing and Hamilton failed to stop him. [...] The final orders issued by Stopford and the 11th Division commander, Major General Frederick Hammersley, were imprecise, requiring only that the high ground be taken [...] "if possible".|$|E

A major focus should now be put on renewable sources of energy." [...] French Green party lawmaker Noël Mamère claims that more concrete efforts to fight present-day global warming will be neglected {{as a result of}} ITER: [...] "This is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we're not even <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted {{a dinner}} {{to raise money}} for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the {{sponsoring}} organizations, he wrote, [...] "have long been connected with Communist activities." [...] Hellman replied: [...] "I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves." [...] She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened to}} favorable reviews. Critics unanimously praised Ethel Merman's performance as Annie Oakley, though some thought the score and book were not particularly distinguished. John Chapman of the Daily News {{declared that the}} production had [...] "good lyrics and tunes by Irving Berlin... the razzle-dazzle atmosphere of a big-time show" [...] but pronounced Merman {{the best part of}} the show, stating [...] "She is a better comedienne than she ever was before", stating that [...] "Annie is a good, standard, lavish, big musical and I'm <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a huge success--but it isn't the greatest show in the world". Louis Kronenberger of PM stated that the show was 'in many ways routine", but greatly praised Merman's performance, opining, [...] "For me, Annie is mainly Miss Merman's show, though the rest of it is competent enough of its kind...Irving Berlin's score is musically not exciting--of the real songs, only one or two are tuneful".|$|E

2500|$|... 2012 was {{a roller}} coaster ride for the Knights as they start the season seeing {{themselves}} sinking down {{as far as the}} 6th spot and it didn't stop there as star center Raymond Almazan was missing a lot of games in the first round due to unknown reasons. Almazan vowed to come back in the 2nd round and with him back in the lineup, the Knights became the hottest team in the NCAA as they won 7 of their 9 games just enough to secure the #3 spot to force a Final 4 rematch against San Sebastian. In the first game Kevin Alas made history as he scored 43 points (the most in Final 4 history)to force a knockout game. In the do-or-die game, the game went down to the wire just like the previous year but Jojo Belorio made <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be Letran this time by scoring the game winning free throws to book the last ticket to the Finals. They met their archrivals, San Beda in the finals. Although they avoided defeat by winning the second game after losing the first game, they were blown out in the last game of the finals by the Red Lions. This season, the battlecry W17NESS LETRAN was formulated for their bid to attain the school's 17th overall title in the men's basketball tournament.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, Sharon {{went to the}} Abbott cabin to {{have time}} for herself after the {{breakdown}} of her marriage to Jack. Nick showed up because Noah was ice-skating and fell, suffering hypothermia. After becoming trapped in the cabin during a blizzard, Nick found a letter Sharon wrote to him (but didn't intend to show him) which professed her undying love for him. He confronted her and they made love. Prior to this, Brad {{had come to the}} cabin to profess his love for Sharon. On his way out, he ended up dying by saving Noah from the ice. Discussing the plot, Case said that Sharon wants Nick [...] "more than anyone" [...] but would only have him under [...] "certain terms" [...] which includes him leaving Phyllis. Additionally, she said that she wouldn't want Nick and Sharon reunite if there wasn't any conflict. That April, they were at the cabin again searching for Noah and ended up making love, resulting in Sharon becoming pregnant. During an interview with The Daily News Case said that Nick constantly changing his mind whether to be with Sharon or Phyllis [...] "throws everything into a spin" [...] and causes Sharon to make her decisions [...] "all over again because she has new information". Also weighing in on the reunion, Morrow told TV Guide: [...] "The fans have wanted {{this for a long time}} [...] it is going to be a very messy journey getting these two back together as a solid couple, but I am <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> happen." [...] Sharon briefly lied about the baby's paternity because of Summer becoming ill, and stated that Jack was the father. The truth came out, but Faith [...] "died" [...] at birth, Nick and Sharon grieved the loss of their child.|$|E
