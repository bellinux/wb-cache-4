5|$|Einstein's {{affiliation}} with the Institute for Advanced <b>Study</b> <b>would</b> last {{until his death in}} 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the <b>study</b> <b>would</b> widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a <b>study</b> <b>would</b> be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E
30|$|If {{homogeneous}} {{data were}} provided by two or more <b>studies,</b> a meta-analysis <b>would</b> have been performed {{and the risk of}} bias across <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> have been evaluated.|$|R
30|$|If {{none of the}} <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> provide {{correlations}} between the proxies, the multivariate analysis equals the univariate analysis.|$|R
30|$|Conventionally, LCA <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> include {{sensitivity}} analysis and normalization of results. They {{were not included}} in the scope of this article.|$|R
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further <b>study</b> <b>would</b> be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{other three}} plants under <b>study</b> <b>would</b> {{be on the}} Jamanxim River.|$|E
25|$|In David Hough's book Proficient Motorcycling, Dr. Hurt said he {{had always}} assumed a new <b>study</b> <b>would</b> be conducted.|$|E
50|$|In {{her early}} years, she studied art in France and Italy. The <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> have {{particular}} significance for her stained glass.|$|R
50|$|Early reports {{indicated}} that the follow-up to Battle <b>Studies</b> <b>would</b> be called Born and Raised and would be released in October 2011.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that N. leyte might fall within the natural variability of N. ramos, though field <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be needed to confirm this.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the size}} of the project we would also ask for a {{detailed}} EIA to be done, as a preliminary <b>study</b> <b>would</b> not be sufficient to address all the issues that will arise.|$|E
25|$|Despite public interest, NASA {{considers}} {{the study of}} ETH to be irrelevant to its work {{because of the number}} of false leads that a <b>study</b> <b>would</b> provide, and the limited amount of usable scientific data that it would yield.|$|E
25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A case control <b>study</b> <b>would</b> involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective <b>study</b> <b>would</b> involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.|$|E
30|$|Before {{analysing}} the data, we hypothesised {{that the}} majority of the <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> show that navigated HTO would provide more accurate correction in comparison to conventional techniques.|$|R
50|$|Armenian <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> {{start to}} develop in France after the {{creation}} of the Armenian department of the School of Oriental languages with the initiative of Napoleon I.|$|R
50|$|The project contemplates four {{baseline}} studies: {{the basic}} engineering design, the market study, the strategic {{study and the}} environmental study. The four <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be complete by 31 December 2014.|$|R
25|$|On 16 January 2007 the Regional Development Minister David Cairns {{announced}} that a feasibility <b>study</b> <b>would</b> be launched into {{the construction of a}} rapid transit route linking Holywood Exchange to Belfast city centre. The route would also serve the airport and the Titanic Quarter development.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January 2010 it was {{announced}} that the parliamentary committee, having concluded its <b>study,</b> <b>would</b> recommend that a ban on veils covering the face in public locations such as hospitals and schools be enacted, but not in private buildings or on the street.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, San Francisco voters soundly {{rejected}} Proposition F, {{which would}} have required the City to conduct an $8 million study on how the flooded valley could be drained and restored to its former state. The proposed <b>study</b> <b>would</b> also have been required to identify potential replacements for the water storage capacity and hydroelectric power production.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have also}} been done to {{determine}} the efficacy of OIT for multiple allergens simultaneously. One study concluded that multi-OIT would be possible and relatively, though larger <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be necessary.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{exploring}} {{efficacy of}} stronger magnetic fields, non-contrast or low dosage, and diagnostic test accuracy <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> aide in clinical decision making. Continuing follow-up and research {{will be needed}} on low-risk formulations in the long term.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{have found}} no {{reliable}} evidence that open marriage has either increased or decreased substantially {{over the last two}} generations. Further <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be needed to assess increases or decreases in the incidence of open marriages.|$|R
25|$|Correlational methods {{examine the}} {{statistical}} association between two naturally occurring variables. For example, one could correlate {{the amount of}} violent television children watch {{at home with the}} number of violent incidents the children participate in at school. Note that this <b>study</b> <b>would</b> not prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: {{it is quite possible that}} aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.|$|E
25|$|Further <b>study</b> <b>would</b> {{be needed}} to {{establish}} its relationship to other conifers. The initial suspicion was that it had certain characteristics of the 200-million-year-old family Araucariaceae, but was not similar to any living species in the family. Comparison with living and fossilised Araucariaceae proved {{that it was a}} member of that family, and it has been placed into a new genus with Agathis and Araucaria.|$|E
25|$|If by {{one hand}} {{rehabilitation}} through gaming {{may be beneficial}} since it can improve motivation to the rehabilitation and reduce distraction from the routine of a tedious medical treatment, injuries arisen from excessive gameplay have been occasionally reported, such as tendonitis, dislocation of patella or hand laceration. Although these injuries might be occasional or rare, a large scale <b>study</b> <b>would</b> be needed to investigate the occurrence of these damages facing the millions of users of games worldwide.|$|E
30|$|It is {{worthwhile}} {{to mention that}} because the current research {{is based on a}} number of specimens, a numerical analysis and more empirical <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be useful to have a better validation of the proposed ANN models.|$|R
30|$|Large {{epidemiological}} studies {{in this population}} are scarce. Prospective, multicenter <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> lead {{to a better understanding}} of this population’s specificities and optimize the admission strategies as well as the management of these children in the PICU.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, Iceland {{proposed}} to resume research whaling after a 14-year interruption. The proposed quota {{would consist of}} 100 minke whales, and 100 fin and 50 sei whales (both endangered species). The <b>study</b> <b>would</b> examine the eating habits of whales in Icelandic waters. The Federation of Icelandic Fishing Vessel Owners claimed whales had reduced local cod stocks by 10–20 percent. However, environmental groups disputed the figures and asserted that fish stocks had actually been reduced by commercial overfishing.|$|E
25|$|Some contended {{the program}} placed undue {{emphasis}} on assumed {{negative effects of}} cetacean predation on fishery resources while failing to address the effects of fisheries on cetaceans. However, others believed determining the effects of cetaceans on fish stocks and more information on minke stock structure to be critically important. Some stated the feasibility <b>study</b> <b>would</b> provide valuable information on methodology {{and other aspects of}} the program would improve over time and contribute to fundamental questions. The committee identified that the pollution objective did not contribute to the goals of the IWC Pollution 2000+ project but remained relevant to the IWC for long term study.|$|E
25|$|Bede seldom {{mentions}} Chad without {{referring to}} his regime of prayer and study, so these clearly made up {{the greater part of}} monastic routine at Lastingham. <b>Study</b> <b>would</b> have been collective, with monks carrying out exegesis through dialectic. Yet not all of the monks were intellectuals. Bede tells us of a man called Owin (Owen), who appeared at the door of Lastingham. Owin was a household official of Æthelthryth, an East Anglian princess who had come to marry Ecgfrith, Oswiu's younger son. He decided to renounce the world, and as a sign of this appeared at Lastingham in ragged clothes and carrying an axe. He had come primarily to work manually. He became one of Chad's closest associates.|$|E
30|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was planned}} {{only if there}} were at least two studies of low or unclear risk of bias, reporting similar comparisons, and similar outcomes at similar time points. Otherwise, qualitative synthesis of the included <b>studies</b> <b>would</b> be performed.|$|R
