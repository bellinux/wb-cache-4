5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
25|$|Kupcinet {{apparently}} {{went straight}} home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including The Danny Kaye Show, with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> {{sitting next to}} them on the couch. She awoke and went to her room. The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{has said}} of her musically {{oriented}} family: [...] "there were so many records, so much music constantly being played. My mother played piano, my father sang, and we were always surrounded in music." [...] Her father sang in local nightclubs and at weddings. While growing up, Hill frequently listened to Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and Gladys Knight; years later she recalled playing Marvin Gaye's What's Going On repeatedly until <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> to it.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke {{described}} as [...] "a stout old woman", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in {{the house at the}} time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a [...] "cinder gatherer" [...] who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.|$|E
500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, [...] "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to be asleep. These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E
500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors and wanted to know how the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return every once in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|E

Just before <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> she said, 'Do you think Mr. and Mrs. Sanborn will be pleased that the wonderful child has his rights?' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Louis IX was ransomed for 400,000 dinars. After {{he pledged}} {{not to return}} to Egypt again and {{surrendered}} Damietta to the Egyptians, {{he was allowed to}} leave on May 8, 1250, to Acre with his brothers and 12,000 war prisoners, including some from older battles, whom the Egyptians agreed to release. Many other prisoners were executed. Louis's queen, Marguerite de Provence, suffered from nightmares. [...] The news (the capture of her husband Louis) terrified her so much, that every time <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> she fancied that her room was filled with Saracens, and she would cry out, [...] "Help! help!" [...] and left for Acre a few days earlier with her son, born in Damietta, who was called Jean Tristan (John Sorrow).|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{formerly}} {{suffered from}} epilepsy; {{she was being}} hospitalised around once every 10 days in early 2014, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "When I have a fit at night, my arms come out. They dislocate. So I {{have to go into}} hospital to have them relocated. That's happened 26 times in the last nine months". The seizures could occur up to ten times at night, according to Sathnam Sanghera who interviewed her for The Times in mid-2015. They began in her late teens whenever <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> and did not respond to prescribed drugs, she said in 2017. In a piece for The Sun, published the following August, she announced she was considering surgery to help prevent seizures. In mid-November 2015, her condition led her to fall to the ground in the street, injuring her face, and for an ambulance to be called.|$|E

2500|$|... “The {{first time}} this thing ever got hit was when a young lady was driving home from the library at the University of Texas,” Sicking explains. “She was driving a small pickup truck with her cruise control set at highway speeds when <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> and drifted off the road. She hit the {{guardrail}} at 65 or 70 miles per hour, and her only injury was a bruise across her chest caused by the seat belt. I got a very nice letter from her father describing the crash. He felt that she almost certainly would have been killed if she had hit {{one of the other}} common guardrail systems, and there is a high probability that he was right. But to hear that from a father whose daughter walked away unhurt—you live for moments like that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first single}} was {{completed}} in autumn 2000, entitled [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] (later released in English as [...] "All the Things She Said"). It was not physically and formally released until December 2000. The song describes the turmoil in a girl's soul because she {{is in love with}} another girl, but is afraid, as society frowns upon this. She asks her parents for forgiveness. Elena Kiper has been credited with the song, explaining that the idea came to her when <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at her dentist's office and had a dream in which she kissed another woman. She woke up saying out loud, [...] "Я сошла с ума!" [...] (Ya soshla s uma, meaning [...] "I've lost my mind"). Ivan Shapovalov is said to have added the second phrase of the chorus, [...] "Мне нужна она" [...] (Mne nuzhna ona, meaning [...] "I need her").|$|E
2500|$|Silkwood {{said she}} had {{assembled}} documentation for her claims, including company papers. She decided {{to go public with}} this evidence, and contacted David Burnham, a New York Times journalist, who was interested in her story. On November 13, 1974, Silkwood left a union meeting at the Hub Cafe in Crescent. Another attendee of that meeting later testified that Silkwood had a binder and a packet of documents with her at the cafe. Silkwood got into her car and headed alone for Oklahoma City, about [...] away, to meet with Burnham, the New York Times reporter, and Steve Wodka, an official of her union's national office. Later that evening, Silkwood's body was found in her car, which had run off the road and struck a culvert {{on the east side of}} route 74, 0.11 miles (180 m) south of the intersection with West Industrial Road (35.855233°-97.584963°). The car contained none of the documents she held in the union meeting at the Hub cafe. [...] She was pronounced dead at the scene in what was believed to be an accident. The trooper at the scene remembers that he found one or two tablets of the sedative methaqualone (Quaalude) in the car, and he remembers finding marijuana. The police report indicated that <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel. The coroner found 0.35 milligrams of methaqualone per 100 milliliters of blood at the time of her death— an amount almost twice the recommended dosage for inducing drowsiness.|$|E
