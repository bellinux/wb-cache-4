40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1989 As {{the role}} of the {{polymeric}} materials in industry broadens, it becomes increasingly important to provide rapid quality evaluation of these materials. Existing quality evaluation methods, such as physical testing, FT-IR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and X-ray scattering, cannot be used for rapid quality evaluation, because they require substantial sample preparation and long analysis times, and are usually destructive. In contrast, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy requires minimal sample preparation and is not destructive. Therefore, NIR spectroscopy can be used for rapid analysis of polymers, if it is periodically calibrated with a reference analytical method. The success of NIR methods depends on the ability of NIR spectroscopy to determine important compositional and structural properties of polymers. Earlier NIR analyses have demonstrated successful determinations of a few properties, but these studies were very limited in scope, and did not utilize newly-developed NIR instrumentation and multivariate calibration techniques. In this work, the ability of NIR spectroscopy to determine several important compositional and structural properties of polymers is demonstrated, with the aid of multivariate calibration methods. Results indicate that NIR spectroscopy can determine composition in <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>copolymers,</b> Reaction Injection Molded (RIM) polyurethanes, polyurethane foams, and EPDM terpolymers, microstructure of poly(butadiene) and <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>copolymers,</b> crystallinity in poly(ethylene terephthalate) and Ethylene-Propylene-Diene (EPDM) terpolymers, phase separation in RIM polyurethanes, and adsorption of poly(octadecyl methacrylate) to alumina.

50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>copolymers</b> allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution.

Comparable results were obtained for dynamic mechanical measurements employing different test geometries; that is, the effect is independent of {{the direction of the}} strain relative to the orientation of the double network. These results indicate that deformation during the imposition of a second network disrupts the carbon black agglomer-ates, and this deflocculated structure is stabilized by the second crosslinking.

40|$|The {{first order}} {{approximation}} {{of the theory}} of the so-called simple material describes the viscoelastic behavior of soft polymers in large deformations with twelve time-dependent material functions and three material constants, all functions of the three invariants of the deformation tensor. Restricting consideration to deformations in which time shift invariance is preserved, a series of models was developed which describe the time dependence of the stress through the Boltzmann superposition integral incorporating into it a suitable nonlinear measure of strain. The theory was developed in its most general three-dimensional form. Its predictions for homogeneous deformations were tested in a series of experiments on an uncrosslinked <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>copolymer.</b> For the prediction of the viscoelastic behavior of soft polymers the simplest form of the theory requires only one time function, the relaxation modulus. In addition, it requires a strain parameter which is a characteristic material constant. The dependence of this parameter on temperature and other material and experimental variables was examined on hand of estimates from published data {{as well as from the}} experimental results reported here. Sensitive tests in which small (theoretically infinitesimal) deformations were superposed on a finite stretch, allowed a distinction to be made between the two simplest forms of the theory which, in principle, should apply to solidlike and to liquidlike behavior, respectively. Although uncrosslinked <b>styrene-butadiene</b> <b>copolymer</b> behaves in many respects like a liquid, it showed unprecedented excellent agreement with the predictions of the solid model at room temperature. It was concluded that under this condition the liquidlike character of the copolymer is not strong enough to satisfy the special requirements of the liquid model. The new theory allows specific predictions to be made concerning the contribution of internal energy to the restoring force in rubberlike materials. It represents an advance over former theories in that it permits the contribution to be obtained on uncrosslinked as well as on crosslinked soft polymers.

For high-impact polystyrene and blends of SBR and BR a separation according to chemical composition must be conducted. Using selective chromatographic techniques, fractions of copolymer and homopolymer can be obtained and analyzed separately. The determination of the chemical heterogeneity of styrene-ethyl acrylate copolymers is important for materials using in the coatings industry. Phase compatibilizers based on <b>styrene-butadiene</b> block <b>copolymers</b> can be prepared by grafting reactions. In the grafting reaction a complex product mixture is obtained which must be analyzed by high-performance techniques.

The excellent quality of the resulting spectra which compare to off-line transmission spectra enables a simple qualitative and quantitative analysis. The thesis demonstrates that the combination of powerful chromatographic techniques (liquid chromatography at critical conditions, gradient HPLC and 2 D chromatography) and FTIR spectroscopy is a perfect tool for the analysis of complex polymer systems. The application of such method combinations is of great practical relevance for product development and optimization as well as quality control.
