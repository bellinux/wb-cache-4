40|$|Dynamic sealing systems, such as {{mechanical}} face <b>seals</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> {{in internal}} combustion engines are critical components of modern machines. These sealing systems present a unique challenge in controlling the lubricant supply and {{flow in the}} contact areas {{in order to minimize}} leakage, friction, and wear. Due to the sealing requirement, the minimum oil film thickness is in the order of surface roughness, which is one critical design parameter for the sealing systems. On the other hand, the wavelength of the surface geometrical features ranges from the size of the asperities of the surface roughness, which is in the order of a few microns {{to the size of the}} sealing components, which is in the order of millimeters to hundreds of millimeters. It is helpful for engineers to have a good understanding of lubricant transport across a large range of length scales. The aim of this thesis is to establish efficient and robust hydrodynamic lubrication models that are able to handle arbitrary complex geometries, flexible boundary conditions, and penetration of foreign gases. In this thesis, first a general oil transport model was developed. The model considers the variation of oil volume occupation fraction and establishes the dynamic mass flow balance in all locations. Instead of using inefficient small relaxation coefficients to assure convergence, we adjust the local linearization scheme according to local full film or partial film status. The model also applies quick contour detection algorithm to avoid the problems caused by equation's singularity around contact points and slow convergence caused by complex contact patterns. Furthermore, the models can be easily adapted to different scales. With the strong link between the numerical scheme and critical physical processes, the model eases the analysis of complicated results. This model has served as fundamental block of applications that predict and optimize the performance of metal face <b>seals</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> pack liner system. Based on the success of single specie two phase oil transport model, a new multi phase oil transport model have been developed with reasonable assumptions about oil/gas mixture coexistence pattern and oil contact pattern. This multi phase model expands our analytical capability to some important but formerly not reachable areas like the starving oil supply boundary condition, pressurized gas boundary condition and the influence of gas penetration to oil film between mechanical components. Some preliminary investigations about the influence of gas penetration to the lubrication of the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> in internal combustion engines has been carried out. The results demonstrate that this model is able to preserve the oil mass conservation while capturing the gas penetration, gas pressure variation, and its interaction with the liquid oil. Furthermore, the results show that the liner finish effects becomes more and more prominent when the ring face profile becomes flatter and flatter with either fully-flooded or starved oil supply boundary condition. by Yong Li.

40|$|Advances {{in modern}} engine {{development}} {{are becoming more}} and more challenging. The intense increase of thermal and mechanical loads as a result of higher power density requires perfecting the function of all engine components especially with regard to emission and friction reduction. In particular, <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> pack represent one of the most important cause of mechanical friction loss in internal combustion engine [1], and inadequate ring-liner lubrication leads to high fuel/oil consumption and increased engine emissions with dramatic impact over the entire system efficiency. A desirable piston ring-pack set has to provide efficient sealing performance with both the cylinder wall in a radial direction and the top or bottom sides of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> housing in an axial direction, leading to minimal gas blow-by, oil consumption and friction loss. Moreover <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> other requirement are low friction, low wear and good resistance against mechanical/thermal fatigue. This is a challenging task due to the nature of the phenomena and interactions associated with <b>piston</b> <b>rings.</b> For example, increasing the installed ring tension, which is a method to control oil consumption, also tends to increase ring friction. Hence, any attempt to optimize ring-pack performance output parameters requires a good understanding of the dynamics of all the involved components. Different key elements have to be considered: the ring shape in its free state (namely free shape), the ring crossing-section geometry and the contact surface profile, which play important roles in determining the ring behavior. In order to achieve <b>sealing,</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> are first held against the cylinder liner in its front face by their tension after being installed into the cylinder bore. The contact pressure on the cylinder wall is achieved by the inherent spring force of the ring in conjunction with the gas pressure behind the ring. During different engine operating conditions, the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> experience dynamically changing forces and axial as well as radial movements of the rings can occur. The contact on the side of the piston housing is achieved by the axial forces acting on the ring. The axial forces are composed of the gas pressure above and under the ring, the mass forces (inertia), and the friction forces. These forces change their direction during the cycle, and, as a result, the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> moves from one side of the groove to the other during the engine cycle. This is known as ring fluttering when the axial movement becomes excessive. This behavior open an additional gas flow path: gas can flow around the inner diameter of the ring which results in very high engine blow-by loss. In addition the ring pack design should also consider other factors, including gas blowback and, as said before, ring pack friction. The blowback is the reverse process of blowby and is highly related to engine emission and oil consumption while ring friction can cause severe ring and cylinder wall wear, which results in the ring losing its sealing capability. These factors are related to the ring circumferential pressure distribution, which is defined by the ring free shape and the ring cross section geometry. The understanding of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> behavior is an hard challenge for automotive engineer. Firstly, in 1936 Castleman [2] investigated and proposed the concept of hydrodynamic lubrication for the <b>piston</b> <b>ring.</b> Thereafter, more and more research has been done in this field. Dowson et al. [3] predicted the behavior of a <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> using the EHL theory. Sun [4] conducted his study for ring-bore conformability, in which the ring was modeled as a curved beam under in-plane loads. Liu and Tian [5, 6] developed an FEA tool for <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> design. Ejakov et al. [7] modeled ring twist behavior predicting ring axial, radial displacements, bending and twisting angles along the ring periphery over an engine cycle. In this contributions a complete 3 D model of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> is proposed, and the influence of an important parameter like the twist angle of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> section on both ring-liner and ring-piston groove interaction is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{of more than}} 20 % can be achieved through engine friction reduction. <b>Piston</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> contribute {{approximately half of the}} total engine friction and are therefore central to friction reduction efforts. The most common method to reduce mechanical losses from <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> has been to lower ring tension, the normal force providing <b>sealing</b> between the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> and the cylinder liner. However tension reduction can result in additional lubricant consumption. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the physical mechanisms resulting in flow of oil to the combustion chamber in order to achieve optimal designs of <b>piston</b> <b>rings.</b> The optimal design is a compromise between friction reduction and adequate gas and lubricant sealing performance. To do so a multi-scale curved beam finite element model of <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> is developed. It is built to couple ring deformation, dynamics and contact with the piston and the cylinder. Oil flow at the interfaces between the ring and the cylinder liner and between the <b>ring</b> and the <b>piston</b> groove can thus be simulated. The <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> model is used to study the sealing performance of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), whose function is to limit the amount of oil supplied to the ring pack. The contributions of the three main mechanisms previously identified, to oil flow past the OCR are quantified: - Deformation of the cylinder under operating conditions can lead to a loss of contact between the ring and the liner. - Tilting of the piston around its pin can force the OCR to twist and scrape oil from the liner. - Oil accumulating below the OCR can flow to the groove and leak {{on the top of the}} OCR The OCR is found to be flexible enough to limit the impact of cylinder deformation on oil consumption. Both ring scraping and flow through the OCR groove can contribute to oil consumption in the range of engine running conditions simulated. Reduction of scraping is possible by increasing the ability of both OCR lands to maintain contact with the liner regardless of piston groove tilt. The flow of oil through the OCR groove can be reduced by designing appropriate draining of oil in the groove and an adequate oil reservoir below the OCR. The <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> oil transport model developed in this thesis will be a valuable tool to optimize ring pack designs to achieve further ring pack friction reduction without increasing oil consumption. by Camille Baelden.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{analyzes}} the numerical model of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) of <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> in the cylinder liner {{of the internal}} combustion engine (ICE). Authors take into account reactions of the lubricating layer, the pressure force of the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> on the cylinder wall, forces of the gas pressure in the cylinder, the friction force between the upper edge of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> and the <b>piston</b> groove. A simulation model was developed in the Fortran program and authors have analyzed characteristics and forms of <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> in the ICE...|$|R
