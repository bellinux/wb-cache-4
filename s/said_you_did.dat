6000|$|... "Mr. Clarke, you do {{not seem}} {{impressed}} with your importance," [...] said Colonel Zane. [...] "My sister <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not tell her what part you took in Isaac's rescue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you, sir," [...] Arnold answered, a little awkwardly. [...] "I shall {{bear in mind}} all that <b>you</b> have <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not object, I presume, to my dining with him to-night?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Document what <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> (Tell {{them that}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> {{in the first}} place) More is better {{as long as it}} makes sense.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} why I had called," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Aronson, in apparent astonishment. [...] "That is strange. Did not your father tell you about his investment in the Sharon Valley Land Company?" ...|$|E
60|$|I couldn't {{believe a}} word you <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{everything}} you shouldn't have done. The {{result was that}} the men mutinied, and if I hadn't {{come back in the}} nick of time they'd have killed you and looted all the stores.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, (said he) we {{will not}} dispute about HIS Beauty, but your opinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I {{understood}} you right, you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not find them so plain as you expected to do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can you prattle in that mischievous way--after what Lady Strickland <b>said,</b> too? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} what harm you may do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have put}} it exactly,' I <b>said.</b> 'If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not choose, <b>you</b> need have no {{communication}} whatever with persons ordering the work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say to him? <b>you</b> <b>said</b> something. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not, at any rate, bid him {{remember}} {{that he was a}} poor labouring man, and that you were a lady of high rank." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{aspect of}} the affair had not {{occurred}} to me. [...] "But {{you asked me to}} put my name to it," [...] I stammered. [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not want your own to appear--for private reasons. You made a point of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Aca. O, say no more, lest words less kind destroy What {{these have}} raised in me {{of peace and}} joy: You <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> both pity and forgive; You would do neither, should Acacis live. By death alone the certain way appears, Thus to hope mercy, and deserve your tears.|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE (still listening) [...] That dog of his, you are sure, [...] Could {{not come}} after us--he must have perished; [...] The torrent would have dashed an oak to splinters. [...] You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not like his looks--that he [...] Would trouble us; {{if he were}} here again, [...] I swear {{the sight of him}} would quail me more [...] Than twenty armies.|$|E
50|$|You're {{never too}} old, {{and if you}} want to, as my mother <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>you</b> want to, but you have to work at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say you are sorry <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> to me," [...] went on Dave, [...] "or {{into the}} river you go!" [...] And despite Poole's efforts, he dragged the aristocrat {{toward the edge of}} the dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{interrupted}} Dominick, [...] "have {{you tried}} to climb our signal-tree, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do,</b> to replace the flag that was blown away by last night's gale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a very ordinary, {{matter of}} fact Englishman," [...] he said, [...] "leading a very ordinary, {{matter of fact}} life, and you must forgive me if I {{consider}} such a sweeping condemnation a little extravagant and fantastic. I have no particular enemies on my conscience, I am implicated in no conspiracy, and I am, in short, an individual of very little importance. Consequently I {{have nothing to fear}} from anybody and am afraid of nobody. This man cannot have anything to gain by injuring me. I believe you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know the lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, then, you've {{fallen on}} your feet! Nofri {{said you were}} good-for-nothing vermin; but what then? An ass may bray a good while before he shakes the stars down. I always <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> well to run away, and it isn't often Bratti's in the wrong. Well, and so you've got a husband and plenty of money? Then you'll never think much of giving four white quattrini for a red cross. I get no profit; but what with the famine and the new religion, all other {{merchandise}} is gone down. You live {{in the country where}} the chestnuts are plenty, eh? You've never wanted for polenta, I can see." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{the kind}} of {{question}} the doctor hated. If you said a patient couldn't live another month the family prepared itself for a bereavement, and if then the patient lived on they visited the medical attendant with the resentment they felt at having tormented themselves before it was necessary. On the other hand, if you said the patient might live a year and he died in a week the family <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not know your business. They thought of all the affection they would have lavished on the defunct if they had known the end was so near. Dr. Wigram made the gesture of washing his hands.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a line}} artificially {{drawn by}} the infidel in between us—saying you are from Kazakhstan, Turkistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan—there is a line drawn artificially by the infidel, my {{brothers}} [...] [...] [...] The religion never came only to Kazakhs, it did not come only to Uighurs, {{and it did not}} come only to Arabs [...] [...] [...] Do not separate. Allah <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not separate to say that 'you are Kazakhstan, you are Turkistan and you are Uzbekistan.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! how {{wonderful}} {{you were in}} that act, Joe.' Aunt Julia sighed. 'Do you remember the back-fall <b>you</b> used to <b>do</b> down the steps? I always have <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the best back-fall in the profession.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You thought I {{was young}} and innocent, but I absorbed every word <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> But <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not notice, for like you, I was good at pretending…it was you who taught me to be that way!" [...] (Yi Jing to the principal) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you told me. You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not trust me. It doesn't matter. I am coming back whether you trust me or not. This house is under martial law, and I am in command. The {{situation}} has changed since I spoke to you last night. Last night I was ready to let you have your way. I intended {{to keep an eye}} on things from the inn. But it's different now. It is not a case of Sam Fisher any longer. You could have managed Sam. It's Buck MacGinnis now, the man who came that night in the automobile. I saw him in the village after I left you. He's dangerous.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} me; {{now you see}} how deceived you have been. A stern, resentful devil possessed me then, and I obeyed it. I was very proud; full of ambitious plans and jealous love for the few I took into my heart. Letty had brought a stain upon our honest name that time could never wash away; had {{quenched}} my hopes in despair and shame; had made home desolate, and destroyed my faith in every thing; for whom could I trust, when she, the nearest and dearest creature in the world, deceived and deserted me. I could not forgive; wrath burned hot within me, {{and the desire for}} retribution would not be appeased till those cruel words were said. The retribution and remorse came swift and sure; but they came most heavily to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'My lord, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over our trouble'--he was with us in Egypt--'I {{have been thinking}} {{so much that it}} has got a hold of my sleep. To-night as you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not want me any more and I was tired, I went to bed early and had a dream. I dreamed that we were once more in the shrubbery, as happened some years ago, and that the little African gent who shot like a book, was showing us the traces of those two black men, just as he did when they tried to steal her ladyship. Then in my dream I seemed to go back to bed and that beastly snake which we found lying under the parcel in the road seemed to follow me. When I had got to sleep again, all in the dream, there it was standing on its tail {{at the end of the}} bed, hissing till it woke me. Then it spoke in good English and not in African as might have been expected.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{had listened}} that night before <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> all {{might have been}} different," [...] she answered. [...] "But I'm {{so glad to see}} you, and hungry for news. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave mother, and the shop? I don't care to hear about the chapel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --That reminds me, Mr Deasy <b>said.</b> <b>You</b> can <b>do</b> me a favour, Mr Dedalus, {{with some}} of your {{literary}} friends. I have a letter here for the press. Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.|$|R
6000|$|... “Keola,” she <b>said,</b> “if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not eat, I {{tell you}} plainly {{you will be}} killed and cooked to-morrow. Some of the old chiefs are murmuring already. They think you are fallen sick and must lose flesh.” ...|$|R

6000|$|I'm afraid you'll be very unhappy. But you see, {{something}} more than your happiness is at stake. A little while ago <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wanted to <b>do</b> more for your country than <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Does</b> it strike <b>you</b> that <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> something for it now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go {{home in a}} taxi," [...] she agreed, [...] "if <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> {{one thing}} for me. It won't take long. It has been in my mind ever since <b>you</b> <b>said</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> about charity. I want us all {{to go down to}} the Embankment. It isn't late enough really, but I want you to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Florence, [...] "do not {{shrink from}} doing what is safe, and necessary, and right for <b>you</b> to <b>do,</b> because <b>you</b> have once <b>said</b> <b>you</b> would not <b>do</b> it. <b>You</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
