25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry</b> reached out to Pickens and {{encouraged}} his support of energy/climate change legislation he was drafting with Senators Lieberman and Graham. During a May 2010 meeting with reporters, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry</b> endorsed key provisions of “the Pickens Plan,” incorporating aspects {{of that in the}} Kerry-backed legislation calling for the greater use of domestic natural gas to replace foreign oil‑diesel‑gasoline in America’s heavy‑duty vehicle fleets.|$|E

50|$|In 2003 and 2004, Devine {{served as}} a senior adviser and {{strategist}} to <b>Senator</b> John <b>Kerry's</b> campaign for President in both the primary and the general election. His elevation to a senior strategic role coincided with <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry's</b> turn around in late 2003, and Devine remained in a senior role throughout {{the remainder of the}} campaign. He frequently represented the campaign on national television programs such as Meet the Press, C-SPAN, Face the Nation and other broadcasts.|$|R
25|$|Polling {{after the}} Iowa Caucuses {{consistently}} showed Governor Dean behind <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry</b> {{by a wide}} margin in the run up to the New Hampshire Primary. A poll released from Franklin Pierce College showed Kerry leading by as much as 30%-16%. However, after a substantial effort by Dean on the campaign trail, the final poll conducted by Marist College showed Kerry leading 36%-27%.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by a Labor right-wing {{factional}} ally, <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry</b> Sibraa, to seek {{election for}} a role as a Labor Party branch organiser in 1971, Richardson was successful, left his university studies, and discovered the powerbrokers in the NSW Right. He apprenticed himself to learn from these men, {{some of the toughest}} in the Labor Party, and progressed to become Assistant Secretary of the New South Wales (NSW) Labor Party in 1976 and General Secretary a little later that year, aged 26 – the youngest ever person to hold that role. John Faulkner, of Labor's socialist left faction, was Richardson's Assistant Secretary and for eight months, so great was their mutual hatred, they did not exchange a word.|$|E
500|$|While {{control of}} the House of Representatives {{went over to the}} Republicans in the 112th Congress, the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain {{continued}} to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As the Arab Spring took center stage, McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power. McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi, the highest-ranking American to do so, and said that the rebel forces were [...] "my heroes". In June, he joined with <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry</b> in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention, and said: [...] "The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive." [...] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis. In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system; following objections by civil libertarians, some Democrats, and the White House, McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens.|$|E

5000|$|Our {{examination}} {{found that}} existing documentation regarding the Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals indicates the awards approval process was properly followed. In particular, the senior officers who awarded the medals were properly delegated {{authority to do}} so. In addition, we found that they correctly followed the procedures {{in place at the}} time for approving these awards. Conducting any additional review regarding events that took place over 30 years ago would not be productive. The passage of time would make reconstruction of the facts and circumstances unreliable, and would not allow the information gathered to be considered {{in the context of the}} time in which the events took place. Our review also considered the fact that <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry's</b> post-active duty activities were public and that military and civilian officials were aware of his actions at the time. For these reasons, I have determined that <b>Senator</b> <b>Kerry's</b> awards were properly approved and will take no further action in this matter.|$|R
