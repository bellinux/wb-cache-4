40|$|Exchanges {{of water}} south of Africa between the South Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean are an {{important}} component of the global thermohaline circulation. Evidence exists that the variability in these exchanges, on both meso- and longer time scales, may significantly influence weather and climate patterns in the southern African region and the significance of these regional ocean–atmosphere interactions is discussed. Observations of the inter-ocean exchange are limited and it is necessary to augment these with estimates derived from models. As a first step in this direction, this study uses an eddy-permitting model to investigate the heat and volume transport in the oceanic region south of Africa and its variability on meso, seasonal and inter-annual time scales. On the annual mean, about Full-size image (< 1 K) (<b>standard</b> deviation <b>Full-size</b> image (< 1 K)) of heat flows west into the South Atlantic across 20 °E (longitude of Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa), with just over Full-size image (< 1 K) (<b>standard</b> deviation <b>Full-size</b> image (< 1 K)) flowing north into the South Atlantic across 35 °S. The seasonal variations in this transport are about 10 % at 35 °S in the South Atlantic and around 20 % through 20 °E; the model value of Full-size image (< 1 K) for summer (standard deviation ranging from Full-size image (< 1 K) in January to Full-size image (< 1 K) in March) appears consistent with respective estimates of 0. 51 and Full-size image (< 1 K) derived from two WOCE summer cruises southwest of Cape Town to 45 °S in 1990 and 1993. Volume transports of the Agulhas Current section through 35 °S in the SW Indian Ocean range from 58 to Full-size image (< 1 K) in summer/autumn to 64 –Full-size image (< 1 K) in winter/spring. The model results suggest that the inter-ocean exchange south of Africa is highly variable on seasonal through to interannual scales. If this variability is also the case in the real ocean (and the limited observations suggest that this is so), then there are likely to be significant implications for climate...|$|R

The Corvair, Chevrolet's rear-engined compact car, was originally brought to market to compete directly with the VW Beetle.

We report our experience of downsized pediatric lung transplantation in comparison with <b>standard</b> <b>full-size</b> pediatric lung transplantation over one decade. Pediatric recipients undergoing downsized or standard lung transplantation were included (January 1997 -December 2006).

Five patients underwent <b>standard</b> <b>full-size</b> lung transplantation; five had downsized lung transplants. "Downsized" recipients had significantly lower median height and weight Z-scores.

40|$|For many years, tool {{manufacturers}} have proposed disposable micro-knives {{as a solution}} to both the vulnerability and the frequent maintenance problems of <b>standard</b> <b>full-size</b> knives. The study compared disposable micro-knives and standard full size-knives for replacement time and management costs. It also quantified the cost of severe damage caused to conventional knife set-ups, following accidental introduction of metal contaminants inside the chipper. In this case, damage can amount to over 30, 000 €. Adoption of disposable micro-knives may avoid such severe damage and mitigate its consequences. The simpler replacement procedure also allows a 15 % reduction of knife replacement time, compared with the standard knife option. On the other hand, these same benefits are also obtained with other measures, such as the adoption of a swing-away counter-knife and the use of a pneumatic wrench for knife replacement. However, disposable micro-knives do offer a significant reduction of knife-related cost, due to an extended sharpness retention. Savings may amount to 30 % of the knife-related cost of a conventional knife set, or about 18 Euro cents per tonne. Further studies should investigate the reasons for the better performance of micro-knives, with a view in improving the durability of both knife types...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that using halved silicon wafer solar cells in a photovoltaic (PV) module is {{an efficient way to}} reduce cell-to-module resistive losses. In this work we have shown that PV modules using halved cells additionally show an improvement in their optical performance, resulting in a higher current generation. We attribute this increase in current to gains in light reflected from the backsheet area. An optical model is presented that quantitatively determines the influence of the backsheet on the short-circuit current of a PV module. We find that, for an accurate prediction, several factors have to be taken into account, including the geometry of the module, the backscattering properties of the backsheet and the illumination spectrum. Particularly the angularly and spectrally resolved scattering properties of the backsheet are shown to have a large impact on the current generation. Furthermore, light beam induced current (LBIC) measurements are used to test the backscattering properties of the backsheet and also the influence of the illumination spectrum. LBIC measurements are also used to verify the simulation results, giving good agreement. Thus the design of a PV module can be optimized by simulation. A <b>standard</b> <b>full-size</b> cell module and a halved-cell module with optimized cell spacing are fabricated.

40|$|The LHCb sub-detector {{electronics}} {{are organized}} around the detector in chassis or on individual boards, which requires configuration access to load or read different types of information. The experiment requires a configuration bus, capable to communicate properly on a copper line for a distance of over 100 meters, with a unique master, located {{in the control room}} which is not exposed to radiation, and up to 32 slaves implemented close to the detector electronics boards, working in a radiation sensitive environment. A complete Serial Protocol for Experiment Configuration System (SPECS) system was developed in 2005 based on PCI boards and detector mezzanines. The protocol requires 4 differential copper links over a standard Ethernet CAT 6 cable using BLVDS technology with a transfer rate of 10 Mbit/s in each direction. For PC obsolescence reasons, a new SPECS-MASTER (SPECSPCIE) is developed for the upgrade, based on the XTCA <b>standard</b> (<b>full-size</b> double-width). The SPECSPCIE board can be housed in XTCA chassis or in individual boxes. For this configuration, a COMExpress module provides all the link interfaces: Ethernet, PCIexpress, and JTAG. The board's core is the new ARRIA V GX FPGA family which implemented hard PCIexpress IP and transceivers at 3. 125 Gbps which allow direct connections with the serial links: 1 Gb Ethernet and PCIexpress 4 X GEN 2. The board has been designed as aversatile system, it integrates 16 SPECS-MASTER with individual drivers with discrete pole zero compensation and per-emphasis to allow a transfer length of up to 120 m. It also include a mezzanine HSMC connector for future development. An 8 bits microcontroller manages the XTCA startup sequence and the communication with the chassis controller (MCH) using the IPMB bus, and also the programmable power supervisor by I 2 C bus. A clock generator and jitter cleaner chip is implemented onboard and allows wide clock frequencies (40 Khz to 1. 5 Ghz) with very low jitter performance (. 35 ps RMS). This last one is configured by a SPI bus which is controlled by an on-chip NIOS CPU. To allow complex systems with easy programming an embedded uLinux system is implemented. With this configuration, we manage the Ethernet TCP/IP protocol. CPU communication is performed via PCIexpress or Ethernet link. The FPGA configuration is achieved by serial EEPROM, and reconfiguration by JTAG or by CvP (PCIexpress capability). Software libraries are available to use the SPECS System. One low level library allows users to access the master registers and to prepare and send SPECS frames to communicate with the electronics using the different modes available (I 2 C, JTAG, DMA Bus, Parallel Bus).
