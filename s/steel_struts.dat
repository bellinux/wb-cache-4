5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular <b>steel</b> <b>struts</b> without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|The {{design for}} the {{renovation}} project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it. Unfortunately {{it was discovered that}} the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate {{design for the}} support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular <b>steel</b> <b>struts</b> passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. H shape <b>steel</b> <b>strut,</b> {{which is}} the most {{commonly}} used material in traditional braced wall system (TBWS), has some disadvantage such as narrow strut spacing and cost ineffectiveness. Therefore, a newly retaining wall system with pre-stressed (PS) wale and square pipe struts is developed for widening strut spacing and saving construction costs. In this study, three cases, which are changed from TBWS with H shape <b>steel</b> <b>strut</b> to retaining wall system with PS wale and square pipe struts, are compared construction costs and constructability. This results reveal that construction costs is decreased by 46. 9 % on average and constructability is improved by decreasing the amount of material and widening the strut spacing...|$|R

40|$|Under extreme loading {{conditions}} such as an earthquake event considerable amount of energy is imparted to a structure. To protect the structure and to minimize damages, a method is to divert {{a portion of the}} input energy into designated energy dissipating devices.

The device is composed of a short segment of a <b>steel</b> <b>strut</b> embedded inside a mortar filled jacket which makes the BRL 2 ̆ 7 s capacity governed by the squash load under axial tension or compression.

2500|$|The E.115 {{appeared}} in 1937 with significant {{changes to the}} wing. The span was only slightly reduced (by 200mm or 7.9in) but continuous taper reduced the area by 20%. The ailerons were fabric covered. It could be powered by either the Praga B or D and was noticeably faster than earlier variants, even with the smaller engine. The E.115 also had a revised undercarriage, with single, streamlined <b>steel</b> <b>struts</b> hinged to the lower fuselage braced by [...] rods to the centre section. The wheels were spatted and the legs sprung with bungee cord inside the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The quite thick (13.5%) wings were fabric {{covered over}} a metal frame. They were of {{constant}} chord out to gently curved tips, each carrying two ailerons. [...] The three 400hp (298kW) V-12 water-cooled Hispano Suiza 12 Jb engines were mounted close together {{on top of}} the wing and out of the spray in well-streamlined cowlings; those of the forward-facing outer engines slimmed finely to the trailing edge. [...] Each engine drove a two-bladed propeller. Flat radiators were placed {{on the underside of the}} upper wing, beneath each motor. The primary attachment of the wings was not to the fuselage but to the sponson tips, by two pairs of parallel <b>steel</b> <b>struts</b> to mid-wing. [...] On each side, another pair of struts went almost vertically from the sponson to the wing below the outer engine. [...] The outer engines were further supported by struts to the upper fuselage longerons, from which also a pair of inverted V struts supported the central engine.|$|E

In contrast, the east side of this wing is punctuated with window openings. The rear of the Park Row Building, where it faces Theatre Alley, is also punctuated with window openings, the lowest of which have metal shutters. Where this part of the building faces Ann Street to the south, it contains a blank wall devoid of windows, and an opening to a light court that is also spanned by eight <b>steel</b> <b>struts.</b> Visible on all parts of the red brick walls are traces of the cream-colored paint that had originally been applied to the brick to make it match the limestone facades of the building on Park Row and Ann Street.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study is}} made of the hysteretic behaviour of a simply supported prismatic <b>steel</b> <b>strut</b> subjected to cyclic loading. The analysis includes the effect of two types of imperfection, namely an initial out-of-straightness of the strut and an initial eccentricity of the applied axial loading. Basic equations are derived in a closed form through an elastic-perfectly plastic type of analysis in conformity with one-dimensional idealization of the strut. The analysis {{is based on the}} plastic hinge concept and takes into consideration the plastic flow theory in the vicinity of plastic hinges. The exact interaction curve of any type of cross-sectional shape is adequately approximated by a piecewise linear interpolation of the fully plastic states in pure bending and in pure tension and compression. Results are presented which illustrate the imperfection sensitivity of struts under cyclic inelastic loading. © 1987...|$|R

The engine was a modified Henderson motorcycle engine purchased for $325.|$|R
5000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{bridge on}} the trunk line is the viaduct in the Bielefeld suburb of Schildesche. The original viaduct was completed in 1847 was double track with 28 spans and in 1917 a largely identical viaduct was built next to it. During World War II it was badly damaged on 14 March 1945 by a Grand Slam bomb dropped by a No. 617 Squadron RAF Avro Lancaster. After the war, one line was reopened with a temporary <b>steel</b> <b>strut</b> for freight traffic, while passenger trains used a winding bypass built as a diversionary route prior to the bombing, known as the [...] "rubber railway”. In 1965 the viaduct was reopened, the two-track viaduct for the “passenger route” having been repaired with concrete spans replacing the destroyed masonry spans, and the other using a provisional steel-frame construction built from old Wehrmacht pioneer materials. In 1983, the “freight route” viaduct was fully repaired, featuring the same concrete architecture used for the passenger route’s bridge.|$|R

[...] The wings were built on two I-section spruce spars and fabric covered everywhere apart from at the leading edge, where thin aluminium was used. [...] Differential ailerons were fitted; initially the gap between aileron and wing was filled with narrow rubber flaps, but later they were removed as they added weight and made lateral control heavy.
