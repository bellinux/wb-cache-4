5|$|After {{the devastating}} raid of 6 July, the Germans held a {{high-level}} {{meeting on the}} site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be installed in a single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E
5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of British fears, the native infantry's long arms were modified by reaming out the rifling of the Pattern 1853 as a <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> bullet does not require greasing. This greatly reduced the gun's effectiveness, as did replacing the variable distance rear sight to a fixed sight. This became the Pattern 1858. However, due to the new thinner walls, the barrel would bulge and bursting was not an unknown problem. Furthermore, with the bayonet fitted excessive flexing became an issue. To remedy this, new barrels were made with thicker walls. This became the Pattern 1859.|$|E
25|$|The Desha County Artillery was {{assigned}} to Colonel Emmett MacDonald's brigade of Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke's division of Major General Thomas C. Hindman's 1st Corps, Army of the Trans-Mississippi during the Prairie Grove Campaign. At that time the battery consisted of sixty one men, one 6 pound <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> cannon, two 12 pound field howitzers. The unit did not join Marmaduke's force until after the Battle of Cane Hill on November 28, 1862. According to Captain West's report on the Battle of Prairie Grove, December 7, 1862, Brigadier General Marmaduke ordered the battery to support Brigadier General Fagan's brigade of Shoup's Division. The battery fired in support of Shoup’s Division until driven off by the rifled guns of the union artillery. The battery then supported Brigadier General Roan's brigade until nightfall ended the battle.|$|E
25|$|When the Trans-Mississippi Army {{surrendered}} in May 1865, McNally's Battery, {{along with}} most other units, simply disbanded and never formally surrendered. The battery was officially surrendered by General E. Kirby Smith with the Trans-Mississippi Department on May 26, 1865. The date of the military convention between Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith and Union General Edward Canby for the surrender of the troops and public property in the Trans-Mississippi Department was May 26, 1865, however, it took awhile for parole commissioners to be appointed and for public property to be accounted for. As a result, a final report of field artillery {{which was part of}} the accounting process, was not completed until June 1, 1865. The final report lists McNally's Battery with four, six pounder <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> cannon being turned in at Shreveport, Louisiana. Captain McNally was paroled at Shreveport, Louisiana, on June 10, 1865.|$|E
50|$|Alabama {{was fitted}} with eight pieces of {{ordnance}} after {{she arrived at}} the Azores; six of those were 32-pounder <b>smooth</b> <b>bores.</b> Seven cannon were identified at the wreck site: Two were cast from a British Royal Navy pattern and three were of a later pattern produced by Fawcett, Preston, and Company in Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1850s, the {{development}} of rifled cannon had rendered the fort's <b>smooth</b> <b>bored</b> muzzle loading ordnance obsolete. In late 1858 the fort was transferred from the War Department to the Board of Admiralty and, in 1859 it became {{the headquarters of the}} Royal Marine Artillery. Between 1860 and 1861, the defences were improved to accommodate new muzzle loaded Armstrong guns.|$|R
50|$|Most English pistols had <b>smooth</b> <b>bores,</b> {{though some}} had scratch rifling, a subtle form of rifling which was {{difficult}} to see with the naked eye. Pistols with rifled barrel spin-stabilise the shot when it is fired, resulting in much improved accuracy. As a result, duelling pistols with rifled barrels were considered unsporting by many, {{although there was no}} unfairness so long as the pistols were identical.|$|R
25|$|Because {{there was}} no {{immediate}} use for her, she was placed in ordinary and moored in the River Medway. Internal fitting out continued in a somewhat desultory manner over the next four years, and sea trials were completed in 1769, after which she was returned to her Medway berth. She remained there until France joined the American War of Independence in 1778. Victory was now placed in active service as part of a general mobilisation against the French threat. This included arming her with a full complement of <b>smooth</b> <b>bore,</b> cast iron cannon. Her weaponry was intended to be thirty 42-pounders (19kg) on her lower deck, twenty-eight 24-pounders (11kg) on her middle deck, and thirty 12-pounders (5kg) on her upper deck, together with twelve 6-pounders on her quarterdeck and forecastle. In May 1778, the 42-pounders were replaced by 32-pounders (15kg), but the 42-pounders were reinstated in April 1779; however there were insufficient 42-pounders available and these were replaced with 32-pounder cannons instead.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been completely}} abandoned, {{one of the most}} violent conflicts between British forces and Australian Aborigines is alleged to have occurred. The facts of this event are still disputed by historians and the descendants of the Tasmanian Aborigines, however, it is alleged that on the morning of 3 May 1804, a food hunting party of approximately three hundred crested the heavily wooded hills above the Risdon Cove settlement, looking for kangaroo, in what is now considered {{to be part of the}} Oyster Bay tribe's traditional hunting grounds. It is supposed that both the Marine sentries, and the hunting party surprised each other. It is not clear how the engagement began, with differing accounts being given. It does seem that, feeling threatened by such an overwhelmingly large group, the Marines fired upon the Aborigines in an unprovoked attack. A convict by the name of Edward White claimed to have seen this. Armed with only spears and clubs, the Aboriginals were outdone by the firepower of the Marines who were armed with the Brown Bess <b>smooth</b> <b>bore,</b> muzzle loading musket, many of whom were experienced troops from conflicts in India and the Americas. It is claimed that between three and fifty of the Aboriginals were killed.|$|E

50|$|Shotguns are {{normally}} civilian weapons used primarily for hunting. These weapons are typically <b>smooth</b> <b>bored</b> and fire a shell containing small lead or steel balls. Variations use rifled barrels or fire other projectiles including solid lead slugs, a Taser XREP projectile capable of stunning a target, or other payloads. In military versions, these weapons {{are often used}} to burst door hinges or locks in addition to antipersonnel uses.|$|R

The two then started experimenting with pointed elongated lead-coated projectiles fired from rifled, breech loading, guns of Wahrendorff's design. In 1854 the Swedish Army adopted three different types of <b>smooth</b> <b>bored</b> breech loaded Wahrendorff guns, in calibers from 155 to 226 mm.|$|R

2500|$|LeMat {{originally}} chambered {{his pistol}} for [...]40 (or [...]42) caliber revolver bullets, with a [...]60 (20 gauge) smooth-bore barrel, {{and had a}} jointed ramrod (mounted {{on the right-hand side}} of the frame), which was used to load both barrels. [...] Later, during the American Civil War, a lighter [...]35-caliber pistol with a [...]55 caliber (28-gauge) <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> barrel was produced, but as these were non-standard ammunition sizes (.36 or [...]44 caliber were most common for contemporary revolvers) LeMat owners had to cast their own bullets (as opposed to being issued them from general military stores). [...] The final models of the LeMat were produced in [...]36 or [...]44 caliber in response to these criticisms, but too few of them managed to get past the Union blockade of the South during the Civil War to be of any real use.|$|E

2500|$|During the Battle of Shiloh, General Hardee nicknamed {{this unit}} [...] "The Bloody Seventh." [...] The 7th Arkansas had been formed with 905 {{officers}} and men, {{but after the}} conflict at Shiloh there were only 380 present. Colonel Shaver was assigned to command a brigade, which consisted of the 2nd, 6th and 7th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. [...] Shaver's Brigade struck the first blow in the battle before sunrise on April 6, 1862. [...] The Arkansas troops initially rushed into a Union camp of two German regiments from St. Louis, MO, and regiments from Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois—all commanded by Colonel Peabody. [...] When the pickets' fire was heard in the Union encampment, Colonel Peabody's men took up defensive positions {{on the edge of}} their camp and laid down heavy fire. [...] Shaver's Brigade rushed them with a wild Rebel yell. [...] The Uionn troops stood their ground until the Arkansas soldiers were within 30 feet of them and then they broke and fled. [...] The Shaver's men pushed in amongst the retreating Union soldiers and a fierce hand-to-hand melee followed. [...] More than Union troops were bayoneted, including Colonel Peabody. [...] Shaver's Brigade had rushed forward so fast that General Hardee halted them at that point until the line of battle could catch up. [...] The 7th Arkansas, together with most of the Arkansas troops at the Battle of Shiloh, was armed mainly with flintlock muskets, flintlock & percussion shotguns and various other outdated <b>smooth</b> <b>bore</b> weapons supplied from the soldiers' own homes. [...] In Colonel Peabody's camp they found 2000 new M1853 Enfield rifled muskets (still in their wooden crates) complete with ammunition. [...] So the men of the 7th threw away their outdated weapons, took up the new Enfield muskets, and continued fighting. [...] Later, still on the first day, Shaver's Brigade made an attack against the 24th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Unionn). [...] During the battle of Pittsburgh Landing every officer on Shaver's staff was either killed or wounded. [...] Colonel Shaver had four horses killed under him before he was critically wounded by an artillery shell {{on the second day of}} fighting. [...] Lieutenant Colonel John M. Dean, who had field command of the 7th in place of Colonel Shaver, was killed during a charge at Shiloh. Lieutenant Colonel Dean led his men into battle at Shiloh with his musicians (drum and fife) playing the song [...] "Granny does your Dog Bite?" [...] Lt. Colonel Dean was mentioned in the afteraction reports for the gallantry that he and his men displayed at Shioh.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863, he was {{promoted}} to commander and given command of the [...] under Admiral David Dixon Porter's Mississippi Squadron. The Essex was a 1,000 ton ironclad river gunboat of the United States Army and later United States Navy during the American Civil War. It was named for Essex County, Massachusetts. Essex was originally constructed in 1856 at New Albany, Indiana as a steam powered ferry named New Era. She had a crew of 134, armament consisting of one 32-pounder, three 11-inch Dahlgren <b>smooth</b> <b>bores,</b> one 10-inch Dahlgren smoothbore and one 12-pounder howitzer, with armor consisting of 1¾ inch forward casemate, ¾-inch sides.|$|R
50|$|The Richmond {{grounded}} broadside {{to the bar}} in {{the center}} of the river mouth, and opened fire on the mosquito fleet. In turn the fleet maneuvered up river just out of range of the Richmond’s <b>smooth</b> <b>bores,</b> and returned fire with their longer ranged rifled guns. Despite the volumes of projectiles launched, few hits were scored. None of the Rebel vessels were hit, the Richmond was only hit twice, one shot wrecking one of the boats stored on the main deck, one passing into a gun port and coming to rest in the hull. By ten o’clock Commodore Hollins decided the mosquito fleet was running low on coal and ammunition, and ordered the fleet back upriver to Fort Jackson. The Manassas was taken back to the forts under tow.|$|R

50|$|When in firing position, {{the mortar}} tube is {{attached}} to the bipod by a clamp. It then is fastened to the base plate by the insertion of the spherical knob on the base cap into the socket on the plate and rotating the mortar 90 degrees right or left. The tube is <b>smooth</b> <b>bored,</b> and its interior surface is carefully finished. Tolerance between the wall of the tube and the bourrelet of the shell is very close, thus preventing the shell from striking the firing pin with sufficient percussion to detonate the primer. On its outside surface the tube has a sighting line and quadrant seat at the muzzle end. The base cap of the tube is hollowed and threaded to screw onto the breech end of the tube which it thereby seals against gas leakage. The cap terminates in a spherical knob, which locks into the socket of the base plate and is bored and is threaded axially to receive the firing pin and the base cap plug.|$|R
50|$|Barrels {{can also}} benefit from lapping, {{not only because it}} makes the bore a more {{consistent}} diameter, but also because it polishes the bore.

6000|$|Accordingly I sold such {{stock and}} goods {{as we had}} upon the station, reserving only the two best waggons and two spans of oxen.

The guns would have moved any modern explorer to merriment; but such as they were I managed {{to do a good}} deal of execution with them. One of them was a single-barrelled, <b>smooth</b> <b>bore,</b> fitted for percussion caps--a roer we called it--which threw a three-ounce ball, and was charged with a handful of coarse black powder. Many is the elephant that I killed with that roer, although it generally knocked me backwards when I fired it, which I only did under compulsion. The best of the lot, perhaps, was a double-barrelled No. 12 shot-gun, but it had flint locks. Also there were some old tower muskets, which might or might not throw straight at seventy yards. I took six Kaffirs with me, and three good horses, which were supposed to be salted--that is, proof against the sickness. Among the Kaffirs was an old fellow named Indaba-zimbi, which, being translated, means [...] "tongue of iron." [...] I suppose he got this name from his strident voice and exhaustless eloquence. This man was a great character in his way. He had been a noted witch-doctor among a neighbouring tribe, and came to the station under the following circumstances, which, as he plays a considerable part in this history, are perhaps worth recording.|$|E

I never saw but one smooth-bore that would carry at all, and that was a French ducking-piece, upon the big lakes; it had a barrel half as long agin as my rifle, and would throw fine shot into a goose at one hundred yards; but it made dreadful work with the game, and you wanted a boat to carry it about in. When I went with Sir William agin’ the French, at Fort Niagara, all the rangers used the rifle; and a dreadful weapon it is, in the hands of one who knows how to charge it, and keep a steady aim. The captain knows, for he says he was a soldier in Shirley’s; and, though they were nothing but baggonet-men, he must know how we cut up the French and Iroquois in the skrimmages in that war.

Now, they say, they talk of running one of them wide roads with gates on it along the river; first making a road, and then fencing it up! I hunted one season back of the Kaatskills, nigh-hand to the settlements, and the dogs often lost the scent, when they came to them highways, there was so much travel on them; though I can’t say that the brutes was of a very good breed.

2500|$|The USS Essex {{had been}} {{constructed}} in 1856. She was a 1000-ton river gunboat, converted from her original {{role as a}} timberclad ferry named New Era. She was armed with one 32-pounder cannon, three [...] Dahlgren <b>smooth</b> <b>bores,</b> one [...] Dahlgren smoothbore and a 12-pounder howitzer. The USS St Louis was a City class ironclad built in 1861 at Carondelet, Missouri.

Both ships were sent to Cairo, Illinois, early in the Civil War as part of troop transports moving the army into Tennessee. Illinois, a Union state which contributed 250,000 men to the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, was a key theater. Cairo, at the confluence between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, was a key supply point and headquarters for Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote and General Ulysses S. Grant. It was defended by Fort Defiance. The complex river network provided routes for the Union gunboats into the heart of the Confederate forces; however the water levels – particularly in the Tennessee River – were often not sufficient for gunboats to pass.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weak link}} in this {{concentrated}} chain of firepower was the fleet commander and {{captain of the}} Richmond, Captain John Pope.

We are liable to be driven from here at any moment, and, situated as we are, our position is untenable. I may be captured at any time by a pitiful little steamer mounting only one gun.” The Ivy’s rifled gun did outrange Pope’s <b>smooth</b> <b>bores,</b> but at extreme range could not score any hits. Pope was obviously more of an administrator than a warrior, ready to flee from a mere reconnaissance element of Hollin’s fleet. The possibility of setting up picket boats, ranging posts or illuminated marker buoys, illumination fires, or preplanned concentrations of gunfire did not occur to him.|$|R
