5|$|Forensic archaeologists are {{involved}} within three main areas. Assisting with crime scene research, investigation, and recovery of evidence and/or <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> {{is only one}} aspect.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a wealth}} of <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains,</b> Diplodocus {{is one of the}} best-studied dinosaurs. Many aspects of its {{lifestyle}} have been subjects of various theories over the years. Comparisons between the scleral rings of diplodocines and modern birds and reptiles suggest that they may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, {{underwater}} searches {{were conducted}} by Aruban authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains,</b> possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.|$|E

5000|$|A similar {{incident}} occurred in October 2011 in Stavern when workers uncovered {{another set of}} mysterious <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains,</b> which again {{turned out to be}} centuries old. [...] This time Sørnes deduced that it either belonged to a murderer executed in 1816, or one executed in 1775. Its precise identity was never confirmed.|$|R
5|$|The Jadovno camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to {{the depth of the}} gorges where bodies were disposed of and {{the fact that some of}} these had been filled with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities. Additional sites containing the <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> revealed injuries including a broken ankle, and a double fracture to the larynx which indicated strangulation {{as the cause of}} death. At times, both Mme M'Barek and her brother admitted their involvement in the death of Lord Shaftesbury and the French authorities decided to charge both her and her brother with the crime of premeditated murder.|$|E
5|$|Among heterodontosaurids, only Heterodontosaurus {{itself is}} known from a {{complete}} skeleton. Fragmentary <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> of Abrictosaurus are known {{but have not}} been fully described, while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments and teeth. Consequently, most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies (defining features) have been described from the teeth and jaw bones. Heterodontosaurus measured just over 1meter (3.3ft) in length, while the fragmentary remains of Lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual.|$|E
5000|$|Balangoda {{is notable}} {{due to the}} {{discovery}} of <b>skeletal</b> Hominini <b>remains</b> from the late Quaternary period (the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia). The town is also the birthplace of Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero and Sirimavo Bandaranaike (the world's first female head of government) the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka (1960-65, 1970-77 and 1994-2000).|$|R

5|$|Analysis {{of antiquities}} related to <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> {{revealed}} 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and {{two types of}} turtles. Bones of birds and fish were also found. Faunal finds indicate that the area was forested over an undulating topography.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{continued}} on to San Antonio, where {{he lost a}} substantial amount of money playing Monte Bank. He decided to return to San Felipe. Meeting two Americans and a Mexican cigar maker travelling that way, with their permission, he traveled with them. After his return to San Felipe, the citizens began to suspect Desha of murdering Early. A few days after Desha's arrival, Early's clothing was found in a nearby creek. Scattered nearby, a search party located <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> believed to be Early's.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the wreck}} was located by Danish divers. The British marine {{archeologist}} Innes McCartney led a subsequent dive and {{confirmed that the}} wreck sits upright on the sea floor and is largely intact. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> from the ship's crew are scattered around the sunken cruiser. The wreck was positively identified when McCartney's team recovered the ship's bell in 2001, which they donated to the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, where the bell is currently on display.|$|E
40|$|From several waste {{holes of}} the Vučedol site the <b>skeletal</b> bird <b>remains</b> have been collected. Athough the bony {{material}} is not rich (21 bones), five families with seven genera and seven {{species have been}} determined. The inhabitants of Vučedol hunted these bird species – Anser fabalis, Anser sp., Anas platyrhynconos, Aythya ferina and Grus grus, because of tasteful meat, and thus they supplied deficiency in their diet...|$|R
50|$|The chapel was rebuilt in the Baroque {{style in}} 1731. In 1852 its crypt was {{decorated}} with <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains</b> taken from the adjacent cemetery, giving rise to the name Chapel of Bones (Il-Kappella tal-Għadam). The chapel was heavily damaged by aerial bombardment in 1941, and its ruins were subsequently demolished, leaving only some foundations on the site. However, the crypt might still survive intact.|$|R
2500|$|In Bones, {{a long-running}} TV series {{centered}} around forensic analysis of decomposed and <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains,</b> facial reconstruction is {{featured in the}} majority of episodes, used much like a police artist sketch in police procedurals. Regular cast character Angela Montenegro, the Bones team's facial reconstruction specialist, employs 3D software and holographic projection to [...] "give victims back their faces" [...] (as noted in the episode, [...] "A Boy in a Bush").|$|R
5|$|In 2014, <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> of a {{woman who}} lived around 425AD were {{discovered}} in the vicinity of Beachy Head on the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African skeletal structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, Owen Beattie, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began the 1845–48 Franklin Expedition Forensic Anthropology Project (FEFAP) when he and his team of researchers and field assistants travelled from Edmonton to King William Island, traversing the island's western coast as Franklin's men did 132years before. FEFAP hoped to find artifacts and <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> in order to use modern forensics to establish identities and causes of death among the lost 129.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this has}} {{probably}} been due to its wealth of <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> and former status as the longest dinosaur. The donation of many mounted skeletal casts by industrialist Andrew Carnegie to potentates around {{the world at the}} beginning of the 20th century did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} cold case {{investigations}} are under review after {{a search of}} Swindler's archives revealed eight sets of <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains.</b> Samples were collected for DNA profiling by Dr. Katherine Taylor, who is with the King County, Washington Medical Examiner Office and also is a UW forensic anthropologist faculty affiliate, and sent as forensic evidence with the remains to law enforcement agencies in Washington state and Michigan.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{objective is to}} describe the social identity of the <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains</b> based on dental modification. The research material is <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains</b> from Kedaton Temple and Upas Well which consists of five individuals. These human remains {{are located in the}} residential complex of the kingdom of Majapahit (ca. 1300 - 1500), thus it can be assumed that they are associated with Indonesian classical period. The applied method of research is observation and comparison. Based on the observation of teeth, all individuals underwent dental modification. The male had the “T” pattern and the females had the “diamond” pattern. Comparison with other types of dental modifications in Indonesia shows that the pattern of dental modification among human remains from Kedaton Temple and Upas Well is different from the other modification patterns in Indonesia. If we relate the location of the grave and the location of the temple where are in the royal family residential area, hence it can be concluded that these human remains belonged to the high social status...|$|R
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{building}} an extension to the London Underground at Hobbs End dig up <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains.</b> Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney (James Donald) is called in and deduces {{that they are}} the remnants of a group of five-million-year-old apemen, more ancient than any previous finds. One of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object. Believing it to be an unexploded bomb, they call in an army bomb disposal team.|$|E
5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period. The term was {{initially}} coined {{to refer to}} anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that {{were responsible for the}} island's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture'. The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools.|$|E
5000|$|The skull {{was held}} up to be his, albeit with [...] "a certain area of doubt". Along with nearby <b>skeletal</b> bones, these <b>remains</b> were {{transferred}} to Coxwold churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.|$|R
5000|$|The boats now pass behind Schweitzer Falls (referred to as [...] "the Backside of Water") {{to enter}} the Amazon River. <b>Skeletal</b> animal <b>remains</b> and warning signs {{featuring}} pictures of dagger-toothed fish forewarn the next show scene, where the boats encounter a swarm of leaping piranha. The guests then pass a couple of water buffalo and a boa constrictor before they meet shrunken head dealer Trader Sam ("He'll trade you two of his heads for just one of yours") {{before returning to the}} dock.|$|R
2500|$|On 29 August 2010, trail bike riders {{discovered}} <b>skeletal</b> human <b>remains</b> in the Belanglo State Forest in New South Wales. Media reports {{at first}} linked the killing to serial killer Ivan Milat and the backpacker murders, but later forensic examination found the remains {{had been left}} there many years after Milat was jailed in 1996 for the seven murders in the forest. In a 2010 appeal for information, police called the woman [...] "Angel" [...] after the motif on a t-shirt she was wearing.|$|R
5|$|Banton {{was already}} {{inhabited}} during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden coffins and <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> {{found in the}} island's caves in 1936 {{by a team of}} researchers from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, a piece of a traditional burial cloth found in one of the wooden coffins. It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus, {{the type}} species, is known from 5 to 10 {{articulated}} skulls with some associated <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains,</b> from juvenile to adult individuals {{found in the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation. H. stebingeri is known from an unknown but substantial number of individuals, with an age range of embryos to adults. The hypothesis that H. altispinus and H. stebingeri form a natural group excluding other known hadrosaur species may be incorrect, as noted in Suzuki et al.s 2004 redescription of Nipponosaurus; their phylogenetic analysis found that Nipposaurus was {{more closely related to}} H. altispinus than H. stebingeri was to H. altispinus. This was rejected by Evans and Reisz (2007), though.|$|E
5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the <b>skeletal</b> <b>remains</b> of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 <b>skeletal</b> and archaeological <b>remains,</b> {{thought to}} be a church, were {{discovered}} in a field at Auldhame. Initial estimates that the church dated from the Medieval period were later proved wrong, and it was established that the find may even date from the time of Saint Baldred himself.|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Sri Lankan fossils, the island's fossil records from around 40,000 BP onwards are much more complete. Excavated fossils of <b>skeletal</b> and {{cultural}} <b>remains</b> from this period provide the earliest records of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in South Asia, {{and some of the}} earliest evidence for the use of a specific type of stone tool.|$|R
30|$|In the {{long-lasting}} {{debate of}} extraction versus non-extraction treatment, {{the impact of}} extractions on the <b>skeletal</b> vertical dimension <b>remains</b> rather unclear. The aim of this retrospective research study was to obtain a bias-free sample of morphologically similar borderline patients treated with or without extraction of the four first premolars and to retrospectively evaluate the vertical changes that occurred.|$|R
