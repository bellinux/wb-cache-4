5|$|On 14 February 2013, a blurry {{screenshot}} of {{the game}} was released by Avalanche Studios founder and CEO Christofer Sundberg. The game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 on 10 June at Sony's press conference, with a scheduled 2014 release for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Although Sundberg <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> expo that Miller and Barlog's project was not the Mad Max game announced by Avalanche, he later said that Barlog had worked on a Mad Max game at Avalanche. Despite the unclear relationship between the projects, according to the game's design director, Miller had collaborated with Avalanche during the game's pre-production in mid-2011. Despite having Miller to offer input, Warner Bros. inclined to give lots of creative freedom to Avalanche. Full production {{of the game}} began before May 2012.|$|E

The 1st and 2nd Battalions arrived at Port Said by Landing Ship Tank, the 2nd Battalion were delayed in starting to advance towards Ismailia. The battalion was supported by the tanks of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment, but due to the delay, they were still short of their objective when a ceasefire was announced.

25|$|On the 49ers' {{first drive}} of the game, wide {{receiver}} Jerry Rice caught {{a very long}} pass from quarterback Joe Montana {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 50-yard touchdown; however, the future Hall of Famer inexplicably fumbled the football into the Giants end zone without being touched. (John Madden <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> telecast that the artificial turf at Giants Stadium may have been a factor.) Giants safety Kenny Hill recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. New York then drove 80 yards in 10 plays to score on Simms' 24-yard touchdown to tight end Mark Bavaro. San Francisco responded with a 26-yard field goal by Ray Wersching, but in the second quarter, Giants safety Herb Welch intercepted a pass from Montana and lateralled the ball to Elvis Patterson, who ran for 16 yards before being tackled. New York then converted with the turnover into a touchdown on Joe Morris' 45-yard run.|$|E
25|$|Romney also <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> primary {{campaign}} {{that he would}} seek to make the U.S. a much less hospitable place for undocumented immigrants by eliminating {{what he called the}} magnets that attract them. An example of a magnet, he said, would be offering to undocumented immigrants the same tuition discounts that are offered to legal residents who attend public colleges in their states, a benefit that rival candidate Governor Rick Perry supported for Texas students who had been brought as children to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents. Romney similarly said that he opposed all forms of amnesty because he regards amnesty as another magnet for illegal immigration. He vowed that as president he would veto the DREAM Act (legislation which would allow individuals who had been brought to the U.S. as children when their families immigrated illegally an opportunity to qualify for permanent residency if they met certain qualifications), because he considered it yet another magnet for illegal immigration.|$|E

25|$|In March 2013, 16 {{restaurants}} around Taiwan {{were given}} halal certification, {{in a move}} to make Taiwan more attractive to Muslim tourists thereby expanding tourism in Taiwan. The certificates were issued by the ROC Tourism Bureau in collaboration with Chinese Muslim Association (CMA). The restaurants covered are in Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, Hualien and Taitung. These restaurants cover {{a wide variety of}} food, including Chinese, Taiwanese, Indian, Thai, Turkish and Egyptian cuisine. This move brings the total number of halal restaurants throughout Taiwan to 31. Liu Hsi-lin, deputy director-general of the bureau, <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> ceremony that people from different countries and different religions will have different needs. The key to develop Taiwan's tourism industry is to show respect for these diverse needs. He said that Taiwan is aiming at attracting Muslim tourists from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Thus the bureau, together with the CMA, try to help the local tourist industries cater to the needs of Muslim visitors. Also present at the ceremony is Salahuding Ma, secretary-general of CMA.|$|E
25|$|On the Shabbat, festivals (i.e., on Yom Tov and on Chol HaMoed), and on Rosh Chodesh (new {{month in}} the Jewish Calendar), a Mussaf (additional) Amidah is said, both silently and {{repeated}} by the Reader. The Mussaf service is technically a separate, free-standing service which could potentially be said any time between the shacharit (morning) and mincha (afternoon) services, but today is normally recited immediately after the regular morning service as part of single, but extended, worship session. The Mussaf Amidah begins with the same first three and concludes with the same last three blessings as the regular Amidah. However, {{in place of the}} 13 intermediate blessings of the daily service, special prayers are added for the holiday. In Orthodox Services, these prayers recount the special Mussaf sacrifice that was offered in the Temple in Jerusalem on the occasion, and contains a plea for the building of a Third Temple and the restoration of sacrificial worship. The biblical passage referring to the Mussaf sacrifice of the day is included. The Priestly Blessing is <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Reader's repetition of the Amidah. Outside the land of Israel, the Mussaf Amidah of major Jewish holidays is the only time the Priestly Blessing is chanted by actual kohanim (priests).|$|E
25|$|Booth’s {{earliest}} cricket {{was played}} at Fulneck School, and {{later he was}} associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and {{of which he was}} captain. He appeared regularly for Yorkshire Second Eleven in 1907 and the two following seasons, and in 1908 received his first trial for the county against Somerset at Dewsbury without success. He did not, however, secure a regular place in the team until two years later, but in 1911 he scored 1,125 runs for his county and took seventy-four wickets, with a highest innings of 210 against Worcestershire on the Worcester ground. Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and in 1913 made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting – it was <b>said</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work – but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth’s claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. Possessed of a free, natural action, he made the ball come quickly off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.|$|E
