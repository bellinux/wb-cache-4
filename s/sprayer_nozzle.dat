40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} improve the use of {{pesticides}} and pesticide consumption and prevent environmental pollution, manufactures and scientists have considered two major trends. The first major trend is improving techniques that are practical and effective use of small quantities of chemicals to reduce the negative effect of residues of pesticides. The use of new methods usually requires investment and cost. The second major trend is changing the parts that are more important to reform the sprayer components {{in order to reduce}} pollution, mainly by including engineering controls, and design and construction of appropriate nozzles. The optimization can be done with the least expensive pesticide. Nozzle is a device for spraying the solution in the form of particles with a certain pattern. Tip of a nozzle is placed in the nozzle’s body and has many different types. The main factors in choosing tips include: material, pattern of distribution, spray angle and the amount of the solution. The spray tip may be made of aluminum, brass, nylon, stainless steel, ceramic or other materials. Nanocomposites are composites that contain at least one component with dimensions in the nanometer range between 1 to 100 nm. This material is suitable as an alternative to overcome the limitations that exist with integrated microcomposites. The aim of this study was the construction and evaluation of a <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzle</b> with ceramic nanocomposites with good shelf life and optimum performance. Materials and methods: This research was supported by the Agricultural Engineering Research Institute and Nanotechnology Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture. The operations of this study were as follows: 1 - Preparing of materials, including alumina powder and stabilized zirconia powder with yttrium. 2 - Design and manufacture of molds. 3 - Preparation of the samples pressing operations. 4 - Zintering of samples to achieve high density. 5 - Tests to determine the quality of the products. In order to prepare nanocomposite powder mixed with stabilized zirconia alumina, the ratio of 10 / 90 percent by volume of the powder was poured into the mill for three hours and it was stirred in the mixer. Pressing is placing the powder into a mold, and applying pressure to achieve the desired density. In this study, pressing device with 30 tons was manually used and powder sample in the amount of one gram was placed in a semi-cylindrical small hollow. After making a few samples and determining the optimal pressure and time of pressing in action, samples were manufactured under 90 kg cm- 2 pressure at 20 seconds. A high temperature furnace model F 3 L- 1720 was used for zintering. Samples were put into the furnace after forming by a single-axis press. Temperature the of furnace was raised up 1650 °C at a rate of 10 degrees per minute and then the samples were exposed for one hour in order for the heat to be evenly applied in all the body of the nozzle. Finally, a hollow cone spray pattern fan nozzle with a major diameter of 15 mm and an inner diameter of 2 mm was built. Equipment for analyzing used in this study included: X-Ray Diffraction device (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The flow rate output was measured at a pressure of 2 bar in the period of 0 - 50 hours at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 hours. Results and Discussion: XRD analysis of nano-composite stabilizer in the presence of yttria- zirconia- alumina toughness with (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3), yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) and alumina indicates respective phases. For the samples made with better properties, it should be uniformly distributed within it. To evaluate the uniformity, SEM-Mapping test samples were made. The results showed that the distribution of Y, Zr, Al in nanocomposite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) is almost uniform. The results of changes in the level of output over time showed that the rate of flow in composite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) nozzle versus ceramic conventional (Al 2 O 3) nozzle after 50 hours of testing under static condition, flow rate was decreased to 30 - 35 percent. Conclusions: Nozzles {{are one of the most}} important terminal parts in sprayers and are used to spread the liquid evenly at a certain flow rate. Addinga nanomaterial ceramic structure as a new solution was effective. By paying attention to reduce the use of chemicals and protection of the resource bases, a correct approach to the development of agricultural mechanization equipment that are essential components should be a priorityas a low-cost solution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to generate drift curves from pesticide applications on coffee plants and to compare them with two European drift‑prediction models. The used methodology {{is based on the}} ISO 22866 standard. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with ten replicates in a 2 x 20 split‑plot arrangement. The evaluated factors were: two types of nozzles (hollow cone with and without air induction) and 20 parallel distances to the crop line outside of the target area, spaced at 2. 5 m. Blotting papers were used as a target and placed in each of the evaluated distances. The spray solution was composed of water+rhodamine B fluorescent tracer at a concentration of 100 mg L‑ 1, for detection by fluorimetry. A spray volume of 400 L ha‑ 1 was applied using a hydropneumatic <b>sprayer.</b> The air‑induction <b>nozzle</b> reduces the drift up to 20 m from the treated area. The application with the hollow cone nozzle results in 6. 68 % maximum drift in the nearest collector of the treated area. The German and Dutch models overestimate the drift at distances closest to the crop, although the Dutch model more closely approximates the drift curves generated by both spray nozzles.

40|$|When liquids {{are forced}} under {{pressure}} through small orifices (like <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles)</b> they are sheared into small aerosols or particles having nearly a thousand fold range in spherical diameters. Owing to gravitational {{forces and the}} viscosity of air, the rate of fall to ground can be predicted by Stokes Law and {{is proportional to the}} radius of the particles. The rate of fall before a particle hits ground (or conversely how long a particle remains in air before it falls a given distance) is modified by entrainment in a mobile air mass. Rate of fall of a spray particle will also be influenced by the rate of evaporation of the liquid constituting the aerosol. The longer the aerosol remains in air before falling to ground (or alternatively striking an object above ground) the greater the opportunity to be carried away from its intended target (e. g., crop canopy). In general, all size classes of spray particles are capable of movement off-target, but the smallest particles would move the farthest before depositing on the ground. Drift has been historically considered to be the movement of pesticide residues via air masses during and after application. Post application movement of pesticide residues (i. e., after deposition on plants or soil) via volatilization has been distinguished as secondary o...|$|R

Maize leaves were sprayed varying the neem extracts, <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles,</b> concentration and number of application. In the first experiment, the results showed the smallest damage to chlorpyrifos (2. 00) and for the aqueous extracts from neem leaves (2. 50) applied three times through flat nozzles. The commercial extract did not protect maize leaves from larval damage (7. 22 to 7. 90). The larval development showed consistent with the low leaves damage, resulting in the low larval weight (97. 41 mg). In the second experiment, the smallest leaves damage (2. 62 and 2. 65) were observed in three applications of the aqueous extract, using 80. 01 / 80. 04 / 80. 01 nozzles, 10, 000 and 7, 500 ppm, respectively.

Twelve rainfall simulation plots (three replications of four herbicide application treatments) were established in 1995. Losses of atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine with surface runoff were measured for the four different treatments: broadcast spray without incorporation with no-till (NT), broadcast spray with disk incorporation (SD), broadcast spray with Mulch Master incorporation (MR), and subsurface application with incorporation using a modified Mulch Master (MB). For the modified Mulch Master, <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles</b> were added to the trailing edges of 61 -cm wide Mulch Master sweeps, which were run at a depth of 6 cm. Following herbicide application, rainfall was simulated at 6. 35 cm h - 1 for 1. 5 h on the 3. 1 m × 10. 7 m plots. Runoff volumes and soil losses were greatest for NT (3. 36 cm and 632 kg ha - 1), followed by MR and MB, with SD showing the lowest total runoff and sediment losses (0. 34 cm and 217 kg ha - 1). Herbicide losses and concentrations were significantly greater (P = 0. 10) for NT than for the other three treatments.

40|$|According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the {{technology}} used to spray pesticides in most developing countries reflects technical standards of 40 years ago, resulting in pesticide waste and environmental damage. FAO {{called for the}} adoption of minimum standards for the safe and efficient application of agrochemicals through good quality equipment and better training of farmers. According to FAO, farmers and equipment operators have insufficient knowledge about pesticides and correct methods of application. Extension services rarely have technicians with any specialized knowledge of application technology. In many countries the only specialist offering advice to farmers on application technology, handling and calibration of their equipment are the representatives of pesticides companies. Many farmers mistakenly believe that high volumes, high pressure and high doses, are the most appropriate way to apply pesticides. In addition, in many countries, much of the spraying equipment is in extremely poor condition with worn-out <b>sprayer</b> <b>nozzles</b> not being replaced, or worse, enlarged deliberately to achieve higher flow rates. FAO has developed Guidelines for the basic requirements for pesticide application equipment and Standards for pesticide application equipment which includes test procedures. They suggest that incentives for improved equipment quality should be created.

The Swedish Farmers Selling & Purchasing Association had requested its local branches to collect nozzles from farmers who had kept records of how they had been used. These records gave information {{on the type of}} herbicide, the number of seasons used and the spray rate. Altogether 42 sets of nozzles were used in the survey. Of these, 9 were made of brass (fan nozzles) and 33 of plastic (5 cone nozzles, 28 fan nozzles). The experimental equipment consisted of a patternator. The test was divided into two parts, the first dealing with determinations of the flow and the second dealing with the spraying uniformity. In the present study the total flow per nozzle was chosen as a measure of the nozzles range of use. As the original flows of the nozzles are not known, it is impossible to calculate the relative change in flow. This survey demonstrates that the change in flow is negligible within the sector in which the nozzles have been used. Neither do coefficients of variation for the flow change with the total flow. The coefficient of variation for the distribution increases with the total flow in the nozzle. A plastic fan nozzle is, on average, worn out after approximately 4000 l. In order to obtain a corresponding value for brass we have made an extrapolation (but its justification is doubtful). According to the extrapolation, the brass nozzles would wear out after approximately 14000 l (3. 5 times more than plastic).

CONCLUSIONS Air assistance and flat-fan nozzles allow volume rates to be reduced while maintaining or improving spray quality distribution. The working parameters of hand-held sprayers must be considered to reduce environmental risk and increase {{the efficacy of the}} spraying process. © 2015 Society of Chemical IndustryPostprint (updated version...|$|R

40|$|Foliar {{fertilizer}} application on sugarcane plantations using a knapsack sprayer was ineffective in spraying liquid foliar fertilizer evenly {{across the surface}} of the leaf. To improve its performance, a knapsack power sprayer was modified and tested, for a better comfort and effectiveness of the liquid foliar {{fertilizer application}}. The motor sprayer was modified by replacing its big fluid tank with a smaller fluid tank of the manual <b>sprayer.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> pipe was modified in such a way to be used in spraying two rows of sugarcane in one pass. The modified motor sprayers were tested in sugarcane plantation for applying the foliar fertilizer. The test results showed that the motor sprayers could spray the fluid fertilizer in more effective and uniform spraying than that of the manual sprayer. Spraying using high pressure of the motor sprayer could spray the foliar fertilizer to the leaf surface uniformly. The droplet size was more tiny, and could reach the entire leaf of the sugarcane.

40|$|A {{spray drift}} model called RTDrift was {{developed}} to estimate drift caused by ground sprayer machines. The sprayer was equipped with sensors measuring operational parameters namely spray pressure, boom height and movements, and geolocalization. Climatic parameters, including wind speed and direction, were measured using a 2 -D ultrasonic anemometer mounted on the <b>sprayer.</b> The <b>nozzles</b> spray drop size spectra were characterized using Phase Doppler Interferometer measurements. At every successive boom position, a diffusion-advection Gaussian tilted plume model computed the spray drift deposits for each drop class taking into account evaporation. The contribution of a single nozzle was calculated by integration of the individual puffs with respect to time and summation of the contributions of individual drops classes. The overall drift generated by the sprayer machine was obtained adding the contributions of all the nozzles. Field trials were performed on a fallow field with water and on crops with pesticides in various wind conditions. The ground drift was measured at different drift distances using fluorometric methods. When comparing {{the results of the}} model with experimental measurements of deposits, the model produced realistic maps of drift deposits. Some further improvement is needed in the presence of large scale eddies. The model offers potential benefits for the farmer as a real time drift estimator embedded on a sprayer machinePeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcrete {{structures}} are often reinforced with steel. In {{order for the}} reinforcement to take over tensile forces, concrete has to crack. Through such cracks, water and compounds that are harmful to concrete can enter. This can cause durability issues like leakage, concrete degradation and reinforcement corrosion. In situ repair of cracks is often labour-intensive and inefficient. Preferentially, cracks are autonomously healed {{from the inside out}} in an early stage, preventing the ingress of water. This can be achieved by incorporating healing agent particles composed of nutrients and bacterial spores into the concrete matrix. The bacteria will germinate when water is available, plugging cracks with calcium carbonate. However, a coating is needed to protect the water-soluble healing agent from water during mixing. In order to allow the bacteria access to water for activation after the concrete has hardened, such a coating should break whenever a crack occurs in the concrete. Therefore, it should adhere well to the concrete matrix. It is possible to achieve this by protecting the particles with a brittle geopolymer coating. For this study, healing agent particles are coated with geopolymers following different mixture recipes. Metakaolin is used as an aluminosilicate source and sodium silicate as well as sodium aluminate are used as activator liquids. The particles are coated by granulation in a low-shear granulator. In order to improve the coating process, the operating window and the granulation mechanism are determined for all activator liquids used. Leaching and strength tests are performed and coated particles are incorporated in cement paste {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of application of the particles in concrete. Results show that the prepared particles are better protected from leaching than untreated particles. Using a high pressure single-fluid nozzle to improve nebulisation when coating produces more particles of the desired size than coating with a low pressure single-fluid nozzle with poor nebulisation.

40|$|Spray drift can {{be defined}} as the {{quantity}} of plant protection product that is carried out of the sprayed area by the action of air currents during the application process. Efficacy of pesticide applications in orchards and vineyards is highly dependent on matching the canopy characteristics with the liquid distribution on a vertical plane, this being influenced by the type of <b>sprayer,</b> the <b>nozzle</b> orientation and air outlet adjustment. Two simple vertical patternators were designed and developed with the express purpose to be used in field conditions for the adjustment of vineyard canopy sprayers. Three different orchard sprayers were selected for comparative field trials of two new patternators with an already commercially available portable vertical patternator designed at University of Turin (Italy). The objective was to evaluate their efficiency in terms of spray recovery, symmetry and repeatability. Results show the ability of the two prototypes to measure the vertical distribution of liquid, as well as the important similarities between the liquid distribution profiles obtained with both patternators in comparison to the reference one. Trials conducted with the three different orchard sprayers show the suitability of this kind of tool, not only for research purposes but also for training activities and as part of the sprayer calibration process. Important benefits from both an economic and a sustainable point of view can be obtained regarding adequate liquid distribution according to the crop characteristics, this being especially interesting in field conditions.

It aimed to evaluate in the laboratory the influence of the syrup temperature and the nearby environment at the application nozzle in the deposition of the aqueous solution on the target. The syrup was prepared with distilled and deionized water and potassium chloride, and cooled in conventional refrigerator. The ambience was cooled using vortex tube with compressed air. We used a <b>nozzle</b> <b>sprayer</b> with an injection of CO 2 by keeping constant parameters: time, application rates and wind.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{pesticide}} application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of mechanical sprayers. Hydraulic sprayers consists of a tank, a pump, a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple <b>nozzles).</b> <b>Sprayers</b> convert a pesticide formulation, often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid chemical carrier, such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles. This conversion is accomplished by forcing the spray mixture through a spray nozzle under pressure. The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both. Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to spray drift, but require more water per unit of land covered. Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to generate drift curves from pesticide applications on coffee plants and to compare them with two European drift-prediction models. The used methodology {{is based on the}} ISO 22866 standard. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with ten replicates in a 2 x 20 split-plot arrangement. The evaluated factors were: two types of nozzles (hollow cone with and without air induction) and 20 parallel distances to the crop line outside of the target area, spaced at 2. 5 m. Blotting papers were used as a target and placed in each of the evaluated distances. The spray solution was composed of water+rhodamine B fluorescent tracer at a concentration of 100 mg L- 1, for detection by fluorimetry. A spray volume of 400 L ha- 1 was applied using a hydropneumatic <b>sprayer.</b> The air-induction <b>nozzle</b> reduces the drift up to 20 m from the treated area. The application with the hollow cone nozzle results in 6. 68 % maximum drift in the nearest collector of the treated area.
