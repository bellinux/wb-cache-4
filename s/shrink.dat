5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that <b>shrink</b> or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve to <b>shrink</b> to a point is proportional to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E

5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws.

5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or <b>shrink</b> over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely <b>shrink</b> to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will <b>shrink</b> at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} <b>shrinking</b> and {{separation}} properties (two notions well-known in descriptive set theory) for NP and coNP {{and show that}} under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, both properties do not hold for NP and the <b>shrinking</b> property does not hold for coNP. In particular we obtain the following results. 1. NP and coNP {{do not have the}} <b>shrinking</b> property unless PH is finite. In general, ΣnP and ΠnP do not have the <b>shrinking</b> property unless PH is finite. This solves an open question posed by Selivanov (1994) [33]. 2. The separation property does not hold for NP unless UP⊆coNP. 3. The <b>shrinking</b> property does not hold for NP unless there exist NP-hard disjoint NP-pairs (existence of such pairs would contradict a conjecture of Even et al. (1984)  [6]). 4. The <b>shrinking</b> property does not hold for NP unless there exist complete disjoint NP-pairs. Moreover, we prove that the assumption NP≠coNP is too weak to refute the <b>shrinking</b> property for NP in a relativizable way. For this we construct an oracle relative to which P=NP∩coNP, NP≠coNP, and NP has the <b>shrinking</b> property. This solves an open question posed by Blass and Gurevich (1984) [3] who explicitly ask for such an oracle...|$|R
