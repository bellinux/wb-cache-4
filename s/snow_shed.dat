2500|$|The Southern Pacific and Cotton Belt {{were the}} only buyers of the EMD SD45T-2 [...] "Tunnel Motor" [...] {{locomotive}}. This locomotive was necessary because the standard configuration EMD SD45 {{could not get a}} sufficient amount of cool air into the diesel locomotive's radiator while working Southern Pacific's through snow sheds and tunnels in the Cascades and Donner Pass. These [...] "Tunnel Motors" [...] were EMD SD45-2's with radiator air intakes at the locomotive car body's walkway level, rather than EMD's typical setup with fans on the locomotive's long hood roof pulling air through radiators at the top/side of the locomotive's body. Inside tunnels and snow sheds hot exhaust from lead units would accumulate {{near the top of the}} tunnel or <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> and be drawn into the radiators of trailing EMD (non-tunnel motor) locomotives, leading these locomotives to shut down as their diesel prime mover overheated. The Southern Pacific also operated EMD SD40T-2s, as did the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.|$|E

60|$|He shivered, for {{the cold}} was keen and the coat he had got at Green Lake was old. Besides, he was tired; he had started before daybreak from his shack, but {{when he reached the}} {{railroad}} the moon was on the rocks. In the shadow, the snow that streaked the mountain-side was blue; across the gorge broken crags shone like polished steel and the small pines growing in the cracks sparkled with frost. Not far off, a dark hole in a slanted white bank indicated the mouth of a <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> but Jimmy knew the stones and snow had come down the hill.|$|E
40|$|Disasters to {{transmission}} lines due to wet snow events motivate researchers {{to carry out}} advanced dynamic analysis {{in order to understand}} and predict the line transient response to complex dynamic loads. The interest of numerical modeling of the effects of <b>snow</b> <b>shedding</b> phenomena is to check whether the amplitude of the induced motion is within the design limits of electrical clearances with the ground or with other conductors. This paper aims to develop a numerical model to consider wet snow adhesion on transmission line cables, and consequently, to predict <b>snow</b> <b>shedding</b> from cables due to dynamic effects. The finite element analysis software ADINA is used to simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of a snow-covered cable to the application of periodic loads and subsequent effects of <b>snow</b> <b>shedding.</b> Comparison of model results and small scale experimental simulations is used to validate the model. The model predicts cable rebound height following the application of different periodic loads as well as different <b>snow</b> <b>shedding</b> scenarios. It is found that for highest adhesion, <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> only at high excitation frequencies, whereas the inverse occurs for low adhesion. Cohesion force between the snow particles is greater than its adhesion strength to the cable. For large snow thickness, it is rather difficult to obtain <b>snow</b> <b>shedding</b> comparing to the small thickness...|$|R

2500|$|To {{solve this}} challenge, the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) had built <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> along the track, {{especially}} on the section between Finse Station and Hallingskeid Station. [...] Of the [...] line between the two stations, [...] was under <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> and [...] was in tunnel. Along {{this part of the}} line was the highest point of the railways, [...] at a point named Taugevatn.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy heard a rumble {{and went}} with Graham to the door. To watch the great train come down the gorge would {{for a few minutes}} banish his gloomy thoughts. Up the track, a streak of silver light touched the rocks and trees. The {{speeding}} beam got brighter, and by and by dazzling radiance flooded the gorge. The ground began to shake, harsh, clanging echoes rolled across the rocks; one heard the big cars jolt and the roar of wheels. Then black smoke swirled about the hut and the beam was gone. In the dark, the banging cars rushed by, a blaze touched the <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> and went out, and the turmoil died away.|$|E
50|$|The Cruach <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> at 205 yards long, had a {{corrugated}} iron roof in three sections; in summer the centre section was removed; in 1944 {{it was said}} to be the only <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> on a British railway.|$|E

5000|$|East of Snoqualmie Pass in Washington in the {{northwest}} U.S., westbound Interstate 90 had a <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> midway along the east shore of Keechelus Lake ( [...] , milepost 57.7); it was removed in 2014 {{in preparation for the}} construction of bridges to replace it. The 500 ft concrete structure covered two lanes on a curve and was constructed in 1950 for U.S. Route 10, then one lane in each direction; it marked the first time precast construction was used for a highway structure in a mountainous area and was the last remaining <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> on an Interstate highway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>sheds</b> or {{avalanche}} galleries are {{a common}} sight on railroads in mountain areas, such as the Donner Pass in the United States or many of the Swiss mountain railways, where tracks are covered with miles of shedding. Although unused today, the Central Pacific railroad had a complete rail yard under roof in the pass. They are also found on especially hazardous stretches of roadway as well. The Trans-Canada Highway between Revelstoke and Golden in British Columbia has several <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> covering both carriageways {{to cope with the}} heavy snow.|$|R
2500|$|Rogers Pass {{is known}} for its winter snowfall, which amounts to about 10 metres per year. [...] Because of steep mountains, {{avalanches}} are very common in winter. [...] When the railway first went over the pass, 31 <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> with a total length of about 6.5km were built to protect the railway from the avalanches. <b>Snow</b> <b>sheds</b> for the Trans-Canada Highway were built later, including large ones in 1962. To keep the highway and railway open during the winter, the Royal Canadian Artillery uses 105mm howitzers to knock down the avalanches under controlled circumstances so traffic is not caught in unexpected avalanches.|$|R
50|$|The old {{track and}} <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> remain {{and have been}} {{preserved}} {{as part of the}} Iron Goat Trail, which is accessible easily from U.S. Highway 2 near Stevens Pass or near Scenic, east of Everett.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot on Rollins Pass, Colorado, at the Corona townsite. Corona was a town {{dedicated}} {{to keeping the}} rail line open during the harsh winter, and was partially underground in a trench along the tracks, and under a <b>snow</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> {{constructed}} in 1950 when {{the road was}} known as US-10, formerly covered the westbound lanes, {{but it has been}} replaced by 'avalanche bridges', as of April 2014. [...] The use of sheds (very rare on Interstates) is an admission that plowing cannot keep up with snowfall and avalanches.|$|E
50|$|The {{ascent to}} the Coquihalla Summit is very steep, {{especially}} from the south. The ascent is particularly steep after passing northbound through the Great Bear <b>snow</b> <b>shed.</b> The pass is named after the Coquihalla River, after which the highway also derived its name. The Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area {{is located at the}} top of the pass on the Coquihalla Highway approximately 45 km north of Hope.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>sheds</b> are {{a kind of}} {{artificial}} tunnel built to protect a railway from avalanches of snow. Similarly the Stanwell Park, New South Wales [...] "steel tunnel", on the South Coast Line, protects the line from rockfalls.|$|R
50|$|It cost $5.5 million, while {{a further}} $3 million were spent on track revision, which saw 14.5 mi {{abandoned}} including the Loops and over 4 mi of <b>snow</b> <b>sheds.</b> In all, the route was shortened by 4.3 mi.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, {{service was}} {{suspended}} to Sandon, with trains only servicing {{as far as}} McGuigan because expensive repairs {{needed to be done}} to bridges damaged by spring slides. While the track was rebuilt, service was never restored. In 1910, a serious forest fire burned much of the remaining major bridges and <b>snow</b> <b>sheds.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> snow bridge or {{avalanche}} gallery {{is a type}} of rigid snow-supporting {{structure for}} avalanche control (avalanche defense) or to maintain passage in areas where snow removal becomes almost impossible. They can be made of steel, prestressed concrete frames, or timber.These structures can be fully enclosed, like an artificial tunnel, or consist of lattice-like elements. They are typically of robust construction considering the environments they must survive in.|$|E
5000|$|Highway 5 begins {{south at}} the {{junction}} with Highway 3 at uninhabited [...] "Othello", 7 km east of Hope (named after a nearby siding on the Kettle Valley Railway, which used many Shakespearean names). Exit numbers on the Coquihalla are a continuation of those on Highway 1 west of Hope. The speed limit on the Coquihalla Highway south of Merritt is 120 km/h. 35 km north of Othello, after passing through five interchanges, Highway 5 reaches the landmark Great Bear <b>snow</b> <b>shed.</b> The location of the former toll booth is 13 km north of the <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> passing through another interchange and the 1244 m Coquihalla Pass. Highway 5 was the only highway in British Columbia to have tolls; a typical passenger vehicle toll was C$10. Now free to drive, at the Coquihalla Lakes junction, the highway crosses from the Fraser Valley Regional District into the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. 61 km and five interchanges north of the former toll plaza, the Coquihalla enters the city of Merritt. There it joins Highway 5A and Highway 97C.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{describes}} the truck careening down through a [...] "tunnel" [...] (during which process several crates of chickens stacked {{on the back}} of the truck are inadvertently lost) and eventually into a feed store in Pagosa Springs. This tunnel is actually a snow shed: the song predates the only true tunnel on the pass by 30 years. However, the <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> is on the east side of the pass while Pagosa Springs is on the west side, making this sequence of events impossible.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> and earth dams {{are used to}} protect the Rogers Pass highway from {{avalanche}}s.

Parks Canada and the Department of National Defence work together to keep the pass safe for traffic on the Trans-Canada Highway and the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline.|$|R
50|$|Crocker bought train plows to plow {{the tracks}} of snow through the mountains, but they derailed due to ice on the tracks. He had more than 40 mi of <b>snow</b> <b>sheds</b> built to cover the tracks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, to prevent the tracks from getting covered with snow in the winter. This project cost over $2 million.|$|R

5000|$|At Cumbres (MP 330.48), {{elevation}} 10015 ft, is the Car Inspector's House, Water Standpipe, {{remnants of}} the extensive <b>snow</b> <b>shed,</b> and the Section House, which replaced the original depot after it was demolished in the 1950s. Cumbres is the highest point on the railroad. From here east, the track heads down at 2.5%, and descends the Cumbres Loop, more commonly refer to as [...] "Tanglefoot Curve". After exiting the loop, the track follows a general easterly direction until Milepost 327.6, where they turn north up the Los Pinos Valley.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel as {{completed}} in 1900 was 13283 ft long with a 1.7% grade descending to the west. The eastern portal was at elevation 3347 ft {{and the western}} at elevation 3123 ft. Both portals have a concrete facing with two pilasters flanking the tunnel mouth and a pyramidal cap. The {{entire length of the}} tunnel is lined with concrete.Prior to the Wellington Disaster in 1910, the pass was protected by 17 snow sheds for a total length of 7593 ft. The structures were added over time, as the need became apparent. The sheds did not block the slides but carried the debris over the right of way. Additions to the <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> protection totaled construction of 5411 ft in length, located at 26 points from 29 mi east of the Cascade Tunnel to 9.5 mi west. A double-track reinforced concrete <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> 3900 ft long was built in Wellington. Believed to be the first double-track shed built.With the increase in traffic over the line made possible by the improvements, interruptions increased as heavier snows blocked exposed portions of the track. In 1913, the Railway began a series of improvements on the west slope of the Cascade. As a result of these endeavors, eight of the twelve miles of track between the Cascade Tunnel and Scenic were covered by tunnels or snow sheds. Included in this construction was the Windy Point Tunnel, some 1200 ft long, which permitted the double tracking of the line along an almost vertical cliff. A second tunnel of note in the route was the Martins Creek tunnel, located immediately west of Martin Creek. Tracks approached the tunnel portal on a bridge and the tunnel turned about 170 degrees in a rising curve, the tracks crossing over Martin Creek again on a second bridge. The tunnel, built in 1911, was an unusual solution to a difficult problem and it was aptly called the Horseshoe Tunnel. The snow sheds added during this period were combination structures of wood and concrete. Reinforced or mass concrete was used for the back wall and timber formed the roof and supporting pillars; the largest shed constructed in this series was 4100 ft long.The maintenance of the sheds was expensive. Electrification of the line began in 1909. A simplified route was needed.|$|E
50|$|From Ridgway, the byway turns south onto US 550 {{following}} the Uncompahgre River into the Victorian mining town of Ouray. The highway {{is referred to}} as the Million Dollar Highway from Ouray south back to Durango. For the first 7.0 mi south of Ouray the byway follows through the Uncompahgre Gorge. Just past the only tunnel on the route, just south of Ouray, the road crosses over Bear Creek Falls on a bridge at the location of an impassable toll booth on the original road. The Alpine Loop National Back Country Byway, a four wheel drive jeep road, takes off in the gorge south of Bear Creek Falls. Before leaving the gorge the byway passes through a <b>snow</b> <b>shed</b> under the Riverside Slide avalanche zone. A monument stands near here honoring those who have lost their lives in the avalanche, including several snowplow operators. At this point the byway enters Ironton Park, a nice flat valley in contrast to the gorge. The road ascends several switchbacks, or S-curves, past the Idarado mining operation to the 11,018 ft summit of Red Mountain Pass, providing views of Red Mountain and several ghost towns. Back into the San Juan National Forest the highway descends through the Chattanooga Valley to Silverton.|$|E
