5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
500|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1945, Roosevelt {{remained}} active in politics {{for the remaining}} 17 years of her life. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> United States to join and support the United Nations and became its first delegate. She served as the first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights and oversaw the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Later she chaired the John F. Kennedy administration's Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. By {{the time of her}} death, Roosevelt was regarded as [...] "one of the most esteemed women in the world"; she was called [...] "the object of almost universal respect" [...] in her New York Times obituary. In 1999, she was ranked ninth in the top ten of Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century.|$|E
2500|$|For {{her third}} war patrol Harder teamed with [...] and [...] {{to form a}} deadly and coordinated attack group (a [...] "wolfpack"). Departing 30 October 1943 for the Mariana Islands, Harder {{encountered}} a target 12 November. Promptly dispatching this one, she surfaced and sighted a trawler-escort damaged by the explosion {{of one of her}} own depth charges. Submerging again until sunset, the submarine sank the damaged ship with gunfire, then turned toward Saipan in search of new targets. Sighting three marus on 19 November, she radioed her companions and closed for attack. After passing close by an escorting destroyer, Harder fired six torpedoes at two ships, sinking Udo Maru. As depth charges began to fall, <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> attack; two more torpedoes finished Hokko Maru. Harder climbed to periscope depth after nightfall to finish off the third maru. Shortly before midnight, she fired several more shots at 6,000-ton Nikkō Maru, but the Japanese ship stubbornly refused to sink. A brave, but doomed, enemy crew kept the cargo ship afloat until Harder had expended all torpedoes, many of which ran erratically. Rough weather the next day finally sank the damaged target. Harder returned to Pearl Harbor on 30 November, then sailed to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (smiling reproachfully). It {{was both}} hands {{when you went}} away. (He has to show that his left hand is gone; she is overcome.) I did not know. (<b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> empty sleeve in remorse.) You never {{mentioned}} it in your letters.|$|R
60|$|The girl's face flashed {{white in}} <b>the</b> gloom. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> against <b>the</b> outlaw--wrung his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> home <b>the</b> point, [...] "isn't disguising that pride under {{a mask of}} {{careless}} indifference {{equivalent to}} telling a lie?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> clumsy iron latch further: it yielded again, and anon she {{was able}} to push open the door.|$|E
60|$|Ghita, with {{streaming}} eyes, steadily {{put aside}} the gold, though <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> cross to her bosom, kissing it fervently again and again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> clasp of a {{black velvet}} bag which rested {{on the edge of}} the box, opened it, and passed him a key.|$|E
50|$|With {{the death}} of her father and no {{prospect}} of marriage with Wyn, Kitty goes to work in New York for Delphine. One day, <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> burglar alarm button by mistake at Delphine's fashion store. She pretends to faint to cover her blunder and is attended to by Mark. Mark, aware she is faking it, playfully blackmails her into a first date.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} moment of meeting there was nothing said, but <b>she</b> warmly <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> hand which he held out to her.|$|R
6000|$|PHOEBE. If you please, both of you. (They retire together, and {{no sooner}} have they gone than MISS PHOEBE leaps from the couch, her eyes sparkling. <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> cordial on MISS SUSAN.) Nay, drink it, Susan. I left {{it for you}} on purpose. I have such awful {{information}} to impart. Drink. (MISS SUSAN drinks tremblingly and then the bolt is fired.) Susan, Miss Henrietta and Miss Fanny are here! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> cat to her threadbare bosom with a breathless exclamation. [...] "Ah!" [...] Then {{not much}} above a whisper: [...] "Under Peter Ivanovitch?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t open it”; and <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> gate close. “If {{you should}} open it I’d go out. There you’d be, monsieur—for I should never return.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> {{little hand}} that she held between hers, {{and looked up}} into the face that was bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.|$|E
50|$|One day, Lisa gets {{word that}} Stanley has died. Alone in her apartment, after {{attempting}} {{to feed her}} now dead pet fish, she breaks down and cries uncontrollably. The next day at work, Lisa gets an unexpected delivery of flowers from a secret admirer. Puzzled, <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> delivery man for information on who might have sent her the flowers. He says the sender wants to remain anonymous. Lisa asks her friends for names and visits the flower shop to no avail.|$|R
5000|$|When Bea confronted Jacs in {{her cell}} {{wanting to know}} the truth behind what {{happened}} to Debbie, she becomes enraged when Jacs condoned what she had done. Bea then stabs Jacs in the neck with a pen causing her to bleed out and die. After this, <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> duress button, and is escorted away by two guards as her fellow inmates watch in shock and confusion. This scene contrasts Bea entering the prison in 1x01 being escorted by guards.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "I do. Mrs. and Miss Rice accept, and {{her friend}} Miss Greenway, who's staying with her, and--yes! here's one from Mr. Welling! Oh, how glad I am! Willis, dearest, if I could be the means of {{bringing}} those two lovely young creatures together, I should be so happy! Don't you think, now, {{he is the most}} delicate-minded, truly refined, exquisitely modest young fellow that ever was?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> unopened note to her corsage, and leans eagerly forward entreating a sympathetic acquiescence.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you know}} that?" [...] he asked, {{surprised}} at her little burst of enthusiasm, for as she spoke <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> grimy hand in both her own.|$|E
60|$|Mabel {{melted into}} tears, and <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> affectionate {{creature}} to her heart. It was near {{a minute before}} she could renew the discourse, but then she succeeded in speaking more calmly and with greater coherence.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> packet {{into his}} hand. Armand's face was ashen pale. He {{clung to her}} with strange, nervous tenacity; the paper which he held in one hand seemed to sear his fingers as with a branding-iron.|$|E
6000|$|Hushed {{were his}} Gertrude's lips; but still their bland [...] And {{beautiful}} expression seemed to melt [...] With love {{that could not}} die! and still his hand [...] <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> to <b>the</b> heart no more that felt. [...] --Gertrude of Wyoming.|$|R
60|$|Margery {{seized the}} idea in a moment. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> through <b>the</b> rift into the tree, lifted {{the cover of the}} box, and, behold, there was {{disclosed}} within a lovely white apparition in a somewhat flattened state. It was the ball-dress.|$|R
50|$|Elevator: Two {{businessmen}} {{shake hands}} in an elevator. A woman enters the elevator asking {{to get off}} at the second floor, but the men are in a freeze-frame so <b>she</b> must <b>press</b> <b>the</b> button herself.|$|R
60|$|Miss Temple made no reply, but <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> {{hand that}} held the pocket-book to her bosom, and, taking her friend by the arm, they issued {{together}} from the inclosure into the principal street of the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> hand to her bosom. Something had made her sure today that her child loved her--needed her as much as ever.|$|E
60|$|Eve gazed {{long and}} wistfully at the {{beautiful}} {{features of this}} image of her husband's mother. She traced in them that pensive thought, that winning kindness, that had first softened her heart towards Paul, and her lips trembled as <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> insensible glass against them.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "Nothing, nothing; I--I--thought it {{was getting}} too warm. Go on, dear; don't let me {{interrupt}} you." [...] After a moment of heroic self-denial <b>she</b> softly <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> register open with her foot.|$|R
50|$|As a gunner, {{she uses}} the Cowling Staff Ex-St as her {{personal}} weapon, but during combat often hesitates whether to shoot or not the enemy. At Shinjou's request, Ex-St's attack power {{is proportional to the}} strength of her intentions, so it would not create more destruction than the user wished. But even with such a function, Shinjou feels a great sense of rejection when <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> trigger. Opposites in nature, Sayama finds in her sweetness the justice he does not have, so they quickly get fond of each other and she becomes his counterbalance.|$|R
50|$|The Dwarfers take Edgington back to {{the ship}} and use her device to make her human again. She tells them how to remove the device, but they have to do the {{opposite}} of everything she suggests because all her instructions (excluding the last one) are incorrect. After saving Lister, Edgington takes a walk with Rimmer (who she seems to like) and ends up accidentally trapped in an airlock. <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> wrong button and is ejected into space. Lister gives Rimmer the accident report forms to fill in.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it!" [...] cried Bertha, proudly. [...] "I {{told them}} so. I scorned {{to hear a}} word! Blame her with justice!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> hand between her own, and the soft cheek against her face. [...] "No, I am not so blind as that." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} struggle in Emily for self-command. She {{was obliged to}} find support in a chair. The returning richness of color, excited by her walk, vanished; but recovering herself, <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> hand of her anxious guardian, and, gently waving her back, proceeded to her own room.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the banquet}} hall to-night were {{gathered}} only old and trusted friends, so here Ozma was herself--a mere girl. She greeted Dorothy with a kiss, the Shaggy Man with a smile, the little old Wizard with a friendly handshake and then <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> Scarecrow's stuffed arm and cried merrily: ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the wealthy}} count Waldemar Daninsky kills a wolf on his grounds, it {{transforms}} into a gypsy upon death, and {{he finds himself}} cursed by a vengeful gypsy witch who is angry about him killing one of her band. The witch orders a young, beautiful gypsy girl to seduce Daninsky and then, while he is sleeping, bite him with the skull of a wolf which she smuggles into the count's mansion. When <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> skull's fangs into his skin, Waldemar becomes a werewolf (without a doubt the most original of all of Waldemar's various [...] "origins" [...] in the series).|$|R
6000|$|Slight as it was, {{the shade}} of melancholy in his manner pained her. Forgetting all other anxieties in the anxiety to cheer him, <b>she</b> gently <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> hand he gave her. [...] "If that won't tell him the truth," [...] she thought, [...] "nothing will." ...|$|R
50|$|Mario {{leaves the}} GCPD and sets {{off to a}} jewelry store {{to pick up the}} rings. Gordon {{intercepts}} him and they are attacked by the assassins. Mario manages to surpass a killer, using his strength. Nygma decides to put Tabitha's hand to be rolled by a blade while handing a button. If <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>the</b> button, the blade will stop but Butch will be electrocuted to death; and if she lets her hand get cut, they will be left to go. Tabitha is doubtful about it as she is not in love with Butch. Butch reassures her that these weeks were the best days of his life and is happy to be with her. He then decides to taunt Nygma over killing Isabella but his statements do not match the car crash. Tabitha decides not to <b>press</b> <b>the</b> button and her hand is cut off. Nygma leaves just as Barbara has already found the place.|$|R
