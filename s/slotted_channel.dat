40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN) is prone to adverse influences {{from a number of}} factors such as the interference from co-located wireless systems utilising the same spectral space. Channel hopping technique was proposed to mitigate the problem via periodic change of the operating frequency, and has been adopted in the form of time <b>slotted</b> <b>channel</b> hopping (TSCH) by IEEE 802. 15. 4 e standard. This paper proposes adaptive <b>slotted</b> <b>channel</b> hopping (A-TSCH), an enhanced version of the TSCH aided by blacklisting technique. Complete design and implementation specifics are provided; and the results of experiments are analysed to show its advantages over existing TSCH. The main finding of this work is that A-TSCH can significantly improve the reliability of channel hopping scheme and thus provide better protection from interference for wireless sensor networks.

The proposed approach focuses on bypassing critical thermal resistances in motor by cooling coils directly in stator slots with oil flow. Firstly, the basic configuration and features are shown: sealed stator slots to air gap, pressure reservoirs on both side of the <b>slots</b> and <b>slot</b> <b>channels</b> for oil flow. The key to enhance thermal performance of the motor here is based on introducing fluid guiding structure in the <b>slot</b> <b>channels.</b> Next, heat transfer in the channel with guiding structure is investigated by CFD and compared with bare <b>slot</b> <b>channel</b> without guiding structure. For studying the effectiveness of proposed cooling concept, numerical analysis is conducted to compare it with HEV favored oil impingement cooling.

30|$|This article {{presented}} and analyzed a general method for distributed node selection using a random access competition on a shared <b>slotted</b> <b>channel.</b> Two access strategies were proposed: uniform access maximizes reliability; slow-start access reduces message complexity. Making slot access probabilities {{dependent on a}} node metric, both schemes can be applied for node selection. We analyzed the selection protocol theoretically in terms of reliability, message overhead, and delay. Furthermore, we tested the protocol in two case studies, namely relay selection and load balancing.|$|E

The protocol is applied in two case studies: relay communications and load balancing in wireless networks. In relay communications, a node is selected based on its channel state to serve as relay. In load balancing, a node is selected based on its battery charge state to perform a task. Results indicate that selecting nodes based on the observed metric contributes to better performance and longer network lifetime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An ultra {{high power}} density 10 -kW/ 500 -kHz {{three-phase}} pulse-width modulation rectifier (Vienna Rectifier) is under {{development at the}} Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, ETH Zurich. From preliminary measurements and numerical simula-tions the total efficiency {{is assumed to be}} 95 % at full load, resulting in power losses of up to 150 W in each multichip power module that realizes a bridge leg of the rectifier. In order to maintain the required power density of the system high direct water cooling is employed where water is in direct contact with the module base plate. Based on the measured characteristic of the water pump (pressure drop dependent on the water flow rate) the geometry of different water channel structures below the module base plate is systematically optimized based on equations which are formulated using well-established fluid dynamics theory. The design optimiza-tion is constrained by the desire to keep the geometry of the water channels in a range which allows simple and low-cost manufac-turing. The aim is to find a channel structure resulting in a min-imum thermal resistance of the power module for a given pump characteristic. In this paper, a very simple <b>slot</b> <b>channel</b> is investigated. The dependency of the thermal resistance on the cooling system is calculated for various heights of the <b>slot</b> <b>channel,</b> and an optimized channel height is determined using the condition of simple manufacturability. The shortcomings of the simple slot structure are discussed, and a novel metallic inlay structure is introduced and optimized that results in a reduction of the thermal resistance of the direct water cooling scheme as compared to the <b>slot</b> <b>channel</b> system. All theoretical considerations are experimentally verified. The general optimization scheme introduced in this paper can easily be adapted to other cooling problems.
