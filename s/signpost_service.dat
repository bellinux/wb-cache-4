40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} of African-Caribbean informal stroke carers in the UK. Design: Qualitative methodology. Setting: Three urban locations in southern England. Participants: Nine African-Caribbean informal stroke carers providing support to a relative with stroke {{for at least six}} months. Method: Semi-structured interviews were used to explore both predetermined and unexpected topics relating to any aspects of the carers’ experiences. Interview transcriptions were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Several themes resembled those identified in previous qualitative studies with informal stroke carers from other ethnic backgrounds. However, new themes emerged which were related to the carers’ ethnicity and cultural values. These themes were ‘understanding of individual needs’, ‘battle’, ‘independence from services’, ‘faith in God’, ‘family ties’ and ‘avoiding institutionalised care. ’ Conclusions: This small-scale study provides an insight into African-Caribbean stroke carers’ own perspectives. These have much in common with those of other ethnicities, but also exhibit important areas of difference. Several themes indicate issues with existing service provision. Stereotypical assumptions about informal stroke carers based on ethnicity appear to be unwarranted; there is diversity within ethnic groups. Individual contexts of ethnicity, culture and religious beliefs shape expectations and perceptions. Several themes <b>signpost</b> <b>service</b> attributes that are perceived as relevant to acceptability by African-Caribbean stroke carers. Recruitment challenges could be addressed in future projects with ethnic minority carers by collaborative planning and the development of individual relationships with key informants...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{challenges}} and controversies that healthcare professionals who work in death and dying settings face when working with service users with religion, belief, and spiritual identities. The secular-minded modern history of the nation has left people precarious of religion and belief, lacking religious literacy (i. e. the ability to talk about it) (Dinham & Francis 2015). Religious literacy is a contested concept which {{is used as a}} lens through which this thesis is framed. The study was undertaken in hospices while it reports on data from a triangulation method, including participant observation, interviewing, and focus groups. Healthcare professionals appear to have lost the ability to engage adequately with religion, belief, and spiritual identities of service users. Religion and belief have been approached as problems to be solved, rather than aspects to engage with. Solutions to deal with the religiously diverse service user population include equality and diversity laws that underpin respectful and non-judgmental attitudes, yet mask inclusivity with neutrality. Findings show that healthcare professionals are ambivalent toward discussing religion and belief related issues while the preference is to <b>signpost</b> <b>service</b> users to religious leaders or communities. Additionally, hospice organisations are currently undergoing many and various changes that are often washed down to professional practitioners. The changes include the removal of religious adornments from within the space, as well as amendments in relation to language on signs. The space is more like the portrayal of a largely secular nation that lacks proper abilities to engage with religion and belief. This study is merely opening up the dialogue in end of life care about adequate accommodation of religion, belief, and spiritual identities of service users in professional practice. This is paramount in order to fulfil requirements toward a fundamental aspect of hospice care; comforting service users from a holistic approach, beyond the bio-medical...|$|E

40|$|Rural issues {{become more}} and more {{important}} since the urban expansion tends to go beyond its social and environmental sustainability. Rural development is a priority objective of the European and international political agenda. It is underpinned by the same factors as development in general. Nevertheless they could come into action only by profound changes in this area. The main challenges arise from the increased competition and the changing role of agriculture. Knowledge transfer addresses a more and more important social need of the knowledge based economy to value research outcomes by up taking it in new products and realistic policies, {{on the one hand and}} to perform a demand driven public research, on the other hand. Processes triggered by the profound changes needed in rural area are information intensive so that rural knowledge hubs and gateways gather academic staff, farmers and businesses. There are different approaches to build up such centers that struggle to transform performance research outcomes in successful rural businesses. A survey of the international experience of such initiatives led us to outline the key features that has to be considered in setting up research networks for rural renaissance, such as bottom-up approach, free or heavy subsidized advisory and mentoring services, one-to-one communication, appropriate valuation of information and communication technologies' potential, collaborative work between farmers and entrepreneurs, project based management, businessled initiatives, local products, <b>signposting</b> <b>services,</b> developing business groups, mentor guidance. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rising {{dementia}} {{prevalence rates}} rise {{combined with the}} policy objective of enabling people with dementia to remain living at home, means {{that there will be}} a growing demand for dementia care in the community setting. However, GPs are challenged by dementia care and have identified it as an area in which further training is needed. Previous studies of GPs dementia care educational needs have explored the views of GPs alone, without taking the perspectives of people with dementia and family carers into account. The aim of the study was to explore GPs’ dementia care educational needs, as viewed from multiple perspectives, in order to inform the design and delivery of an educational programme for GPs. Methods: A qualitative study of GPs, people with dementia and family carers in a community setting was undertaken. Face-to-face interviews were performed with GPs, people with dementia and with family carers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results: Thirty-one people were interviewed, consisting of fourteen GPs, twelve family carers and five people with dementia. GPs expressed a wish for further education, preferentially through small group workshops. Five distinct educational needs emerged from the interviews, namely, diagnosis, disclosure, <b>signposting</b> of local <b>services,</b> counselling and the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD). While GPs focused on diagnosis, disclosure and BPSD in particular, people with dementia and family carers emphasised the need for GPs to engage in counselling and <b>signposting</b> of local <b>services.</b> Conclusions The triangulation of data from multiple relevant sources revealed a broader range of GPs’ educational needs, incorporating both medical and social aspects of dementia care.

40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{association}} between optimism and psychological distress in women with breast cancer after taking into account their self-rated general health. MethodsData were aggregated from the Scottish Health Survey (2008 to 2011) to derive a nationally representative sample of 12, 255 women (11, 960 cancer-free controls, and 295 breast cancer cases identified from linked cancer registry data). The explanatory variables were optimism and general health, and the outcome variable was symptoms of psychological distress. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, with optimism entered in step 1 and general health entered in step 2. ResultsIn an unadjusted model, higher levels of optimism were associated with lower odds of psychological distress in both the control group (OR[*]=[*] 0. 57, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 51 – 0. 60) and breast cancer group (OR[*]=[*] 0. 64, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 47 – 0. 88). However, in a model adjusting for general health, optimism was associated with lower odds of psychological distress only in the control group (OR[*]=[*] 0. 50, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 44 – 0. 57), but not significantly in the breast cancer group (OR[*]=[*] 1. 15, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 32 – 4. 11). In the breast cancer group, poor general health was a stronger associate of psychological distress (OR[*]=[*] 4. 98, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 32 – 18. 75).

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{characteristics of}} the services and support women want {{to enable them to}} eat healthily during pregnancy to make a potential future service acceptable to this population. Background: An unhealthy diet during pregnancy may have a significant influence on pregnancy outcome, either directly through nutrient deficiencies or indirectly through maternal weight gain. Many pregnant women in the United Kingdom gain too much weight in pregnancy, and this weight gain may lead to an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and having an obese child. Thus, {{there is a need for}} interventions aimed at improving healthy eating in pregnancy. It is crucial in developing successful interventions to understand how participation can be maximised by optimising intervention acceptability. Methods: Four focus groups were conducted; two with prenatal women (n = 9) and two with postnatal women (n = 14). Discussion focused on identifying relevant characteristics of a service targeting prenatal and postnatal women's eating to ensure that a future service was acceptable to the women. Findings: The participants’ responses were clustered into three broad themes: (1) early information leading to routine formation of healthier eating habits, (2) the delivery of practical sessions to increase information and (3) health professionals providing support and <b>signposting</b> to <b>services.</b> The participants reported wanting a practical service held in a convenient location, preferably led by women who have been pregnant themselves. The participants also reported wanting to be offered this service in pregnancy to help them get into a routine before they gave birth.

40|$|Students who commute {{experience}} {{travel and}} mobility in far more diverse – and often enriching – ways than {{the literature on}} inclusion and belonging in HE suggests. Travel time – either alone or with others – was understood by students for its therapeutic purposes and was a means through which they could manage their sense of emotional wellbeing and engage in co-present (i. e. through car-shares, and co-mobility) and virtual practices of intimacies (such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger groups). Choices about mode of transportation thus reflected the careful negotiation of concerns about comfort, affordability, affiliations to friends and kin, and efficiency, rather than single-issues such as cost reduction or green issues. Car use emerged as a key mode of transportation {{and it was clear}} that there is some tension between aims to recruit from the region and widen participation of underrepresented groups (first generation entrants, student-parents, etc.), and ‘green’ initiatives such as limiting the number of car parking spaces on campus. Everyday travel and mobility was experienced as integral, rather than as a barrier, to students’ feelings of belonging and inclusion at university. The more students felt their mobility needs, and rhythms, were understood and responded to (in both practical, pedagogic terms), the more they felt a sense of belonging to the university. Staff and students agreed that better <b>signposting</b> of <b>services</b> designed to facilitate everyday mobility (lockers, showers, car parking, overnight accommodation) would enhance feelings of belonging and inclusion and present commuting as one of several modes of participation, rather than as ‘other’. Staff and students agreed that provision for students who commute is patchy; this group is often hidden, falling within and between other minority groups i. e. mature students, students with mental health/access concerns, student-parents.

40|$|Objective: To explore general {{practice}} staff views of managing childhood obesity in primary care. Design: A qualitative study to elicit {{the views of}} clinical and non-clinical {{general practice}} staff on managing childhood obesity. Setting: Interviews were conducted at 30 general practices across England. These practices were interviewed {{as part of the}} Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) Pilot Study. Participants: A total of 52 staff from 30 practices took part in a semi structured interview. Main outcome measures: Key themes were identified through thematic analysis of transcripts using an inductive approach. Results: Three themes were identified: lack of contact with well children, sensitivity of the issue, and the potential impact of general practice. Identifying overweight children was challenging because well children rarely attended the practice. Interviewees felt ill equipped to solve the issue because they lacked influence over the environmental, economic and lifestyle factors underpinning obesity. They described little evidence to support general 4 practice intervention and seemed unaware of other services. Raising the issue was described as sensitive. Conclusion: General practice staff were unconvinced they could have a significant role in managing childhood obesity on a large scale. Participants believed schools have more contact with children and should coordinate the identification and management of overweight children. Future policy could recommend a minor role for general practice involving opportunistically identifying overweight children and <b>signposting</b> to obesity <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinical care {{alone at}} the end of life is {{unlikely}} to meet all needs. Volunteers are a key resource, acceptable to patients, but there is no evidence on care outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether support from a social action volunteer service is better than usual care at improving quality of life for adults in the last year of life. Methods: A pragmatic, multi-centre wait-list controlled trial, with participants randomly allocated to either receive the volunteer support intervention immediately or after a four week wait. Trained volunteers provided tailored face to face support including befriending, practical support and <b>signposting</b> to <b>services,</b> primarily provided within the home, typically for 2 - 3 hours per week. The primary outcome was rate of change of quality of life at 4 weeks (WHO QOL Bref, a general, culturally sensitive measure). Secondary outcomes included rate of change of quality of life at 8 weeks and Loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale), social support (mMOS-SS) and reported use of health and social care services at 4 and 8 weeks. Results: 196 adults (61 % (n= 109) female), mean age 72. No significant difference found in main or secondary outcomes at 4 weeks. Rate of change of quality of life showed trends in favour of the intervention: physical quality of life domain (b= 3. 98 (CI - 0. 38 to 8. 34), psychological domain (2. 59 [CI - 2. 24 to 7. 43], environmental domain (b= 39 [- 4. 13 to 4. 91]). Adjusted analyses to control for hours of volunteer input found significantly less decrease in physical quality of life in the intervention group (slope (b) 4. 43 (CI 0. 10 to 8. 76). While the intervention also favoured the rate of change of emotional (b=-. 08 [CI -. 52 to. 35] and social loneliness (b=-. 20 [CI -. 58 to. 18]), social support (b=. 13 [CI-. 13 to. 39], and reported use of health and social care professionals (b =. 16 [CI -. 22 to. 55]), these were not statistically significant.

40|$|Problem and background: Dysmelia {{is usually}} {{detected}} prenatally or postnatally in maternity services. The provision of family-centred care for {{parents at the}} time of initial diagnosis is crucial to facilitate decision making, access to appropriate services, and the provision of parental care-giving, but no research has investigated parent experiences or preferences in this population. Aims: The current research aimed to address this by investigating satisfaction with <b>service,</b> occurrence of <b>signposting</b> and preferences in this group. Methods: Two online surveys were conducted. In the first survey (n = 417), parents reported whether they were offered signposting information and their level of satisfaction with the service they received when initially diagnosed. In the second survey (n = 130), a subgroup of participants who completed the first survey reported their preferences for <b>signposting</b> and health <b>service</b> access after diagnosis. Findings: On average, participants were less than satisfied with the service they received and only 27 % were offered signposting information. Satisfaction was higher amongst parents who had been offered signposting information. 91 % of parents said they would have wanted signposting information and 67 % would have wanted access to a support group. Conclusions: There is a need to improve the family-centeredness of care when dysmelia is identified. Offering signposting information to relevant third-sector organisations may increase parent satisfaction and address parent preferences. These findings could have implications for parents of children with other rare diseases identified in maternity services...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{national}} carers' strategy, the Department of Health commissioned six pilot workshops spread across England for General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary healthcare workers. The six workshops were held during September and October 2009, arranged by the Royal College of General Practitioners and planned in consultation with the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. The workshops were delivered by one of two GPs and by a carer. The Department of Health commissioned an evaluation of the workshop programme. This paper reports on the attitudes towards and knowledge of carers by GPs and other primary care workers, such as community matrons, practice nurses, healthcare assistants, practice managers and receptionists. It also tracks changes over time from the questionnaire responses pre- and post-workshop and 3  months later in the GPs' and other primary care workers' response to carers. Prior to the workshops, GPs and other primary care workers saw primary care as having a significant role in directly assisting carers, especially with emotional support and in <b>signposting</b> to other <b>services.</b> However, {{there was a lack of}} knowledge about issues facing carers, limited confidence in assisting carers and few services within the primary care teams directly focussed on carers. The workshops were regarded positively by those who attended, and the evaluation found that there was a positive impact with GPs and other primary care workers reporting specific actions they had taken post-workshop to assist carers, greater confidence and awareness in working with carers, and increased knowledge about carers.

40|$|Background: Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD) {{is a complex}} disorder, characterised by instability of affect, interpersonal relationships, self image and behaviour. Recurrent self-harming and suicidal behaviour are common amongst individuals with the diagnosis, and the literature has historically placed an emphasis on parents‟ {{role in the development}} of the disorder. Despite this, with the emphasis on community support for individuals with a diagnosis of BPD, parents are frequently relied on to provide a significant level of care to their child and to manage their self-harming and suicidal behaviour. Aim: The aim of the study was to explore parents‟ experiences of self-harm and attempted suicide as displayed by their daughters, who have a diagnosis of BPD. Method: A qualitative approach was adopted and seven parents (five mothers, two fathers) were interviewed. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the verbatim interview transcripts. Results: Three super-ordinate themes were identified, including lack of control, blame and burden, and loss and isolation. These themes, along with their associated sub-themes, were identified through analysis and interpretation of the parents‟ narratives and are discussed in detail. Conclusions and Recommendations: The analysis indicated that parents‟ felt powerless in response to their daughters‟ behaviour, and that this sense of powerlessness was compounded by healthcare professionals‟ obligations to maintain patient confidentiality. Exclusion from their daughters‟ treatment and care led parents‟ to feel they lacked the necessary skills and knowledge to support their child, and many spoke about feeling angry, frustrated or exhausted. Parents‟ accounts suggested that over time they felt that health professionals increasingly involved them, with many accessing available services. Relationships with friends and family appear to have been affected, as have parents‟ life plans. To cope with the difficulties faced, parents‟ described using multiple coping methods. Despite the majority of parents‟ voicing that their daughters‟ were self-harming and attempting suicide less often, if at all, ongoing worry and self blame was evident. Although the findings are specific to the sample, they provide an insight into parents‟ experiences and emphasise the importance of collaborative working and parents receiving up-to-date information and practical advice, as promoted by modern policy documents. Additionally it appears that parents would benefit from health professionals being proactive in involving them and <b>signposting</b> available <b>services</b> and organisations. It is hoped that the findings will act as a driver for future research, for instance, little is known about the experiences of parents from other cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, exploration of parent and child experiences, and health professionals‟ attitudes towards parents, is needed...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{population}} is ageing rapidly {{and the extent}} of comorbidities will continue to increase. This greater demand for support and care will need to be met within an environment of continued economic restraint. One policy response to mitigate such demand has been the reinvigorated focus on prevention and early intervention in health, social and third sector care. Prevention is broadly defined to include a wide range of services that promote independence; prevent or delay the deterioration of health and well-being resulting from ageing, illness or disability; and delay the need for more costly and intensive services. In exploring the existing evidence base around effective and cost-effective preventative services, our typology of prevention includes the accepted discourse of primary, second and tertiary prevention, while placing those ‘upstream’ well-being interventions at the core of any prevention strategy. In particular, we recommend that a Care Navigator (CN) model is universally adopted as a central intervention in ensuring the development of a ‘seamless’ pathway for users and carers. CNs, often employed by the voluntary sector, but with a core role in multidisciplinary teams, identify available <b>services,</b> <b>signpost</b> and support access and facilitate appropriate service integration through their role as ‘link worker’. While the CN role has been implemented in many different ways, the identified core tasks consist of assessment of need, education, collaboration, communication, support, coordination and follow-up of care across the relevant pathway. Outcomes from previous (albeit limited) evaluations have demonstrated reduced use of out of hours GP services and A&E; fewer repeat attendances at GP surgeries by patients for non-clinical matters; improved take-up of outpatient clinics; and improved health-related quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{interest}} in websites as a means of increasing access to free chlamydia tests through the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England. We aimed to describe and evaluate online access to chlamydia testing within the NCSP. Methods We analysed NCSP chlamydia testing data (2006 – 2010) for 15 – 24 [*]year olds from the 71 / 95 programme areas in England where site codes were available to identify tests ordered through the internet. The characteristics of people using online testing services in 2010 were compared with those testing in general practice (GP) or community sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. We evaluated 58 websites offering free chlamydia tests through the NCSP, and 32 offering kits on a commercial basis for <b>signposting</b> to clinical <b>service</b> and health promotion advice offered. Results Between 2006 and 2010, 5 % of all tests in the included programme areas were accessed through the internet. The number of internet tests increased from 18 (1 sexual partner in the past year. Provision of sexual health information and appropriate signposting for those in need of clinical services varied between websites. Service provision within the NCSP was fragmented with multiple providers serving specific geographical catchment areas. Conclusion Internet testing reaches a population with a relatively high risk of chlamydia infection and appears acceptable to young men, a group that has been difficult to engage with chlamydia testing. In order to maximise the potential benefit of these services, websites should be consistent with national guidelines and adhere to minimum standards for signposting to clinical care and health promotion information. The current system with multiple providers servicing geographically specific catchment areas is contrary to the geographically unrestricted nature of the internet and potentially confusing for clients. </p...|$|R
40|$|The sale of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) medicines {{from community}} pharmacies offers important opportunities {{for members of}} the public to access medicines and self-treat conditions. They are increasingly recognised, however, as having the potential for abuse and harm despite their perceived relative safety. This study reports on a qualitative study that explored the experiences and views of community pharmacy staff in relation to current practices and concerns, management and support relating to OTC medicine abuse. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of ten pharmacists and seven medicines counter assistants in the United Kingdom. Analysis of interviews indicated that a range of medicines was implicated, including opiates, sedative antihistamines, laxatives and decongestants. A surveillance role was apparent for assistants, who placed emphasis on regulations, procedure and monitoring frequency of purchases to manage abuse, with referral on to pharmacists. Frequency of purchase was central to assistants' definition of those suspected of OTC medicine abuse, which pharmacists also utilised as well as a distinction between intentional abuse and unintentional medicine misuse. A lack of information about customers, easy access to, and poor communication between community pharmacies were emergent barriers to pharmacists providing more support. Many appeared uncertain of referral options or how pharmacists could effectively stop the problem of abuse. The commercial environment was a particular concern, in relation to customer expectations, medicine advertising and easy access to different community pharmacies. A key tension emerged between providing medicine supplies that permitted consumer freedom, with the needs of healthcare professionals to understand more about those consumers qua patients. Policy implications include the need for improved knowledge for community pharmacy staff about <b>signposting</b> to relevant <b>services,</b> increased awareness of who might be affected, and a review of how pharmacists can have more information about patients to inform OTC medicine sales. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The ageing {{population}} in the UK is placing huge pressure on Health and Social Care, exacerbated by current economic pressures to cut costs. The British Government is politically driving integrated care, to encourage the different services that constitute the whole system of care {{to work together in}} order to reduce fragmentation and overlap in the system. However, methods for effective partnership working towards integrated care are not well researched. This thesis details an action research project to virtually integrate Housing into the whole system of care in Conwy in particular, concluding that the methods used provide an appropriate approach for partnership working towards integrated care, thus addressing this gap. Housing {{plays an important role in}} the whole system of care for older people as a person's home environment has a high impact on their wellbeing. Poor quality housing can negatively impact on health, and care can be provided in the home due to the government's emphasis on 'ageing in place'. However, whilst the importance of considering Housing's role in the whole system of care is identified in government policy, efforts towards achieving integrated care do not commonly include Housing departments or providers. The thesis concludes that only types of housing which inherently include care (e. g. extra care, care homes) are integrated into the system, despite the fact that residents can access care in any type of housing. Soft systems methodology (SSM) is used to identify the whole system of care in Conwy, Wales. A Steering Group was established to develop an Older Persons' Housing Strategy (OPHS) for Conwy, one of the aims of which was to integrate Housing into the whole system of care. The local authority act as the 'strategic enabler' in achieving this. Each Steering Group member was interviewed to establish their role within the system, and their worldviews on it. This enabled the Steering Group to develop a shared vision for the OPHS, which is a key feature of successful partnerships to achieve integrated care. Support is identified as an appropriate integrating function and examined to establish appropriate operations structures. Through a survey of support services in Wales, it is identified that support, provided by wardens in sheltered housing, is currently going through a transition period, due to changes to funding guidelines for support. Many local authorities in England are now using offsite support, but the impacts of this are not well researched. This research provides an evidence base for practitioners looking to change the structure of their warden service. This is based on a SWOT analysis of onsite and offsite support, conducted from the data gathered during the survey. Local authorities can capitalise on the changes being made to warden services, taking the opportunity to upskill wardens and using support to integrate Housing into the care system by <b>signposting</b> other <b>services.</b> Finally, focus groups were conducted with older people to ensure the OPHS met their needs. This also served to triangulate the findings of the SSM and the survey, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining these methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Secondary school {{teachers}} are at heightened risk of psychological distress, {{which can lead}} to poor work performance, poor quality teacher-student relationships and mental illness. A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) – the WISE study – evaluated the feasibility of a full-scale RCT of an intervention to support school staff’s own mental health, and train them in supporting student mental health. Methods Six schools were randomised to an intervention or control group. In the intervention schools i) 8 – 9 staff received Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training and became staff peer supporters, and ii) youth MHFA training was offered to the wider staff body. Control schools continued with usual practice. We used thematic qualitative data analysis and regression modelling to ascertain the feasibility, acceptability and potential usefulness of the intervention. Results Thirteen training observations, 14 staff focus groups and 6 staff interviews were completed, and 438 staff (43. 5  %) and 1, 862 (56. 3  %) students (years 8 and 9) completed questionnaires at baseline and one year later. MHFA training was considered relevant for schools, and trainees gained in knowledge, confidence in helping others, and awareness regarding their own mental health. Suggestions for reducing the length of the training and focusing on helping strategies were made. A peer support service was established in all intervention schools and was perceived to be helpful in supporting individuals in difficulty – for example through listening, and <b>signposting</b> to other <b>services</b> - and raising the profile of mental health at a whole school level. Barriers to use included lack of knowledge about the service, concerns about confidentiality and a preference for accessing support from pre-existing networks. Conclusions The WISE intervention is feasible and acceptable to schools. Results support the development of a full-scale cluster RCT, if steps are taken to improve response rates and implement the suggested improvements to the intervention.
