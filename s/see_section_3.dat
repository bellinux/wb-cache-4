DynSys 3 D has been designed to meet requirements which allow a fast and modular investigation of dynamical systems. Such requirements are, e. g., extendability, interactivity, and symmetry. Some visualization examples realized with DynSys 3 D illustrate the flexibility of the system. Keywords: visualization, dynamical systems 1 Introduction DynSys 3 D is a flexible environment for implementing and evaluating new ideas in the field of advanced visualization techniques with special emphasis on three-dimensional dynamical systems.
