40|$|Context and Purpose: This {{dissertation}} {{was based}} on the authors own practical experience of working with small and micro-enterprises (<b>SaMEs)</b> over eighteen years. In his experience, many business development models, originally developed around large firms, do not take account of the needs and characteristics of <b>SaMEs,</b> including innovation theories and models which base their research on large multinational organisations with apparently little consideration for how innovation is developed, managed or measured in <b>SaMEs.</b> Therefore, the author decided to undertake research into innovation in <b>SaMEs</b> in Donegal. The three overall objectives of this research study were to:  Identify what <b>SaMEs</b> in Donegal understand by the term ‘innovation’  Investigate innovation practice(s) in <b>SaMEs</b> in Donegal  Identify how innovation can be effectively measured within <b>SaMEs.</b> Design / Methodology / Approach In a process similar to Andrews et al. (2008), a detailed literature review was undertaken which guided subsequent research activities where data was collected using in-depth interviews. The two stages of data collection were: 1. Literature review supported by in-depth interviews with key informants (government bodies, agencies) who provided an insight to innovation practices within the county 2. In-depth interviews which provided a comprehensive view of the understanding, practice, motivations, behaviours and attitudes towards innovation and its measurement amongst <b>SaMEs</b> in Donegal 4 Findings: While very few <b>SaMEs</b> are aware of innovation theories, processes and procedures, practically all of them engage in some form of innovative activity. They possess a broad understanding of the ‘concept’ of innovation and are aware of its benefits. Enterprises engage {{in a wide range of}} innovations across products, processes, people, marketing, etc. and innovation is very important to them. However, innovation is not a managed or systematic process and while this is often due to lack of resources, the small size and flexible nature of <b>SaMEs</b> also means that innovative proposals with merit can be assessed and acted upon quickly. Many enterprises in Donegal do not engage with existing innovation networks/clusters as they feel that they are not suited to their needs. The main innovation barriers include lack of time and management support for innovation, the financial risk associated with innovations, poor ICT infrastructure, complacency amongst <b>SaMEs</b> and high costs of innovation including prototyping, IP, etc. Few <b>SaMEs</b> measure innovation activities and some only measure innovation because management accounts provide them with the information to facilitate this. A significant point to emerge from the study was the benefits of management accounts to <b>SaMEs.</b> Research Limitations: Very little information exists on innovation in micro enterprises. Furthermore, innovation is a very broad subject and while a number of significant themes emerged from the literature review, it was not feasible, as part of a Masters dissertation, to investigate these issues by means of an extensive quantitative survey with <b>SaMEs.</b> Originality / Value This paper seeks to provide an insight into the understanding which regionally-based, <b>SaMEs</b> have of innovation and whether, given their unique characteristics, they can practically use accepted innovation management theories, tools, etc. It also seeks to inform support organisations and other enterprises as to the challenges faced by regionally-based <b>SaMEs</b> in trying to implement innovation activities and whether current 5 support structures adequately address their needs. Finally, it seeks to establish whether innovation in <b>SaMEs</b> is effectively measured and whether innovation metrics have benefits for such organisations. Suggestions for Further Research: Further consideration should be given to whether recognised innovation management systems, models and structures as opposed to flatter, more organic innovation models are best suited to <b>SaMEs.</b> Also, can current support structures, networks, clusters, etc., be effectively tailored so that they are responsive to the real needs of <b>SaMEs,</b> and can current support organisations and policy makers present innovation more simply to <b>SaMEs</b> in a way which is easy to understand and practical to manage and which can demonstrate clear growth benefits. The benefits of effective management accounting systems which accrue to <b>SaMEs</b> in terms of knowledge management, innovation management and marketing activities should also be considered. Finally, as little research exists in relation to innovation in micro enterprises further studies should be undertaken in this area...|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals belong to the <b>same</b> strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal {{to the other and}} vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the <b>same</b> value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the <b>same</b> strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the <b>same</b> value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the <b>same</b> strongly connected component as its negation.|$|E
