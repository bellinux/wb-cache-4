The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine the ability of different processing methods to reduce canavanine in <b>sword</b> <b>beans</b> (Canavalia gladiata). For this purpose a method for the detection and quantification of canavanine was developed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of the dabsylated derivatives. The recovery of canavanine using this method was 88 – 91 %. Optimum extraction of canavanine from raw and processed beans was obtained by addition of hot water prior to overnight soaking. The results obtained with this method agree well with previously published values for raw seeds. The method is sensitive, specific and can successfully be applied to the detection of canavanine in legumes. Overnight soaking and boiling in excess water followed by decanting gave the most pronounced reduction in canavanine content (around 50 %), followed by boiling and decanting excess water (34 %).

Two different types of P fertilizer, namely SP- 36 (total P = 36 %) and Phosphate Rock (PR) (total P = 24. 3 %, particle size distribution = 75 % < 0. 25 mm, 85 % < 0. 50 mm, 90 % < 1. 00 mm) {{were used in the}} trial. For the treatment, each P fertilizer type consisted of four rates (0, 50, 100 and 150 mg P 2 O 5 kg- 1 soil) that were arranged in a Completely Randomized Design with four replications. The results showed that the application of P fertilizers had significant effects on soil pH, soil plant-available P, the potential-P (HCl 25 %), leaf N and P concentrations, the yield of <b>sword</b> <b>bean.</b> Increased rates of both forms of P fertilizer increased the soil pH values. As the soil used had low pH and very high exchangeable Al, hence, this result is most probably related to the addition of Ca 2 + to the soil solution that resulted from the P fertiliser applied (liming effect), either from SP- 36 (monocalcium phosphate) or PR (flour apatite). There was no difference in soil available P concentration due to the different in P fertilizer types, indicating that 4 months after the fertilizer application, the relatively insoluble Phosphate Rock had the same P solubility with SP- 36. Increased rates of both forms of P fertilizer increased the <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> yield. For the application of 0 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1, although <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> crops had pods, but, they did not give any seed.

40|$|Background and Aims Forisomes are Ca 2 +-dependent {{contractile}} protein {{bodies that}} form reversible plugs in sieve tubes of faboid legumes. Previous work employed Vicia faba forisomes, a not entirely unproblematic experimental system. The {{aim of this}} study was to seek to establish a superior model to study these intriguing actuators. Methods Existing isolation procedures were modified to study the exceptionally large, tailed forisomes of Canavalia gladiata by differential interference contrast microscopy in vitro. To analyse contraction/expansion kinetics quantitatively, a geometric model was devised which enabled the computation of time-courses of derived parameters such as forisome volume from simple parameters readily determined on micrographs. Key Results Advantages of C. gladiata over previously utilized species include the enormous size of its forisomes (up to 55 µm long), the presence of tails which facilitate micromanipulation of individual forisomes, and the possibility of collecting material repeatedly from these fast-growing vines without sacrificing the plants. The main bodies of isolated Canavalia forisomes were box-shaped with square cross-sections and basically retained this shape in all stages of contraction. Ca 2 +-induced a 6 -fold volume increase within about 10 – 15 s; the reverse reaction following Ca 2 +-depletion proceeded in a fraction of that time. Conclusions The <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> C. gladiata provides a superior experimental system which will prove indispensable in physiological, biophysical, ultrastructural and molecular studies on the unique ATP-independent contractility of forisomes...|$|E
40|$|Edible {{beans are}} natural sources of {{antioxidant}} polyphenols, but their polyphenol composition and bioactivities have been little investigated compared to many fruits and vegetables. In this study, phenolic composition and bioactivities, mainly antioxidant capacity, were systematically investigated in edible beans and their related products. A large scale screening {{was performed to}} investigate antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content in 42 edible bean genotypes. Edible beans had {{a wide range of}} antioxidant polyphenols and their bound phenolics were generally higher than in common fruits and vegetables. The red <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> (Canavalia gladiata) was found to have the highest level of antioxidant polyphenols among the genotypes tested. Further study showed that the <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> coat was rich in antioxidant polyphenols, mainly gallic acid and its derivatives. In addition, pigmented edible beans had higher levels of antioxidant polyphenols than non-pigmented ones due to their pigmented bean coats, which were rich in proanthocyanidins and flavonoids, and exhibited antioxidant and antibacterial effects. Next, antioxidant polyphenols were investigated in edible bean sprouts. Germination was found to cause accumulation of antioxidant polyphenols in 12 edible bean sprouts, and the mung bean (Vigna radiata) sprout had the highest level of antioxidant polyphenols among them. Further study found that antioxidant polyphenols in green and black mung bean sprouts increased in a time-dependent manner during a 5 -day germination period, accompanied with agradual increase of several phenolic compounds, such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid and rutin. Subsequently, the influences of thermal treatments on antioxidant polyphenols of bean products were investigated. Hot air drying at 70 and 80 °C for 24 hr was found to notably increase antioxidant polyphenols in mung bean sprouts, simultaneously with evident browning and increased content of caffeic acid. On the other hand, steaming was better than boiling to increase antioxidant polyphenols in five edible bean milks. In particular, steaming substantially increased isoflavone glucosides but slightly reduced isoflavone aglycones in soybean milk. Overall, thermal treatments could induce interconversion between soluble polyphenols, and release of bound polyphenols and the products of Maillard reaction, all of which could contribute to increased antioxidant polyphenol contentin tested bean products. Finally, the effects of fermentation on antioxidant polyphenols in edible legumes and bean milks were investigated. Fermentation had varying effects on their antioxidant capacity, while in general increasingtheir total phenolic content. Fermented mottled cowpea had the highest antioxidant polyphenol levelamong eight fermented edible legumes, with substantially increased catechin content. Additionally, the lipophilic fraction had much higher free radical scavenging capacity than the commonly investigated hydrophilic fraction in fermented and non-fermented mung bean and soybean milks. Fermentation did not significantly change two main flavones vitexin and isovitexin in mung bean milk. On the whole, fermentation could improve the bioavailability of legume polyphenols. In conclusion, edible beans and their processed products can be good sources of natural antioxidant polyphenols. They can be confidently recommended for consumption in human diets to help prevent oxidative-stress related chronic diseases, and can be developed into functional foods with potential health benefits. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The results indicated that sesbania used as green manure resulted in a fresh weight content higher than the others, and promoted plant height, plant diameter, leaf area, ear number / plant, yield both before and after peeling / rai, ear weight both before and after peeling / ear, ear diameter after peeling and standard yield content / rai consequently. In addition, the ear color after peeling was satisfactory for consumers. Yield contents / rai grown on the other sources of green manures were significantly lower (P < 0. 01...|$|E
40|$|Foi objetivo dêste trabalho a determinação da quantidade de nitrogênio do ar fixada pelas bactérias que vivem associadas às raízes das leguminosas feijão de porco (Canuvalia ensiformis D. C.) e feijão baiano (Vigna sinensis (L.) Savi). A experiência foi conduzida em vasos de Mirscherlich, utilizando-se terra-roxa-misturada, proveniente da Estação Experimental Central do Instituto Agronômico, Campinas, e retirada à profundidade de 0 - 20 cm. Por ocasião do florescimento das plantas procedeu-se à colheita do {{material}} e documentou-se por fotografias o desenvolvimento e a nodulação das raízes em todos os tratamentos. No final do ensaio determinou-se o teor de nitrogênio da terra dos vasos que não receberam adubação nitrogenado, para comparação com o teor inicial desse elemento no solo utilizado. Idêntica determinação foi feita com a parte aérea e as raízes das plantas, depois de secas em estufa a 60 ° C e pesadas. Com base nos dados obtidos calculou-se que os máximos de fixação verificados com o feijão de porco e o feijão baiano correspondem, respectivamente, a 48, 5 e 73, 0 kg de nitrogênio por hectare. Tais resultados indicam que, deste ponto de vista, as duas leguminosas apresentam característica positiva para a sua indicação como adubos verdes. The {{determination of the}} nitrogen fixed from the air by bacteria in association with <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> (Canavalia ensiformis D. C.) and cowpea (feijão baiano) (Vigna sinensis (L.) Savi) was {{the main purpose of}} this work. The two leguminous plants were sown in Mitscherlich pots filled with 6 kg of "terra-roxa-misturada" soil, collected at the depth of 20 cm in the Central Experiment Station, Instituto Agronômico, Campinas County. The following treatments with three replications were compared: 1) check; 2) NPK; 3) NPK + limestone; 4) NPK + inoculant; 5) NPK + limestone + inoculant; 6) PK + limestone; 7) PK + limestone + inoculant. The amount of limestone was calculated to raise the pH to 6. 5 and the base saturation of the sail to 70 %. The fertilizer applications for N, P 2 O 5,. and K 2 O were 2. 0 g, 2. 2 g and 3. 0 g respectively, as solutions of NH 4 NO 3, K 2 HP 0 (4) and KCl. Harvesting was done at the beginning of blooming-time by cutting the plants even with the ground. Later, both the aerial parts, as well as the roots, were weighed fresh and after drying at 60 ° C. Nitrogen determination by the Kjeldahl method of these two fractions, aerial parts and roots, were mode after drying. The soil from those pots without nitrogen fertilizer were submitted to the same analysis for comparison with the initial level of this element in the soil. The data obtained indicate that the two leguminous plants showed a good nitrogen fixation capacity and that the feijão baiano was more effective. The amounts of nitrogen fixed in pots that received the best treatments corresponded to 48. 5 kg per hectare for the <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> and 73. 0 kg for the "feijão baiano". From this point of view both leguminous plants were satisfactory to be employed as green manure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFood legumes {{comprise}} all legumes {{grown for}} human food in China as either dry grains or vegetables, except for soybean and groundnut. China has a vast territory with complex ecological conditions. Rotation, intercropping, and mixed cropping involving pulses are normal cropping systems in China. Whether indigenous or introduced crops, pulses have {{played an important}} role in Chinese cropping systems and made an important contribution to food resources for humans since ancient times. The six major food legume species (pea, faba bean, common bean, mung bean, adzuki bean, and cowpea) are the most well-known pulses in China, as well as those with more local distributions; runner bean, lima bean, chickpea, lentil, grass pea, lupine, rice bean, black gram, hyacinth bean, pigeon pea, velvet bean, winged bean, guar bean, <b>sword</b> <b>bean,</b> and jack bean. China has remained the world's leading producer of peas, faba beans, mung beans, and adzuki beans in recent decades, as documented by FAO statistics and China Agriculture Statistical Reports. The demand for food legumes as a healthy food will markedly increase with the improvement of living standards in China. Since China officially joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, imports of pea from Canada and Australia have rapidly increased, resulting in reduced prices for dry pea and other food legumes. With reduced profits for food legume crops, their sowing area and total production has decreased within China. At the same time, the rising consumer demand for vegetable food legumes as a healthy food has led to attractive market prices and sharp production increases in China. Vegetable food legumes have reduced growing duration and enable flexibility in cropping systems. In the future, production of dry food legumes will range from stable to slowly decreasing, while production of vegetable food legumes will continue to increase...|$|E
40|$|The tender {{fruits of}} the leguminous plant Canavalia gladiata (Sinhala awara, sword beans) are {{consumed}} in Sri Lanka as a green vegetable. The mature seeds are also utilized {{in a variety of}} ways but not very frequently, in spite of desirable agronomical properties, for cultivation in the country. This study was performed with the intention of developing methods for increasing utilization of the <b>sword</b> <b>bean</b> for human consumption. Flour of the whole mature seed and cotyledon contained higher crude protein than other legumes, with starch as the major nutrient. The total dietary fibre of whole seed was thrice the amount in cotyledon. Sucrose represents the highest fraction of low molecular weight carbohydrates in both types of flour. In comparison with the recommended dietary intake for adults the seeds contained K, Mg and P in considerable quantities. The essential amino acid profile compared well with the FAO/WHO recommended pattern except for the sulphur-containing amino acids. Heat processing increased the true digestibility of the cotyledon grits and flour when compared to raw and soaked grits. Soaking decreased the digestibility of cooked or uncooked seeds. The biological value of the processed samples was lower than that of raw sample except for soaked and cooked grits. The NPU values of (i) cooked and (ii) soaked and cooked grits were higher than those of other heat-processed samples, and also of raw seed flour, while not different from each other. The correlation between the in vivo and in vitro digestibility values was poor suggesting that the in vitro method was not a good predictor of changes in in vivo digestibility due to processing. Starch granules were elliptical in shape. A well-defined cross, typical of ungelatinized starch, was seen under polarized light in raw and dry-heat treated samples. Wet-processed samples had lower water solubility, higher water absorption and lower gelatinization enthalpies than the raw bean flour, whereas the dry-heat-treated samples showed higher water solubility and higher gelatinization enthalpies. The starch molecular size distribution pattern indicated a higher amount of high molecular weight carbohydrates in dry heat-treated samples and a large fraction of intermediate molecular weight carbohydrates in the wet-processed samples. The low molecular weight carbohydrate content was low in wet-processed samples. The content of canavanine, a potentially toxic amino acid, was quantified successfully using HPLC. The highest decrease in canavanine content was seen when soaked overnight and boiled in excess water followed by decanting. Boiling and decanting excess water was the other effective processing method for reducing canavanine. Roasting and autoclaving were less effective in decreasing the canavanine content. The chemical composition and the protein nutritional quality evaluation indicate sword beans to be a good complement to be introduced as a new food to a cereal-based diet. The decrease in canavanine content was highest in wet-processed samples. The decorticated seed grits once soaked and cooked or cooked would have the best nutritional quality and the lowest anti-nutritional factors and thus could be used as a thickener in food preparations or be incorporated into dough...|$|E
