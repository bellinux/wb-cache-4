The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the levels of TSNAs between liquids and generated aerosol. Methods: Three EC liquids were obtained from the market. An additional (<b>spiked)</b> <b>sample</b> was prepared by adding known amounts of standard TSNAs solutions to one of the obtained liquids. N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), N-nitrosoanabasine (NAB) and 4 -(methylnitrosamino) 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) were measured. Three 100 -puff sets from each liquid were trapped in filter pads and were subsequently analyzed for the presence of TSNAs. The expected levels of TSNAs (calculated based on the liquid consumption) were compared with the measured levels in the aerosol. Results: Only NAB was found at trace levels in two commercial liquids (1. 2 and 2. 3 ng/g), while the third contained 1. 5 ng/g NAB and 7. 7 ng/g NNN. The 100 -puff sets resulted in 336 – 515 mg liquid consumption, with no TSNAs being detected in the aerosol. The <b>spiked</b> <b>sample</b> contained 42. 0 – 53. 9 ng/g of each of the TSNAs.

In the present study, this yeast estrogen assay was validated as a qualitative screening method for the determination of estrogenic activity in calf urine. This validation was performed, according to EC decision 2002 / 657, which prescribes {{the determination of the}} detection capability (CCß), the specificity/selectivity and the stability/ruggedness/applicability. To determine these performance characteristics, twenty blank urine samples of 19 -week-old calves were collected and spiked with 17 ß-estradiol (E 2 ß) at 1 ng ml- 1, diethylstilbestrol (DES) at 1 ng ml- 1, 17 a-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) at 1 ng ml- 1, a-zearalanol at 30 and 50 ng ml- 1 or mestranol at 10 ng ml- 1. Following enzymatic deconjugation and solid phase extraction, 100 µl equivalents of these blank and <b>spiked</b> urine <b>samples</b> were screened for estrogenic activity in a 96 well plate using the yeast estrogen bioassay. All of these low estrogen <b>spiked</b> urine <b>samples</b> could be distinguished from the blank <b>samples</b> as all <b>spiked</b> <b>samples</b> gave a signal above the determined decision limit CCa and the mean responses of the <b>spiked</b> <b>samples</b> were higher than the determined detection capability CCß.
