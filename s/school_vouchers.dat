5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His {{political}} philosophy extolled {{the virtues of}} a free market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and <b>school</b> <b>vouchers.</b> His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E
5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

O'Malley promised to enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for <b>school</b> <b>vouchers</b> and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro promised to continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, <b>school</b> <b>vouchers</b> and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} {{religious}} segregation causing greater society wide segregation {{can be seen}} in private schools. When parents choose {{to send their children to}} private schools, they are often religious institutions, and because religious institutions are often racially segregated, this means that students are in turn in racially segregated classrooms. There is some concern that an increase in the use of <b>school</b> <b>vouchers</b> in the United States will also then increase the number of students in segregated schools, as <b>school</b> <b>vouchers</b> are generally used to send children to private religious institutions.|$|E

40|$|Please Do Not Cite without Author Permission Under the Florida A+ Accountability Program, Floridaâ€™s {{schools are}} graded based on student {{performance}} on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT). Previously, when schools would earn their second failing grade within four years, students assigned to these <b>schools</b> were offered <b>vouchers</b> to attend private schools. However, in January of 2006 the Florida Supreme Court declared the private <b>school</b> <b>voucher</b> component of the A+ Program unconstitutional, eliminating the private <b>school</b> <b>voucher</b> threat for students enrolled in failing schools. This exogenous shock allows us to test whether private voucher threats and the funding tied to students matter, {{or whether it is}} the stigma of publicly receiving a failing grade that motivates schools to respond. We find no evidence that the private <b>school</b> <b>voucher</b> threats drove academic improvement beyond what is seen in failing <b>schools</b> when this <b>voucher</b> threat is removed...|$|R
