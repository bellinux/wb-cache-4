40|$|Abstract—To {{clarify the}} role of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system in the development of cyclosporine A (CsA) -induced rise in blood pressure (BP), the effects of CsA on 24 -hour ambulatory BP (ABP) were studied in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) who underwent a liver transplantation. On the basis of autonomic function tests, patients with absent or mild-to-moderate <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage</b> (Group A, n 511, age 29 to 43 years, disease duration 2 to 6 years) and patients with severe <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage</b> (Group B, n 59, age 27 to 38 years, disease duration 3 to 9 years) were identified. Both groups were followed for 1 year. The daily doses of CsA and the CsA whole blood trough levels between the groups did not differ. Pretransplantation values of daytime and nighttime ABP were, respectively, 11768 / 7667 mm Hg and 108612 / 6869 mm Hg in group A and 10766 / 6664 mm Hg (P, 0. 05 group A versus group B) and 10266 / 6264 mm Hg in group B. In response to CsA, BP increased in all patients, but more so in patients of group B than in patients of group A. One year after transplantation, daytime and nighttime ABP had increased by 669 / 3611 % and 12610 / 14614 % in group A and by 1266 / 13610 % (P, 0. 05) and 21611 / 27621 % (P, 0. 01) in group B. In both groups, the increase in nighttime ABP was greater than the increase in daytime ABP, which resulted in an attenuation or, even, a reversal of the diurnal BP rhythm. Because the rise in BP was greater in patients with more advanced sympathetic dysfunction, the sympathetic nervous system appears to counteract the CsA-induced rise in BP rather than causing it. This implies involvement of factors other than sympathetic activation in the pathogenesis o...|$|E
30|$|Since {{sympathetic}} innervation {{is considered}} to be a highly dynamic process with an ability to self-regenerate [28], the findings suggest that the cardiac sympathetic nervous system might play a role both in the remodeling process that is associated with paroxysmal AF and the reverse remodeling following PVI. Thus, the remodeling process of the sympathetic nervous system might have an impact on the likelihood to develop an AF relapse in the short-term course following PVI. Clinical studies indicate that this period of time is crucial for the atrial reverse remodeling process that determines the probability of sinus rhythm maintenance [2, 40 – 42]. In patients with more intense atrial remodeling the remodeling process may result in a more extensive <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage</b> and subsequently to more severe left ventricular denervation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Autonomic {{neuropathy}} {{has been}} reported in patients with alcoholic liver disease but information on its occurrence in patients with non-alcoholic liver disease is contradictory. Aim: To assess autonomic functions in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease. Study design: Autonomic function using five standard tests was examined in 20 cirrhotics (10 alco-holics and 10 non-alcoholics) and 20 age and sex matched controls. The extent of autonomic dysfunc-tion was determined in the patients and a comparison between the characteristics of patients with and without autonomic neuropathy was made. Results: Sixteen (80 %) of the cirrhotic subjects were found to have evidence of autonomic neuropathy. Of these, three (15 %) patients had early parasympathetic damage, five (25 %) had definite parasym-pathetic damage, and eight (40 %) had combined (that is, both parasympathetic and <b>sympathetic)</b> <b>damage.</b> Nine (90 %) of the alcoholics and seven (70 %) of the non-alcoholics had autonomic dysfunc-tion. Only one patient belonging to the alcoholic group had clinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, there was no significant association between subjective symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and objective evidence of autonomic damage as assessed by autonomic function tests.

40|$|Uremic {{autonomic}} neuropathy {{studied by}} spectral analysis of heart rateBackgroundThere is good evidence that power spectral analysis (PSA) of {{heart rate variability}} may provide an insight into the understanding of autonomic disorders. MethodsWe investigated 30 chronic uremic patients who were on periodic bicarbonate hemodialysis by a battery of six cardiovascular autonomic tests (beat-to-beat variations during quiet breathing and deep breathing, heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver and standing, blood pressure responses to standing and sustained handgrip) and PSA of heart rate variations. ResultsEleven patients (37 %) had an abnormal response to only one parasympathetic test. Twelve patients (40 %) had a definite parasympathetic damage, as indicated by at least two abnormal heart rate tests, whereas four (13 %) had combined parasympathetic and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage.</b> Multivariate analysis of the cardiovascular tests revealed that 19 patients (63 %) had moderate-to-severe autonomic neuropathy (AN), and 11 patients exhibited normal autonomic function. Among the symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction, only impotence in males {{was significantly associated with}} test-proven AN. The PSA of the heart rate variability demonstrated a good discrimination of low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands (LF, 0. 03 to 0. 15 Hz; HF, 0. 15 to 0. 33 Hz) among controls, uremic patients without test-proven AN, and uremic patients with test-proven AN. A significant reduction of the LF value on supine uremic patients without AN suggests that an early sympathetic involvement exists that traditional autonomic tests were unable to detect. ConclusionsOur study indicates that the current opinion of a major parasympathetic damage in chronic uremic patients on hemodialysis has to be modified in favor of a more widespread autonomic dysfunction involving both the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Following axonal <b>damage,</b> <b>sympathetic</b> neurons {{are capable}} of {{regenerating}} and reinnervating their target tissues. Some years ago exogenous administration of polyamines was shown to enhance this regeneration. Recently, {{it was found that}} axonal injury leads to a dramatic up-regulation of the expression of arginase I in sympathetic neurons. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of arginine to ornithine, which can subsequently be converted to the diamine putrescine and, ultimately, to the polyamines spermidine and spermine. In the present study, using an antiserum that reacts with both spermidine and spermine, we have found an increase in polyamine levels in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in the superior cervical ganglion 2 and 5 days following transection of the ganglion’s postganglionic trunks. Using PC 12 cells primed with nerve growth factor and then stripped off the culture dish and replated as a model system for axotomized sympathetic neurons, we found that spermidine treatment, with or without nerve growth factor, resulted in an increased percentage of cells with a neurite whose length was at least twice the diameter of the neuron’s cell body. These increases could be seen within 48 h and were still evident after 8 days. Together, these data support the possibility that endogenous polyamines are involved in the normal regeneration which occurs following <b>sympathetic</b> axonal <b>damage.</b> © 2004 IBRO.

40|$|Diabetic {{neuropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} complications of diabetes, and it increases morbidity and mortality in patients with both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Because the autonomic nervous system, for example, parasympathetic axons, has a diffuse and wide distribution, we do not know the morphological changes that occur in autonomic neural control and their exact mechanisms in diabetic patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Although the prevalence of sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathy is similar in T 1 DM versus T 2 DM patients, sympathetic nerve function correlates with parasympathetic neuropathy only in T 1 DM patients. The explanation for these discrepancies might be that parasympathetic nerve function was more severely affected among T 2 DM patients. As parasympathetic nerve damage seems to be more advanced than <b>sympathetic</b> nerve <b>damage,</b> it might be that parasympathetic neuropathy precedes sympathetic neuropathy in T 2 DM, which was Ewing's concept. This could be explained by the intrinsic morphologic difference. Therefore, the morphological changes in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves of involved organs in T 1 DM and T 2 DM patients who have DAN should be evaluated. In this review, evaluation methods for morphological changes in the epidermal nerves of skin, and the intrinsic nerves of the stomach will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if photoplethysmography (PPG) could be used to analyse the foot microvascular changes caused by diabetic autonomic neuropathy. The digital PPG signals were collected from 37 healthy volunteers (Group I), 35 diabetic patients (Group II), and 38 diabetic patients with sensory neuropathy (Group III) and analysed using MAT LAB. Prominent spectral peaks with sidebands were obtained at both the high frequency (HF) and the low frequency (LF) end of the Fourier spectrum of these PPG signals. Previous studies of microcirculation have shown that both are sympathetically and parasympathetically mediated and hence are a good measure of the autonomic activity. In the HF analysis, the heart rate (HR) response from 13 participants in Group III was severely reduced and significantly different from the responses obtained from the other two groups. However the responses from remaining 25 participants had similar characteristics to those of Group II. Hence the HF analyses failed to both statistically and objectively differentiate between the diabetics with and without neuropathy. The spectral density for the frequency bandwidth of 3 - 20 cpm was significantly reduced in the neuropathic group, compared to the other two groups. A Statistically significant difference was observed in the spectral densities calculated from Group II and III, though no difference could be established between Groups I and III. The LF analysis of this bandwidth differentiated between Groups II and III with a sensitivity of 84 % and specificity of 61 %. Activities at the LF end of the spectrum mostly represent the sympathetic control as opposed to the HR variability that is mostly a measure of the parasympathetic control. These results suggest that sympathetic dysfunction possibly precedes parasympathetic dysfunction and that PPG can assess the changes in the skin microcirculation due to <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage</b> with moderate success.

40|$|Diurnal {{variations}} in blood pressure, {{heart rate and}} pressure rate product were analyzed in 68 hospitalized diabetics (male 42, female 26) and 33 hospitalized controls (male 21, female 12) to investigate the influence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy on hemodynamics. The severity of autonomic damage was assessed by measuring the variabilities in R-R intervals of 100 consecutive heart beats in ECGs during quiet and deep breathing in the supine position and with the Schellong test. According to the results, the diabetics were divided into three groups: Normal ANS (31 patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy), Abnormal PS (27 patients with parasympathetic damage alone) and Abnormal PS+S (10 patients with both parasympathetic and <b>sympathetic</b> <b>damage).</b> The blood pressure and heart rate of all subjects were recorded for 24 hours under near-basal conditions using an ambulatory blood pressure recording device (Pressurometer® Ⅱ, Del Mar Avionics, USA). The patterns of diurnal variations and the diurnal variabilities in blood pressure, heart rate and pressure rate product were analyzed in 22 control, 21 normal ANS, 20 abnormal PS and 10 abnormal PS+S patients. The effects of atropine sulfate (2. 0 mg daily, p. o.) were also studied in 11 control, 10 normal ANS and 11 abnormal PS patients {{to determine the effect}} of parasympathetic nerve damage on the variations. Hourly mean heart rates during the daytime and mean 24 -hour heart rates were not different among the groups. However, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was a significant reduction in the diurnal variation in heart rates, with greater mean night heart rates and greater hourly minimum mean heart rates. On the other hand, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was {{a significant increase in the}} diurnal variation in the systolic blood pressure. However, diastolic blood pressure varied to the same extent regardless of the severity of autonomic nerve damage. The diabetics with autonomic neuropathy had significantly greater hourly mean and mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pressure rate product. The diurnal variation in the pressure rate product was similar to the heart rate results. Indices of the diurnal {{variations in}} heart rate and systolic blood pressure in controls and normal ANS patients approached those of abnormal PS patients after atropine sulfate administration. This result suggests that damage to the cardiac parasympathetic nerve plays a major role in the changes in the diurnal variations in heart rate and systolic blood pressure observed in diabetics...|$|E

40|$|Although {{autonomic}} dysfunction is {{a common}} manifestation of Guillain-Barré syndrome, cardiovascular involvement in this setting has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. We describe a case of reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction in a 60 -year-old man with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Our patient had no history or signs of cardiac dysfunction on initial presentation. During the clinical manifestation of his autonomic dysfunction, he developed electrocardiographic changes accompanied by mildly elevated cardiac enzymes and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and segmental wall motion abnormality, which coincided with elevated urinary catecholamine and vanilmandelic acid levels. These abnormalities, and his symptoms, resolved rapidly once the acute episode was over. We believe the reversible left ventricular dysfunction was due to the toxic effect of increased catecholamines and to the transiently <b>damaged</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve endings in the myocardium, presumably a consequence of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

The mean H/M ratio in Parkinson's disease was significantly lower than that in controls and the other diseases. The H/M ratio tended to decrease with the disease progression. In {{almost half of the}} patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage I, the H/M ratio was already decreased. The sympathetic skin response in upper and lower limbs, head up tilt test, and coefficient of variation of R-R interval were abnormal in 17 %, 31 %, 30 %, and 17 % of the patients, respectively. All the patients with abnormal autonomic functions were in Hoehn and Yahr stage III, IV, or V. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function. Twenty four hour Holter electrocardiography detected no serious arrhythmias except for one patient with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  CONCLUSION— 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy might detect early disturbances of the sympathetic nervous system in Parkinson's disease and might give useful diagnostic information to differentiate vascular parkinsonism, essential tremor, and multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease. ...|$|R

5000|$|On July 29, 1977, H.F., a 51-year-old teacher, was {{attempting}} to remove a casserole dish from her new 600-watt microwave oven. The oven signaled {{the end of the}} heating cycle, but the light and the cooking blower were on. During retrieval of the dish, she inserted two thirds of her bare forearms into the oven, for a total time of about five seconds. The oven was still operating. She felt [...] "hot pulsating sensation" [...] and burning in fingers and fingernails and a sensation of [...] "needles" [...] over the exposed areas. Jabbing pain, swelling, and red-orange discoloration of dorsal sides of both hands and forearms appeared shortly afterwards. The next day she sought medical help. Since then, she has undergone treatment with oral and topical cortisone, Grenz rays, ultrasound, and later acupuncture, without relief. Symptoms persisted, including high sensitivity to radiant heat (sun, desk lamp, etc.) and growing intolerance to pressure of clothes and to touch in hands and forearms. Neurological examinations in 1980 and 1981 did not yield a definite diagnosis. Neuronal latencies were within norm. Electromyography discovered denervation in the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and radial nerve on both arms. Severe reduction of number of sweat glands in the finger pulps, in comparison with a random control, was also found. The injury was determined to be caused by the full power of the magnetron; the pulsating sensation was caused either by the stirrer (a mechanical mirror distributing the microwave beam across the oven space to prevent formation of hot and cold spots), or by the arterial pulsation in combination with increased nerve sensitivity. Damage to the A beta fibers, A delta fibers, and group C nerve fibers was the cause of the burning sensation. The increased hypersensitivity to radiant heat is caused by the damage to the A beta, A delta, and polymodal nociceptors (the group C fibers); this damage is induced by a single-time overheating of the skin to 48.5-50 °C, and the resulting sensitivity persists for a long time. Degeneration of the alpha motor neurons is also caused by the exposure to heat and radiation. Most of the major nerve trunks were not affected. Damage to the A beta fibers (located in the skin), discovered by the two-point discrimination test, is permanent; the Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, and Merkel nerve endings, which degenerated after denervation, do not regenerate. The sympathetic nervous system was involved as well; the reduction in active sweat glands was caused by destruction of their innervation, the initial edema and reddening was also caused by <b>sympathetic</b> nerve <b>damage.</b>|$|R

ExEC provides a means for conducting very detailed analysis of weapons effects on targets for advanced mission planning purposes. ExEC is composed of a suite of high fidelity physics codes, which have been used for decades by the nuclear weapons laboratories for assessing high explosive, thermal, and structural effects. The ExEC capability {{should not be confused with}} the fast running empirical codes MEA and MEVA, which are good for fast scoping analysis. MEA and MEVA rely on look-up tables or simple approximations to quickly obtain a rough estimate of weapon damage on a target. In contrast, the ExEC capability provides a much higher fidelity damage prediction and a limitless number of target configurations by solving the time dependent conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, in order to directly simulate the interaction of a weapon with a target component. In contrast, MEA/MEVA must be calibrated for every different weapon type and target. ExEC has produced accurate simulations for weapon disablement, shape charge penetration, <b>sympathetic</b> detonation, fragment <b>damage</b> effects, and blast effects. For example, ExEC was used to look at a DTRA test performed at White Sands Missile Range, Dipole Orbit 1 (DO 1). In DO 1, a BLU- 109 bomb was statically detonated in a partially buried four-room building that was storing chemical and biological weapon simulants, as well as inactive equipment typical of a CBW (Chemical and Biological Warfare) facility. The blast wave (overpressure) histories were recorded and compared to an ExEC and MEVA simulation. A direct comparison between experimental data and calculations, for a single pressure gauge, indicated that MEVA had a 200 % error compared to 5 % for ExEC. In addition, ExEC tracks the time dependant fluctuations in pressure (for an accurate prediction of the impulse), while MEVA produces only the peak overpressure. ExEC provides added flexibility in target configurations, weapon selection, and weapon placement. For each potential target, ExEC can look into a variety of possible scenarios, in great detail, that will bound the uncertainty in achieving a mission goal. This is a great advantage on targets where it is desirable to minimize collateral damage. ExEC can provide detailed shot maps of ideal weapon placement for achieving target kill most efficiently. To do this ExEC requires more detailed information than a typical MEVA analysis...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the most}} {{important}} life-threatening disease. The heart is densely innervated with sympathetic fibers, however prolonged <b>sympathetic</b> activation can <b>damage</b> the heart, resulting in chronic heart failure. Recent findings suggest that norepinephrine (NE) may contribute to cardiac fibrosis and a loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptosis. Many studies demonstrate that NE is able to induce transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), which are two key mediators during the cardiac remodeling process. Nowadays most of the studies in cardiac remodeling are focusing on myocytes, whereas a few studies have been paid {{to the role of the}} cardiac fibroblasts (CF). In this thesis, the role of NE in cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis was investigated in CF. The mechanisms by which NE induced TGF-beta, CTGF and VEGF expression in CF were examined. Furthermore, the therapeutic potentials in cardiac fibrosis by blocking NE with adrenergic receptor antagonists were explored. Conclusions. NE is a pathogenic molecule involving cardiac remodeling. NE exhibited its fibrotic and apoptotic effects on CF in a concentration-dependent mariner. Up-regulation of the TGF-P/CTGF pathway could be a critical mechanism of NE-induced cardiac fibrosis, while NE was capable of activating Bax-Capase 3 to cause CF apoptosis. The presence of CTGF/VEGF complex in CF in response to NE may contribute to the inhibition of angiogenesis, which may be other mechanism of ischemic heart injury. These findings indicate that an increase in NE production associated with over activation of sympathetic system is harmful to the heart and may be a major cause of chronic heart failure. Furthermore, the ability of adrenergic receptor antagonists to block NE-induced cardiac fibrosis suggest the therapeutic approach by using NE receptor antagonists for patients with chronic heart diseases. Methods and results. Rat CF was isolated, characterized, and stimulated with NF (0. 01 to 100 muM for 6 to 72 h). Procollagens (I and III), TGF-beta 1, bax, bclXL, CTGF and VEGF gene expressions were measured by real-time PCR method. Collagen protein level was measured by Sirius red-based colorimetric method and Western blot. CTGF protein level, VEGF concentration, cell viability, apoptosis caspase 3 activity was measured by Western blot, ELISA, MTT assay cytometry, and flurogenic assay kit, respectively. Results showed that NE at concentrations of 0. 01 to 0. 1 muM was capable of up-regulating procollagens, TGF-beta 1 and CTGF expression (ail p< 0. 05). However, NE at higher concentrations (10 to 100 muM) significantly induced CF apoptosis (p< 0. 01). This was demonstrated by a significant increase in bax gene expression and caspase- 3 activity, while inhibiting bclXL gene expression. At this higher concentration of NE, CTGF expression was inhibited, whereas VEGF expression was promoted. However, using immunoprecipitation, the CTGF/VEGF complex was found in CF in response to NE, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis such as tube formation in cultured endothelial cells. Interestingly, addition of NE receptor antagonists produced differential effects on procollagen expression and apoptosis. For example, carvedilol and doxazosin, the alpha-receptor-associated non-selective antagonists, were able to inhibit NE-stimulated procollagens expression, but this was not inhibited by specific beta-receptor antagonists, metoprolol and propranolol, suggesting that NE signals through the alpha-receptor to mediate cardiac fibrosis. Interestingly, all four types of adrenoceptor antagonists had no effect on NE-induced CF apoptosis, which suggests that NE induces CF apoptosis via a receptor-independent mechanism. Lai, Ka Bik.

40|$|PhD (Physiology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Motivation The {{prevalence}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} is on the increase in sub-Saharan Africa largely owing to lifestyle changes associated with urbanisation. Traditional diets are being replaced with diets high in saturated fat and sugar. In addition to the nutritional transition, urbanisation in developing African countries also contributes to a more sedentary lifestyle. Together these trends contribute to a higher {{prevalence of}} obesity and hypertension that are major risk factors {{for the development of}} cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue is now widely recognised as an endocrine organ that secretes numerous inflammatory mediators as well as adipocytokines such as leptin. The primary role of leptin is to induce satiety after a meal and to suppress appetite. However, in recent years the role of leptin in the development of obesity-related cardiovascular disease has gained increasing attention and interest. Furthermore, leptin levels not only differ with regard to gender but also ethnicity. Africans have higher leptin levels than Caucasians due to higher subcutaneous fat in Africans. Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension and stroke are also greater in the African population. Taken together, it is important to investigate mechanisms by which elevated leptin may {{contribute to the development of}} cardiovascular disease, especially in cardiovascular disease-prone Africans. Aim The general aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the role of leptin in cardiovascular disease development by investigating associations of leptin with markers of sympathetic activity, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in Africans and Caucasians. Methodology Data from the SABPA (Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Africans) study was used and presented in the original research articles described in Chapter 2, 3 and 4. This study included 409 African and Caucasian schoolteachers working in the Potchefstroom district in the North West Province of South Africa. Groups were stratified by ethnicity, gender and ethnicity or obesity in order to demonstrate potential differences. We performed cardiovascular measurements and determined levels of leptin, renin, cortisol, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Independent t-tests were done to compare means between groups and Chi-square tests to compare proportions. Pearson’s correlations were determined to investigate associations as well as partial correlations after minimal adjustment for potential confounders. Multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate independent associations of leptin with cardiovascular and biochemical markers according to the specific focus of each research manuscript. Results and conclusions of the individual manuscripts  Leptin may contribute to obesity-related hypertension through its sympatho-activating effects. In the first research article (Chapter 2), we compared mean leptin levels and markers of autonomic activity between Africans and Caucasians. We also investigated associations between markers of autonomic activity and leptin. Africans had higher leptin, body mass index, blood pressure and heart rate compared to Caucasians. Furthermore, Africans also demonstrated reduced heart rate variability that is indicative of autonomic imbalance. Markers of autonomic activity that collectively reflected sympathetic overactivity associated with leptin in both Africans and Caucasians, independent of significant covariates and confounders including body mass index. These findings suggest that leptin may contribute to the development of hypertension by inducing autonomic dysfunction.  Leptin exerts direct vascular effects and may thereby contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk in the obese. We therefore investigated associations between circulating markers of endothelial dysfunction (PAI- 1, vWF and ACR) and leptin in lean and obese groups, irrespective of ethnicity (Chapter 3). As expected, leptin and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 antigen levels were higher in the obese group. We found no differences for von Willebrand factor antigen and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. In the obese group, all markers of endothelial dysfunction were positively associated with leptin in univariate analysis. However, after full adjustment in multiple regression analyses, only the association with plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 remained significant. Higher leptin levels in the obese may possibly induce endothelial dysfunction through mechanisms related to thrombotic vascular disease.  Greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress and prolonged recovery thereafter associates with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In the final research article (Chapter 4), we therefore investigated the relationship between cardiovascular reactivity and recovery to acute stress, induced by the cold pressor test, and leptin in Africans and Caucasians. Africans demonstrated greater cardiovascular reactivity compared to Caucasians. Associations of blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and arterial compliance reactivity with leptin were investigated during the stressor application and 1, 3 and 5 minutes post-stressor. There were no independent associations between cardiovascular reactivity and leptin during the stressor, and a few correlations at 1 and 3 minutes post-stressor. Associations were mostly evident at 5 minutes post-stressor and in Africans. We argue that higher leptin levels relate to impaired post-stress recovery and thereby could contribute to hypertension development in Africans. General conclusion Elevated leptin relates to <b>sympathetic</b> overactivity, vascular <b>damage</b> and delayed post-stress recovery, and thereby could contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk.
