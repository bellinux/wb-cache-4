5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle.

Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> the Swedish national culture, {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell.

50|$|Hosts that {{suffer from}} late leaf spot include {{groundnut}} species {{belonging to the}} genus Arachis hypogaea, and peanuts. Late leaf <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut that produces sexual spores {{is referred to as}} Mycosphaerella berkeleyi, whereas the asexual spore is referred to as Cercosporidium personatum. Late leaf <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut symptoms usually appear between 30-50 days following planting. Symptoms include dark brown to black pin-point spots on the upper and under side of the leaf surface. This contrasts the fewer, lighter brown spots that early leaf <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut presents. Late leaf <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut produces symptoms later in the season. These spores can be seen without magnification and give the spot a velvety appearance as opposed to early leaf <b>spot</b> <b>of</b> peanut, which can be seen with higher magnification. Even though these differences are slight, it is what helps to distinguish between the two pathogens.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a fumble}} occurs {{anywhere}} {{in the field of}} play on fourth down, only the fumbling player can recover and/or advance the fumble.

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Because of his father's {{success in}} {{business}} and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides {{being one of the}} leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father, and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of Honolulu where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few seasons, Abdur-Rahim {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of the}} Grizzlies team. In his sophomore season, he averaged 22.3 ppg, 7.1 rpg and 2.6 assists per game (apg). The following season, he elevated his performance with 23.0 ppg, 7.5 rpg, and 3.4 apg. Despite his best efforts, the Grizzlies remained grounded at the bottom two <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> the Midwest Division in his first four seasons. For the 2000–01 season, Abdur-Rahim finished with a 20 ppg-plus average for the fourth straight season and was ranked in the top 20 in 13 NBA statistical categories, once again leading the Grizzlies in both ppg and rpg. Abdur-Rahim's importance to the team was highlighted in a game against the Indiana Pacers on December 1, 2000, when he earned all of the 20 points scored by the Grizzlies in the final quarter of the game.|$|E

5|$|The alpine pika is a generalist herbivore, mainly {{foraging}} for mosses, trees branches, pine nuts, {{and plant}} stems, which it gathers {{during the summer}} to create haypiles for use in winter. These haypiles were estimated by I.V. Travina in 1984 {{to be as much}} as 30kg per hectare (12kg per acre) when the population density is around 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. This store would sometimes be shared with other species such as reindeer. In 1978, Khlebnikova documented the influence exerted by the alpine pika on plant diversity and composition in the regions they inhabit. These include reduced seed content of the soil, decreased ratio of flowering plants, and slow succession of plants such as the Siberian pine due to the pika's foraging on young trees. The remnants of the haypiles, however, might facilitate plant growth and the accumulation of pellets that create <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> nitrophilic vegetation (vegetation rich in nitrogen).|$|E

5|$|The {{triangular}} <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E

Five days later, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, he and Mikey attempted to distract Ziggler in a Career vs. title match under Maryse's command, but were unsuccessful in doing so, ultimately giving Ziggler the win. On the October 11 episode of WWE Smackdown, Kenny and Mikey took on Dolph Ziggler in a 2-on-1 Handicap match; Ziggler won but was then attacked by The Miz and saved by Rhyno and Heath Slater. On October 18th, Kenny and Mikey and the Miz defeated Dolph Ziggler, Heath Slater & Rhyno in a six man tag team match where Kenny pinned Slater. On October 25th, Mikey and Kenny received a match up for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship but wrestled to a losing effort. On the 1 November edition of SmackDown, Mikey and Kenny lost a match against American Alpha, with the latter being awarded <b>spots</b> <b>of</b> a Survivor Series line-up.
