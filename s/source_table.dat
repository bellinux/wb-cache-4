[...] It is as if you are running two separate ANOVAs with the same data set, except that it is possible to examine the interaction of the two effects in a mixed design. As can be seen in the <b>source</b> <b>table</b> provided below, the between-subject variables can be partitioned into the main effect of the first factor and into the error term. The within-subjects terms can be partitioned into three terms: the second (within-subjects) factor, the interaction term for the first and second factors, and the error term. The main difference between the sum of squares of the within-subject factors and between-subject factors is that within-subject factors have an interaction factor.|$|E

Sensitivity and selectivity were signifi-cantly better than using a diode-array UV detector. Overview Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is rapidly becoming a routine technique for efficient trace analysis of polar pesticides in {{various types of}} samples. In comparison to existing methodologies, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultraviolet (UV) detec-tion, LC-MS considerably simplifies cleanup proce-dures, reducing both time of analysis and method development time. 1 LC-MS with an electrospray ion (ESI) source avoids the thermal degradation of labile pesticides encountered with GC and {{eliminates the need for}} preliminary derivatization to increase compound volatility. The Analysis of Organophosphate Pesticides by LC/MS Application Additionally, LC-MS provides unequivocal identifi-cation of each pesticide, even if the pesticide was not completely resolved from neighboring eluants.

40|$|We have {{surveyed}} a ~ 0. 9 -square-degree {{area of the}} W 3 giant {{molecular cloud}} and star-forming region in the 850 -micron continuum, using the SCUBA bolometer array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. A complete sample of 316 dense clumps was detected with a mass range from around 13 to 2500 Msun. Part of the W 3 GMC is subject to an interaction with the HII region and fast stellar winds generated by the nearby W 4 OB association. We find that the fraction of total gas mass in dense, 850 -micron traced structures is significantly altered by this interaction, being around 5 % to 13 % in the undisturbed cloud but ~ 25 - 37 % in the feedback-affected region. The mass distribution in the detected clump sample depends somewhat on assumptions of dust temperature {{and is not a}} simple, single power law but contains significant structure at intermediate masses. This structure is likely to be due to crowding of sources near or below the spatial resolution of the observations. There is little evidence of any difference between the index of the high-mass end of the clump mass function in the compressed region and in the unaffected cloud.

40|$|Objectives and {{relevance}} of project: Ammonium nitrate production {{is expected to}} be phased out as it is security issue for the fertilizer industry and economics favor other N sources. Many farmers in Missouri have already turned to urea as a source of N for forage production. However, when urea is applied to pastures, losses of N to volatilization can exceed 50 %. Farmers are looking for a reliable and inexpensive source of N for pastures. The most promising solutions are to use a non-volatizing N source such as ammonium sulfate or to treat urea fertilizer with a volatilization inhibitor. These products might alleviate concerns from farmers and the fertilizer industry, but little research has been done to examine the efficacy of these products for fertilizing pastures in Missouri. The overall objective is to develop research-based recommendations that help industry personnel and farmers determine the best source of N fertilizer for tall fescue pastures. Specific objectives are: Objective 1 : Determine the optimum source of nitrogen for both spring (typically for hay) and late-summer (stockpiling) N applications to tall fescue pastures. Objective 2 : Determine the optimum rate and use efficiency for each source of N tested. Procedures: Treatments: Two experiments are proposed: 1) four different sources of N and four application rates of N for spring fertilization and 2) the same for a late-summer application for stockpiling (Table 1). The sources of N are urea, urea coated with a volatilization inhibitor, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium nitrate. The rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 300 lb. of N per acre) were selected to give a full response curve, so that optimal N fertilization rates can be established for each <b>source.</b> <b>Table</b> 1.

40|$|The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) {{combines}} {{data from}} NASA's Spitzer, Chandra, Hubble and GALEX observatories, together with ground-based data into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 low redshift Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs). The LIRGs are a complete {{subset of the}} IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The LIRGs targeted in GOALS span {{the full range of}} nuclear spectral types defined via traditional optical line-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. They provide an unbiased picture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxies in the local Universe. As an example of the analytic power of the multi-wavelength GOALS dataset, we present data for the interacting system VV 340 (IRAS F 14547 + 2449). Between 80 - 95 % of the total far-infrared emission (or about 5 E 11 solar luminosities) originates in VV 340 North. While the IRAC colors of VV 340 North and South are consistent with star-forming galaxies, both the Spitzer IRS and Chandra ACIS data indicate the presence of a buried AGN in VV 340 North. The GALEX far and near-UV fluxes imply a extremely large infrared "excess" (IRX) for the system (IR/FUV = 81) which is well above the correlation seen in starburst galaxies. Most of this excess is driven by VV 340 N, which alone has an IR excess of nearly 400. The VV 340 system seems to be comprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy (VV 340 North) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system and which hosts a buried AGN, and a face-on starburst (VV 340 South) that dominates the short-wavelength emission.

Narrowband AO observations centered at wavelengths of 1. 28, 2. 12, and 2. 17 micron were also obtained. The area covered by these observations is about 0. 5 pc square, centered on the O star RCW 38 IRS 2. We use the JHKs colors to identify young stars with infrared excess. Through a detailed comparison to a nearby control field, we find {{that most of the}} 337 stars detected in all three infrared bands are cluster members (~ 317), with essentially no contamination due to background or foreground sources. Five sources have colors suggestive of deeply embedded protostars, while 53 sources are detected at Ks only; their spatial distribution with respect to the extinction suggests they are highly reddened cluster members. Detectable Ks-band excess is found toward 29 +/- 3 % of the stars. For comparison to a similar area of Orion observed in the near-infrared, mass and extinction cuts are applied, and the excess fractions redetermined. The resulting excesses are then 25 +/- 5 % for RCW 38, and 42 +/- 8 % for Orion. RCW 38 IRS 2 is shown to be a massive star binary with a projected separation of ~ 500 AU. Two regions of molecular hydrogen emission are revealed through the 2. 12 micron imaging. One shows a morphology suggestive of a protostellar jet, and is clearly associated with a star only detected at H and Ks, previously identified as a highly obscured X-ray source. Three spatially extended cometary-like objects, suggestive of photoevaporating disks, are identified, but only one is clearly directly influenced by RCW 38 IRS 2. A King profile provides a reasonable fit to the cluster radial density profile and a nearest neighbor distance analysis shows essentially no sub-clustering.
