5|$|From 1852 until 1888, San Diego was {{governed by}} a board of trustees, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was no {{official}} mayor.|$|E
5|$|Page {{references}} to Dawson {{are from the}} 1596 edition; each folio or double-page spread has a single number, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> are twice as many actual sides as numbers.|$|E
5|$|Early on, it {{was learned}} that {{diseases}} were species specific, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was {{no danger of}} a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic. Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was little incentive for currency war even if it had been possible.|$|E
5|$|HDMI is {{backward}} compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> is {{no loss of}} video quality.|$|E
5|$|KMFDM's {{music has}} since been a fusion of {{electronic}} and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> is a degree of versatility and freedom in the music.|$|E
30|$|Uh-huh. <b>So</b> <b>there’s</b> the anxiety; {{it wants}} you to run away, it {{wants you to}} avoid? (KURT: Yeah).|$|R
5000|$|... 5 = 5, <b>so</b> <b>there's</b> a {{good chance}} that we were right that 6338 &times; 79 equals 500702.|$|R
6000|$|The sailor was silenced, but not {{convinced}} by his employer's logic. [...] "Well, well," [...] he said sulkily, [...] "I am going, <b>so</b> <b>there's</b> {{an end of}} it, and there's no good in having any more palaver about it. You have your object in running rotten ships, and you make it worth my while to take my chances in them. I'm suited, and you're suited, <b>so</b> <b>there's</b> no more to be said." ...|$|R
5|$|Ludvig Borga did {{not return}} to the WWF after his ankle healed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was no closure to his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two {{eventually}} formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|<b>So</b> <b>there</b> is an {{infinity}} of values which are possible {{candidates for the}} value of i'i, one for each integer k. All of them have a zero imaginary part so one can say i'i has an {{infinity of}} valid real values.|$|E
5|$|Swimming or bathing {{outdoors}} was discouraged in the Christian West, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> {{was little}} demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.|$|E

5000|$|Kagame has not groomed {{anyone to}} be his {{successor}}, <b>so</b> <b>there’s</b> nothing that points to who his successor could or should be.|$|R
5000|$|There is no trap-bath split, <b>so</b> <b>there's</b> no /ɑː/ {{in words}} like bath, grass, etc., so to rhyme with math(s), gas, etc.|$|R
5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was little point going back to the start.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> was little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder}} of their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E
5|$|After {{her high}} school graduation, she planned to attend Alcorn State University, which {{did not have a}} women's {{basketball}} team. However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This was before Title IX, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E

5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. <b>So,</b> <b>there</b> are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Appointees to {{the offices}} of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as {{happened}} on 23 January 2017). However every new appointment to the Stewardship revokes the previous appointment <b>so</b> <b>there</b> is no difficulty in situations {{in which more than}} two resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs when several separate appointments were made on a single day.|$|E

5000|$|Paul {{played his}} guitar and sang it live, a mic on the guitar and mic on the voice. But, of course, the voice comes {{on to the}} guitar mic and the guitar comes on to the voice mic. <b>So</b> <b>there's</b> leakage there. Then I said I'd do a string quartet. The musicians objected to playing with headphones, so I gave them Paul's voice and guitar on two {{speakers}} either side of their microphones. <b>So</b> <b>there's</b> leakage of Paul's guitar and voice on the string tracks.|$|R
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and <b>so</b> <b>there</b> is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
