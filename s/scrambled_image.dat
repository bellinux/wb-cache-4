40|$|High-level {{regions of}} the ventral visual pathway respond more to intact objects {{compared}} to scrambled objects. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if this selectivity for objects emerges at an earlier stage of processing. Visual areas (V 1 –V 3) were defined for each participant using retinotopic mapping. Participants then viewed intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> from different object categories (bottle, chair, face, house, shoe) while neural responses were measured using fMRI. Our rationale for using <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> is that they contain the same low-level properties as the intact objects, but lack the higher-order combinations of features that are characteristic of natural images. Neural responses were higher for <b>scrambled</b> than intact <b>images</b> in all regions. However, the difference between intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> was smaller in V 3 compared to V 1 and V 2. Next, we measured the spatial patterns of response to intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> from different object categories. We found higher within-category compared to between category correlations for both intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> demonstrating distinct patterns of response. Spatial patterns of response were more distinct for intact compared to <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> in V 3, but not in V 1 or V 2. These findings demonstrate the emergence of selectivity to natural images in V 3...|$|R
40|$|Brain-imaging {{studies have}} found {{distinct}} spatial and temporal patterns of response to different object categories across the brain. However, {{the extent to which}} these categorical patterns of response reflect higher-level semantic or lower-level visual properties of the stimulus remains unclear. To address this question, we measured patterns of EEG response to intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> in the human brain. Our rationale for using <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> is that they have many of the visual properties found in intact images, but do not convey any semantic information. Images from different object categories (bottle, face, house) were briefly presented (400 ms) in an event-related design. A multivariate pattern analysis revealed categorical patterns of response to intact images emerged ∼ 80 – 100 ms after stimulus onset and were still evident when the stimulus was no longer present (∼ 800 ms). Next, we measured the patterns of response to <b>scrambled</b> <b>images.</b> Categorical patterns of response to <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> also emerged ∼ 80 – 100 ms after stimulus onset. However, in contrast to the intact images, distinct patterns of response to <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> were mostly evident while the stimulus was present (∼ 400 ms). Moreover, <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> were able to account only for all the variance in the intact images at early stages of processing. This direct manipulation of visual and semantic content provides new insights into the temporal dynamics of object perception and the extent to which different stages of processing are dependent on lower-level or higher-level properties of the image...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} BOLD signal changes associated with <b>scrambling</b> natural <b>images</b> into different numbers of segments in visually modulated {{regions of the}} macaque monkey (macacca mulatta) brain. For 10 ° × 10 ° images, we observed that BOLDactivity in primary visual cortex (V 1) increased with scrambling, and then dramatically dropped for very highly <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> (128 × 128 segments). In extrastriate visual areas, BOLD signal levels did not distinguish between natural <b>images</b> and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images,</b> except that as in V 1 very highly <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> led to a drop in BOLDactivity. Finally in the superior temporal sulcus region and inferior temporal cortex, BOLDactivity decreased systematically with scrambling. Our {{results are consistent with}} the view that the BOLD signal might reflect average activation of local orienation detectors in V 1, and sensitivity to more global object representations in higher visual areas. In addition, we quantify the effects of scrambling on the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the images. This analysis shows that scrambling causes substantial changes to the spatial frequency content of images. This suggests that low-level accounts for reduced BOLD activation in higher visual areas cannot be completely ruled out based on scrambling data...|$|R

In this paper, Partial image scrambling method is proposed using Non Sinusoidal wavelets, the image is scrambled in the wavelet domain using Kekre's Walsh Sequency algorithm and then an inverse transform is applied to get the <b>scrambled</b> <b>image</b> in spatial domain. The scrambling in wavelet domain helps resists against statistical attacks.

40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>scrambling</b> is an {{important}} technique in digital image encryption and digital image watermarking. This paper's main purpose is to research how to <b>scramble</b> <b>image</b> by space-bit-plane operation (SBPO). Based on analyzing traditional bit operation of individual pixels <b>image</b> <b>scrambling</b> method, this paper proposed a new scrambling algorithm. The new scrambling algorithm combined with SBPO and chaotic sequence. First, every eight pixels from different areas of image were selected according to chaotic sequence, and grouped {{together to form a}} collection. Second, the SBPO was performed in every collection and built eight pixels of the image with new values. The <b>scrambling</b> <b>image</b> was generated when all pixels were processed. In this way, the proposed algorithm transforms drastically the statistical characteristic of original image information, so, it increases the difficulty of an unauthorized individual to break the encryption. The simulation results and the performance analysis show that the algorithm has large secret-key space, high security, fast scrambling speed and strong robustness, and is suitable for practical use to protect the security of digital image information over the Internet...|$|R

Image encryption is used to transmit sensitive multimedia information in unsecured networks to provide high de-gree of confidentiality. In this paper, a new image encryption method is proposed based on novel implementation of pixel scan, utilizing the Knight‟s Travel Path, and true ran-dom number. The Knight‟s travel path is a pattern in which the path of a Knight around a chess board is taken without revisiting any node. This travel path pattern is used to per-mute the pixel positions of the original image to obtain the <b>scrambled</b> <b>image.</b> The scram-bled image is further XORed with the random key numbers to get the cipher image. To change the pixel values of the <b>scrambled</b> <b>image,</b> true random numbers are generated from the amplitude values of a chosen noise audio file.

Digital <b>image</b> <b>scrambling</b> or encryption is the solution which transforms a meaningful image into a meaningless or disordered image in order to enhance the ability to confront attack and in turn improve the security. This paper presents a new scheme for digital <b>image</b> <b>scrambling</b> based on the principle of information entropy. The quad tree decomposition technique is used to hierarchically divide the image into blocks or regions for enforcing security at the block or region level of an image, which thus ensures the security of the entire image.

40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{revealed}} distinct patterns {{of response to}} different object categories in the ventral visual pathway. These findings imply that object category is an important organizing principle in this region of visual cortex. However, object categories also differ systematically in their image properties. So, {{it is possible that}} these patterns of neural response could reflect differences in image properties rather than object category. To differentiate between these alternative explanations, we used images of objects that had been phase-scrambled at a local or global level. Both scrambling processes preserved many of the lower-level image properties, but rendered the images unrecognizable. We then measured the effect of <b>image</b> <b>scrambling</b> on the patterns of neural response within the ventral pathway. We found that intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> evoked distinct category-selective patterns of activity in the ventral stream. Moreover, intact and <b>scrambled</b> <b>images</b> of the same object category produced highly similar patterns of response. These results suggest that the neural representation in the ventral visual pathway is tightly linked to the statistical properties of the image...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{internet}} allows large multimedia files to be easily stored and transmitted. The multimedia data {{plays a major role}} in medical imaging, telemedicine, military and satellite communications. It is important to protect the multimedia data from unauthorized disclosure during the transmission. Traditional cryptosystems, such as AES, DES, and IDEA provides security for text encryption but are not ideal for image encryption. Image encryption methods based on bit permutation, pixel permutation, and block transformations are introduced by various researchers in the literature. An image encryption method for permuting the pixels based on Knight Travel path and True Random Numbers is proposed in this paper. The Knight travel is a pattern in which the path of a knight around a chess board without revisiting any particular node is taken and it is used as a SCAN pattern. When this pattern is applied to an image, the obtained image will be a <b>scrambled</b> <b>image.</b> The random key stream is the one which consists of random values used in image encryption for XOR operation. The audio file is considered as key which has a range of amplitude values producing the random key stream.

Also, another lesson is that we can control the incomplete decoded image quality using a specialized key individually. Subsequently, the watermark information is correctly extracted from the watermarked image by using this approach. The watermarked images are in good visual quality and have high PSNR values. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been demonstrated with the aid of experimental results.|$|E

Both locations within the sample are then brought to the exact same position in front of the scattering layer one after another. As expected, the scattering layer scrambled the fluorescence signals from the guide star, as well as from the scene, heavily. We used the scattered fluorescent image of the guide star as the point spread function (PSF). We then deconvoluted the <b>scrambled</b> <b>image</b> of the scene using this PSF.|$|E
