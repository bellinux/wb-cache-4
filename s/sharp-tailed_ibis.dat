50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> (Cercibis oxycerca) is {{a species}} of ibis native to open wet savannas in parts of {{northern}} South America.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{sympatric}} glossy ibis, the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> largely feeds terrestrially or semi-terrestrially; {{either on}} open land or in short grass. It typically forages in moist soil, shallow mud and along marshy edges of lagoons and rice fields. However, it also occasionally forages {{in shallow water}} at depths of 3 cm or less. It is less aquatic in its feeding habits than many other South American Ibises. Throughout the sharp-tailed ibis’s range, only the buff-necked ibis forages on drier, higher-altitude ground. More rarely, the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> has been observed to forage in gallery forests during the wet season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> is monotypic, {{being the}} only {{representative}} of the genus Cercibis. Much remains unknown about this ibis’s evolutionary history; however, phylogenetic analyses based on skull morphology and function {{suggest that it is}} closely related to the spoonbills.|$|E
50|$|One natural {{enemy of}} this ibis {{may be the}} black-collared hawk Busarellus nigricollis, one {{individual}} of which has once been observed to pursue a <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> over a flooded marsh. Further, the ibis flew with a rapid twisting flight which was unusual considering its normally torpid wing beating.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> feeds {{primarily}} on medium-sized insects, {{especially in the}} dry season. It also occasionally feeds on amphibians, crustaceans, earthworms and snails. Its tendency to forage in pairs or small groups may be partly attributable to the relatively dispersed distribution of its insect prey in the llanos.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> has a slow, laboured flight; with {{individuals}} flying low {{above the ground}} and often only covering short distances such as between neighbouring trees. However, they have been observed to fly across wide open expanses of grassland toward roosting or feeding sites. Due to its noisy wing beating, it is often heard before coming into view.|$|E

50|$|Unusually for a {{wading bird}} of the llanos, this ibis breeds {{in the dry}} season months from August until February; whereas the {{majority}} of llanos avifauna breeds in the wet season around May to October. The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> breeds solitarily in gallery forests, where egg-laying is believed to occur from August to September; and fledged offspring remain with their parents until late February. Average egg measurements have been reported as 65.9 x 44mm and the average egg weight as 70g. In a six-year wading bird survey of Masaguaral in the llanos, the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> was never seen on the lowland grasslands during the dry-season months of August and December. In one other study, it was not sighted in the months of December and January. Its secretive nesting behaviours probably explains its apparent absence from the open llanos grasslands during the breeding season. Details of courtship in this species are largely unknown. However, preening behaviours between mates have been observed in which one individual nibbles with its bill {{at the base of}} the other’s bill; which could potentially be part of courtship. Additionally, larger individuals have been observed to preen smaller individuals assumed to be their offspring, which also sometimes gently peck with their bills at the larger individuals in return.|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the green ibis in 1789, from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana, Johann Friedrich Gmelin {{gave it the}} scientific name Tantalus cayennensis, assigning it to the same genus {{as a number of}} Old World ibis species. In 1930, James Lee Peters moved it to the monotypic genus Mesembrinibis; it has no subspecies. DNA-DNA hybridization studies show that the species falls squarely into the New World ibis clade, with its closest relatives being the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis,</b> the American white ibis and the buff-necked ibis.|$|E
50|$|Feeding by this ibis is {{primarily}} tactile. Its typical foraging method consists in walking quickly on moist soil and through shallow mud or water; probing habitually {{deeply into the}} moist underlying substrate for prey. It is relatively flexible in microhabitat use, foraging either on open ground or in short grass. Several individuals have been observed with dried mud {{along the length of}} their bill. Its foraging highly resembles that of the glossy ibis and buffnecked ibis. Despite the largely overlapping niches, the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> may be more active during the morning than other sympatric ibises; hence suggesting temporal niche partitioning. There may also be differences between these sympatric ibis species in specific dry-season probing depths and microhabitat use within the large-scale savannas.|$|E
50|$|Despite this ibis’s {{infrequent}} {{occurrence in}} its savannah habitat, the population {{appears to have}} remained stable since the early 20th century; There have been no trade records of this species, and the global population is {{not considered to be}} threatened generally. The world population has been estimated at 10,000-25,000 individuals, with 6700-17000 of these being mature. The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> has been evaluated by the IUCN as Least Concern since 2004 because this bird does not approach Vulnerable under the population trend and range size criteria. Nevertheless, this species could potentially decline unnoticed due to its solitary lifestyle and hence the potential difficulty in detecting individuals during population monitoring. Further information on its basic biology and ecology is required to safeguard it against appreciable future population declines.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>ibis</b> inhabits wet lowland savannas and riverbanks of {{northern}} South America {{east of the}} Andes, at less than 300-500m above sea level. It is native to Venezuela, eastern Colombia, southwestern Guyana, Brazil and Suriname. In Venezuela, it is typically found along or near the Orinoco and Apure rivers. In the llanos of eastern Colombia, it is found along the Casanare and Cravo Sur rivers, {{as well as the}} Colombian stretch of the Apure. In Brazil, it often occurs to the northwest of the Amazon and frequents the grasslands near to the Rio Negro and Rio Branco. However, it is also present to the west near Rio Guanco and to the south in northwest Mato Grosso. This ibis also sometimes uses gallery forests in which to roost and breed.|$|E
