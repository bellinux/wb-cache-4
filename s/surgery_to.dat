5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during <b>surgery</b> <b>to</b> assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
