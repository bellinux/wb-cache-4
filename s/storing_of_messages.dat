50|$|From July 1989, a new mailbox {{system was}} {{introduced}} which allowed for single messages {{of up to}} five frames in length, <b>storing</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> prior to sending, sending to multiple recipients, either individually or via a mailing list, forwarding of messages, and requesting an acknowledgment of receipt. Whilst sending a simple mailbox using none of the new facilities remained free, {{all of the new}} options were charged at 1p per use per recipient. For the first time, the sending of spam was accounted for and permitted, albeit at 20p per recipient. In addition, the stored message facility was replaced by a summary page, which listed all the messages, both new and old, that were waiting. The user could then pick which message to view, rather than being required to read through them all in chronological order. As only the first 20 could be accessed, this effectively allowed for up to 19 messages to be stored while allowing the continued reception of new mail.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of network coding for {{anonymous}} broadcast. Network coding, the technique <b>of</b> transmitting or <b>storing</b> mixtures <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> rather than individual messages, can provide anonymity with its mixing nature, efficiently disseminate content in multicast and broadcast networks, and resiliently deliver messages despite packet erasure and constrained network resources. While broadcast mediums guarantee receiver anonymity, they {{are thought to be}} difficult to emulate efficiently over unicast networks. This thesis introduces NCGAB, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay network based on network coded gossip that provides a resilient, anonymous broadcast medium. Unlike most anonymous communication systems, NCGAB requires no cryptosystem, no infrastructure of trust, and no special nodes to operate. This thesis also introduces Melting Pad, an algebraic coding scheme with properties of information theoretic security and efficient decodability, designed to protect messages for wide dissemination and for hosting with diminished liability. by Ivan A.

40|$|To provide high {{availability}} for {{services such as}} mail or bulletin boards, data must be replicated. One way to guarantee consistency of replicated data is to force service operations {{to occur in the}} same order at all sites, but this approach is expensive. In this paper, we propose lazy replication as a way to preserve consistency by exploiting the semantics of the service's operations to relax the constraints on ordering. Three kinds of operations are supported: operations for which the clients define the required order dynamically during the execution, operations for which the service defines the order, and operations that must be globally ordered with respect to both client ordered and service ordered operations. The method performs well in terms of response time, amount <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> state, number <b>of</b> <b>messages,</b> and availability. It is especially well suited to applications in which most operations require only the client-defined order...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWillshaw {{networks}} are {{a type of}} associative memories with a storing mechanism characterized by a strong redundancy. Namely, all the subparts <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> get connected to one another. We introduce an additional specificity, by imposing the constraint of a minimal space separating every two elements <b>of</b> a <b>message.</b> This approach results from biological observations, knowing that in some brain regions, a neuron receiving a stronger stimulation can inhibit its neighbors within a given radius. Theoretical arguments are derived to quantify the benefits of this method in terms of memory usage as well as pattern completion ability. We experiment with different values of the inhibition radius introduced, and we study {{its impact on the}} error rate in the retrieval <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> <b>messages.</b> We show that this added constraint can result in significatively better performance of the Willshaw network, either when reducing its set of connections, or when extending its set of neurons while maintaining the memory resource...|$|R

We propose a web-like structure for Mil Archives and we present first steps towards the design of efficient search engines to recover mil information that may use the structure embedded in Mail Archives.

40|$|The {{problem of}} private {{information}} retrieval with private side information (PIR-PSI) is recently introduced by Kadhe et al. In this problem, N replicated databases each <b>store</b> K <b>messages,</b> <b>of</b> which M {{are known to}} the user as side-information. The identity <b>of</b> these M <b>messages</b> is unknown to the databases. The user wishes to retrieve, as efficiently as possible, a new desired message without revealing any information about the joint indices of the desired and side-information messages. We show that the capacity of PIR-PSI is (1 + 1 /N+ 1 /N^ 2 + [...] . + 1 /N^K-M- 1) ^- 1. Thus, the capacity of PIR-PSI with K messages, N databases and side-information <b>of</b> M <b>messages</b> {{is identical to the}} capacity of PIR with K-M messages, N databases and no side-information, which was found previously by Sun and Jafar. The achievability and converse proofs are essentially inherited from the original work of Sun and Jafar...|$|R

50|$|The {{major issue}} is {{length of time}} a key is to be used, and {{therefore}} frequency of replacement. Because it increases any attacker's required effort, keys should be frequently changed. This also limits loss of information, as the number <b>of</b> <b>stored</b> encrypted <b>messages</b> which will become readable when a key is found will decrease as the frequency of key change increases. Historically, symmetric keys {{have been used for}} long periods in situations in which key exchange was very difficult or only possible intermittently. Ideally, the symmetric key should change with each message or interaction, so that only that message will become readable if the key is learned (e.g., stolen, cryptanalyzed, or social engineered).|$|R

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a {{class of}} {{emerging}} networks where disconnections may occur frequently due to propagation phenomena, node mobility, and power outages. Delay is inevitable in DTNs, thus, making better use of buffer space to maximize the packet delivery rate {{is more important than}} concentrating on how to decrease the delay. In this paper, we improve the buffer scheme of Epidemic Routing, which is a well-known routing protocol in DTNs. Epidemic Routing utilizes the FIFO buffer management scheme to manage the queuing. However, Epidemic Routing is still very sensitive to the buffer size. Epidemic Routing, furthermore, can only achieve good performance with respect to infinite buffer size due to that a node may have enough space to <b>store</b> lots <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> in its buffer and carry them along for long periods of times until appropriate forwarding opportunities arise. Once there is not enough buffer size, then the performance of Epidemic Routing will fall down hastily. We propose a new buffer scheme in Epidemic Routing, named Location and Direction Aware Drop Scheme (LDDS). LDDS utilizes the location and moving direction information of nodes to determine the drop sequence. A node can get the location and moving direction information of other nodes by receiving beacon packets periodically from anchor nodes and referring to received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for the beacon. In particular, LDDS is able to guarantee the high packet delivery ratio under small buffer size...|$|R
40|$|A {{definition}} of intrapersonal communication is needed that will encompass noncognitive elements and thus {{allow for a}} broader range of research methodologies. One possible definition is the physiological and psychological decoding, processing, <b>storing,</b> and encoding <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> that happen within individuals at conscious and nonconscious levels whenever they communicate with themselves or others for the purposes of defining, maintaining, or developing their social, psychological, or physical selves. Such a definition differs from other conceptualizations in several ways. First, it considers both physiological and psychological processes. Second, it includes conscious and nonconscious communication processes. Third, it specifies functions that frame the intrapersonal domain. Finally, it extends the situations in which intrapersonal communication can be, considered by focusing on the functions of intrapersonal communication rather than on situations in which people find themselves. Broadening the definitional boundaries of intrapersonal communication to include physiological processes can give impetus to new research techniques and allow for additional insights into how and why various communication processes function.

40|$|An {{associative}} memory is {{a framework of}} content-addressable memory that <b>stores</b> a collection <b>of</b> <b>message</b> vectors (or a dataset) over a neural network while enabling a neurally feasible mechanism to recover any message in the dataset from its noisy version. Designing an {{associative memory}} requires addressing two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise representation of the dataset {{in the form of}} a graphical model (or a neural network), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> vector from the dataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm over the network learnt during the learning phase. This paper studies the problem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a network representation for a large dataset that ensures correction against a large number of adversarial errors during the recall phase. Specifically, the associative memories designed in this paper can store dataset containing (n) n-length message vectors over a network with O(n) nodes and can tolerate Ω(n/ polylog n) adversarial errors. This paper carries out this memory design by mapping the learning phase and recall phase to the tasks of dictionary learning with a square dictionary and iterative error correction in an expander code, respectively.

The work of Gripon and Berrou proposes two retrieval rules, SUM - OF - SUM and SUM - OF - MAX. In this paper, we implement both rules on a general purpose graphical processing unit (GPU). SUM - OF - SUM uses only matrix-vector multiplication and is easily implemented on the GPU, whereas SUM - OF - MAX, which involves non-linear operations, is much less straightforward to fulfill. However, SUM - OF - MAX gives significantly better retrieval error rates. We propose a hybrid scheme tailored for implementation on a GPU which achieves a 880 -fold speedup without sacrificing any accuracy...|$|R

The applications that handle the {{transmission of}} audio and video have different demands compared to conventional data transmission. For instance, the timing aspect is a central issue.
