40|$|The {{implementation}} of reliable and efficient geometric algorithms is a challenging task. The {{reason is the}} following conflict: On the one hand, computing with rounded arithmetic may question the reliability of programs while, on the other hand, computing with exact arithmetic may be too expensive and hence inefficient. One solution is the {{implementation of}} controlled perturbation algorithms which combine the speed of floating-point arithmetic with a protection mechanism that guarantees reliability, nonetheless. This paper {{is concerned with the}} performance analysis of controlled perturbation algorithms in theory. We answer this question with the presentation of a general analysis <b>tool</b> <b>box.</b> This <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> is separated into independent components which are presented individually with their interfaces. This way, the <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> supports alternative approaches for the derivation of the most crucial bounds. We present three approaches for this task. Furthermore, we have thoroughly reworked the concept of controlled perturbation in order to include rational function based predicates into the theory; polynomial based predicates are included anyway. Even more we introduce object-preserving perturbations. Moreover, the <b>tool</b> <b>box</b> is designed such that it reflects the actual behavior of the controlled perturbation algorithm at hand without any simplifying assumptions.
