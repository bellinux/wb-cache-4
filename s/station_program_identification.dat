50|$|In 2005, ACNielsen {{initiated}} their MVP (Media Voice Panel) program. Panel members {{carry an}} electronic monitor that detects the digital <b>station</b> and <b>program</b> <b>identification</b> codes hidden within the TV and radio broadcasts {{they are exposed}} to. At night, members place the monitor in a cradle that sends the collected data through the home's electrical wiring to a relay device that transmits it by phone, {{making it one of}} the first practical uses of electrical wiring as a home network. With an approximately one week notice to members, the MVP program ended on March 17, 2008.|$|R
50|$|Bozeman {{worked on}} some NBC network {{programs}} http://www.dailymotion.com/cmpb301/video/x4o5hr_audio-satmoviebumper1975_shortfilms, {{but the majority}} of his duties consisted of live booth-announcing work - including promotional spots, bumpers, <b>station</b> <b>identifications,</b> <b>program</b> introductions, live tags and sign-offs - for the local network owned-and-operated station, KNBC. He alternated with his colleagues in introducing the station's NewsCenter 4 every night, and in being thanked on the air by anchor John Schubeck.

However, the voice for the resumption of this program was strong, and in 2003, a new, CGI version of {{the program was}} produced, with refined graphics and made for the then-new technology of digital terrestrial television. Between 2003 and 2008, the analog feed aired a simple animation of the Nippon Television logo forming up. In 2008, {{as a part of the}} station's 55th Anniversary celebrations, the clip got a new, shortened version.|$|R
