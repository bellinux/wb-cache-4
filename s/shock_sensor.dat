50|$|The {{simplest}} aftermarket alarms are one-piece {{units with}} a siren and control module. The {{most common type}} of sensor is a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> and two wires (12-volt constant power and ground) which are connected to the car's battery. This type of alarm is triggered by vibration transferred to the <b>shock</b> <b>sensor,</b> or by voltage changes on the input (the alarm assumes that a sudden change in voltage is due to a door or trunk being opened, or the ignition being turned on); however it is very prone to false triggers on late-model vehicles with many electronic control modules, which can draw current with the ignition off.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} aftermarket alarms are wired {{into the}} vehicle's electronics individually. Typically, these alarms have inputs {{for power and}} ground, {{as well as for}} positive- and negative-switched door open circuits, negative trunk and/or hood circuits, and ignition-switched circuits to detect the ignition being turned on; aftermarket alarms also usually have a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> which may be built into the control module or external to it.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some {{aftermarket}} alarms have {{provisions for}} optional sensors (these must be purchased separately). The tilt sensor can sense the vehicle being tilted (alerting to towing). Tilt sensors come in digital or mercury. A digital sensor is more accurate since it sets itself, {{allowing for the}} vehicle {{to be placed on}} a hill and not cause false triggers. A sound discriminator or glass breakage sensor senses only the sound of glass breaking. Typically, a sound discriminator sensor can be eliminated using a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor.</b> Proximity, infrared, or motion sensors sense motion inside or outside the vehicle; these are typically installed on convertible or T-top vehicles. The sensors mentioned here are usually adjustable in order to avoid false alarms. For example, a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> will sometimes vibrate due to a loud noise in the area, or an accidental bump to the car from a passerby. Proximity sensors can cause false alarms in parking lots when a passerby is entering or exiting a vehicle parked next to the armed car. These can cause the alarm to falsely sense an attempted break-in.|$|E
40|$|Latching <b>shock</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{acceleration}} threshold {{sensors that}} trigger when the acceleration level exceeds the designed acceleration threshold. The latching mechanism provides a mechanical memory, which keeps the sensor in a triggered, or latched, state until the sensor is reset. The attractive {{feature of this}} type of sensor {{is that it does not}} require power during monitoring; power is only needed to query and reset the sensor. Several devices have been presented in the literature, but with limited experimental data and models that provide little to no insight into the dynamics of the latching event. The aim of this work is to further the understanding of the physics and design of micromechanical latching <b>shock</b> <b>sensors</b> by conducting a combination of careful experiments and development of original reduced-order models. These efforts enable one to obtain a detailed picture of the latching dynamics for the first time. Latching <b>shock</b> <b>sensors</b> have been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated in this work. The model predictions have been compared to the experimental results to verify the validity, including a quantitative comparison of th...|$|R

The measured data reveals whether the goods in transit have been subjected to potentially damaging conditions. Based on this data, the options may be: ...|$|R
50|$|Generally, OEM alarms {{monitor the}} doors and trunk/hatch for {{unauthorized}} entry. On some vehicles this is done through pin switches, mercury switches, or microswitches integrated into the latch. On others, the doorlock mechanisms have switches built into them. Some OEM alarms additionally will trigger if the hood is opened, or if the ignition is turned on. A few systems have a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> which will trigger upon a significant impact to the vehicle's body, such as window glass being broken. Motion sensors monitoring the vehicle's interior are installed in some higher end models.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} was co-developed with Etak; the system utilized a modified hockey puck, {{cut in half}} to embed an array of infrared emitters, a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an embedded circuit board and battery. The halves of the puck were then bound back together using an epoxy. The modified pucks were engineered {{to have the same}} weight and balance as an unmodified NHL puck; chief engineer Rick Cavallaro noted that players could tell if the puck was even slightly off its normal weight, as it behaved differently. He stated that around 50 pucks were brought to each game that uses the system.|$|E
5000|$|On its {{launch in}} 1979, the Alfa 6 was the {{flagship}} of the Alfa Romeo range. The four-door body was fairly conventional {{and used a}} similar style to the existing Alfa Romeo Alfetta, and in fact both vehicles share {{a great number of}} parts, including door panels; Design work on the 6 was done prior to the Alfa Romeo Alfetta, but the fuel crisis of 1973 delayed further development and led to the 6's belated 1979 debut. The styling was not particularly aerodynamic but the drag coefficient was a somewhat respectable 0.41. Power came from an all-new 2.5 V6 engine which generated [...] at 5600 rpm using a total of six carburettors and a single, belt driven camshaft in each cylinder head. Power steering, power windows, central locking, electric wing mirrors and a 25% limited slip differential were standard, making the Alfa 6 competitively priced compared to similar saloons of that time where such equipment typically was a costly extra. The car was also designed to set new standards in safety; for example it featured a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> in the boot which would cut off the fuel supply {{in the event of a}} crash.|$|E
50|$|Seismic glass-break detectors, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as <b>shock</b> <b>sensors,</b> are different {{in that they are}} installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, {{depending on the type of}} glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.|$|R
5000|$|FoxTrax, also {{referred}} to as the glowing puck, is an augmented reality system that was utilized by Fox Sports' telecasts of the National Hockey League. The system was intended to help television viewers visually follow the puck on the ice; it utilized modified hockey pucks containing <b>shock</b> <b>sensors</b> and infrared emitters, which were then read by sensors and computer systems to generate on-screen graphics to enhance vision of the puck for the television audience, such as a blue [...] "glow" [...] around the puck, and trails to indicate the hardness and speed of shots.|$|R

40|$|A shock-capturing {{methodology}} {{is developed}} for non-linear computations using low-dissipation schemes and centered finite differences. It consists in applying an adaptative second-order filtering to handle discontinuities {{in combination with}} a background selective filtering to remove grid-to-grid oscillations. The shock-capturing filtering is written in its conservative form, and its magnitude is determined dynamically from the flow solutions. A shock-detection procedure based on a Jameson-like <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> is derived. A second-order filter with reduced errors in the Fourier space {{with respect to the}} standard second-order filter is also designed. Linear and non-linear problems are solved to show that the methodology is capable of capturing shocks without providing dissipation outside shocks.

40|$|The use of MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) sensors in {{multiple}} applications of environmental monitoring help {{to fill the}} need of a small scale, low power monitoring and sensing applications. In this design, the use of single-die multiple MEMS sensors to monitor ambient temperature, relative humidity, and accelerative high-g shock were developed and tested. In addition to the sensors, signal conditioning circuits were developed for outputting the sensor data into a microcontroller to analyze and process the signals into useful information for human operators to analyze. The three sensors were fabricated using a bulk micro-machined process on 100 mm silicon wafers developed in the RIT SMFL. This work extends previous work on a multisensor from a year earlier. Ion implantation is now used to tune doping levels. To help reduce cross-talk between sensors, p-wells were introduced to aid in substrate isolation. A parallel plate humidity sensor was developed, bringing {{the need to develop}} in-line processing of polyimide. Lastly, the one-axis <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> is upgraded into a three-axis <b>shock</b> <b>sensor.</b> The temperature sensor is made using a PN diode, utilizing the temperature dependence of the forward bias voltage drop from the Shockley diode equation, corresponding to - 2. 2 mV/°C response over a range of - 50 °C to 150 °C for the application operation range. Signal conditioning is a constant current mode operation, measuring the change in voltage drop across the diode. The relative humidity sensor is formed from one of two designs; an interdigitated comb-finger capacitor or a parallel plate capacitor. Polyimide was used as the dielectric material due to linear diffusion properties of water vapor to relative humidity. While the comb-finger sensor was coated with polyimide post-processing, a new thin film processing and integration technique was developed for the first time here at RIT for the parallel plate sensor. Due to the small levels of capacitive change in the range of 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} concerning {{the function of}} the acceleration sensors from impacting systems. On an existing device, a new acceleration sensor was mounted instead of a <b>shock</b> <b>sensor,</b> from economy reasons, and then tests were performed. Using a ballistic pendulum, composed from a prismatic body with two steel balls attached to the ends, a planar motion was obtained by the suspending method. The prismatic body has attached the acceleration sensor, the sensor signal generated by the sensor and the characteristic signal for time period during which the active part of the pendulum collides different bodies are compared using a memory oscilloscope. From the experimental tests it was concluded and validated by literature that the acceleration values from impact phenomena are considerable greater than the working range of the acceleration sensor. Thus, the use of acceleration sensor in the study of impact phenomena is inappropriate because can lead to erroneous values and conclusions.

High-response (110 -Hz bandwidth) overboard bypass doors were used, both as the variable to control shock position {{and as the}} means of disturbing the inlet airflow. An inherent instability in inlet shock position resulted in noisy feedback signals and thus restricted the terminal shock position control performance that was achieved. Proportional-plus-integral type controllers using either throat exit static pressure or <b>shock</b> position <b>sensor</b> feedback gave adequate low-frequency control. The inlet restart control system kept the terminal shock control loop closed throughout the unstart-restart transient.

40|$|Artificial {{viscosity}} can {{be combined}} with a higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization to resolve a shock layer within a single cell. However, when a piecewiseconstant artificial viscosity model is employed with an otherwise higher-order approximation, element-to-element variations in the artificial viscosity arising at the shock induce oscillations in state gradients and pollute the downstream flow. To alleviate these difficulties, this work proposes a new higher-order, state-based artificial viscosity with an associated governing PDE. In the governing PDE, the <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> acts as a forcing term, driving the artificial viscosity to a non-zero value where it is necessary. The decay rate of the higher-order solution modes and edge-based jumps are both shown to be reliable shock indicators. This new approach leads to a smooth, higher-order representation of the artificial viscosity, that evolves {{in time with the}} solution. Additionally, an artificial dissipation operator that preserves total enthalpy is introduced. The combination of higher-order, PDE-based artifical viscosity and enthalpy-preserving dissipation operator is shown to overcome the disadvantages of the piecewise-constant artificial viscosity, while achieving greater robustness on flows with strong shocks.

Simulations are repeated on a coarsened grid, and results indicate strong grid density sensitivity. The effect of turbulence recycling on the solution is illustrated by performing coarse grid simulations with and without inflow turbulence recycling.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a novel piezoresistive high-g {{accelerometer}} design, that partially overcomes a common drawback of <b>shock</b> <b>sensor</b> concepts, namely that their bandwidth, i. e. natural frequency, cannot be increased without sacrificing sensitivity. Its figure of merit (sensitivity multiplied by frequency squared) is about 5 × 10 6 m - 1. This is one order of magnitude higher than in existing designs in the literature or currently on the market. The increase is {{made possible by a}} design approach that focuses on displacements rather than stresses and the utilization of a spring-mass system related parameter called the "geometrical constant". The concept allows finding initial design geometries, which can be used for further optimization, and may be applied to sensors other than accelerometers. The accelerometer design presented in this paper is implemented as a MEMS device that features self-supporting piezoresistive elements. The first specimens have been characterized for shocks of up to 75, 000 × g in Hopkinson bar experiments and have sensitivities ranging from 0. 035 to 0. 23 V/V exc. /g and natural frequencies ranging from 2. 7 to 3. 7 MHz.
