Well-understood domains of software (e. g., avionics software, communication networks, operating <b>systems,</b> etc.) <b>will</b> be standardized as libraries of plug-compatible and interoperable components. A software system in these domains (e. g., a particular avionics system, a particular operating <b>system,</b> etc.) <b>will</b> be specified as a composition of components.

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary <b>system</b> <b>will</b> emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit <b>system</b> <b>will</b> be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD.

5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated <b>system</b> <b>will</b> always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the <b>system</b> <b>will</b> work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
