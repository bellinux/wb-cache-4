40|$|Synthetic {{insecticide}} {{have been}} used to control Culex quinquefasciatus, but the prolonged usage of synthetic insecticide has a bad impact on the environment and may caused resistance. <b>Sugar</b> <b>apple’s</b> (Annona squamosa) seeds which contain alkaloid can be used as an alternative insecticide that was safe for environment. This research aims is to know the effect of <b>sugar</b> <b>apple’s</b> seeds with different length of storage as C. quinquefasciatus larvacide. This research was an experimental study with a randomized controlled trial group design approach. The test material was an extract of <b>sugar</b> <b>apple’s</b> seeds which have been kept for 0, 1, 2, and 3 week with LC 50 (0, 47 ppm) was used. Each treatment used 25 C. quinquefasciatus larvae from third instar larvae stage and replicated five times. After exposed for 24 hours, dead larvae counted. The result confirmed that the extract of <b>sugar</b> <b>apple’s</b> seeds which has been stored in 0, 1, 2, and 3 week did not showed any significant different on larvae mortality. Extract of <b>sugar</b> <b>apple’s</b> seeds which have been stored in 0, 1, 2, and 3 week have an equal activity as Culex quinquefasciatus larvicide...|$|R

A five-year-old tree can produce as many as 50 <b>sugar</b> <b>apples.</b> Poor fruit production has been reported in Florida because there are few natural pollinators (honeybees have a difficult time penetrating the tightly closed female flowers); however, hand pollination with a natural fiber brush is effective in increasing yield. Natural pollinators include beetles (coleoptera) of the families Nitidulidae, Staphylinidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae and Scarabeidae.|$|R
