5000|$|The first Stoeger Lugers were {{produced}} in 1969 with aluminum forging/machined frames (7075 T6 aluminum). Beginning in 1980 the receiver material {{was changed to}} steel. One way to identify the frame type is by the <b>safety</b> selector <b>markings.</b> Steel frames will have a red and green painted indented spot while the aluminum frames will have raised lettering that says Fire or Safe. Use of a magnet {{is another way to}} identify the composition of the pistol frame ...|$|R
40|$|Pavement marking {{is a kind}} {{of traffic}} safety {{facility}} that plays important role in road safety. As the development and application of ergonomics in traffic engineering and road <b>safety,</b> perceptual <b>markings</b> appeared in Japan, America and Europe. Perceptual markings warn drivers of potential danger or inform drivers of road condition change by special figure, color, alignment, textile or their combinations that can offer drivers visual, tactile or aural sensations. This paper gives an overall introduction of perceptual markings and their typical application and practice, which can be referred by traffic practitioners...|$|R
50|$|The RSMA {{was founded}} in 1976, as the Road Marking Manufacturers and Contractors Association (RMMCA), {{changing}} {{its name to the}} Road <b>Safety</b> <b>Markings</b> Association in 1992. It was incorporated as a company on 27 March 2002. Initially based in Charlwood, Surrey, it had offices in Bury, Greater Manchester from 1998 to 2006, prior to setting up offices and a national training centre in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire (on the same site as the Highways Industries Confederation).|$|E
50|$|The station {{once had}} a ticket office and shelter on the former eastern {{platform}}, {{like the one at}} Long Gully, and a shelter on the western platform. The eastern platform shelter and ticket office were demolished in 1984. The shelter on the western platform was replaced in 2009. As part of the renewal of the Belair line in 2009, improvements to access ramps, seating, fencing, lighting, signage and <b>safety</b> <b>markings</b> have taken place at Eden Hills.|$|E
50|$|These {{standards}} {{have been developed}} and formulated by the ANSI Z535 committee, originally formed in 1979 and accredited by the American National Standards Institute. This committee is a highly active United States standards-making body that writes these standards to govern the characteristics of visual <b>safety</b> <b>markings</b> {{that are used to}} warn about hazards and prevent accidents. Gary Bell led this committee {{for more than two decades}} and, as of January 2012, the chairmanship is now held by Geoffrey Peckham, CEO of Clarion Safety Systems.|$|E
50|$|The country's {{primary road}} is the East-West highway, {{known locally as}} the Lateral Road, which was {{constructed}} starting in 1962. The road starts in Phuentsholing on the southwestern Indian border and terminates in Trashigang in the far east, with spurs to other main centres such as Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha. The Lateral Road is built to a standard width of only 2.5 m yet must support traffic in both directions (the cost of cutting a wider road through the mountainous Middle Himalayas is prohibitive at this time). <b>Safety</b> barriers, road <b>markings,</b> and signage are sparse. Traffic proceeds at a slow speed, typically around 15 km/h, to minimise head-on collisions. Road accidents still occur frequently and, because of the steep mountainous topography, are typically horrific. Most of the route between Paro Airport and Thimphu has recently been improved to a two lane road.|$|R
40|$|Many global challenges, {{including}} obesity, {{health care}} costs, and climate change, could {{be addressed in}} part by increasing the use of bicycles for transportation. Concern {{about the safety of}} bicycling on roadways is frequently cited as a deterrent to increasing bicycle use in the USA. The use of effective signage along roadways might help alleviate these concerns by increasing knowledge about the rights and duties of bicyclists and motorists, ideally reducing crashes. We administered a web-based survey, using Twitter for recruitment, to examine how well three US traffic control devices communicated the message that bicyclists are permitted {{in the center of the}} travel lane and do not have to "get out of the way" to allow motorists to pass without changing lanes: "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" and "Share the Road" signage, and Shared Lane Markings on the pavement. Each was compared to an unsigned roadway. We also asked respondents whether it was safe for a bicyclist to occupy the center of the travel lane. "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" signage was the most consistently comprehended device for communicating the message that bicyclists may occupy the travel lane and also increased perceptions of safety. "Share the Road" signage did not increase comprehension or perceptions of <b>safety.</b> Shared Lane <b>Markings</b> fell somewhere between. "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" signage showed notable increases in comprehension among novice bicyclists and private motor vehicle commuters, critical target audiences for efforts to promote bicycling in the USA. Although limited in scope, our survey results are indicative and suggest that Departments of Transportation consider replacing "Share the Road" with "Bicycles May Use Full Lane" signage, possibly combined with Shared Lane Markings, if the intent is to increase awareness of roadway rights and responsibilities. Further evaluation through virtual reality simulations and on-road experiments is merited...|$|R
5000|$|ANSI Z535-style {{communications}} {{are becoming}} more prevalent in society. Identified by {{their use of the}} signal words DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, NOTICE, or SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS, ANSI-style signs most often include specific details {{about the nature of the}} hazard, the consequence of interaction with the hazard, and avoidance procedures. Product manufacturers and facility owners in a wide array of industries use the ANSI Z535 standards in their efforts to assure a safer workplace and the safe use of their products so both accidents and lawsuits are minimized. The ANSI Z535 standards are often cited in U.S. court decisions as the state-of-the-art benchmark against which <b>safety</b> <b>markings</b> and their adequacy are judged.|$|E
50|$|The road becomes dual {{carriageway}} {{again as the}} road follows the Beckingham Bypass, built in 1975 with soil from the Gainsborough relief road, then reaches another roundabout with the A620, from the south (and for Retford). The road continues as {{dual carriageway}}, crossing the Doncaster to Lincoln Line, with the former road being Ramper Road to the south, and becomes the single carriageway The Flood Road, on the former route, being the Beckingham-Saundby parish boundary. Approaching Gainsborough it passes the Crown Carveries Trent Port Inn. Crossing Trent Bridge, Gainsborough it enters West Lindsey and Lincolnshire. It then goes through Gainsborough, meeting two spurs of Lea Road (A156) and Trinity Street (A159) at a roundabout. There is an exit for Thorndike Way, the A631 Gainsborough Relief Road, which opened in March 1974. Lindsey County Council intended to continue the dual carriageway {{all the way to}} the A15 at Caenby Corner. On the southern relief road, it passes The Gainsborough Academy (former Trent Valley Academy) to the south, and there is a right turn at traffic lights for Heapham Road. Corringham Road (B1433), the former route, is to the left, and nearby is the Road <b>Safety</b> <b>Markings</b> Association.|$|E
