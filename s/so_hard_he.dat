5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, space science became a topical field of {{research}} {{in the wake of the}} launch of Sputnik I. Urey helped persuade NASA to make unmanned probes to a moon a priority. When Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The samples supported Urey's contention that the moon and the Earth shared a common origin. While at UCSD, Urey published 105 scientific papers, 47 of them about lunar topics. When asked why he continued to work <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>he</b> joked, [...] "Well, you know I’m not on tenure anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried {{to make sense of it}} all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E

2500|$|In 1878, Radbourn {{joined the}} Peoria Reds, a barnstorming team, as their right fielder and [...] "change pitcher". No substitutions were allowed {{at the time}} so if the {{starting}} pitcher became ineffective in the late innings the change pitcher, usually playing right field, would exchange positions with the starter {{to try to save}} the game. In 1879 he signed with Dubuque in the newly formed Northwest League. He finally made the major leagues in 1880 as second baseman, right fielder and change pitcher for the Buffalo Bisons of the National League. He played in six games, batted [...]143, never pitched an inning, but practiced <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> developed a sore shoulder and was released. When he recovered he pitched for a pick-up Bloomington team in an exhibition game against the Providence Grays. He impressed everyone so much that Providence signed him on the spot for a salary variously reported as $1,100 or $1,400.|$|E
2500|$|One {{biography}} of Orwell {{accused him of}} having had an authoritarian streak. In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while [...] "fooling around" [...] with his friends, had [...] "accidentally bumped into him" [...] at a station, resulting in Orwell falling [...] "heavily" [...] down some stairs. One of his former pupils recalled being beaten <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> could not {{sit down for a}} week. When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called [...] "The Shooting Stick" [...] and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.|$|E

60|$|She {{looked into}} his face <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> that <b>he</b> felt the blood rush to his cheeks, and a dizzy {{sensation}} of being drawn forward.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} 'is hand and Sam shook it, and then shook 'ands with Peter Russet, who was {{grinning}} <b>so</b> <b>'ard</b> that <b>he</b> couldn't speak.|$|R
60|$|But Reddy Fox {{just laughed}} at them, and nipped the long ears of Peter Rabbit's little brother <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> cried with the pain.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{sat there}} smoking, and I sat there thinking. Twice 'e spoke to me, and I held my 'and {{up and said}} 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im {{all of a sudden}} and pinched his arm <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> nearly dropped 'is beer.|$|E
6000|$|The hunter's brow darkened. [...] "That's impossible, sir," [...] he said; [...] "I couldn't do {{him a good}} turn if I was to try ever <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> may bless his {{stars that}} I don't want to do him mischief; but to love him, it's jist imposs'ble." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{great man}} seized {{the pen and}} ink [...] And wrote <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> couldn't think; [...] Ideas grew beneath his fist [...] And flew like falcons from his wrist. [...] His pen shot sparks {{all kinds of ways}} [...] Till all the rivers were ablaze, [...] And where the coruscations fell [...] Men uttered words I dare not spell.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, he rapped loudly {{upon the}} door, not once, but several times, and <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> drew the {{attention}} of the policeman on that beat.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's an ornery--looking bronc," [...] went on Belllounds, and {{he reached}} with {{careless}} hand for the mustang. Whang jerked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> pulled Jim half over.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has got it putty bad," [...] remarked Barringford. [...] "If he hadn't he wouldn't ram {{into things}} <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> Reckon <b>he</b> hardly {{knows what he}} is doin'." ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} reply Johnny Chuck began to chuckle. The chuckle became a laugh, and {{presently}} Johnny was laughing <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> {{had to hold}} his sides. Now, as you know, laughter is catching. In {{a minute or so}} everybody was laughing, and no one but Johnny Chuck knew what the joke was. At last Peter Rabbit stopped laughing long enough to ask Johnny what he was laughing at.|$|E
6000|$|Now Ol' Mistah Buzzard is {{naturally}} good-natured and accommodating, and when Peter begged <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>he</b> just couldn't {{find it in}} his heart to refuse. Besides, he rather enjoys telling stories. So he shook his feathers out, half spread his wings to let the air blow under them, looked down at all the little meadow and forest people gathered about {{the foot of the}} tall, dead tree where he delights to roost, grinned at them in the funniest way, and then began this story: ...|$|E
6000|$|Eftsoons with {{corrugated}} brow, [...] Wet towels bound {{about his}} pow, [...] Locked legs and failing appetite, [...] He thought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> couldn't write. [...] His soaring fancies, chickenwise, [...] Came {{home to roost}} and wouldn't rise. [...] With dimmer light and milder heat [...] His goose-quill staggered o'er the sheet, [...] Then dragged, then stopped; the finish came-- [...] He couldn't even write his name. [...] The Thundergust in three short weeks [...] Had risen, roared, and split its cheeks. [...] Said Pondronummus, [...] "How unjust! [...] The storm I raised has laid my dust!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are made of stone," [...] he said, {{clenching}} his fingers <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> broke the fragile cup. The pieces fell into the grate. And Irene smiled.|$|R
60|$|Hearing this, the King {{glared at}} his Counselor with a furious {{expression}} and {{tugged at his}} own long white whiskers until <b>he</b> pulled them <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> yelled with pain.|$|R
60|$|On {{my return}} in the {{afternoon}} I gave an enthusiastic account of my day's ramble, speaking not {{of the things that}} had moved my soul, but only of those which move the Guayana Indian's soul--the animal food he craves, and which, one would imagine, Nature would prefer him to do without, <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> finds it to wrest a sufficiency from her. To my surprise they shook their heads and looked troubled at what I said; and finally my host informed me that the wood I had been in was a dangerous place; that if they went there to hunt, a great injury would be done to them; and he finished by advising me not to visit it again.|$|E
60|$|Those Sundays {{were great}} days for Martin, {{greatest}} {{because he was}} with Ruth, and great, also, because they were putting him more {{on a par with}} the young men of her class. In spite of their long years of disciplined education, he was finding himself their intellectual equal, and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> had abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do. Except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.|$|E
60|$|For just {{a second}} Bowser stared in utter surprise. Then with a little yelp of pure joy he leaped up and {{did his best to}} lick his master's face. Could you have seen Bowser, you might have thought that he was just a foolish young puppy, he cut up such wild antics to express his joy. He yelped and whined and barked. He nearly knocked Farmer Brown's boy down by leaping up on him. He raced around in circles. When at last he was still long enough, Farmer Brown's boy just threw his arms around him and hugged him. He hugged him <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> made Bowser squeal. Then two of the happiest folks in all the Great World started back across the snow-covered fields to the sleigh.|$|E

60|$|Oh, it was dreadful! Tom was <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> If <b>he</b> {{had been}} crying on the floor, Maggie would have cried too. And {{there was the}} dinner, so nice, {{and she was so}} hungry. It was very bitter.|$|R
6000|$|... "By and by {{he noticed}} that it was growing dark outside. 'My goodness! If I am going to get {{anything}} to eat to-day, I shall have to hurry,' thought he. When he got outside, he found that Mr. Sun had gone to bed. So had all the birds, except Mr. Owl and Mr. Nighthawk. Now Mr. Nighthawk doesn't belong to the Hawk family at all, so {{there was nothing to}} fear from him. Then Mr. Bat had a very pleasant surprise. He found the air full of insects, ever so many more than in the daytime. By being very smart and quick he caught a few before it was too dark for him to see. They didn't fill his stomach, but they kept him from starving. As he flew back to the cave, a great idea came to him, the idea for which he had been thinking <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>He</b> would sleep days in the cave, where he was perfectly safe, and come out to hunt bugs and insects just as soon as Mr. Hawk had gone to bed! Then he would be safe and would not have to complain to Old Mother Nature.|$|E
60|$|Approaching Malta Street, Soho, and the Restaurant Bretagne, where Annette {{would be}} {{drooping}} her pretty shoulders over her accounts, Soames thought with wonder of those seven years at Brighton. How had {{he managed to}} go on so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas, where he had not even space to put his treasures? True, those had been years with {{no time at all}} for looking at them--years of almost passionate money-making, during which Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte had become solicitors to more limited Companies than they could properly attend to. Up to the City of a morning in a Pullman car, down from the City of an evening in a Pullman car. Law papers again after dinner, then the sleep of the tired, and up again next morning. Saturday to Monday was spent at his Club in town--curious reversal of customary procedure, based on the deep and careful instinct that while working <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> needed sea air to and from the station twice a day, and while resting must indulge his domestic affections. The Sunday visit to his family in Park Lane, to Timothy's, and to Green Street; the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health as sea air on weekdays. Even since his migration to Mapledurham he had maintained those habits until--he had known Annette.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not mind}} cold and wet, and cross people, if I {{can get the}} pennies,' {{answered}} Tessa, feeling very brave with such a friend to help her. She thanked Tommo, and ran away to get ready, for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything. She sewed up the holes in her shoes {{as well as she}} could, for she had much of that sort of cobbling to do; she mended her only gown, and laid ready the old hood and shawl which had been her mother's. Then she washed out little Ranza's frock and put it to dry, because she {{would not be able to}} do it the next day. She set the table and got things ready for breakfast, for Tommo went out early, and must not be kept waiting for her. She longed to make the beds and dress the children over night, she was in such a hurry to have all in order; but, as that could not be, she sat down again, and tried over all the songs she knew. Six pretty ones were chosen; and she sang away with all her heart in a fresh little voice so sweetly that the children smiled in their sleep, and her father's tired face brightened as he entered, for Tessa was his cheery cricket on the hearth. When she had told her plan, Peter Benari shook his head, and thought it would never do; but Tessa begged <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>he</b> consented at last that she should try it for one week, and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in New York.|$|E
60|$|He nearly shut up the {{expressive}} eye altogether; {{he looked at}} him <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> And <b>he</b> gave his eye, and his face, and his whole person, a sharp twist. As {{if he would have}} screwed the truth out of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only you, Peter. Only you," [...] replied Digger faintly, for <b>he</b> {{had laughed}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>he</b> had almost lost his voice. [...] "I am afraid {{you would find}} a pair of horns like those rather heavy, Peter, rather heavy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that is {{just why}} it is <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> Evan. <b>He</b> is Great Heart. You named him well. Listen--you watch him now. He is as gentle as {{he said he would}} be that night--gentle toward me, I mean. And more. You watch him--" ...|$|R
