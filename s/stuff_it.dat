500|$|In 1996, Chris Carter {{declared}} [...] "One Breath" [...] {{to be one}} of the series' {{most popular}} episodes. Co-writer James Wong also enjoyed the episode, saying [...] "I really love that show". Director R. W. Goodwin said of the episode, [...] "What's so unusual about [...] "One Breath" [...] is that it had very little to do with our usual X-File <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> was more about human emotions, drama, relationships".|$|E
500|$|Despite the America-specific references, {{the filmmakers}} have always {{referred}} to the film as adding dialogue {{to a set of}} issues much broader than the US administration. When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on Fox News Channel, McTeigue replied, [...] "Yes. But not just Fox. Everyone is complicit in this kind of <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> could just as well been the Britain's Sky News Channel, also a part of News Corp." ...|$|E

The Star Wars saga, the greatest pop culture icon {{of the last three}} decades, is no exception... Palpatine's dissolution of the Senate in favor of imperial rule has been compared to Julius Caesar's marginalization of the Roman Senate, Hitler's power-grab as chancellor, and FDR's court-packing scheme and creation of the imperial presidency." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} studio fire, Schlesinger and Chase {{discussed}} trying out new genres for the album, incorporating influences from {{different types of}} music. Schlesinger stated: [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> works well with Dominique's voice". However, while tracks like [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] experimented with new music like trip hop, [...] "Lucy Doesn't Love You" [...] reflected Ivy's previous material.|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the song, Adam Schlesinger and Chase played {{around with the}} idea of incorporating new genres into their music; in an interview with Billboard, Ivy stated, [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> works well with Dominique's voice". With the exploration, Ivy began crafting [...] "stronger" [...] songs, that were less atmospheric than those on their previous studio album, Apartment Life (1997), but contained more [...] "infectious melodies".|$|E
500|$|During {{the show}} itself, Bowie {{incorporated}} {{a wide variety}} of props: [...] "I'm really attempting {{to do a lot of}} <b>stuff!</b> <b>It</b> incorporates movement, dialogue, fragments of film, projected images, it's what used to be called multi-media in the '60s." [...] Bowie described how he assembled the show, saying, [...] "The idea was to concoct surrealist or minimalist stage pieces to accompany rock-and-roll songs. I wanted to bridge together some kind of symbolist theater and modern dance. Not jazz dance, certainly not MTV dance, but something more influenced by people like Pina Bausch and a Montreal group called [...] There are some symbolist pieces, some minimalist pieces, and some vulgar pieces, too – some straightforward vaudeville bits." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Cornell {{revealed}} {{further information}} about the band's breakup; [...] "Personally {{a lot of it}} was me trying to land on my feet again. I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began work on a new studio album; however, the band was dropped by their label, Epic Records, shortly after the reissue of Apartment Life was released. After the end of their {{contract}} with Epic, and lead singer Dominique Durand's pregnancy, the New York City studio where Ivy regularly recorded music burned down. In order to forget about these events, Ivy resumed recording sessions, and began incorporating influences from new wave. Member Adam Schlesinger detailed the album's exploration of different genres: [...] "The first songs [...] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> works well with Dominique's voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Constance {{joined the}} hippie {{movement}} and encouraged her sons {{to get involved}} in the arts. Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all sorts of <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> just kind of made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I just kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E

500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and <b>stuff...</b> <b>It</b> was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{has said}} of her time with Automatic Dlamini: [...] "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy {{to learn how to}} play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E
500|$|Seymour Goes to Hollywood {{was praised}} for its {{comparatively}} large size and for having more logical puzzles than Dizzy games, due to it being {{set in the}} real world. Some players were critical {{of the size of}} the game and the time required to complete it. The puzzles themselves were widely praised as [...] "some of the best puzzles.....ever seen in an arcade adventure", and similar to Dizzy but with enough variation to [...] "keep you scratching your head for hours". Crash magazine's reviewer stated that the puzzles may be too simple for players experienced with Dizzy games. The game was compared to the Dizzy series by most reviewers, in both positive and negative lights. For instance, one reviewer stated that the game was indistinguishable from Dizzy games and succeeded for the same reasons, another reviewer called it average fare and asked [...] "why didn't Codemasters just <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> out as another Dizzy game?" [...] Crookes commented that though Seymour Goes to Hollywood borrows heavily from the Dizzy series it was a fulfilling game.|$|E
500|$|... "Search Committee" [...] {{was written}} by show runner and {{executive}} producer Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show, his 14th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Jeffrey Blitz, the ninth episode he has directed for the series. The episode features special guest appearances from Ricky Gervais (as his character David Brent from the original British version of The Office), Catherine Tate, Will Arnett, Ray Romano, James Spader, Jim Carrey, Cody Horn and Warren Buffett. Gervais previously appeared in the episode [...] "The Seminar", and co-wrote the episodes [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "The Convict"; he also serves as an executive producer for the series. In addition to appearing in [...] "Search Committee", Gervais contributed to the episode script. Initially the guest stars were planned to be a secret, before all were revealed to the media. Lieberstein described the moments with the guest stars in the episode as [...] "more than a montage. It's a number of scenes. We fit it in. We <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> in".|$|E

500|$|After the band's movie {{debut in}} Roger Corman's Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), renowned {{producer}} Phil Spector {{became interested in}} the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century. During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff. Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: [...] "End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones." [...] This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, [...] Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying [...] "It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production really worked tremendously. 'Rock 'N' Roll Radio' is really good. For the harder <b>stuff,</b> <b>it</b> didn't work as well." [...] The string-laden Ronettes cover [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] released as a single, became the band's biggest hit in Great Britain, reaching number8 on the charts.|$|E
500|$|Brett Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that, {{while the}} episode's plot was [...] "not {{particularly}} notable" [...] on the surface, it manages to work [...] "because of Rainn Wilson's commitment to it". Furthermore, {{he wrote that}} the episode concluded {{the first half of}} the season in a [...] "respectable and respectful" [...] manner. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a worthy extension of [...] tradition" [...] and [...] "definitely one of the best episodes of this final season". He praised Dwight's antics as well as Kevin's humorous lines. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode four stars out of five and wrote that [...] "part of the charm of this episode was that the writers didn't try to <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> with too much plot". One of the very few mixed reviews was written by Caroline Framke of The A.V. Club, who awarded the episode a [...] "B–" [...] and argued that [...] "Dwight Christmas" [...] was trying too hard to replicate the humor of the second-season episode [...] "Christmas Party". She concluded that the episode [...] "ranks as more impish than admirable." ...|$|E
500|$|Julia Glum, in {{an article}} in the International Business Times, wrote that the [...] "mascot for the Olympic Games is almost always strange-looking, and Rio de Janeiro is no exception. ... though they're by far not the craziest Olympic animals to ever exist ..." [...] In an article {{published}} by Mic, Brianna Provenzano referred to the mascots as [...] "lovable", describing their appearance as [...] "sweet and simple" [...] and highlighting their symbolisms for the animals and plants of Brazil. However, Charlotte Wilder, a writer on USA Todays sports column For The Win, was unimpressed by Vinicius's design, stating, [...] "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet did exactly what it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> with some synthetic filling, and call it day." [...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species. Young also criticized the organizers for not offering a female name in the public vote.|$|E
