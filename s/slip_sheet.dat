5000|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>sheet</b> {{attachment}} (push - pull) - is {{a hydraulic}} attachment that reaches forward, clamps onto a <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> and draws the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> onto wide and thin metal forks for transport. The attachment will push the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> and load off the forks for placement.|$|E
50|$|The first type of <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is {{the single}} lip (tab) <b>slip</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> has a {{four to six}} inch lip (tab) {{that extends}} beyond {{one or more of}} the sides of the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet.</b> The lip {{extensions}} permit a push-pull device to lift the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> unit load.|$|E
50|$|When used alone, pallets {{provide more}} {{structural}} support than <b>slip</b> <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike wooden pallets <b>slip</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{not subject}} to {{phytosanitary}} restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|Using <b>slip</b> <b>sheets</b> {{instead of}} wooden pallets allows for 0-30% more {{products}} in material handling containers.|$|R
50|$|The {{second type}} of <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is the multi-lip <b>slip</b> <b>sheet.</b> This type of <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is {{generally}} used on a container placed onto a railroad car or an ocean delivery vehicle due to the necessary loading/unloading patterns. This allows a loading device to load the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> unit load from one side and an unloading device to unload the load from another side depending on the number and pattern of the remaining lips.|$|E
50|$|The <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is used as}} a pallet {{support device}} in vehicle {{delivery}} and transportation of products. When slip sheets are supported by a pallet board, flat load carrying surface, or a cart or fork lift truck, the structural strength of the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> supports the product load's weight. With the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> supported by one of these transportation devices the unit load can easily be transported both internally within a facility and externally between two facility locations.|$|E
50|$|The plastic <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is {{made from}} {{recycled}} high-density polyethylene or polypropylene materials. This type of material allows for greater non-tear strength and an increased number of uses in cold and humid environments. The only disadvantage to the plastic <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is the high cost. Yet, its advantages include longer sheet life, durable lips, ability to be stored in cold or humid environments, and {{that it can be}} handled by a roller conveyor, <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> lift truck, or powered unit load transportation devices.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are thin}} pallet-sized sheets made of plastic, heavy {{laminated}} kraft paperboard, or corrugated fiberboard used in commercial shipping. Often, these replace {{the use of}} traditional wooden pallets. The unit load is usually stretch wrapped or shrink wrapped for stability.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{walls were}} covered with felt <b>slip</b> <b>sheets</b> and wallpaper. Floorboards are {{circular-sawn}} tongue-and-groove, attached directly to the floor joists. The stairway consists of wedge-shaped cedar treads with closed risers in a tight 180-degree turn with no handrails. The back-to-back fireplaces are made of Tenino sandstone mantels with fire brick fireboxes and wood surrounds.|$|R
50|$|Automated Truck Loading Systems - ATLS {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in the material handling industry {{to refer to the}} automation of loading or unloading trucks and trailers with product either on or without pallets, <b>slip</b> <b>sheets,</b> racks, containers, using several different types of automated guided vehicle systems (AGV) or engineered conveyor belt systems that are integrated into vehicles, automating the shipping / receiving and logistics operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{corrugated}} fiberboard {{consists of two}} kraft liner board outer surfaces with a corrugated interior that is bonded together with adhesive or glue. This bonded material provides the necessary strength for the push-pull device to clamp the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> once or twice. There are several disadvantages associated {{with this type of}} <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> material including that it is not very durable, moisture resistant, resistant to high humidity or usable in cold storage areas. The advantages associated with this material are low cost, one-way use, and its ability to be moved by a conveyor or lift truck with a <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> device.|$|E
5000|$|With Push Pull {{attachement}} {{could save}} the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet,</b> Roller Forks not.|$|E
50|$|Cut the lip {{from the}} <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> if no {{additional}} push-pull activities are required.|$|E
60|$|Anderson {{hesitated a}} moment, peered {{cautiously}} around, and then, <b>slipping</b> folded <b>sheets</b> {{of paper from}} his inside coat pocket, he evidently made ready to hand them to Kurt.|$|R
60|$|I {{instantly}} <b>slipped</b> in a <b>sheet</b> of foolscap, {{and began}} to type-write with alarming speed--click, click, click; while Elsie, rising to the occasion, set to work to transcribe imaginary shorthand as if her life depended upon it.|$|R
60|$|There were {{minutes of}} breathless silence. Then Crawshay, {{as the last}} <b>sheet</b> <b>slipped</b> through his fingers, glanced stealthily into Brightman's face, saw him bite through his lips till the blood came and strike the table with his clenched fist.|$|R
50|$|Dragging a <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> load {{across a}} rough or bumpy floor {{can damage the}} load.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>sheet</b> usage {{requires}} special, relatively low-cost attachments on transportation {{devices such}} as a lift truck.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of slip sheets {{that can be used}} for the {{transportation}} of a unit load depending upon the desired use of the sheet. The <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is shaped and dimensioned to the size of the product or unit load. The type of <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> varies depending on both the number of lip extensions and the material from which it is manufactured.|$|E
30|$|The {{variations}} of δ on dimensionless velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration profiles for K[*]=[*] 0 and K[*]≠[*] 0 are depicted in Figs.  20, 21, and 22, respectively. It is worth mentioning here that δ[*]=[*] 0 corresponds to no slip condition and δ[*]≠[*] 0 shows velocity <b>slip</b> at stretching <b>sheet</b> wall. It {{is interesting to}} see that increasing values of δ reduces the fluid velocity initially and then increases far from the sheet whereas dimensionless temperature and nanoparticle concentration increase with increase in δ. Physically, this shows that fluid velocity adjacent to the sheet {{is less than the}} velocity of normal stretching <b>sheet</b> as <b>slip</b> (δ[*]≠[*] 0) occurs. Increasing δ allowed more fluid <b>slipping</b> over the <b>sheet</b> and the flow decelerates near the sheet.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{publication}} an attempt is made to bring some order in the terminological chaos existing in the field of delapsion, which is the independent gravitating of rock material along sloping surfaces. The term olisthon is introduced for everything that has been delapsed. For the purpose of a rational and comprehensive classification of geological phenomena delapsion is introduced as a separate class between tectonization and sedimentation. Special emphasis is laid upon the concepts of olisthostrome and olistholith, which are redefined. The principles of the mechanics involved in delapsional processes are discussed. In the second part emphasis is laid upon the description of the olisthostromes, olistholiths, reversely graded mud flow and muddy gravel avalanche deposits that invaded the Moratalla basin during the Miocene. Attention is also given to the olisthostrome occurring in the Lower Eocene, the slump packets and slip blocks in the Miocene, and to the extensive <b>slip</b> <b>sheets</b> of Cretaceous rocks that closed the depositional phase of the basin. The regional stratigraphy and tectonic structure are briefly discussed. The interpretation of the structures - the greater part of the Triassic rocks of the Subbetic zone is thought to be in autochthonous to parautochthonous position - differs from the current interpretation that the Triassic rocks form the basal part of the Subbetic nappe that would have thrust over some twenty kilometres...|$|R
60|$|Before {{leaving this}} subject, however, I must be {{permitted}} to say one word to those members of the Scotch Church who are severe in their requirement of the nominal or apparent extemporization of all addresses delivered from the pulpit. Whether they do right in giving those among their ministers who cannot preach extempore, the additional and useless labor of committing their sermons to memory, may be a disputed question; but it can hardly be so, that the now not unfrequent habit of making a desk of the Bible, and reading the sermon stealthily, by <b>slipping</b> the <b>sheets</b> of it between the sacred leaves, so that the preacher consults his own notes on pretence of consulting the Scriptures, is a very unseemly consequence of their over-strictness.|$|R
50|$|The {{fiberboard}} (thick paperboard) <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> {{consists of}} {{several layers of}} solid kraft paperboard sheets laminated together. The bonding of layers of several flat solid kraftboard sheets increases the slip sheet’s non-tear strength. This, in return, allows the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> to be used several times and in different temperatures. In addition, some fiberboard slip sheets are protected by a plastic coating to improve its use in humid environments. The disadvantages {{to this type of}} <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> are that it has a medium cost and is not very durable. The advantages with this material are its multiple uses, ability to withstand humid and cold environments, and ability to be handled by conveyors, AGV, or other power unit load transportation devices.|$|E
50|$|During the {{transportation}} of a <b>slip</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{there are several}} options for handling the slip sheet’s lip.|$|E

50|$|In the {{apartment}} above the bird-human couple, lives Mister Smile, whose head is a yellow smiley face. Mr. Smile stamps his face onto sheets of paper, causing the features to disappear {{from his face}} completely. The features always regenerate though, as he <b>slips</b> the stamped <b>sheets</b> of paper into envelopes. Each group of characters receives one of these envelopes in the mail. They {{have been invited to}} visit Mr. Smile, who is presumably a celebrity.|$|R
60|$|He went up, however, directly, {{with the}} {{recklessness}} of despair; every separate stair creaking and cracking under him, as if a young elephant had been retiring to bed {{instead of a}} young man. He blew out his light, tore off his clothes, and, <b>slipping</b> between the <b>sheets,</b> began to breathe elaborately, {{as if he was}} fast asleep--in the desperate hope of being still able to deceive his father, if Mr. Thorpe came up stairs to look after him.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{thickness}} variation of folded layers {{in terms of}} apparent flattening indicates the relative 11 viscositiesrr of the layers, and hence modes of deformation, Orthogonal-thickness ratios, which are unique for each percentage of flattening, are convenient indicators of the equivalent flattening of an initially concentric profile. Axial-thickness ratios, intrinsi cally more sensitive, are less useful {{because there is a}} spread of values for each percentage of flattening. Measurements of fold profiles from diverse sedimentary, diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic environments show that the higher the t emperature and pressure at which the rocks were deformed the smaller the range of fold style. At Port Moresby, Papua, progressive syntaphral sliding has folded Eocene cherts and less competent argillite in a complex polyclinal style. Individual layers, then groups of layers up to one metre thick, and finally <b>slip</b> <b>sheets</b> tens of metres thick slid towards the west-southwest. Structural analysis of linear and planar fold elements in diagenetic or lovr-grade metamorphic environments in Tasmania leads to the conclusion that cleavage developed contemporaneously in both sandstone and slate as a planar feature. The cleavage in the slate is penetrative to the scale of detrital grains, but non-penetrative in the sandstone where pelitic ribbons anastomose through the rock enclosing non-cleaved lenses of normal greywacke fabric. The most satisfactory hypothesis to account for the observed mesoscopic configurations is that the cleavage formed during deformation as pelitic deposits in channels along which excessive water was forced out of the rock at very high pore pressure. The ratio between pore pressure and confining pressure is a significant parameter determining fold style. Heterogeneities necessary for concentric folding are effective where the pore pressure is relatively low, and the fold style is similar where the pore pressure approaches the pressure on the grain fabric. Pore-pressure ratios are most readily varied in superficial deposits, and many different fold styles occur in the intrastratal contortions in the terrestrial, Pleistocene, preglacial deposits in Tasmania, and in the intraformational slumps of the Pleistocene Lisan Formation in Israel. Irregular "flow" folds in the contact aureoles of two intrusive bodies in Tasmania grade outwards into more regular, concentric and disjunctive folds. Both the folding and the variation in fold style may have been caused by water pressures approaching the lithostatic load in the intrusions, and decreasing outwards...|$|R
50|$|When {{considering}} {{the use of}} a <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> vs. a pallet, there are several advantages and disadvantages associated with both.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} used {{would depend}} on the loading patterns, unit load parameters, and desired maneuverability of the slip sheet/unit load. Normally, the thickness of the <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> is less than 0.5 inches.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{unit load}} might consist of {{corrugated}} fiberboard boxes stacked on a pallet or <b>slip</b> <b>sheet</b> and stabilized with stretch wrap, pressure-sensitive tape, strapping or shrink wrap. About 2 billion unit loads are in daily {{use in the}} United States (Ward 1993).|$|E
60|$|Katharine {{sat down}} at her table and opened a long dusty envelope. As Shelley was {{mentioned}} {{in the course of}} the letter as if he were alive, it had, of course, considerable value. Her immediate task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed, or only the paragraph which mentioned Shelley's name, and she reached out for a pen and held it in readiness to do justice upon the sheet. Her pen, however, remained in the air. Almost surreptitiously she <b>slipped</b> a clean <b>sheet</b> in front of her, and her hand, descending, began drawing square boxes halved and quartered by straight lines, and then circles which underwent the same process of dissection.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} thermal radiation in the boundary layer flow through porous medium of an electrically conducting incompressible fluid over a stretching/shrinking sheet {{in the presence}} of convective boundary condition is presented. The flow is permeated by an externally applied magnetic field normal to the plane of flow. The equations governing the flow and heat transfer are reduced into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and exact solutions are obtained. The effects of various parameters entering into the problem on the velocity and temperature distribution are discussed and depicted graphically. This study reveals that convective boundary condition results in temperature <b>slip</b> at the <b>sheet</b> and this temperature slip is significantly influenced by the Biot number...|$|R
