2500|$|In antiquity, two rival {{theories}} of the syllogism existed: Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic syllogistic. Aristotle defines the syllogism as, [...] "...a discourse in which certain (<b>specific)</b> <b>things</b> having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so." [...] Despite this very general definition, in Aristotle's work Prior Analytics, he limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions. These include categorical modal syllogisms.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle has {{a process}} of {{reasoning}} {{similar to that of}} Plato's, though he ultimately disagreed with the specifics of Plato's forms. Aristotle's great contribution to rationalist thinking comes from his use of syllogistic logic. Aristotle defines syllogism as [...] "a discourse in which certain (<b>specific)</b> <b>things</b> having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so." [...] Despite this very general definition, Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms which consist of three categorical propositions in his work Prior Analytics.

2500|$|Deficits {{in visual}} memory {{can also be}} caused by disease and/or trauma to the brain. These {{can lead to the}} patient losing their spatial memory, and/or their visual memory for <b>specific</b> <b>things.</b> For example a patient “L.E.” {{suffered}} brain damage and her ability to draw from memory was severely diminished, whilst her spatial memory remained normal. Other patients represent the opposite, where memory for colors and shapes is unaffected but spatial memory for previously known places is greatly impaired. [...] These case studies show that these two types of visual memory are located {{in different parts of the}} brain and are somewhat unrelated in terms of functioning in daily life.|$|E

Although, as noted by Nancy Basile of About.com, [...] "one should be cautious when accepting advice from the child who spends much of his school time at the blackboard writing punishments." [...] Phillip Slee wrote in Child, Adolescent and Family Development that the book provides a [...] "contemporary glimpse into the world of middle childhood". <b>Specific</b> <b>things</b> taught to readers by Bart in the book include how to increase one's allowance, avoid chores in the home, and getting away with cheating in school.

2500|$|Throughout 2011 and 2012, Julian Assange {{has been}} a {{repeated}} target of Brown's condemnation and personal attacks. Calling Assange a [...] "douchey ideologue", a [...] "greedy, paranoid fame-whore", a [...] "Chomsky-quoting grad school student you avoid talking to at parties", and an [...] "epic donkey lusting for celebrity" [...] while mockingly referencing his physical appearance and personal hygiene, Brown harshly criticized the WikiLeaks founder over {{the manner in which}} his organization gathers and distributes information and the way he presents himself in public. <b>Specific</b> <b>things</b> Brown took issue with include what he saw to be Assange's tendency to blame the U.S. and the Jews, his [...] "cozy relations with despots like Alexander Lukashenko", his 2012 [...] "trumped up schlock of a TV show on a Kremlin-backed TV propaganda unit" [...] whose first episode saw him interview Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and [...] "accept Nasrallah's answers about the future of Middle East without bringing up that Hezbollah’s charter calls explicitly for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic State", his decision to put up a paywall on the WikiLeaks website, etc. By April 2013, Brown seemingly started coming around on Assange, praising him and WikiLeaks for republishing the Kissinger cables and creating the Public Library of U.S. Diplomacy (PlusD).|$|E

6000|$|He knew as {{distinctly}} {{as possible}} {{that this was an}} offer of help to himself from Mr. Farebrother, and he could not bear it. So strangely determined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with the sense that he had privately done the Vicar a service, the suggestion that the Vicar discerned his need of a service in return made him shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all making of such offers what else must come?--that he should [...] "mention his case," [...] imply that he wanted <b>specific</b> <b>things.</b> At that moment, suicide seemed easier.|$|E

6000|$|His {{idea had}} been in advance that she would perhaps sound him much more deeply, asking him above all two or three <b>specific</b> <b>things.</b> He had fairly fancied her even wanting to know {{and trying to find}} out how far, as the odious phrase was, he and Milly had gone, and how near, by the same token, they had come. He had asked himself if he were {{prepared}} to hear her do that, and had had to take for answer that he was prepared of course for everything. Wasn't he prepared for her ascertaining if her two or three prophecies had found time to be made true? He had fairly believed himself ready to say whether or no the overture on Milly's part promised according to the boldest of them had taken place. But what was in fact blessedly coming to him was that so far as such things were concerned his readiness wouldn't be taxed. Kate's pressure on the question of what had taken place remained so admirably general that even her present enquiry kept itself free of sharpness.

50|$|In argumentation theory, a term is {{that part}} of a {{statement}} in an argument which refers to a <b>specific</b> <b>thing.</b> Usually, but not always expressed as a noun, one of the requirements to informally prove a conclusion with a deductive argument is for all its terms to be used unambiguously. The ambiguous use of a term in a deductive argument may be an instance of the fallacy of four terms.|$|R
