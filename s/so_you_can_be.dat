500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} interview, with Juice, Fanning said that [...] "D.A.F." [...] centered on [...] "the old theme {{of searching for}} truth". He said the song related heavily to the ideal of [...] "being honest with yourself <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> honest with other people".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you want}} now you are come?" [...] you interrupt, feeling {{anything}} but genially inclined towards him. He is an old friend, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> rude to him.|$|E
60|$|AUNT MARY (whispering). No, no; I {{must take}} that, <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{with the baby}} below.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall think <b>so,</b> unless <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> discreet. Harry, <b>you</b> {{will have}} to wait. You will {{remember}} that we must wait; but I shall not change." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed! How <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> have <b>been</b> {{acquainted with}} it only since I came to Bath, {{excepting}} {{as you might}} hear me previously spoken of in my own family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle, I wish to go," [...] said Amy, whose {{will was}} law to the amiable major. Up he rose, and Amy added, {{as she took}} his arm, [...] "I'm seized with a longing to go to Baden-Baden and see a little gambling. You are not a wild young man, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trusted there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I WON'T say less!" [...] Fanny laughed; with which, {{the next}} moment, {{she had turned}} away. But they had it again, not less bravely, on the morrow, after breakfast, {{in the thick of}} the {{advancing}} carriages and the exchange of farewells. [...] "I think I'll send home my maid from Euston," [...] she was then prepared to amend, [...] "and go to Eaton Square straight. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be an}} {{hour before}} dinner is ready," [...] Trevor said, as they {{returned}} to the house, [...] "and you won't be wanted before that. I shall be about if the chief has any orders to send out. I don't think it is likely that he will have; he is not given, as some brigadiers are, to worrying; and, besides, there are the orderlies here to take any routine orders out, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> off if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{teach you}} to speak and write correctly, <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood," [...] said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. [...] "Should you like to speak as old Job does?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will sign}} it. I {{will take the}} risk. But you must {{tell me all about}} it, right afterward, <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> arrested before <b>you</b> {{get out of the house}} in case there should be {{anything}} criminal about this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The after-consequences of {{this little}} melodrama," [...] Phipps interposed, with grim fury, [...] "certainly present {{something}} of a problem, I have wondered, during the last hour or <b>so,</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> perfectly sane, Wingate. What good <b>can</b> <b>you</b> expect to do by this brigandage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I; and I mean {{to believe}} that you will not. Meantime, we can try to make the waiting as useful and {{pleasant}} as possible. This painful little back will be a sort of conscience to remind you of what you ought to do and leave undone, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> learning obedience. Then, when the body is strong, it will have formed a good habit to make duty easier; and my Lucinda can be a sweet example, even while lying here, if she chooses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good answer," [...] {{said the}} consul. [...] "But you won't {{have to go}} that far. Here's the scheme. After I get the {{trademark}} tattooed on your hand I'll notify old Urique. In the meantime I'll furnish you {{with all of the}} family history I can find out, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> studying up points to talk about. You've got the looks, you speak the Spanish, you know the facts, you can tell about Texas, you've got the tattoo mark. When I notify them that the rightful heir has returned and is waiting to know whether he will be received and pardoned, what will happen? They'll simply rush down here and fall on your neck, and the curtain goes down for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman with}} her bundle passed {{through the open door}} of the house behind the mill. The public {{entrance}} was at the front where by day the bags of grain were lifted by rope and tackle to the upper story, and the farmers who brought them climbed up by the inner stairways. The believers had expected that they were to come in by way of the dwelling, but now the burly figure of the miller, with the light of a candle behind it, showed black in the doorway, and he spoke up, in his friendly voice: [...] "Neighbors, we want you all to go round to the front of the mill and come in there. The miracle is going to be done on the bolting-cloth floor, where there will be room for all that wants to see. We don't mean to keep anybody out, whether they believe or don't believe. The only thing we want is for you all to be quiet, and not make trouble. And now, come in as quick as you can, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure we haven't had time to do anything to the cloth that the seamless raiment is going to be made out of." ...|$|E
50|$|We {{have the}} {{tendency}} {{to believe that if}} an expert says something, then it must be true. People like to listen to those who are knowledgeable and trustworthy, <b>so</b> if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> those two things, then you are already on your way to getting people to believe and listen to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, lad, yes. You'll {{be through}} between six and seven o'clock, and we'll {{be glad to}} have you drop in any evening till you set about studying; then I allow we'll fix up some place <b>so's</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> away from your partner and his friends. We won't have any soft talk after we get inside, so I'll say it all now. Keep your upper lip stiff, Amateur; don't get down at the heel if them as are in charge seem to bear on a little too hard; {{remember}} that all hands of Ninety-four's company are counting on you to make good their words, and be a man. Unless we get a call you'll see us to-night, so there ain't need of saying very much more just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he said, [...] "the {{mountain}} {{will never}} be brought to Mahomet, <b>so</b> all <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do <b>is</b> to aid Mahomet {{to go to the}} mountain; I must beg of you to come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that would}} be {{perfectly}} splendid!" [...] she said. [...] "I have ever so often {{thought that it was}} a shame that you should be deprived of the pleasures you so much enjoy, which I see you can find here and nowhere else. Now, I have a plan which I think will work splendidly. We are a very small family. Why shouldn't you come here and live with us? There is plenty of room, and I know father and mother would be very glad, and you can pay your board, if that would please you better. You can have the room {{at the top of the}} tower for your study and your smoking den, and the room under it can be your bedroom, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> just as independent as you please of the rest of us, and you can be living on your own place without interfering with us in the least. In fact, it would be ever so nice, especially as I am in the habit of going away to the sea-shore with my aunt every summer for six weeks, and I was thinking how lonely it would be this year for father and mother to stay here all by themselves." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once upon a {{time you}} couldn't really be living in poverty {{if you had a}} regular income, you could find {{yourself}} on a low income, yes. But that is not longer <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> in work and still live in poverty.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{separate}} interview, with Juice, Fanning said that [...] "D.A.F." [...] centered on [...] "the old theme {{of searching for}} truth".

5000|$|Example: If a {{team won}} 9 {{of their last}} 10 games, but the one loss was to a ranked team, I would {{probably}} assign 9.5 points (<b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see this <b>is</b> a little subjective), which equates to 40 points in the Hovell Index.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no marriage," [...] said Foy, [...] "for {{although}} we have not stood together before the altar, yet our hearts <b>are</b> wed, <b>so</b> how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> made the wife of another man?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Shrewsbury {{also had}} big rivalries with Chester City and Wrexham. Following crowd {{difficulties}} at Chesters stadium during a league match in season 2003-04 when well over 2,000 Shrewsbury fans, some {{in different parts}} of the home sections, appeared to come forward to the pitchside when a tannoy spokesman asked [...] "If there are any more Shrewsbury Town fans in the home section would you please come down to the perimeter <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> appropriately relocated in the away section". The rivalry with Wrexham is also less important, with Wrexham no longer being in the Football League, but was always a heated fixture.|$|E

5000|$|Talking about {{introducing}} a fresh concept on primetime, Zee TV Programming Head, Namit Sharma said, [...] "It takes one epic show to replace another, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine. It <b>is</b> a passionate drama of love, {{a far cry}} from regular saas-bahu soaps and has an ensemble cast of some very talented actors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Appears to be," [...] said she, {{with much}} {{emphasis}} on the first word. [...] "Why, can't you see {{that it would be}} impossible for me, as a young unmarried woman, to come to the house of a man, whose proprietor, as Aunt Keswick considers herself to be, has been trying to marry to me, even before I was grown up; for the letters that used to make my father most angry were about this. I hate to talk of these family affairs, and I only do it <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made understand things." ...|$|R
50|$|Tas has truly put {{the board}} into orbit with this stupendous video part which {{contains}} {{some of the}} best vert skating we have seen from anyone in eons. The graphic was done by Mr Marc Mckee, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure that collectors snap it up all over the globe. So good to see you back in the skies above Prahran Tas. The clip is by Greg Stewart, who happens to be known in the UK as “The Talking Filmer”. Gregsie: we are all delighted to once again hear your mid-air commentary. Just incase you missed it, in 2011 Tas was given the Video Vault treatment for his epic Mad Circle part from almost 20 years ago.|$|E

5000|$|Pennebaker's films, usually {{shot with}} a {{hand-held}} camera, often eschew voice-over narration and interviews {{in favor of a}} [...] "simple" [...] portrayal of events typical of the direct cinema style Pennebaker helped popularize in the U.S. Of such an approach, Pennebaker told interviewer G. Roy Levin published in 1971 that [...] "it's possible to go to a situation and simply film what you see there, what happens there, what goes on, and let everybody decide whether it tells them about any of these things. But you don't have to label them, you don't have to have the narration to instruct you <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure and understand that it's good for you to learn." [...] In that same interview with Levin, Pennebaker {{goes so far as to}} claim that Dont Look Back is [...] "not a documentary at all by my standards". He instead repeatedly asserts that he does not make documentaries, but [...] "records of moments", [...] "half soap operas", and [...] "semimusical reality things".|$|E
5000|$|Keys and Chords said [...] "Songs that deeply {{penetrate}} your soul, {{songs that}} you actually have to undergo in solitude, alone and preferably then with headphones <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> disturbed. ... this disc <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> created by talented musicians {{and each of them}} has here on a glorious way contributed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marianne," [...] cried her sister, [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> say <b>so?</b> How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> unjust? They {{are a very}} respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; {{and towards}} us have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how many {{pleasant}} days we have owed to them?" ...|$|R
50|$|Balancer {{chromosomes}} always {{contain a}} lethal recessive allele. This {{means that if}} an organism receives two copies of the balancer chromosome, one from the mother and one from the father, then the organism will not live. So any organism that is homozygous for that chromosome will not live to pass on its genes. However, offspring that only get one copy of one balancer chromosome and one copy of a wild type or mutant chromosome will live to pass on its genes. After only a few generations the population will be entirely heterozygous <b>so</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed of its genotype on at least those two chromosomes.|$|R
