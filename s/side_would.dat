5|$|When Tarzan Boy {{was injured}} {{and unable to}} wrestle Bucanero and Guerrero {{recruited}} Máscara Mágica to even the numbers. The storyline between the two factions reaches its high point at the CMLL 68th Anniversary Show where all seven wrestlers faced off in a steel cage match. The stipulation of the match was that the winning <b>side</b> <b>would</b> gain the rights to use the name Los Infernales while the loser on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>would</b> be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off. In the end El Satánico pinned Máscara Mágica, forcing him to unmask. After losing the match Guerrero, Bucanero and Tarzan Boy became known collectively as Los Guerreros del Infierno (The Infernal Soldiers).|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East <b>Side)</b> <b>would</b> include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes on the far <b>side</b> <b>would</b> be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed {{in the construction of}} mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, {{the council}} {{repeated}} the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some {{who failed to}} comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Zurich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread {{to other parts of}} the Confederation as well as a number of Swabian towns. On 6–8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossmünster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each <b>side</b> <b>would</b> not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund, {{supported}} by Zamoyski {{and the former}} king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August. The Zborowski family called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing <b>side</b> <b>would</b> likely pay a severe price, from confiscations {{and a loss of}} prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.|$|E
5|$|When Chamois Niortais were founded, {{the club}} had no fixed home ground and played {{friendly}} matches at various venues {{in and around}} Niort. In 1926, when the team joined the Ligue du Charentes, the club adopted the small Stade de Genève as their first home. They continued {{to play at the}} Stade de Genève {{for the majority of the}} following 50 years until, in the early 1970s, it was announced that the <b>side</b> <b>would</b> move into a new stadium. On 3 August 1974, the Stade Venise Verte was opened, with the inaugural game being an exhibition match between Chamois Niortais and Dynamo Kyiv. Some time later, the stadium was renamed the Stade René Gaillard in honour of René Gaillard, the former mayor of Niort.|$|E

5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one <b>side</b> <b>would</b> match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg <b>side</b> <b>would</b> catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|George II's {{relationship}} with his son and heir apparent, Frederick, Prince of Wales, worsened during the 1730s. Frederick {{had been left behind}} in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither <b>side</b> <b>would</b> make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha in April 1736.|$|E

50|$|This side of {{the tooth}} tapers in size from the labial {{side of the}} tooth. As a result, the mesial and distal sides of the tooth are further away on the labial side than on the lingual side. Furthermore, a {{cross-section}} of the tooth at the cervical line would show a general triangle appearance. One of the triangle's <b>sides</b> <b>would</b> be the facial surface, {{and the other two}} <b>sides</b> <b>would</b> be the mesial side and the slightly shorter distal side.|$|R

5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given <b>side</b> <b>would</b> expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong <b>side</b> <b>would</b> have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that <b>side</b> <b>would</b> embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E

5|$|Khánh {{had long}} been {{regarded}} as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer. Following the partition of Vietnam, Khánh, a French-trained officer {{who served in the}} French-backed Vietnamese National Army during the First Indochina War, had rallied to support Ngô Đình Diệm, who became the first president of the anti-communist South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam). He rose to become the deputy chief of staff in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), but his record of political loyalty was called into question. In 1960, during an attempted coup by rebel paratroopers, Khánh jumped over the walls of the Independence Palace and joined Diệm during the siege, trying to negotiate an end to the stand-off with the rebels. Khánh parleyed with the rebels long enough for loyal forces to arrive from the outside the capital to suppress the uprising, but his critics contended that he was waiting to see which <b>side</b> <b>would</b> gain the upper hand and was not committed to Diệm. In any case, Diệm then promoted him to be the commander of II Corps. In his younger days, Khánh had joined the Viet Minh but then defected to the French colonial army after a year. Khánh claimed that he had left the Viet Minh because of its communist inclinations, but critics claimed that he was simply switching sides because the French-backed State of Vietnam offered him more opportunities for advancement.|$|E
5|$|Sussex {{also took}} part in the first round, facing Suffolk, one of the minor cricket {{counties}} who did not play first-class cricket. Suffolk were bowled out for 101 runs, a total which Sussex chased down with 161 deliveries remaining. Another minor county, Staffordshire, were Sussex's second round opponents, but the margin of victory was far narrower. Sussex batted first and scored 221 for 6, in which Paul Parker scored his second half-century of the competition. In their response, Staffordshire fell three runs short, finishing with 219 for 9; each of Imran Khan and Geoff Arnold collecting four wickets. In the quarter-final, Sussex faced Yorkshire. The match began on 2 August, but after 52 overs of Yorkshire's innings no further play was possible, even though the match had two reserve days. On 4 August, the match was abandoned, and replaced with a match in which each <b>side</b> <b>would</b> bat for 10 innings. In that match, Sussex batted first and scored 68 for 6, and then restricted Yorkshire to 59 for 8. Imran Khan and Arnold bowled through the entire ten overs, taking three wickets each. A more facile victory provided Sussex with their place in the final; facing Lancashire, Sussex scored 277 for 8, helped by another half-century from Parker, and 75 runs from Javed Miandad, and then bowled their opponents out for 141 runs.|$|E

2500|$|In general, the {{recently}} arrived Spanish colonists, who settled in villages, and Apache bands developed {{a pattern of}} interaction over a few centuries.

For example, one band might be friends with one village and raid another.
