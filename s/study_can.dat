5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other planets in the system, their names are sorted by their distances from the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like planets in a small area of the sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness to dim slightly and at a regular rate, a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future <b>study</b> <b>can</b> prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E

The program also offers non-degree postdoctoral fellowships (such applicants must have a doctoral degree in the health sciences), designed to provide two years of full-time fellowship training.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{rejected}} by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology undergraduate course. He stayed on in Edinburgh to do research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of Cepaea, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from the late Bryan Clarke, one of his teachers at Edinburgh and subsequently professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham. After his PhD, Jones also completed post-doctoral research into the genetics of Drosophila at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones' research has been concerned with snails and the light their <b>study</b> <b>can</b> shed on biodiversity and genetics.|$|E
25|$|It is {{less than}} 1/8inch long and their body color can range from a dark purple to a light reddish-brown color and is sparsely and weakly dotted with small pits. They have short wings and long legs. The beetle lives under rocks and logs, in sinkholes, rotting wood, termite nest, and caves, {{although}} it is now only known to still exist in four caves in the Edwards Plateau, Travis County, Texas. Not all caves {{in the region have}} been surveyed, so this may be an underestimate. It lives in total darkness so there is no use for eyes and uses elaborate appendages and beefed up nerve centers to interpret slight air-pressure or temperature changes, sounds, and smells. This sensory equipment helps the beetle travel, sense objects, and ambush prey. There is no distinct reproduction pattern for the beetle and may reproduce at any time of the year if conditions are steady in the cave. Little is known about daily life of the mold beetle because of their secretive habitats. When going to observe them they are rarely found and when they are found it is usually only one to two specimens. They are so secretive that finding an individual is a rare event. It is also very hard to distinguish Texamaurops reddelli from other beetles in the Pselaphide family. Only upon microscopic <b>study</b> <b>can</b> the beetle be distinguished by its ocular knobs on its head. This makes it hard to identify the beetles in the field as they can easily be mistaken for another beetle species in the same family.|$|E
