40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to pack convex polygons into bins (the nesting problem). To do this polygons {{are placed in}} rows within bins using a metaheuristic algorithm (simulated annealing) and by utilising the No Fit Polygon. We show that simulated annealing out performs hill climbing. The nesting algorithm is described in detail, along with various aspects that have been incorporated {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of the algorithm whilst maintaining solution quality. Computational results are given 1. Introduction In the nesting problem pieces must be placed onto larger shape(s) (which we will refer to as <b>stock</b> <b>sheets).</b> In doing so two constraints must not be violated. The pieces must not overlap and all the pieces must lie {{within the confines of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>sheet(s).</b> In addition, it is usual to minimise the waste. The nesting problem only considers two dimensions, that is, the height and width of the <b>stock</b> <b>sheet(s).</b> Although it is possible to have a number of <b>stock</b> <b>sheets,</b> [...] ...|$|R

These projections incorporate {{the effect on the}} balance sheet of several macroeconomic variables as well as alternative policy decisions, taking into account the uncertainty and risks inherent in the economy. The article describes and assesses the main causes of the present deficit. In the baseline scenario, the deterministic forecast shows that the Central Bank's net worth will increase slowly to reach positive values after 25 years. However, in the stochastic simulations the Bank's net worth will still be negative 25 years from now, with a 69 percent probability. ...|$|R

Improper alloy mixtures occur when the <b>sheet</b> <b>stock</b> contains uneven layers of the metals intended for the type of coin that is produced.

Orientation (i.e. ability/ available density of the sheet to be drawn to the mold which can vary in depths from 1 to 36 inches typically) is highly important and greatly affects forming cycle times for most plastics.|$|E

40|$|Background For {{study with}} obligate anaerobes, inoculated plates {{containing}} suitable reduced media need handling and incubation under strict anaerobic condition. Instead of ensuring a confined oxygen free chamber for placing seeded plates, same purpose may {{be achieved by}} creating total air barrier to the surface. Method Upper moist surface of freshly prepared anaerobic media in Petri plates were intimately covered with very thin transparent bacteriological inert sterile polyester <b>sheets.</b> <b>Stock</b> culture of Bacteroides fragilis, ATCC 23745 and Clostridium sporogenes, ATCC 11437 were grown in cooked meat broth and then sub-cultured on respective plates, after lifting the cover sheets.

To perform antimicrobial susceptibility test, similarly covered seeded plates with well inoculums were inverted en-block after stripping sides {{with the help of}} a spatula. Now antibiotic disks were placed on upper bare surfaces. After short pre-diffusion, plates were incubated keeping inoculated surface below.

50|$|Bend {{allowance}} {{and bend}} deduction are quantities {{used to determine}} the flat length of <b>sheet</b> <b>stock</b> to give the desired dimension of the bent part. Both bend deduction and bend allowance represent the difference between the neutral line or unbent flat pattern (the required length of the material prior to bending) and the formed bend. Subtracting them from the combined length of both flanges gives the flat pattern length. The question of which formula to use is determined by the dimensioning method used to define the flanges as shown in the two diagrams below.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{stochastic}} {{projections of the}} Central Bank of Chile’s balance <b>sheet</b> (<b>stocks</b> and flows), grounded on its present deficit situation. These projections incorporate {{the effect on the}} balance sheet of some macroeconomic variables and alternative policies, taking into consideration the economy’s inherent uncertainty and risks. It also describes and evaluates the main causes of the current deficit. In the baseline scenario, our deterministic projections show that the Central Bank’s capital will tend to grow and reach positive figures after twenty-five years. However, statistical projections indicate that this capital will continue in the red twenty-five years into the future with a 69 % probability. On the other hand, a capital contribution of 7 % of GDP would be necessary for senior liabilities not to surpass assets in ten years’ time, with a 95 % probability. The likely evolution of capital is more favorable in the long run if the reserve hoarding growth rate is moderated, if minimum capital is established in real terms instead of nominal terms, and if accrued, unrealized, foreign exchange gains are not distributed. ...|$|R
