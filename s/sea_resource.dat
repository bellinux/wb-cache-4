In open and complicated underwater environments, targets (events) tend to be highly dynamic and uncertain. It is important to deploy sensors to cover potential events in an optimal manner. In this paper, the underwater sensor deployment problem and its performance evaluation metrics are introduced. Furthermore, a particle swarm inspired sensor self-deployment algorithm is presented. By simulating the flying behavior of particles and introducing crowd control, the proposed algorithm can drive sensors to cover almost all the events, and make the distribution of sensors match that of events. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that it can solve the underwater sensor deployment problem effectively, with fast convergence rate, and amiable to distributed implementation...|$|E

40|$|Minke whales - the rorqual {{group of}} the family Balaenopteridae - are widely {{distributed}} and constitute an important major harvestable living resource of the sea. Recently, the Antarctic minke whale population has been estimated to be between 150, 000 and 300, 000. Populations being dynamic entities, {{the size of the}} minke whale population has been changing. Currently, the minke whale population in the Antarctic has been claimed to have increased considerably. However, the minke whale stock arriving off Brazil could be regarded as only a small discrete unit of breeding stock and {{an integral part of the}} Brazilian natural resource. Data analysis based on the past 21 years shows that this stock is relatively in a steady state, but with only a few annual fluctuations which are around a constant mean value; and these departures are attributable both to environmental conditions and the local operational parameters. Further, the analysis of overall data does not suggest any decline in the Brazilian stock and a MSY at about 58. 5 % can be taken without depleting the stock, provided no dramatic changes occur in the native Antarctic habitat where the minke whales return to feed. This would allow Brazil a carefully controlled rational utilization of this potentially valuable <b>sea</b> <b>resource</b> since enough exploitable numbers of minke whales have been estimated to be available for Area II. The current arguments of the conflicts between the Pro -and Anti-whaling groups are also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Global and {{regional}} change clearly affects {{the structure and}} functioning of ecosystems in shelf seas. However, complex interactions within the shelf seas hinder the identification and unambiguous attribution of observed changes to drivers. These include variability in the climate system, in ocean dynamics, in biogeochemistry, and in shelf <b>sea</b> <b>resource</b> exploitation in the widest sense by societies. Observational time series are commonly too short, and resolution, integration time, and complexity of models are often insufficient to unravel natural variability from anthropogenic perturbation. The North Sea is a shelf sea of the North Atlantic and is impacted by virtually all global {{and regional}} developments. Natural variability (from interannual to multidecadal time scales) as response to forcing in the North Atlantic is overlain by global trends (sea level, temperature, acidification) and alternating phases of direct human impacts and attempts to remedy those. Human intervention started some 1000 years ago (diking and associated loss of wetlands), expanded to near-coastal parts in the industrial revolution of the mid- 19 th century (river management, waste disposal in rivers), and greatly accelerated in the mid- 1950 s (eutrophication, pollution, fisheries). The North Sea is now a heavily regulated shelf sea, yet societal goals (good environmental status versus increased uses), demands for benefits and policies diverge increasingly. Likely, the southern North Sea will be re-zoned as riparian countries dedicate increasing sea space for offshore wind energy generation — with uncertain consequences for the system's environmental status. We review available observational and model data (predominantly from the southeastern North Sea region) to identify and describe effects of natural variability, of secular changes, and of human impacts on the North Sea ecosystem, and outline developments in the next decades in response to environmental legislation, {{and in response to}} increased use of shelf sea space...|$|E
40|$|Food systems {{include many}} issues {{interconnected}} through complex relationships. Some writers examine {{one part of}} the food system in depth but—from my perspective as a management student—a strength of Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat is that it examines food systems by systematically connecting a broad set of issues in its analysis of the widespread adoption of the industrial farming model. This model, the authors argue, requires vast tracts of arable land, makes broad and lifelong use of antibiotics in farm animals to minimize disease and encourage rapid growth, and promotes an increasing use of grain for animal feed rather than for human consumption. Throughout the book, the authors share evidence in an effort to encourage consumers to reflect on the implications of the system we support when purchasing our meat cheaply. The authors have written this book from their experiences as animal welfare activists for a broad audience, but focus their attention on costs that have been unaccounted for in the industrial food system. The book is divided into sections about the natural environment, public health, animal “muck ” (effluent or waste), and land and <b>sea</b> <b>resource</b> scarcity. The authors pull together their arguments by discussing industrial farming with respect to genetically-modified food, the nature of power in the market system that controls most food globally, and by discussing food ingredients and food waste in a surprisingly short chapter. The book closes with a roadmap of how consumer power of those with compassion could make choices that would subvert the dominant model of animal farming, and the authors share advice about how to navigate labelling language and avoid purchasing factory farmed meat. The book is directed at US, EU and UK consumers, in particular, although the authors offer examples from other countries in the book...|$|E

Despite the positive results connected with greater and more intense exploration of <b>seas</b> <b>resources,</b> there also appeared the negative effects.
