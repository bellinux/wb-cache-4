50|$|The {{cut-and-paste}} transposition {{mechanism of}} class II TEs {{does not involve}} an RNA intermediate. The transpositions are catalyzed by several transposase enzymes. Some transposases non-specifically bind to any target site in DNA, whereas others bind to specific target sequences. The transposase makes a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> at the target site producing sticky ends, cuts out the DNA transposon and ligates it into the target site. A DNA polymerase fills in the resulting gaps from the sticky ends and DNA ligase closes the sugar-phosphate backbone. This results in target site duplication and the insertion sites of DNA transposons may be identified by short direct repeats (a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> in the target DNA filled by DNA polymerase) followed by inverted repeats (which are important for the TE excision by transposase).|$|E

The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA. Such ends may be generated by restriction enzymes that cut the DNA - a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> generates two sticky ends, while a straight cut generate blunt ends.|$|E
5000|$|Transposon {{sequencing}} {{begins by}} transforming bacterial populations with transposable elements using bacteriophages. Tn-seq uses the Himar I Mariner transposon, a common and stable transposon. After transformation, the DNA is cleaved and the inserted sequence amplified through PCR. The recognition sites for MmeI, a type IIS restriction endonuclease, can be introduced {{by a single}} nucleotide change in the terminal repeats of Mariner. It is located 4 bp {{before the end of}} the terminal repeat. MmeI makes a 2 bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> 20 bases downstream of the recognition site. When MmeI digests DNA from a library of transposon insertion mutants, fragmented DNA including the left and right transposon and 16 bp of surrounding genomic DNA is produced. The 16 bp fragment is enough to determine the location of the transposon insertion in the bacterial genome. The ligation of the adaptor is facilitated by the 2 base overhang. A primer specific to the adaptor and a primer specific to the transponson are used to amplify the sequence via PCR. The 120 bp product is then isolated using agarose gel or PAGE purification. Massively parallel sequencing is then used to determine the sequences of the flanking 16 bp. Gene function is inferred after looking at the effects of the insertion on gene function under certain conditions.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of transposition of the maize Ac/Ds elements {{is not well}} understood. The true transposition intermediates are not known {{and it has not}} been possible to distinguish between excision models involving 8 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> or 1 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> followed by hairpin formation. In this work, we have analyzed extrachromosomal excision products to gain insight into the excision mechanism. Plasmid rescue was used to demonstrate that Ds excision is associated with the formation of circular molecules. In addition, we present evidence for the formation of linear extrachromosomal species during Ds excision. Sequences found at the termini of circular and linear elements showed a broad range of nucleotide additions or deletions, suggesting that these species are not true intermediates. Additional nucleotides adjacent to the termini in extrachromosomal elements were compared to the sequence of the original donor site. This analysis showed that: (1) the first nucleotide adjacent to the transposon end was significantly more similar to the first nucleotide flanking the element in the donor site than to a random sequence and (2) the second and farther nucleotides did not resemble the donor site. The implications of these findings for excision models are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{second major}} {{challenge}} to the clinical application of gene editing is to enhance the efficiency of homology-directed recombination (HDR)-mediated precise gene modification while decreasing non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-induced indel production. As shown by various studies, the HDR-NHEJ ratio can be regulated by either changing the expression of machinery mediating DNA repair or optimising delivery methods and timing. A more desirable HDR-NHEJ ratio can be achieved through synchronisation of the cell cycle or utilisation of small molecules as well (Maeder and Gersbach, 2016). More recently, an endonuclease known as Cpf 1 {{has also been shown}} to improve HDR. This variant not only allows the production of <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts,</b> but also needs shorter lengths of RNA (Zetsche et al., 2015).|$|R
50|$|The next step, {{the strand}} {{transfer}} reaction, takes place inside the host cell nucleus and involves the critical step of inserting the HIV DNA into a selected {{region of the}} host DNA. The region of insertion contains a weakly conserved palindromic sequence. This strand transfer reaction is initiated as the HIV integrase catalyzes the HIV DNA 3’-hydroxyl group attack on the host DNA. The attack by the HIV DNA occurs on opposite strands of the host DNA in a staggered fashion, typically 4-6 base pairs apart. This reaction leads to separation of the bonds in the host DNA base pairs located between the <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts,</b> and the joining of the HIV 3’-hydroxyl groups with the host DNA 5’ phosphate ends. At this point, the newly joined viral-host DNA region unfolds.|$|R

We have used a hybrid selection procedure to examine macronuclear DNA molecules for subtelomeric length heterogeneity to determine whether chromosome fragmentation occurs at unique or multiple sites. The results suggest that multiple, but closely spaced, chromosome fragmentation sites are used by Oxytricha nova. In contrast, Euplotes crassus uses unique chromosome fragmentation sites in a reproducible manner to generate the ends of macronuclear DNA molecules. Additional studies compared DNA sequences {{in the vicinity of}} chromosome fragmentation sites in an attempt to define cis-acting sequences that direct the fragmentation process.

In {{this study we}} examine the excised forms of two previously characterized deletion elements, the R- and M-element, in Tetrahymena. Using divergently oriented primers in polymerase chain reactions we have detected the junctions formed by joining the two ends of these elements, providing evidence {{for the presence of}} circular excised forms. These circular forms were detected in developing macronuclear DNA from 12 - 24 h after mating began, but not in micronuclear or whole cell DNA of vegetative cells. They are present at very low abundance, detectable after PCR only through hybridization with specific probes. Sequence analysis shows that the circle junctions occur at or very near the known ends of the elements. There is sequence microheterogeneity in these junctions, which does not support a simple reciprocal exchange model for DNA deletion. A model involving <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> and variable mismatch repair is proposed to explain these results.

The two most common products observed were gene conversions external to the P-w(hd) element and gene conversions (targeted transpositions) internal to the P-w(hd) element. These two events were equally frequent. Similar numbers for both orientations of internal conversion events were recovered.

Eight (in some cases nine) base pairs {{to one side of}} each cleavage site is the common sequence TCACC AGTGG. Two lines of evidence indicate that these bases constitute part or all of the Hph recognition site. First, mutations in this sequence prevent Hph cutting. Second, dimethylsulfate-mediated methylation of Gs and As in this site prevent cutting, whereas methylation of purines in the region between this sequence and the cleavage sites has no such effect.

Tens of thousands of DNA breakage and joining, or splicing, events occur during macronuclear development. The DNA removed by such events includes transposon-like elements, referred to as Tec 1 elements, as well as segments of unique sequence DNA, termed internal eliminated sequences (IESs). Both types of elements are bounded by short direct repeats. In the current study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing strategy {{has been used to}} examine the fidelity of excision of two Tec 1 elements and three IESs. In all cases, the vast majority of excision events were found to be precise, with one copy of the terminal direct repeats retained at the empty site in the macronuclear DNA molecule. These results, in combination with previous studies that have characterized the excised DNA elements, indicate that the two products of excision (the free element and the macronuclear DNA molecule) share DNA sequences.

40|$|Tn 4451 is a 6. 3 -kb {{chloramphenicol}} resistance transposon from Clostridium perfringens and {{is found}} on the conjugative plasmid pIP 401. The element undergoes spontaneous excision from multicopy plasmids in Escherichia coli and C. perfringens and conjugative excision from pIP 401 in C. perfringens. Tn 4451 is excised as a circular molecule which is probably the transposition intermediate. Excision of Tn 4451 is dependent upon the site-specific recombinase TnpX, which contains potential motifs associated with both the resolvase/invertase and integrase families of recombinases. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues within these domains was used {{to show that the}} resolvase/invertase domain was essential for TnpX-mediated excision of Tn 4451 from multicopy plasmids in E. coli. An analysis of Tn 4451 target sites revealed that the transposition process showed target site specificity. The Tn 4451 target sequence resembled the junction of the circular form, and insertion occurred at a GA dinucleotide. Tn 4451 insertions were flanked by directly repeated GA dinucleotides, and there was also a GA at the junction of the circular form, where the left and right termini of Tn 4451 were fused. We propose a model for Tn 4451 excision and insertion in which the resolvase/invertase domain of TnpX introduces 2 -bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> at these GA dinucleotides.

Excision and transposition of a nonautonomous Mines transposon {{in the presence of}} a Minos transposase gene was detected with a dominant eye color marker carried by the transposon. Frequencies of excision in somatic tissues and in the germ line were higher in flies heterozygous for the transposon than in homozygotes or hemizygotes. Transposition of a X chromosome-linked insertion of Mines into new autosomal sites occurred in 1 - 12 % of males expressing transposase, suggesting that this system is usable for gene tagging and enhancer trapping in Drosophila. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified donor sites after excision showed precise restoration of the original target sequence in similar to 75 % of events in heterozygotes and the presence of footprints or partially deleted elements in the remaining events. Most footprints consisted of the four terminal bases of the transposon, flanked by the TA target duplication. Sequencing of a chromosomal donor site that was directly cloned after excision showed a characteristic two-base mismatch heteroduplex in the center of the 6 -bp footprint. Circular extrachromosomal forms of the transposon, presumably representing excised Mines elements, could be detected only in the presence of transposase. A model for chromatid repair after Minos excision is discussed in which <b>staggered</b> <b>cuts</b> are first produced at the ends of the inverted repeats, the broken chromatid ends are joined, and the resulting heteroduplex is subsequently repaired.

40|$|Rajnish P Patel, 1, 2 Sunita M Ubale 21 Suyog Women&# 39;s Hospital, 2 Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, Thane, IndiaBackground: Obstetric anal {{sphincter}} injuries (OASIs) are {{the leading}} cause of anal incontinence in women. Episiotomies with a postdelivery suture angle of less than 30 ° to the midline are more likely to injure the anal sphincter directly, while those with a suture angle of more than 60 ° are associated with increased incidence of OASIs, as they do not relieve the pressure on the perineum. A safe zone of 40 °– 60 ° has been proposed. Recently, two new types of episiotomy scissors (Episcissors- 60 ® Straight version and angled version) were introduced to ensure a standardized cutting angle of 60 ° to the midline. We audited our results with the angled Episcissors- 60 in spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients delivering in two private maternity hospitals in Thane, India undergoing clinically indicated episiotomies were included. Only patients delivering spontaneously were included. The scissors were introduced vaginally at crowning, and aligned to orient the guide limb vertically from the posterior fourchette to the anus. While a single cut was preferred, a <b>stagger</b> <b>cut</b> was needed for some women. Postdelivery angles were measured by placing a protractor transparency on the perineum after delivery and marking the angle with an indelible ink pen. Per rectal examination was performed prior to suturing to detect OASIs. Results: A total of 25 women underwent clinically indicated episiotomies. Of these, 16 women were nulliparous, eight women were para 1, and one woman was a para 2. One woman had a vaginal breech delivery (para 2), and the rest were cephalic vertex deliveries. The average age was 27 (range 20 – 35) years. The median birth weight was 2, 800 g (standard deviation 312 g, interquartile range 2, 500 – 3, 000 g). The median postdelivery suture angle of the episiotomy was 50 ° (standard deviation 3. 5 °, interquartile range 48 °– 54 °, range 45 °– 55 °). No cases of OASI were detected in this series. Conclusion: The Episcissors- 60 angled version demonstrated a postdelivery suture angle of 50 ° in a cohort of Indian women undergoing spontaneous vaginal deliveries.

40|$|The DNA that accumulates in the lambda {{infection}} {{restricted to}} the early (circular) stage of replication consists of approximately two-thirds covalently closed circles and one-third relaxed circles bearing a single interruption in either strand of the duplex. The latter molecules are presumed to be a unique class in that the interruption is not repairable by DNA polymerase and ligase. Preferential radioisotopic labeling of the region immediately adjacent to the interruption, followed by hybridization to sheared fragments of the lambda chromosome with varying guanine plus cytosine content, suggested that the nick resides at {{the position of the}} mature molecular ends of the lambda chromosome. Digestion of the labeled molecules with restriction enzymes and reconstruction experiments in which Hershey circles were generated by annealing of interrupted strands isolated from the relaxed circles support this interpretation. The results indicate that the relaxed circles consist of a population containing one interruption in either of the two strands of the duplex jointly representing the two "nicks" contained in Hershey circles (in which the cohesive ends are annealed). These molecules could result from the inability of the maturation function to make the required <b>staggered</b> endonucleolytic <b>cuts</b> when the DNA substrate is a monomeric circle rather than a multimeric linear molecule.

Endonuclease activity requires a substrate with {{two copies of}} the recognition site in head-to-head repeat and is dependent on {{a low level of}} ATP hydrolysis (∼ 40 ATP/site/min). Cleavage occurs at just one of the two sites and results in a <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> 25 – 26 nt downstream of the top strand sequence to generate a two base 5 ′-protruding end. Methylation of the site occurs on one strand only at the first adenine of 5 ′-CATCAG- 3 ′. Therefore, PstII has characteristic Type III restriction enzyme activity as exemplified by EcoPI or EcoP 15 I. Moreover, sequence asymmetry of the PstII recognition site in the T 7 genome acts as an historical imprint of Type III restriction activity in vivo. In contrast to other Type I and III enzymes, PstII has a more relaxed nucleotide specificity and can cut DNA with GTP and CTP (but not UTP). We also demonstrate that PstII and EcoP 15 I cannot interact and cleave a DNA substrate suggesting that Type III enzymes must make specific protein–protein contacts to activate endonuclease activity...|$|E

This chromosome fragmentation process is tightly coupled with de novo telomere synthesis by the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, generating short linear macronuclear DNA molecules. In this study, the sequences of 58 macronuclear DNA termini and eight regions of the micronuclear genome containing chromosome fragmentation/telomere addition sites were determined. Through a statistically based analysis of these data, along with previously published sequences, we have defined a 10 bp conserved sequence element (E-Cbs, 5 '-HATTGAAaHH- 3 ', H = A, C or T) near chromosome fragmentation sites. The E-Cbs typically resides within the DNA destined to form a macronuclear DNA molecule, but can also reside within flanking micronuclear DNA that is eliminated during macronuclear development. The location of the E-Cbs in macronuclear-destined versus flanking micronuclear DNA leads us to propose a model of chromosome fragmentation that involves a 6 bp <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> in the chromosome.

The endonuclease protected most of the purines found in both the major and minor grooves of the DNA helix from modification by dimethyl sulfate (DMS).

The reduction in phage yield caused by cosN G 2 C is correlated with a defect in cos cleavage. Three suppressors of the cosN G 2 C mutation, A-E 515 G, A-N 509 K, and A-R 504 C, have been isolated that restore the yield of λ cosN G 2 C to the wild-type level.

In vitro cos cleavage experiments on cosN G 2 C C 11 G DNA showed that the rate of cleavage for A-E 515 G terminase is three- to fourfold higher than for wild-type terminase.

This intron is unique among mobile group I introns {{in that it is}} located in nuclear DNA. We found that I-Ppo is encoded by an open reading frame in the 5 ' half of intron 3, upstream of the sequences required for self-splicing of group I introns. Either of two AUG initiation codons could start this reading frame, one near the beginning of the intron and the other in the upstream exon, leading to predicted polypeptides of 138 and 160 amino acid residues. The longer polypeptide was the major form translated in vitro in a reticulocyte extract. From nuclease assays of proteins synthesized in vitro with partially deleted DNAs, we conclude that both polypeptides possess endonuclease activity. We also have expressed I-Ppo in Escherichia coli, using a bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase expression system. The longer polypeptide also was the predominant form made in this system. It showed enzymatic activity in bacteria in vivo, as demonstrated by the cleavage of a plasmid carrying the target site. Like several other intron-encoded endonucleases, I-Ppo makes a four-base <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> in its ribosomal DNA target sequence, very near the site where intron 3 becomes integrated in crosses of intron 3 -containing and intron 3 -lacking Physarum strains...|$|E
40|$|Molecular cloning is a crucial, {{and often}} speed-limiting, step in many {{standard}} procedures of molecular biology. Ligation of cohesive DNA ends is normally {{carried out at}} 12 – 16 �C to ensure a good balance between enzyme activity and stability of annealed DNA overhangs. Low temperatures generally reduce ligase activity, whereas too high temperatures may reduce cloning efficiencies by melting annealed DNA overhangs and increase overall molecular motion in the ligation reaction. Several procedures have been described {{to increase the efficiency}} ligation reactions, including the addition of condensing agents as polyethylene glycol (1) or hexamminedicobalt chloride (2). These approaches induce macromolecular crowding, and thus serve to mimic higher DNA concentrations in the ligation reaction. Other approaches seek to increase the efficiency of molecular cloning procedures by omitting the ligation step by generating long single-stranded DNA overhangs that can be annealed and transformed directly into an appropriate Escherichia coli host (3). Ligation of blunt-ended DNA fragments is normally carried out at room temperature using higher concentrations of T 4 DNA ligase. We have devised a simple procedure in which high enzyme activity and DNA annealing is balanced by constant temperature cycling. We find temperature-cycle ligations (TCL) may increase the efficiency of <b>staggered</b> <b>cut</b> cloning ∼ 4 – 8 -fold, while the efficiency of blunt-end clonings are increased ∼ 4 – 6 -fold (see Table 1). The bacterial cloning vector pBluescript II KS + was digested with AflIII and HindIII producing two cohesive end-fragments of 434 and 2526 bp respectively, or PvuII generating two blunt-end fragments of 448 and 2512 bp respectively. All enzymes were purchased from Amersham. Digested plasmid DNA was separated on 1 % low-melting agarose (NuSieve) and purified as described by Sambrook et al. (1). For each digestion a ligation master mix was prepared containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7. 6) ...|$|E
