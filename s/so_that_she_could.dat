5|$|At 12 {{years of}} age, she left home {{and began to}} work for a wealthy {{neighboring}} family, performing chores on their farm. She continued to keep house, cook and sew for wealthy families for 15 years. One of the families that she worked for—the Whitesides—noticed her interest in their Currier and Ives prints and purchased chalk and wax crayons <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> create her own artwork.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{received}} private tuition {{in constitutional}} history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College, and learned French from {{a succession of}} native-speaking governesses. A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> socialise with girls her own age. Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.|$|E

5|$|Paine resumed {{teaching}} and painted portraits to supplement her earnings, {{allowing her to}} support herself and send money to her mother, stepfather and their family, who had moved to Connecticut. To this point her life {{had been one of}} turmoil and financial precariousness. Rather than marry another man to secure a better standard of living, she developed a career <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> support herself.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E
5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that said Charles would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E

5|$|That night, Nicholas–now on {{the verge}} of insanity–hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her ghostly voice down to her tomb. Elizabeth rises from her coffin and pursues Nicholas into the torture chamber, where he falls down a flight of stairs. As Elizabeth gloats over her husband's {{unconscious}} body, she is met by her lover and accomplice, Dr. Leon. They had plotted to drive Nicholas mad <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> inherit his fortune and the castle.|$|E
5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests to show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> relive the events when questioned.|$|E
5|$|Barfi {{is deeply}} {{affected}} by Jhilmil's loss and finds living with Shruti unfulfilling. He finds {{the location of}} Jhilmil's childhood home and takes Shruti to look for her. They find that Jhilmil is still alive, and that both kidnappings were fabricated by her father so he could embezzle money from Jhilmil's trust fund. In the second attempt, second time, they faked her death <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> return to her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother. Barfi has a happy reunion with Jhilmil and the two are married, while Shruti spends {{the rest of her}} days alone, regretting the loss of her chance to be with Barfi.|$|E

5|$|Construction work on Alabama, {{the fourth}} and final member of the South Dakota class, began on 1 February 1940 in the Norfolk Navy Yard with the keel laying. She was {{launched}} on 16 February 1942 and commissioned into service six months later, on 16 August. Alabama sailed on her shakedown cruise from the Chesapeake Bay on 11 November, which culminated in Casco Bay, Maine. Minor repairs were carried out in Norfolk, after which the big ship returned to Casco Bay to conduct training maneuvers with her sister, South Dakota. Beginning in March 1943, Alabama {{was assigned to the}} British Home Fleet, and tasked with convoy escort duties on the route to the Soviet Union. She was relieved of these duties in July <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> return to Norfolk for a brief overhaul in August.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Elizabeth {{undertook}} {{her first}} solo public appearance {{on a visit}} to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the authorities, who disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.|$|E

5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty {{was compared to}} the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry {{a man who was}} more beautiful than her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E
5|$|Lenalee is {{voiced by}} Shizuka Itō in the {{original}} Japanese animated adaptation of the manga. Hoshino joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw Itō's work. Itō was replaced by Ai Kakuma in the Japanese anime sequel D.Gray-man Hallow. Lenalee is voiced in English by Luci Christian. The apparent romantic relationship that grows between Lenalee and Allen in the series led to a brief video clip where Christian acting as Lenalee confesses her feelings to Allen. Christian has stated she liked the character and was happy that Funimation intended to release the series' second half in 2017 <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> voice her again.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{take it with}} her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig and makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

5|$|McConnell-Mills {{was born}} Frances Mary McConnell in 1900 in Monument, Colorado. Her {{father was a}} {{physician}} and a pharmacist, and often took Frances {{with him when he}} made house calls to patients. She was sent to live with her aunt and grandfather <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> attend Colorado Springs High School; she graduated at the age of 15 and was awarded a full scholarship to the University of Denver. She received a bachelor's degree from the university in 1918, aged 17, and graduated again with a master's degree in chemistry when she was 19, making her the university's youngest graduate with a master's degree at the time. In 1919, she began work as a teacher of chemistry, biology, geometry and trigonometry at Englewood High School.|$|E
5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take her belongings out of the home. Just after {{she came out of}} the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
