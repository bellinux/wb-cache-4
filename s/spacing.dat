40|$|We {{introduce}} a phenomenological formalism {{in which the}} <b>space</b> structure is treated in terms of attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>space.</b> Attachment <b>space</b> attaches to an object, while detachment <b>space</b> detaches from the object. The combination of these <b>spaces</b> results in three quantum <b>space</b> phases: binary partition <b>space,</b> miscible <b>space</b> and binary lattice <b>space.</b> Binary lattice <b>space</b> consists of repetitive units of alternative attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>space.</b> In miscible <b>space,</b> attachment <b>space</b> is miscible to detachment <b>space,</b> {{and there is no}} separation between attachment <b>space</b> and detachment <b>spaces.</b> In binary partition <b>space,</b> detachment <b>space</b> and attachment <b>space</b> are in two separat continuous regions. The transition from wavefunction to the collapse of wavefuction under interference becomes the quantum <b>space</b> phase transition from binary lattice <b>space</b> to miscible <b>space.</b> At extremely conditions, the gauge boson force field undergoes a quantum <b>space</b> phase transition to a "hedge boson force field", consisting of a "vacuum" core surrounded by a hedge boson shell, like a bubble with boundary...|$|R

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice <b>spacing</b> between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic <b>spacing</b> to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic <b>spacing</b> known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental <b>spacing</b> is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental <b>spacing</b> for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E

5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and <b>spacing</b> of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider <b>spacing</b> and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to <b>spacing</b> to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the <b>spacing</b> and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E

5|$|The maximum <b>spacing</b> {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The consistency of maximum <b>spacing</b> estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider <b>spacing</b> of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer <b>spacing,</b> larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
