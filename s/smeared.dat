50|$|Triple <b>smear</b> or vaginal-cervical-edocervical (VCE) <b>smear</b> is a cytopathology {{technique}} for identifying lesions {{of the female}} genital tract. The <b>smear</b> is prepared on separate areas of a single slide with three distinct samples, each from ectocervix, vagina and endocervix. Each sample occupies one-third of the glass slide.

Materials and Methods: Archived histopathology records of all cases reported as endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma in the study period were identified and the available corresponding Pap <b>smears</b> (in preceding 1 year) were retrieved. In addition, the Pap <b>smears</b> reported as glandular cell abnormalities (GCA) during the same study period were retrieved. The overall prevalence of GCA, sensitivity, and specificity of Pap <b>smears</b> for the detection of GCA was calculated. The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and LBC <b>smears</b> for the diagnosis of GCA was also compared. Results: The prevalence of GCA in our study was 0. 32 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare ThinPrep (TP) Papanicolaou <b>smears</b> (Cytyc Corp., Box- borough, Massachusetts, U. S. A.) with {{matching}} conventional Papanicolaou (CP) <b>smears</b> for specimen adequacy, cytologic quality, diagnostic accuracy and screening time. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study of 1, 024 women a split-sample, matched-pair design {{in favor of}} CP slides based on single-blind criteria was followed with a <b>smear</b> on a glass slide for CP and the remaining material collected in PreservCyt solution (Cytyc) for a TP <b>smear.</b> A Cytobrush (Medscand, Hollywood, Florida, U. S. A.) was used for <b>smear</b> preparation for CP. TP <b>smears</b> were processed in ThinPrep 2000 (Cytyc). <b>Smears</b> were stained with Papanicolaou stain and were interpreted according to the Bethesda system. RESULTS: The number of satisfactory but limited (SBL) cases with TP were 77 (7. 5 %) as compared to 127 (12. 4 %) with the CP method. This reduction in SBL <b>smears</b> with the TP method and consequent increase in satisfactory <b>smears</b> were highly significant (P<. 001) by McNemar's test. As regards unsatisfactory <b>smears</b> in discordant pairs, {{although the number of}} unsatisfactory <b>smears</b> was higher with TP (41 cases) as against CP (27 cases), the difference was not statistically significant (P<. 05). The split-sample method showed a high correlation between the CP and TP diagnoses. TP <b>smears</b> had a significant advantage over CP <b>smears</b> in the {{reduction in the number of}} ASCUS and AGUS cases (14 vs. 29) (P<. 05) and increased the pickup rate of LSIL, 6 vs. 1. Time taken to screen the TP <b>smears</b> was half that of CP <b>smears.</b> No cases of LSIL or HSIL were missed on TP <b>smears.</b> CONCLUSION: The liquid-based processor significantly improved the adequacy and quality of <b>smears,</b> resulting in fewer recall cases for SBL <b>smears,</b> leading to more definitive diagnoses in atypical cases, increasing the pickup rate of LSILs and reducing the screening time.

40|$|Introduction: Transthoracic guided fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) of clinically suspected lung tumors is {{an increasingly}} common procedure in diagnosis. Cytospin <b>Smear</b> and Cellblock preparations of available material are helpful in subtyping and confirming the diagnosis, {{and they can}} also be used for further studies, i. e., special stain and immunohistochemistry, etc. Aims and Objectives: This research was undertaken to study the technique of guided transthoracic lung FNAC of clinically suspected lung tumors and the establish role of FNAC <b>smears,</b> cytospin <b>smears,</b> and cellblocks in the detection and typing of neoplastic lung lesions and correlation. Materials and Methods: Guided FNAC was taken from 100 cases of clinically suspected lung tumor and FNAC <b>smears,</b> cytospin <b>smears,</b> and cellblocks of aspirated material were studied over a period of 2 years from September 2011 to September 2013. Results: The material adequacies were 80 % in FNAC <b>smears,</b> 83 % in cytospin <b>smears,</b> and 89 % in cellblocks. Additional information supported by cytospin <b>smear</b> and cellblock was 3 % and 9 %, respectively.

5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked <b>smeared</b> with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E

5|$|Moses Hazen {{had served}} as a {{lieutenant}} in the 44th Regiment during the French and Indian War and was receiving a half-pay pension for his British service. In 1775, while he was living on this plus the income from his estate in St. Jean, Quebec, the colonial army invaded. Nevertheless, Hazen was arrested by the British on suspicion of spying for the Americans. He was held a prisoner for 54 days, until he was finally released by General Montgomery after the fall of Montreal in November. Hazen then joined the American cause, and took part in the battle of Quebec. Following the American failure to take the city, Hazen and Edward Antill, an American expatriate, traveled to Philadelphia to report on the battle. Congress partially compensated Hazen by establishing the 2nd Canadian Regiment. He accepted the command, thus forfeiting his British half-pay. Antill was made lieutenant colonel of the regiment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study examined, {{with the}} use of {{transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM), the aggressiveness of three self-etching adhesive systems in penetrating dentin <b>smear</b> layers of different thickness. METHODS: Dentin disks were produced from extracted human third molars. For the control group, the middle dentin surface was cryofractured to create a bonding surface that was devoid of a <b>smear</b> layer. The experimental teeth were polished with wet 600 or 60 -grit SiC paper to produce bonding surfaces with thin and thick <b>smear</b> layers. They were bonded using one of the three self-etching systems: Clearfil Mega Bond (Kuraray), Non-Rinse Conditioner and Prime&Bond NT (Dentsply DeTrey) and Prompt L-Pop (ESPE). Bonded specimens were then demineralized and embedded in epoxy resin for TEM examination. RESULTS: For Mega Bond, thin authentic hybrid layers between 0. 4 - 0. 5 microm were found. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were retained as part of the hybridized complex. For Non-Rinse Conditioner/Prime&Bond NT, the authentic hybrid layers were between 1. 2 - 2. 2 microm thick. <b>Smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved in dentin with thin <b>smear</b> layers, but were partially retained as part of the hybridized complex in those with thick <b>smear</b> layers. For Prompt L-Pop, authentic hybrid layers were 2. 5 - 5 microm thick and <b>smear</b> layer and <b>smear</b> plugs were completely dissolved even in dentin with thick <b>smear</b> layers. SIGNIFICANCE: Contemporary self-etching systems may be classified as mild, moderate and aggressive based on their ability to penetrate dentin <b>smear</b> layers and their depth of demineralization into the subsurface dentin.
