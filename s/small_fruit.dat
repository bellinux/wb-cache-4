G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E

Introduction: In {{this age}} {{when there is}} so much {{scientific}} as well as practical knowledge available in regard to the culture of <b>small</b> <b>fruits,</b> there are few excuses which the farmer of today may offer for not having a fruit-garden upon his farm that will furnish sufficient <b>small</b> <b>fruits</b> for his table. In the earlier days {{it was supposed to be}} too much work and bother for the farmer to raise <b>small</b> <b>fruits,</b> but that day is, we are glad to say, passing away although there are some who still cling to the old ideas. It is the aim of this paper to farther dispel the doubts remaining in the mind of the farmers as to their ability to raise <b>small</b> <b>fruits,</b> by presenting some facts in regard to the cultivation and care of <b>small</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R

5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} <b>small</b> <b>fruit,</b> and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{described by}} Derek Reid in 1972, H.aurantiaca var. macrospora and H.aurantiaca var. rufa, {{have since been}} promoted to distinct species status as H.macrospora (1996) and H.rufa (2008). Two other varieties of the fungus have been described, {{but they are not}} considered to have independent taxonomic significance by Index Fungorum: var. nana (Singer 1946), characterized by a <b>small</b> <b>fruit</b> body; and var. robusta (Antonín 2000), characterized by a robust fruit body and an odour similar to Maggi seasoning sauce. Pale forms of the fungus are sometimes referred to as var. pallida. This taxon was first published by Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi in 1953, but later considered invalid as it did not conform to nomenclatural rules. Variety nigripes, a taxon with a black-brown stipe, is invalid for similar reasons. H.aurantiaca var. pallida was published validly in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Negros {{fruit dove}} (Ptilinopus arcanus) is {{a species of}} bird in the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae. It is endemic to the island of Negros in the Philippines. This fruit dove is known from a single female {{specimen}} collected from the slopes of Mount Kanlaon {{in the northern part}} of the island. While it was found at a high elevation, it is suspected that the species originally lived in the lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction. While some have suggested that the specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species, this is not widely accepted. The female Negros fruit dove was a <b>small</b> <b>fruit</b> dove with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy-grey forehead. It had a distinctive ring of bare yellow skin around its eye, and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it the appearance of having a yellow wingbar when perched. The throat was white, while the undertail and vent were yellow.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackcap}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred {{habitat is}} mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers {{as well as other}} blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4–6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11days. The chicks fledge in 11–12days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, {{for the rest of the}} year, blackcaps survive primarily on <b>small</b> <b>fruit.</b> Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and <b>small</b> <b>fruit.</b> The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E
500|$|Leotia lubrica, {{commonly}} referred to as a jelly baby, is a species of fungus in the family Leotiaceae. The species produces <b>small</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies up to [...] in height, featuring a [...] "head" [...] and a stalk. Ochre with tints of olive-green, the heads are irregularly shaped, while the stalk, of a similar colour, attaches them to the ground. The appearance can be somewhat variable and is similar to a number of other species, including Cudonia confusa, C. circinans, L.atrovirens and L.viscosa. L.lubrica was first validly described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, but it was later transferred to Leotia by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Its relationship {{with other members of the}} genus, of which it is the type species, is complicated.|$|E

Insects were almost entirely absent, owing no doubt to the extreme dampness, and I did not get a single butterfly the whole trip; yet I feel sure that, during the dry season, a week's residence on this mountain would well repay the collector in every department of natural history.|$|E

They even managed to carry <b>small</b> <b>fruit</b> tied up in their tails for the baby's mother, who felt at last that she was safe and at peace. Not that she forgot her husband, for she often thought of him and longed to show him her son, and in the night she would sometimes lie awake and wonder where he was.|$|E
