40|$|ASEE 2009 In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{spread spectrum}} links {{that can be}} used to overcome intentional jamming. The problem of communicating in the presence of jamming is very much akin to the problem of communicating over fading channels. Hence, by finding out how to defeat jamming by spread spectrum will also reveal how to overcome fading. Today, spread spectrum links are also used in many civilian systems to overcome non-intentional jamming (or interference), and the report is concluded with an overview of current commercial spread spectrum systems. In addition to the traditional coherent spread-spectrum systems, the definition of an ideal modified version is introduced and this model is analyzed from an information theoretic viewpoint. The project uses a simple point-to-point communication system with fully <b>synchronized</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver in a simple channel with white Gaussian noise and arbitrary jamming signal. We prove that in traditional systems the channel converges to a Gaussian noisy channel in the limit in the case of almost any jamming signal, and in our new ideal modified system the channel converges to a white Gaussian noisy channel in the limit in the case of any jamming signal when the processing gain goes to infinity...|$|E

40|$|Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) {{is part of}} the {{critical}} infrastructure necessary for the safety and efficiency of vessel movements, especially in congested areas such as the North Sea. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), especially the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS), have become the primary PNT sources for maritime operations. The GNSS position is used both for vessel navigation and as the position and timing source for other systems such as Automatic Identification System (AIS). Unfortunately, GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and interference, intentional or not, which can lead to the loss of positioning information or, even worse, to incorrect positioning information. The user requirement is for dependable PNT information at all times. One potential source of resilient PNT services is Ranging Mode (R-Mode), an alternative PNT concept related to Signals of OPportunity (SoOP) PNT, which uses signals independent of GNSS. In 2013 the German Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration contracted for a feasibility study of R-Mode using medium frequency (MF) Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and very high frequency (VHF) AIS signals as well as those signals in combination and in combination with eLoran. At ION GNSS+ 2014 some of the authors presented the results from that feasibility study and showed the projected performance using the signals individually and in combination. In most of the shipping lanes on the North Sea it appeared that 10 m or better performance could be achieved. Following up on that work, prototypes of a transmitter and receiver for MF-DGNSS R-Mode have been developed. The transmitter was installed in IJmuiden (Netherlands) and the receiver deployed along the Dutch coast to the south of the transmitter for initial on-air testing of the R-Mode concept; both were synchronized to UTC via GPS. While positioning is not possible with only one R-Mode transmitter, the combination of a <b>synchronized</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver pair allows for useful testing of the R-Mode concept. Specifically, the receiver could estimate a true range (rather than a pseudorange); hence, the stability of the range with environmental variations (e. g. weather, day/night skywave effects, etc.) can be studied. To further study skywave effects, the R-Mode modulator was relocated to a more powerful transmitter at Heligoland (Germany) and the receiver moved to a location near the Kiel Canal (Germany). A second receiver was installed at a similar distance from the transmitter to enable simultaneous comparison of two different propagation paths. Later a third receiver was added in order to provide three paths of different lengths. The original R-Mode feasibility study also examined the number of stations that {{it would be possible to}} receive in the North Sea area to ensure there were sufficient stations for positioning. However, it did not look at the converse question; how would a large number of R-Mode signals impact legacy users. As part of the prototype development, very limited experiments were performed to assess the impact of the new signals on legacy DGNSS receivers. Specifically, during the on-air testing mentioned above, a commercial DGNSS receiver was able to accurately demodulate and decode the on-air transmissions from the single prototype R-Mode transmitter; the impact of multiple signals was not examined. A new study, funded by the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland, has just been initiated to analyze how legacy equipment would respond to multiple R-Mode signals at different frequencies, both in-band and out-of-band. This paper presents details of the prototype transmitter and receiver and includes statistical analyses of the range estimates recorded to date and the impact of skywave interference at night using data from the German test sites. Additionally, this paper includes preliminary results of the R-Mode signal interference study...|$|E

40|$|Global {{navigation}} satellite systems (GNSSs) can deliver very good position estimates under optimum conditions. However, in urban and indoor scenarios positioning with GNSS is often impossible. On the other hand, cellular wireless communication systems, e. g., the new, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based third generation partnership project’s long-term evolution (3 GPP-LTE), provide excellent coverage in urban and most indoor environments. Thus, this paper researches timing based positioning algorithms for OFDM using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements and the 3 GPP-LTE signals. Therefore, it introduces synchronization, TDOA estimation, and signal–to–noise ratio (SNR) estimation algorithms. To solve the navigation equation for TDOA, this paper considers the static Gauss-Newton algorithm, positioning Kalman filter and particle filter.

40|$|The {{success of}} a long term {{transient}} electromagnetic survey (TEM) rigorously calls for appropriate system calibration, in addition to advanced processing and inversion of the measured data.

For these reasons, a reference site plays an important role. As first step, we performed the calibration of a Geonics 47 at the Lyngby reference site in Denmark. We then set up a new reference site using the same calibrated TEM instrument. The reference site was established in the San Rossore park area (Pisa), where we identified an area that matches the required conditions. Subsequently, a series of TEM measurements were collected in the selected area using two pre-calibrated TEM instruments: the Geonics 47 and the WalkTEM respectively. The reference responses were therefore jointly inverted, obtaining a 5 layers model that was appointed to be the TEM reference model for the site. Afterwards, based on that reference model, we calibrated the Geonics 47 and 57 instruments for a 100 x 100 m central loop configuration. A unique time-shift and a data level shift factor was calculated and applied to the TEM system as result of the calibration procedure.
