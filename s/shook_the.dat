5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{by the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of over-population, land shortages and depleted soils. The loss of life in the Great Famine of 1315–17 <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population, with major implications for the post-plague economy. The agricultural sector shrank, with higher wages, lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system of cash rents for lands. The Peasants Revolt of 1381 <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably for a century to come. The 15th century saw the growth of the English cloth industry and the establishment of a new class of international English merchant, increasingly based in London and the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economy of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Together with improvements in metalworking and shipbuilding, this represents the end of the medieval economy, and the beginnings of the early modern period in English economics.|$|E

5|$|In September 994 Michael Bourtzes, the Byzantine {{military}} governor (doux) of Antioch and northern Syria, suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of the Orontes {{at the hands}} of the Fatimid general Manjutakin. This Fatimid victory <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine position in Syria, and posed a grave threat to its Arab vassal, the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo. To prevent its fall, Emperor Basil II himself intervened in the region in 995, forcing Manjutakin to retire to Damascus. After capturing Shayzar, Hims and Rafaniya, and building a new fortress at Antartus, the emperor withdrew, leaving Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series.

5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{at the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of overpopulation, land shortages and depleted soils. The Great Famine <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population. The agricultural sector shrank rapidly, with higher wages, lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system centring on the charging of cash rents for lands. As returns on land fell, many estates, and in some cases entire settlements, were simply abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were deserted during this period. A new class of gentry emerged who rented farms from the major nobility. Unsuccessful government attempts were made to regulate wages and consumption, but these largely collapsed in the decades following the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself {{in the center of a}} media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog.

5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids.

These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{belief in}} the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also {{challenged}} when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe the Heavens were displeased and that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Then in 873 a disastrous harvest <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, {{and tens of thousands}} faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714–719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors <b>shook</b> <b>the</b> mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E
