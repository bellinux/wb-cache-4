In 1992, following the fall of the Siad Barre regime, the U.S. opted for a military intervention which it named Restore Hope but the operation soon escalated when the focus shifted from humanitarian aid to an attempt at restructuring Somalia’s government. By 1993 following the Battle of Mogadishu (1993), portrayed in the book and movie black hawk down, the mission in Somalia was considered a failure. The Clinton administration was criticised for the operation's outcome, primarily due to the decision to abandon the region before completing the operation's humanitarian and <b>security</b> <b>objectives,</b> and for their failure to recognize the threat Al-Qaida elements posed in Somalia as well as to U.S. security interests at home.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to reconceptualise the EU’s {{international}} identity {{in the context of}} its counter-piracy efforts at the Horn of Africa. While in the past grand narratives have lent meaning to the EU’s role in the world – e. g. civilian power, global power – {{the current state of the}} discipline is characterised by the so-called strategic deficit. What both these narratives and their critique misunderstand is the logic of security at the EU level by disregarding its grounding in a particular history and process of institution-forming, most notably reflected in the legacy of constructive ambiguity and the transgovernmental bias, which combine to produce an institution that is fundamentally de-politicised - or, rather, post-political - in nature. With recourse to this institutional particularity, I propose a conceptual approach based on the imperative of ‘managing globalisation’, which elucidates how the EU frames and tackles piracy as an adverse instance of globalisation. First, the Somali pirate is discursively removed from his local context and relocated to the global security agenda as the unpolitical enemy of all and threat to global order. As the relevant ‘other’ he is used to legitimate EU intervention. Second, the EU’s declared comprehensive approach to counter-piracy reflects an operationalisation of the new dogma of ‘effective multilateralism’. While piracy mitigation remains important as a <b>security</b> <b>objective,</b> international cooperation itself is elevated to the status of <b>security</b> <b>objective.</b> Consequently, the EU’s practice of counter-piracy is driven by its concern with the management of globalisation, concomitantly redefining the EU’s international identity towards becoming a global security-provider...|$|R
