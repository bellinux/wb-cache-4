40|$|Quantum spin Hall (QSH) {{effect is}} {{promising}} for achieving dissipationless transport devices {{due to the}} robust gapless states inside insulating bulk gap. Here, by using first-principles calculations, we discover group-IV chalcogenide Si 2 Te 2 film to be a 2 D QSH insulator with a fundamental band gap of 0. 29 eV, which is tunable under external strain. This nontrivial topological phase <b>stems</b> from <b>band</b> inversion between the Si-px,y and Te-px,y orbitals, demonstrated by {{a single pair of}} topologically protected helical edge states with Dirac point locating in the bulk gap. Notably, the characteristic properties of edge states, such as the Fermi velocity and edge shape, can be tuned by edge modifications. Additionally, the h-BN semiconductor is an ideal substrate for experimental realization of 2 D Si 2 Te 2 film, without destroying its nontrivial topology. Our works open a new route for designing topological spintronics devices based on 2 D silicon-based films. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Most previous studies focused on the topological edge modes in Bragg gaps which are induced by lattice scatterings. While local resonant gaps would be of great use in subwavelength control of acoustic waves, whether it is possible to achieve topological interface states in local resonant gaps is a question. In this article, we study the topological bands near local resonant gaps in a time-reversal symmetric acoustic systems and elaborate the evolution of band structure using a spring-mass model. Our acoustic structure can produce three band gaps in subwavelength region: one originates from local resonance of unit cell and the other two <b>stem</b> from <b>band</b> folding. It is found that the topological interface states can only exist in the band folding induced band gaps but never appear in the local resonant band gap. The numerical simulation perfectly agrees with theoretical results. Our study provides an approach of localizing the subwavelength acoustic wave...|$|R

40|$|There {{now exists}} {{a wealth of}} {{experimental}} evidence that Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 is an odd-parity superconductor. Experiments further indicate that among the <b>bands</b> <b>stemming</b> from the Ru {xy,xz,yz} orbitals, {{the portion of the}} Fermi surface arising from the xy orbitals exhibits a much larger gap than the portions of the Fermi surface arising from the {xz,yz} orbitals. In this paper the role of impurities on such an orbital dependent superconducting state is examined within the Born approximation. In contrast to expected results for a nodeless p-wave superconductor the unique nature of the superconducting state in Sr_ 2 RuO_ 4 implies that a low concentration of impurities strongly influences the low temperature behavior.

Field effect transistors consisting of thin (thickness: 5 - 17 nm) Bi 2 Se 3 are fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of single crystals, and a combination of conventional dielectric (300 nm thick SiO 2) and electrochemical or chemical gating methods are used to move the Fermi energy through the surface Dirac point inside bulk band gap, revealing the ambipolar gapless nature of transport in the Bi 2 Se 3 surface states.
