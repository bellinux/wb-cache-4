40|$|AbstractA {{hypothetical}} CO 2 {{storage site}} {{that has some}} abandoned wells located near the injection well is considered. Generally, cement plugs are set to cover or isolate porous or productive formations and to isolate usable groundwater from hydrocarbons. When CO 2 is injected into a reservoir, supercritical CO 2 or dissolved CO 2 spreads out in the reservoir. This dissolved CO 2 can react chemically with cement <b>seals</b> (<b>plugs</b> and casing cement) in abandoned wells. As a result, minerals in the cement <b>seals</b> (<b>plugs</b> and casing cement) may alter to form other minerals or mineral phases. The first simulations concerning migration of supercritical CO 2 and dissolved CO 2 in a saline aquifer and a depleted gas field reservoir, were carried out using TOUGH 2. The following temperatures and depths of reservoir were selected: 50 °C at E. L. - 1, 000 m, 60 °C at E. L. - 1, 500 m and 70 °C at E. L. - 2, 000 m. Secondly, geochemical reactions of cement <b>seals</b> (<b>plugs</b> and casing cement) were simulated. The results of reservoir simulations were used as boundary conditions for the geochemical calculation of cement seals. Geochemical simulation of the reactions yielded the extent (length) of alteration of cement <b>seals</b> (<b>plugs</b> and casing cement) after long time periods; for example, the alteration length of cement seals after 1, 000 years was about one meter.

40|$|Chloride stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) is a plausible corrosion mechanism for the stainless steel 3013 containers during their lifetime for plutonium material storage if sufficient electrolyte is present within the container. Contributing factors for SCC, such as fabrication and welding residual stresses, {{are present in the}} 3013 cans. Convenience and inner cans from both Hanford and SRS are made by a flow form process, which cold works the stainless steel during fabrication. Additionally, the inner cans also are sealed at the can top with a closure weld to the <b>sealing</b> <b>plug.</b> Only SRS and Hanford were tested since moisture levels were significant for SCC. As part of the 3013 corrosion plan for FY 09, testing in a boiling magnesium chloride solution was performed on actual 3013 convenience and inner cans to determine if the residual stresses were sufficient for the initiation and propagation of SCC. Additional testing in a 40 % calcium chloride solution was also performed on 304 L stainless steel SCC coupons, i. e. stressed teardrop-shaped samples (teardrops), and an inner can welded top to provide comparative results and to assess the effect of residual stresses in a less aggressive environment. The testing performed under this task consisted of 3013 inner and convenience cans and 304 L teardrops exposed to a boiling magnesium chloride solutions per ASTM G 36 and a 40 % calcium chloride solution at 100 C following the guidance of ASTM G 123. Cracking occurred in all can types including the inner can bottom and welded top and the bottoms of the SRS and Hanford convenience cans when exposed to the boiling magnesium chloride solution at 155 C. Cracking occurred at different times indicative of the residual stress levels in the cans. 304 L teardrops cracked in the shortest time interval and therefore provide a conservative estimate for can performance. Testing in a 40 % calcium chloride solution at 100 C demonstrated that cracking occurs in a less aggressive environment but at significantly longer times than in the boiling magnesium chloride. Vapor space cracking was also found to occur in the inner can welded top exposed over the boiling magnesium chloride solution and on 304 L teardrops exposed over a hot calcium chloride solution...|$|E

When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed <b>seal</b> <b>plugs</b> is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole <b>seal</b> <b>plugs</b> uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a resilient elastomer seal with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed <b>seal</b> <b>plugs</b> shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCompacted bricks of bentonite/sand mixture {{are planned}} {{to be used as}} <b>sealing</b> <b>plugs</b> in deep {{radioactive}} waste disposal repositories because of their low permeability, high swelling capacity and favourable properties with respect to radionuclide retention. The isolating capacity of compacted bentonite/sand mixture is closely related to microstructure features that have been often investigated, in particular by using scanning electron microscope (SEM or ESEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). In this work, microfocus X-ray computed tomography (µCT) observations were used in parallel with MIP measurements to further investigate at larger scale the microstructure of a laboratory compacted bentonite/sand disk (65 / 35 % in mass). Qualitative observation of µCT images showed that sand grains were inter-connected with some large pores between them that were clearly identified in the bimodal pore distribution obtained from MIP measurements. Due to gravitational and to frictional effects along the specimen periphery, a higher density was observed in the centre of the specimen with bentonite grains more closely compacted together. This porosity heterogeneity was qualitatively estimated by means of image analysis that also allowed the definition of the representative elementary volume. Image analysis also provided an estimation of the large porosity in good agreement with MIP measurements...|$|R

In this context, the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has launched the SEALEX project (SEALing performance EXperiments) in which this work has been conducted. Once the initially heterogeneous unsaturated powder/pellet (80 / 20) MX 80 bentonite mixture is put in place, these sealing materials will be subject to coupled hydro-mechanical loadings: hydration due to the infiltration of pore water from the natural barrier and mechanical confinement resulting from the engineered barriers. The present work focuses on the different scales of the material: at the macroscopic scale, it is characterised by a heterogeneous distribution of pellets and powder of bentonite; at the microscopic scale, it is studied by several techniques (MIP, μ-CT observations and SEM).

MethodsUsing a previously reported mathematical model distal distraction forces were calculated prior to performing in vitro pullout testing. The top end of the proximal body and the iliac limbs of the distal body were attached to the grips of a tensile tester via plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>plugs</b> and pneumatic clamps. Channels within the plugs allowed pressurisation of {{the inside of the}} stent-graft. Pullout tests were conducted in the vertical plane. Force and displacement data were recorded and tests repeated 8 times at room temperature with the stent-grafts either dry or wet and unpressurized, at 100  mmHg or at 120  mmHg. ResultsThe median maximum pullout force was 2. 9  N (2. 6 – 4. 1) when dry, 3. 9  N (3. 5 – 5. 4) when wet and unpressurized, 6. 3  N (4. 8 – 8. 3) when wet and pressurized at 100  mmHg and 6. 5  N (4. 8 – 7. 2) when wet and pressurized at 120  mmHg. There was a significant difference between pressurized and unpressurized conditions (P <  0. 01). ConclusionsThe force required to distract the distal bifurcated component of a fenestrated stent graft is much lower than the reported proximal fixation strength of both a standard and fenestrated Zenith stent graft.
