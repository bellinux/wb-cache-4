It includes a <b>seat-back</b> screen that is 11.1 inches, compared to the previous 9 inches. By 2017, EVA Air will finish refurbishing most of their 777-300ER aircraft with the newest premium economy and economy product, along with the installation of Wi-Fi.|$|E
5|$|World Traveller is the {{long-haul}} {{economy class}} offered on international flights to destinations outside Europe. It offers <b>seat-back</b> entertainment, complimentary drinks and meals. AVOD is offered on all A380s, 747s, 777s and 787s.

The outlets in World Traveller are located between each seat.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in mid-2007, {{four major}} airlines, United, Continental, Delta, and Emirates, reached {{agreements}} to install iPod seat connections. The free service will allow passengers {{to power and}} charge an iPod, and view video and music libraries on individual <b>seat-back</b> displays. Originally KLM and Air France were reported {{to be part of}} the deal with Apple, but they later released statements explaining that they were only contemplating the possibility of incorporating such systems.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the seating}} is bleacher-style; the two midfield {{sections}} have stadium seating with <b>seat-backs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ink has {{multiple}} media space opportunities with chosen partner airlines. These include plane wraps, inflight entertainment guides, headrest covers, table trays, menus, timetables, <b>seat-backs,</b> check-in and on-board product sampling and in-cabin announcements.|$|R

25|$|Boeing's {{cancellation}} of the Connexion by Boeing system caused concerns that in-flight internet would not be available on next-generation aircraft such as Qantas' fleet of AirbusA380s. However, Qantas announced in July 2007 that all service classes in its fleet of A380s would have wireless internet access, as well as <b>seat-back</b> access to e-mail and cached web browsing. Certain elements would also be retrofitted into existing Boeing 747-400s. The in-flight entertainment system indicates that Internet access is provided by OnAir.|$|E
25|$|Air China {{introduced}} its new Airbus A330-300 to long-haul operations beginning with services to Düsseldorf, Germany in summer 2011. These aircraft provided the same two-class cabin standard as the Airbus A330-200 {{except that the}} economy cabin had no <b>seat-back</b> entertainment system installed (with {{the exception of the}} first two economy rows which also had increased legroom). Düsseldorf is now the third German destination on the Air China network. The airline launched a new Beijing-Milan-Malpensa service on 15 June 2011, complementing the airline's existing service to Milan from Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|From October 1995, the V6 {{models were}} simply {{known as the}} Vienta—losing the Camry {{identity}} altogether. The availability of manual transmission on the CSi and Touring Series V6 sedan variants coincided with the update, while the V6 Grande superseded the V6 Ultima. Perforated leather upholstery and wood grain trim on the Grande was optional. Towards {{the end of the}} model run, special edition Getaway (October 1996) and Intrigue (April 1997) sedan models were launched. Based on the CSi, the Getaway was further equipped with 14-inch alloy wheels, a CD player and air conditioning. Also based on the CSi, the Intrigue added air conditioning, CD player, Jacquard upholstery, extra <b>seat-back</b> map pockets, and 15-inch wheels. Toyota fitted the four-cylinder Intrigue with the same wheel covers as the Vienta CSi, with the Vienta Intrigue upgraded to alloy wheels.|$|E
50|$|Some {{airlines}} have now installed personal televisions (otherwise known as PTVs) for every passenger on most long-haul routes. These televisions are usually {{located in the}} <b>seat-backs</b> or {{tucked away in the}} armrests for front row seats and first class. Some show direct broadcast satellite television which enables passengers to view live TV broadcasts. Some airlines also offer video games using PTV equipment. Fewer still provide closed captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers.|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1957, McNeal Pavilion {{played host to}} both men's and women's basketball, women's {{volleyball and}} wrestling. The first of two changes to McNeal {{occurred}} in 1990 when the seating in the main arena was doubled to 1,400 during a complete building renovation. The second change happened during 1998-99 and involved resurfacing the gym floor and installing 550 new <b>seat-backs</b> for the seats {{on the east side}} of the gym. McNeal Pavilion also included a swimming pool, racquetball courts, a rock climbing gym, and training rooms. McNeal was torn down in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The all-steel body {{followed}} modern styling trends, and {{featured a}} [...] "panoramic wrap-around" [...] rear window and tail fins. There was space for four people, {{although the two}} in the back would have found their head room rather restricted. The sales material of the time makes much of the car's passive safety features, such as the two spoke steering wheel with a recessed central hub, rounded door handles and a lock on the front <b>seat-backs</b> {{to prevent them from}} tilting forwards unexpectedly. The padded dashboard and interior window frames were also unusual, and the claim can certainly be made that in terms of secondary safety (US English: [...] "crashworthiness") the Lloyd Arabella marked a step forward for cars of this class. [...] The spare wheel was stowed below the rear luggage compartment. It was stowed externally which meant it could be accessed without having to empty out the luggage locker.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests {{that there may be}} an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and <b>seat-back</b> systems.|$|E
2500|$|A final Chevrolet Caprice PPV update {{was made}} for the 2017 model year, {{including}} a limited-slip differential for the V6 model, vinyl rear bench seat with <b>seat-back</b> security panel, 18" [...] full size spare wheel and the deletion of two exterior paint colour options. Like the Holden Caprice WN and exports to the Middle East, the Caprice PPV will be discontinued when production in Australia ends.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 2014, Lufthansa's {{long-haul}} Premium Economy {{is being}} rolled out on all long-haul aircraft, starting with some Boeing 747-8s. Similar in design to Air Canada's Premium Economy or British Airways' World Traveller Plus cabins, Premium Economy features [...] pitch along {{with up to}} [...] more width than economy class, depending on the aircraft. The seats also feature a [...] personal <b>seat-back</b> entertainment screen and a larger armrest separating seats.|$|E
50|$|The 43 bhp, 948 cc OHV engine (coded 9CC) {{was derived}} from the Austin A35 and Morris Minor 1000 models, also BMC products, but {{upgraded}} with twin 1 inch SU carburettors. The rack and pinion steering {{was derived from}} the Morris Minor 1000 and the front suspension from the Austin A35. The front suspension was a coil spring and wishbone arrangement, with the arm of the Armstrong lever shock absorber serving as the top suspension link. The rear axle was both located and sprung by quarter-elliptic leaf springs, again with lever-arm shock absorbers and top links. There were no exterior door handles; the driver and passenger were required to reach inside to open the door. There was also no boot lid, owing to the need to retain as much structural integrity as possible, and access to the spare wheel and luggage compartment was achieved by tilting the <b>seat-backs</b> forward and reaching under the rear deck, a process likened to potholing by many owners, but which resulted in a large space available to store soft baggage.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the base XTS, there are currently five trim packages labeled [...] "Luxury", [...] "Premium Luxury", and [...] "Platinum", with the optional XTS V-Sport offered in both [...] "V-Sport Premium Luxury" [...] and [...] "V-Sport Platinum". Some of the standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, 4G LTE connectivity, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry, leather seat-upholstery, 8-way power front seats, parking assist and comprehensive safety equipment like ABS, stability control, dual-stage front airbags, front side airbags, side-curtain airbags front and rear, and a driver side knee airbag. Optional equipment and technology is extensive, including separate climate controls for rear seat passengers, coupled with 8" [...] LCD screens that flip up from the front passenger <b>seat-backs,</b> allowing an internal DVD player to display content with wireless headphones. The interior can be outfitted in a large assortment of color combinations, along with four types of wood selections. Cadillac's CUE system is standard with an 8-speaker Bose sound system, including HD Radio and SiriusXM. An optional 14-speaker Bose sound package includes AudioPilot noise compensation technology.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew that}} he was in labor with another of those winks of his, though I could not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and wishing him a safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-sacks. It made a great pyramid by the {{roadside}} when it was all out. When they had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again, but put no mail on top, and only half as much inside as there was before. The conductor bent all the <b>seat-backs</b> down, and then filled the coach just half full of mail-bags from end to end. We objected loudly to this, for it left us no seats. But the conductor was wiser than we, and said a bed was better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect his thoroughbraces. We never wanted any seats after that. The lazy bed was infinitely preferable. I had many an exciting day, subsequently, lying on it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how the characters would turn out.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, First Great Western {{announced}} a major overhaul upgrade for its Class 43 locomotives (InterCity 125 power cars), {{including a new}} MTU engine. Two power cars with the new engine were successfully trialled. In 2005, it undertook a [...] {{of a pair of}} InterCity 125 coaches to bring them up to modern standards. Another coach has been refurbished with experimental aircraft-style <b>seat-back</b> screens. As part of its franchise commitments First Great Western announced that it will refurbish the entire fleet and re-engine all power cars with the MTU engine ...|$|E

60|$|He went early, {{and found}} himself in the end seat of a long row of many rows of women, who were prolonging the time of keeping their hats on till custom obliged them to take them off. He gave so much notice to the woman next him as to see that she was deeply veiled as well as widely hatted, and then he lapsed into a dreary muse, which was broken by the first strains of the overture. Then he {{diverted}} himself by looking round at all those ranks of women lifting their arms to take out them hat-pins and dropping them to pin their hats to the <b>seat-backs</b> in front of them, or to secure them somehow in their laps. Upon the whole, he thought the manoeuvre graceful and pleasing; he imagined a consolation in it for the women, who, if they were forced by public opinion to put off their charming hats, would know how charmingly they did it. Each turned a little, either her body or her head, and looked in any case {{out of the corner of}} her eyes; and he was phrasing it all for a scene in his story, when he looked round at his neighbor to see how she had managed, or was managing, with her veil. At the same moment she looked at him, and their eyes met.|$|R
50|$|Jetstar's Boeing 787 {{aircraft}} are fitted with 10-inch <b>seat-back</b> on-demand entertainment screens in business class and 9-inch screens in economy class.|$|E

This service is available on all A380, A350, B787, A319, and select A320, A321, and A330-200 aircraft.|$|E
50|$|SAHR {{is mounted}} {{at the top}} of a frame, inside the <b>seat-back,</b> which is {{designed}} to pivot at its mid point. In a rear-end impact, the occupant’s lower back is forced rearwards by inertia against the bottom portion of the <b>seat-back.</b> A mechanical linkage in the frame then forces the upper half, carrying the head restraint, upwards and forwards to catch the occupant’s head and help minimise the amount of whiplash movement.The Benefit of the SAHR's system is that the headrest doesn't require replacement once used, unlike BMW and Volvo's WHIPS systems.|$|E
50|$|The new {{magazine}} would feature mainly current military {{news and}} Canadian military history. The magazine continued {{to retain its}} <b>seat-back</b> distribution with Air Canada military charters and Scott Taylor began to hire staff to help fill their new eighty-four page format.|$|E
