For the specified purposes, 1794 senior pre-service science teachers (876 males, 905 females, and 13 no response) participated in the study. Results showed that GPA was significantly but not strongly associated with task value, metacognitive <b>self-regulation,</b> <b>effort</b> regulation, peer learning, mastery approach, performance approach, and mastery avoidance. It was also found that pre-service science teachers’ scores of task value, metacognitive <b>self-regulation,</b> <b>effort</b> regulation, mastery approach, and mastery avoidance differ in terms of their gender...|$|E

Sustaining Industry Self-Regulation in the Face of Free-Riding Industry self-regulation, the voluntary association of firms to control their collective behavior, is emerging as an important complement to government regulation. To date, scholars have focused on the decision by firms to participate in self-regulatory efforts. However, scholars have not fully considered the financial implications of these programs for members and nonmembers. Would non-members be better served by participating in self-regulatory programs? In this paper, we test several conflicting hypotheses. We find that while most of the benefit of industry self-regulation spills over to non-members, member firms continue to participate so as to prevent failure of the <b>self-regulation</b> <b>effort.</b> Our findings have important implications for both theory and practice.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a recently}} funded tourism industry capacity building pilot for micro tourism businesses in regional Australia. Skills augmentation, building destination relationships and linkages and industry-wide benchmarking are internationally recognised as leading economic drivers {{for economic growth}} in general, and the tourism industry in particular. Small and micro tourism enterprises (SME) face enormous difficulty competing with their larger counterparts. To make matters worse, many SME are often located in peripheral regions where access to skills support is limited. To date <b>self-regulation</b> <b>efforts</b> in the tourism sector have resulted in little evidence that the industry is capable of capacity building without external planning and intervention.

40|$|The local life {{assurance}} {{industry is a}} major player in the financial sector and has funds under its management which arguably rival any other single sector in the economy. Events in 2008 - 9 saw substantial loss of policy holder funds as a result of dollarization when the erstwhile currency of the day, the Zimbabwean dollar was dumped. That such huge losses occurred under the watch of sector players and the regulators raises questions about the sectorâ€™s preparedness to meet the myriad of risks that are part and parcel of todayâ€™s complex business environment. The study therefore aims to investigate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies being used in the long term insurance sector following dollarization in January, 2009. Other objectives include finding out if there are any regulatory issues that need to be addressed to improve viability of the sector. To accomplish these objectives the study targeted the 10 {{life assurance}} companies that serve the market with a view to conduct in-depth interviews with at least two officials from each of the companies targeted. The study established that whereas there were risk management frameworks used in the sector these largely fell behind in terms of current best practice. Additionally it was found that there are issues to do with both regulation and self-regulation by industry practitioners themselves that need to be tackled to take the industry forward. Finally the study recommended that the industry move forward by embracing ERM frameworks in line with global trends in risk management. Regulators as well were called to complement <b>self-regulation</b> <b>efforts</b> through enacting various supporting legislation. The study then identified the need to conduct in â€“depth case studies at individual player level as an area of further study.

50|$|The most {{comprehensive}} evaluation data {{are of the}} Hampshire RRR initiative. Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess {{the effects of the}} RRR. Included were children ages 4 - 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR. These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of <b>self-regulation,</b> confidence, <b>effort</b> and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{has been}} {{described}} as a state of cognitive efficiency and intrinsic enjoyment, whereby a person feels at one with the activity. The existence of an autotelic personality’, an inter-individual difference dimension characterised by the propensity with which a person experiences flow, has been proposed, but the construct has proven to be relatively elusive. The overall aim of this PhD dissertation was to advance flow theory, and in particular enhance the knowledge of individual differences in flow experiences by the investigation of a new construct, flow metacognitions. Flow metacognitions were defined as people’s metacognitive knowledge and beliefs on flow as a state of optimal cognitive functioning. Building upon the concepts of adaptive and maladaptive metacognitions (Beer & Moneta, 2010; Wells, 2000) that were found to impact <b>self-regulation</b> <b>efforts</b> during demanding situations, it was postulated that people would also hold metacognitions on flow, a cognitive state of deep absorption usually elicited by a demanding activity. However, to date, flow metacognitions had not been defined, measured, or tested for their relevance in the context of flow experiences (or in other contexts of optimal experience). This dissertation presents four studies that were conducted to identify flow metacognitions, comprising the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire to measure them validly and reliably, as well as the examination of the scientific relevance of the operationalised constructs. Preliminary instances of potential flow metacognitions were identified in qualitative analyses, whereby the qualitative content of Flow Questionnaires (FQ, Csikszentmihalyi & Csikszentmihalyi, 1988) administered to a sample of 371 workers was analysed. In addition, semi-structured interviews with 12 workers were held about their experiences of flow in work (Study 1, Chapter 2). From these analyses, two broad metacognitions emerged: people’s beliefs in the ‘usefulness’ of being in flow, and individual differences in their beliefs and confidence in the self-regulation of flow experiences. Based on the metacognitive constructs identified in the qualitative analyses, a 53 -item pilot Flow Metacognitions Questionnaire (FMQ) was developed and tested on a sample of 204 UK students. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-component solution, with item reduction procedures leading to a 12 -item scale. Subsequent principal component analysis on the same sample confirmed that the 12 items loaded onto two main components: Beliefs that Flow Fosters Achievement (FMQ- 1) and Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow (FMQ- 2). The subscales explained a total of 52. 4...|$|R
40|$|Two {{forms of}} {{thinking}} about the future are distinguished: expectations versus fantasies. Positive expectations (judging a desired future as likely) predicted high effort and successful performance, but the reverse was true for positive fantasies (experiencing one’s thoughts and mental images about a desired future positively). Participants were graduates looking for a job (Study 1), students with a crush on a peer of the opposite sex (Study 2), undergraduates anticipating an exam (Study 3), and patients undergoing hip-replacement surgery (Study 4). Effort and performance were measured weeks or months (up to 2 years) after expectations and fantasies had been assessed. Implications for the <b>self-regulation</b> of <b>effort</b> and performance are discussed. Research consistently finds that optimistic thinking about the future fosters motivation and successful performance, whereas pessimistic thinking dampens motivation and successful performance (Bandura, 1997; Heckhausen, 1991; Seligman, 1991; Taylor & Brown, 1988). Optimistic thinking is associated with successful cognitive and self-regulatory problem solving, with prosocial and helping behavior, with setting high standards and aspirations, and with indicators of mental health—all of these factors are essential for well-being and personality development. Optimistic thinking even hinders the emergence of acute and chronic disease and slows its progress (C. Peterson & Bossio...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} new {{theoretical}} {{perspective on the}} <b>self-regulation</b> of <b>effort.</b> In the first part, we discuss research on motivational intensity and cardiovascular adjustments. The sympathetic impact on the heart via beta-adrenergic receptors is proportional to task engagement. This beta-adrenergic impact becomes especially evident in shortened cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP). PEP thus serves as a “gold standard” measure of effort mobilization. Most research on effort mobilization has supported some form of resource conservation principle, or the notion that people prefer to minimize effort to attain their goals. This research has especially supported the predictions of motivational intensity theory that posits that people mobilize effort proportionally to task demand as long as success is possible and justified. However, research from the automaticity literature suggests that people can also be directly primed to mobilize their effort, and that such priming also influences PEP. This raises the question if automatic priming processes operate independently of the resource conservation principle. To resolve this problem, we propose a bounded effort automaticity approach, which integrates automaticity research with the resource conservation principle. In this approach, priming action and inaction during task performance automatically leads to effort mobilization, but {{only as long as}} success is possible and justified. In support of our approach, we discuss studies showing that automatic priming increases mobilized effort but only as long as success is possible and justified. These findings confirm that effort mobilization can be influenced automatically, but only within boundary conditions...|$|R

40|$|Writing is a {{difficult}} and demanding task. It is a conscious and self-directed activity, involving the intelligent use {{of a variety of}} mental operations and skills to satisfy the writer’s goals and {{meet the needs of the}} reader (Graham, in press b). As a result, a writer must deal with many demands at once. As Hayes and Flower (1980) noted, skilled writers caught in the act look very much like busy switchboard operators as they try to jug-gle a number of demands on their attention simultaneously (e. g., making plans, drawing ideas from memory, developing concepts, or creating an image of the reader). In fact, skilled writing does “not simply unfold automatically and effortlessly in the manner of a well learned motor skill [...] . writing any-thing but the most routine and brief pieces is the mental equiv-alent of digging ditches ” (Kellogg, 1993, p. 17). It involves a high degree of <b>self-regulation,</b> cognitive <b>effort,</b> and attentional control (Graham & Harris, 2003).

40|$|Abstract: This session {{presents}} {{efforts to}} develop metacognitive skills in mathematics learning. These skills are seen in current research not only as necessary conditions but also critical for learning mathematics. Current {{research in the area}} of metacognition and mathematics education supports the belief that metacognitive skills are a needed condition for learning mathematics. Metacognition is viewed as important not only in problem solving but in all mathematics performance. The study of metacognition argues for a change from the traditional, teacher-centered instruction to instruction addressing cognition metacognitively. Examples of this new educational trend include cooperative learning activities, the promotion of reflective thinking through discussion and writing, and the development of <b>self-regulation.</b> In an <b>effort</b> to create self-awareness and promote independent learning in their mathematics learning, students can be actively engaged in their learning by whole class or small group discussions, writing activities, and self-monitoring tasks.

40|$|There is an ongoing {{debate whether}} there is a primary deficit in visual {{selective}} attention in childhood attention deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We explored this question using a visual search paradigm, in which participants searched for a target that either 'popped out' of the display (a parallel search) or was difficult to find (a serial search). If visual selective attention is impaired in children with ADHD they should perform similarly to normally developing children in parallel search tasks, but should show poorer performance in serial search tasks. As motivation is an important influence on selective attention, particularly in children with ADHD, we also tested the hypothesis that children with ADHD can improve their performance in serial search tasks for a reward. We first developed and validated visual search tasks suitable for children with normally developing control participants. Children had to search for a pig wearing a blue hat and a green tie. We manipulated search type (feature or conjunction search tasks), set size, and feedback (correct/incorrect or reward). The results showed parallel search for feature search tasks and serial search for conjunction search tasks. We then compared children with ADHD with non-clinical controls using these new visual search tasks. Our results showed that children with ADHD and those in the control group were influenced similarly regarding RT and accuracy, by search type and set size, but differently by feedback. That is, children with ADHD and the control children did not differ in the reward feedback condition; however, in the correct/incorrect feedback condition children with ADHD were slower. Overall, these results suggest that children with ADHD show no specific deficits in selective attention but show poorer performance when external motivators are lacking. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that <b>self-regulation</b> of <b>effort</b> may be the core deficit of children with ADHD...|$|R
40|$|The {{learning}} process {{is sensitive to}} the demands from the learning task and the specific subject of study. This study provides a characterization of the motivational and cognitive learning strategies used by students {{in their first year}} of an undergraduate Civil Engineering degree course at a prestigious Chilean university. The module considered for this study was “Introduction to Calculus”, the first course in Mathematics that these students took {{at the beginning of their}} career. A sample of 339 students (73 % of the total students enrolled) attended the last lecture and consented to participate in this study lecture (no student rejected to participate). They answered the Motivated Strategies Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The MSLQ asked the students about the motivational and cognitive learning strategies that they applied in the selected module. Mean scores for motivational and cognitive items were categorized into low, medium or high values. Students reported high motivational strategies, particularly regarding their value of the task and their control of learning beliefs. These were ranked as “high” level. As for the cognitive learning strategies, they were also high but slightly lower than the motivational dimensions of the learning experience. Hence, they were ranked in an upper-middle range, excelling in metacognitive <b>self-regulation</b> and <b>effort</b> regulation. Moreover, motivational and cognitive strategies were interrelated components affecting the learning outcomes. This study explored self-reported motivational and cognitive learning strategies applied by first-year undergraduate students of a Civil Engineering degree course in one of the largest universities in Chile. Our findings suggest that both motivational and cognitive components of the {{learning process}} are relevant and interact with each other. These results contribute to a better understanding of the learning process of Engineering students in an early curricular stage.

40|$|Ideal living {{requires}} {{people to}} work together, cooperate, and help one another. Hence, prosocial behavior is a necessity in modern life. Culture functions largely in part by people helping one another. Helping others is not easy, however, and can often demand effort and energy. Ingrained tendencies and other factors might predispose people toward selfishness and failing to help others. Self-regulation (or self-control) is the capacity that allows for the resolution of conflict arising from competing thoughts and behaviors (e. g., by overriding one thought or behavior with another) and for the exertion of <b>effort.</b> <b>Self-regulation</b> thus allows for increased prosociality, {{to the extent that}} factors (e. g., selfishness) that decrease prosociality must be overridden. Work on self-regulation has found that self-regulation is impaired after prior self-regulatory exertion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). This occurs because glucose – a primary energy for the brain – in the bloodstream is metabolized (used up) during self-regulation faster than it is replenished. The lowered glucose levels then undermine self-regulation. Work on helping behavior shows a similar pattern, consistent with the idea that helping requires self-regulation. After self-regulating, people are less helpful i...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between tonic—a correlate of self-regulatory functioning—and phasic cardiac vagal activity (indexed by heart rate variability; HRV) during a selective attentional task with varying levels of load. Participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on either fearful or neutral face distractors. Letter strings consisted of six target letters under low load and one target letter and five nontarget letters under high load. With fearful distractors, lower tonic HRV was associated with phasic HRV suppression, suggesting an autonomic stress response under both low and high load. In contrast, higher tonic HRV was associated with phasic HRV enhancement, suggesting greater self-regulatory effort under low load and an absence of phasic HRV suppression under high load. The current research suggests that tonic cardiac vagal tone is associated with the ability to flexibly adapt autonomic responses.

40|$|Introduction: Research {{on medical}} {{students}} shows that adopting <b>self-regulation</b> of <b>effort,</b> time, and study strategies can positively influence academic achievement. The {{purpose of the}} current study was to assess learning and study strategies in medical students. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 2014 - 2015 at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The sample size was determined 360 students {{based on the results of}} a pilot study on 30 members of the study population. Medical students in the first to fourth year of their studies were selected through simple sampling randomly. A valid and reliable Persian translation of Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI) questionnaire was completed by the students. It measures three latent factors of selfregulated learning: Skill, Will, and Self-Regulation. It consists of 80 questions in ten different scales (each scale including eight questions and a variable score of 8 - 40). Data were analyzed using t-test, correlation analysis, and ANOVA. Results: Considering the ten LASSI scales, the highest mean score belonged to test strategies (28. 67 ± 4. 44), and the lowest mean to self-testing (21. 91 ± 4. 91). The results showed significant statistical differences between male and female students in selecting the main idea, attitude, and self-testing. ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests showed a significant difference between the mean scores of different areas of LASSI among students with different grade point average (GPA) in the university. In all areas except the study aids, the mean scores of students with GPA higher than 17. 5 were significantly higher than those of students with GPA lower than 14. 5. Conclusion: The results showed that students need help and consultation in most areas of learning and study strategies. Using 10 areas of LASSI can determine the strengths and weaknesses of students in various areas. Knowing their own limitations, students will be able to improve their study habits. Hence, it is suggested to evaluate the students when enrolling at universities and design educational programs based on the students’ characteristics...|$|R

We assessed whether multiple {{variables related to}} <b>self-regulation</b> (perceived mental <b>effort)</b> emotional states (e. g., anxiety, stress, etc.) and motivational states (e. g., boredom, engagement, etc.) may co-occur or interact with frontal attentional processing probed in two matched-samples of fourteen lower-SES and higher-SES adolescents. ERP and EEG activation were measured during a task probing selective attention to sequences of tones. Pre- and post-task salivary cortisol and self-reported emotional states were also measured. At similar performance level, the higher-SES group showed a greater ERP differentiation between attended (relevant) and unattended (irrelevant) tones than the lower-SES group. EEG power analysis revealed a cross-over interaction, specifically, lower-SES adolescents showed significantly higher theta power when ignoring rather than attending to tones, whereas, higher-SES adolescents showed the opposite pattern. Significant theta asymmetry differences were also found at midfrontal electrodes indicating left hypo-activity in lower-SES adolescents. The attended vs. unattended difference in right midfrontal theta increased with individual SES rank, and (independently from SES) with lower cortisol task reactivity and higher boredom. Results suggest lower-SES children used additional compensatory resources to monitor/control response inhibition to distracters, perceiving also more mental effort, as compared to higher-SES counterparts. Nevertheless, stress, boredom and other task-related perceived states were unrelated to SES. Ruling out presumed confounds, this study confirms the midfrontal mechanisms responsible for the SES effects on selective attention reported previously and here reflect genuine cognitive differences...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore constituents of social belongingness and propose a model of perceived social belonging in the context of executive business and elite sport. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted upon 30 business executives and athletes; both elite and amateur. The interviews were transcribed and common themes were extracted. Participants did not perceive social belongingness in terms of individual relationships but instead as small groups, or example, “parents”, “friends”, “club members”, “team” or “neighbors”, clustered into three domains: family, work/occupation and social life. All participants emphasized the self- regulatory aspect of social belongingness: “contributing” to be “supported”. Furthermore, participants reported feeling “energized” or “drained” depending on how they perceived their level of social belonging. Belongingness to one group could supply energy for operating in others. Senior executives and elite athletes were focused on generating sufficient energy for the work/occupation domain and reported significant situational fluctuations in perceived belongingness levels based on their perception of situational performance in high pressure environments. In contrast, employees and amateur participants were more concerned with “work-life-balance”. Proposed is a model of perceived social belongingness as a hierarchy of inter-connected small group related energy reserves providing resources for <b>self-regulation,</b> motivation and <b>effort</b> regarding that specific group, other groups within the same domain or other domains, and being re-energized by perceived social belongingness to that specific group.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups [...] the collaborative help group (n= 42) and the individual help group (n= 21).; It was hypothesized that the collaborative help group would perform better in content understanding, domain-specific problem solving strategies, domain-independent problem solving strategies (elaboration, adaptive help-seeking strategies and maladaptive help-seeking strategies), and <b>self-regulation</b> (test anxiety, <b>effort,</b> academic efficacy, and control strategies) than would the individual help group.

And the collaborative help group requested more helps and asked more questions than did the individual help group. However, the participants in the collaborative help group did not perform any better than those in the individual help group on teamwork skills, problem strategies, and self-regulation strategies posttests. This study provided evidence for integrating a problem solving model with collaborative learning components. Educators can use helping strategies training as an instructional strategy to enhance their current collaborative learning design...|$|R
