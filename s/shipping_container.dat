In Point Samson, 500people evacuated to shelters in Wickham, Western Australia. TCWC Perth began issuing hourly warnings for potentially affected areas beginning at 1400UTC on 14 December. As the storm made landfall, some residents of Whim Creek took refuge in a <b>shipping</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the <b>shipping</b> <b>container</b> and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Frazier Park, California, with a budget of $45,000. It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days, {{most of which were}} spent on Ron Trost's property. Scenes set in BLT's house were filmed at the Trosts' childhood home, while the look of his basement was designed using the inside of a <b>shipping</b> <b>container.</b> Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets. The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story. Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{the author}} proposes {{to study the}} {{feasibility}} of applying ISO <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> as alternative construction materials. Using retired <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> for dwellings, offices or other construction purposes is an environmentally friendly idea. The 2 ̆ 2 green generation 2 ̆ 2 constitutes a battle against harmful effects of industrial developments. Motivated by the green movement, this research addressed the recycling of <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> in the construction market. Particularly, this research studied the recycling of <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> {{for the purpose of}} student housing construction. The design and justification of the implementation of the innovative construction materials was achieved through the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. The research contribution includes the analysis of the feasibility of the application of the alternative structural components. This research discussed the development of an alternative sustainable method of construction. The author studied if the application of <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> as a structural component of a building can significantly reduce construction cost in addition to the decrease of energy consumption. The author found that it is feasible to use <b>shipping</b> <b>containers</b> to develop midrise student residences with 4 - 7 stories living quarters...|$|R

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected <b>shipping</b> <b>container,</b> holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates {{that it must be}} solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a recent example, the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a <b>shipping</b> <b>container</b> was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
5|$|The first {{long-lived}} supercell, which {{spawned the}} tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado to occur during this outbreak, developed around 4:50 pm CST (2250 UTC) southeast of Centerville in Yell County, Arkansas. The tornado touched {{down to the}} southwest of New Neely, causing minor damage to two structures and downing trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado tracked into Pope County, rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength as it slammed into Lucky Landing, a marina at Lake Atkins where multiple vehicles, boats, and mobile homes were destroyed, and one woman was killed. Continuing northeast, the tornado struck the southern and eastern edge of Atkins, killing three people. 65 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 39 others were damaged {{to a lesser degree}} in the Atkins area. Several vehicles were blown off of Interstate 40, and six mobile homes were destroyed as well, with five others damaged. Northeast of Atkins, the tornado toppled metal truss towers, destroyed chicken houses, and heavily damaged a large church and gym. In the Happy Bend area, another fatality occurred as a man abandoned his mobile home and sought shelter in a large metal <b>shipping</b> <b>container,</b> which was tossed hundreds of yards into a wooded area. The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County at EF3 intensity, passing near the town of Cleveland. 36 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 6 sustained major damage, and 8 sustained minor damage along this segment of the path. Several chicken houses were completely destroyed, killing 80,000 chickens, and an elderly couple was killed when their mobile home was swept completely away.|$|E
