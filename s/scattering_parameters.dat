500|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, none of {{the transfer}} matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice. [...] Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy. [...] For waveguide implementations, circuit voltage and current are entirely meaningless. [...] Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead. [...] These are the powers tranmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in the transmission line technology used in distributed-element circuits in the microwave band. [...] The most well known and widely used of these sorts of parameters is the <b>scattering</b> <b>parameters,</b> or s-parameters.|$|E
500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. [...] These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the <b>scattering</b> <b>parameters</b> matrix for each element. [...] The overall filter response is then found from the combined scattering matrix of all the individual element matrices. [...] This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>scattering</b> <b>parameter</b> {{extraction}} {{method of}} metamaterial homogenization is reviewed {{to show that}} the only ambiguity is the one related to the choice of the branch of the complex logarithmic function (or the complex inverse cosine function), whereas it has no ambiguity for the sign of the wave number and intrinsic impedance. While the method indeed yields two signs of the intrinsic impedance, and thus the wave number, the signs are dependent, and moreover, both sign combinations lead to the same permittivity and permeability, and are thus permissible. This observation is in distinct contrast to a number of statements in the literature where the correct sign of the intrinsic impedance and wave number, resulting from the <b>scattering</b> <b>parameter</b> method, is chosen by imposing additional physical requirements such as passivity. The <b>scattering</b> <b>parameter</b> method is reviewed through an investigation of a uniform plane wave normally incident on a planar slab in free-space, and the severity of the branch ambiguity is illustrated through simulations of a known metamaterial realization. Several approaches for proper branch selection are reviewed and their suitability to metamaterial samples is discussed. Comment: 21 pages including 4 figures.
