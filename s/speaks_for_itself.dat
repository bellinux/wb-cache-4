25|$|Born in Paris, {{he studied}} under Jacques-François Blondel, Germain Boffrand and Jean-Laurent Le Geay, {{from whom he}} learned the {{mainstream}} French Classical architecture in the 17th and 18th century and the Neoclassicism that evolved after the mid century. He {{was elected to the}} Académie Royale d'Architecture in 1762 and became chief architect to Frederick II of Prussia, a largely honorary title. He designed a number of private houses from 1762 to 1778, though most of these no longer exist; notable survivors into the modern era include the Hôtel de Brunoy (demolished in 1930) and the Hôtel Alexandre, both in Paris. His work for François Racine de Monville has apparently also vanished but his probable influence on Monville's own architectural works as seen at the Désert de Retz <b>speaks</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> Together with Claude Nicolas Ledoux {{he was one of the}} most influential figures of French neoclassical architecture.|$|E

25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. People either loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha was a genius at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record that <b>speaks</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He was an absolute genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books far more often had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E

Modell was intrigued, {{partly because of the}} potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport. Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially. As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would [...] "have a free hand" [...] in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract.
