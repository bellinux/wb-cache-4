5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, but he was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes {{standing}} awkwardly holding seven swords, {{the fighting}} continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates {{were able to}} escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from striking {{the rear of the}} Iron Brigade, and <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat {{for the rest of the}} day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more pressing need was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E

25|$|Richardson {{played for}} Bacup and Burnley Cricket Clubs in the Lancashire League in the 1930s.

25|$|On {{the eve of}} the battle, Antony's {{soldiers}} hear strange portents, {{which they}} interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavius' side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus' goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.|$|E

Erica thinks he is dead, and so with help from Janet Green and Skye Chandler, they bury Kinder, but he is very much alive.|$|E
25|$|Another {{debate about}} tyrannosaurs {{would not be}} settled until the early 21st century: their diet. Early {{researchers}} were <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the massive bulk of Tyrannosaurus rex that some, like Lawrence Lambe, were skeptical that it was even capable of hunting down live prey and assumed that it lived as a scavenger. This view continued to be advocated into the 1990s by Jack Horner but was shown false by Kenneth Carpenter, who reported {{the discovery of a}} partially healed tyrannosaur bite wound on an Edmontosaurus annectens tail vertebra, proving that T. rex at least sometimes pursued living victims.|$|E

25|$|In Portugal, {{euthanasia}} {{is practiced}} at publicly owned kennels although several different associations actively shelter strays. Among those is Patas Errantes, a non-profit private organization founded in 2006 which practices {{a policy of}} taking dogs off the street, vaccinating and sterilizing them, and either returning them to the streets or finding them new owners. Liga Portuguesa dos Direitos do Animal, a public utility state-recognized organization founded in 1981, is also quite active in animal sterilization and fights for no-kill. Sintra town kennel is noted for having ceased euthanasia practices in their kennel. However, the shelter admits that during the holidays, it is <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with unwanted and discarded animals that euthanasia is required for humane reasons.|$|E

Robin rushes to the nurses' station. Patrick proposes in front of all of their friends and other loved ones. While everyone is looking at Robin, she becomes <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> and leaves, leaving Patrick devastated. Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying. She does not want him to marry her only because she is pregnant with his child, and although he states he wants to marry her for her, she still says no. She tells him that she loves him, but that she cannot marry him, and walks away, leaving Patrick heartbroken.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Brundage was {{increasingly}} {{concerned about what}} to do with his collection. His homes in Chicago and California were <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> with art that priceless artifacts were kept in shoeboxes under beds. In 1959, Brundage agreed to give part of his collection to the city of San Francisco. The following year city voters passed a bond issue of $2,725,000 to house the donation. The result was the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, which opened in 1966 in Golden Gate Park, initially sharing space with the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum before moving to its own facility near the Civic Center in 2003. Brundage made another major donation in 1969 (despite a fire which destroyed many pieces at his California home, [...] "La Piñeta" [...] near Santa Barbara in 1964), and left the remainder of his collection to the museum in his will. Today, the museum has 7,700 pieces from Brundage among the 17,000-plus objects which make up its collection.|$|E
500|$|On the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield won the Republican {{nomination}} {{after receiving}} 399 votes, 93 higher than Grant's total.

Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|Henry {{tried to}} present his victory as a new {{beginning}} for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a [...] "modern age" [...] with its dawn in 1485. [...] Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian Bernard André, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers {{for the next four}} hundred years. [...] As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. [...] For England the Middle Ages ended in 1485, and English Heritage claims that other than William the Conqueror's successful invasion of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. [...] According to Reader Colin Burrow, André was <b>so</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his Henry VII (1502). [...] For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because [...] "the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side." ...|$|E
