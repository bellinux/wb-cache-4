5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> hope of just getting outside to die. They meet {{up by the}} door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E

5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} spiral {{staircase}} from 1871 was repaired and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the <b>stairs.</b> <b>In</b> October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement window on the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E
5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} almost instantly. Sharp's wife Eliza {{witnessed}} the entire {{scene from the}} top of the <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured.

In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E

5|$|On the {{occasion}} of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaudí constructed the pavilion for the Compañía Trasatlántica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Marítim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Saló de Cent and the grand <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only the chair was made, and Mayor Francesc Rius i Taulet presented it to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited {{the west side of the}} elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone <b>stairs.</b> <b>In</b> the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing beside him and later on the <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E
5|$|Norman keeps {{had four}} sides, with the corners {{reinforced}} by pilaster buttresses; some keeps, particularly in Normandy and France, had a barlongue design, being rectangular in plan with their length twice their width, while others, particularly in England, formed a square. These keeps could {{be up to}} four storeys high, with the entrance placed on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down; early French keeps had external <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> wood, whilst later castles in both France and England built them in stone. In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding. The strength of the Norman design typically came from {{the thickness of the}} keep's walls: usually made of rag-stone, these could be up to 24 feet (7.3 metres) thick, immensely strong, and producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter. The larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions had a single, slightly cramped chamber on each floor. Usually only the first floor would be vaulted in stone, with the higher storeys supported with timbers.|$|E
