50|$|The {{heterodyne}} receiver, {{which uses}} a superconducting-insulator-superconducting (SIS) Josephson junction as the mixer, is the two-backshort design of Kerr (Pan et al. 1983). A <b>scalar</b> <b>feed</b> couples the microwave signal to the receiver, where it is mixed with a local oscillator (LO) signal to produce a 1.4 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal that is further amplified with a low-noise high electron mobility field effect transistor (HEMT FET) amplifier, and passed to the IF section of the receiver. The IF section further amplifies the signal and heterodynes it down to 150 MHz, passing a bandwidth of 200 MHz to the spectrometer.|$|E

40|$|A new {{variety of}} millimeter-wave Fresnel-zone plate lens with {{enhanced}} focusing quality is described. Each full-wave {{zone of the}} lens is divided into four quarter-wave subzones, which are covered by dielectric rings having equal thickness but different permittivities. More practical equations are derived for the radii of the zones, and for {{the thickness of the}} lens by taking into account the angle of incidence of the electromagnetic wave. A Fresnel-zone plate antenna (FZPA) consisting of a quarterwave lens and a <b>scalar</b> <b>feed</b> is developed and analysed theoretically. Equations for the aperture field and far field are derived using multiple ray tracing through dielectric plates and vectorial Kirchhoff diffraction theory, respectively. It is demonstrated that the proposed transmissive-type FZPA has an aperture efficiency of more than 50 % in the 60 GHz frequency band. This computed efficiency agree with the measured overall efficiency reported by other researchers for an X-band quarter-wave reflector-type FZP...|$|E

The antennas used question-mark mounted <b>scalar</b> <b>feeds</b> oriented to transmit or receive linearly polarized 17. 65 -GHz signals having electric field vectors at + 45 deg and - 45 deg from the vertical. Rain data were collected and analyzed for 24 individual storms in which the rain rate exceeded 10 mm/hr. Received signal levels were sampled once each second and stored by a small digital computer which controlled the experiment and performed preliminary data processing. The results are compared with a theoretical model presented by Wiley et al. (1974). Experimental cross-polarization isolation data are found to agree well with theoretical values, especially at high rain rates where the antenna effects are the least significant...|$|R

40|$|Improving the {{connectedness}} of airliners {{in flight}} {{to allow the}} realisation of passengers&# 039; expectations for uninterrupted cell phone usage and internet access requires overcoming the bottleneck between the airliners&# 039; internal networks and the wider world in a cost effective manner while still providing sufficient bandwidth. The 43. 5 - 47 GHz band is attractive for airliner to ground links {{due to lack of}} utilisation and the small physical size of high gain antennas. Prior work on this lens reflector topology produced two satisfactory designs; a epsivr= 2. 5 lens fed by a conventional choked feed and a epsivr= 1. 7 lens fed by a conical horn with dielectric insert. The latter gave superior cross-track plane scan performance with more stable 3 dB beamwidth, but the dielectric insert would be prohibitively small and expensive to construct for the 43. 5 to 47 GHz band.

40|$|Doppler {{reflectometry}} {{is currently}} {{used as a}} powerful technique to measure the perpendicular (to the magnetic field) velocity of density fluctuation, the radial electric field, and the perpendicular wave number spectrum in many fusion plasma devices. In GAMMA 10 a Doppler reflectometer has recently been installed to measure perpendicular rotation velocity of density fluctuation in the cylindrical plasma. The Doppler reflectometer has an antenna system with a launching/receiving <b>scalar</b> <b>feed</b> antenna and focusing mirrors. By rotating one of the mirrors the tilt angle of the incident microwave can be controlled against the normal of cutoff layers. A frequency synthesizer {{is used in the}} range 11. 5 - 18 GHz as the stable microwave source of X-mode probing beam for GAMMA 10 plasma having typical peak density ∼ 2 × 1018 m− 3.

40|$|The Background Emission Anisotropy Scanning Telescope (BEAST) is a {{millimeter}} wavelength experiment designed to generate maps of {{fluctuations in the}} cosmic microwave background (CMB). The telescope is composed of an off-axis Gregorian optical system with a 2. 2 m primary that focuses the collected microwave radiation onto an array of cryogenically cooled high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) receivers. This array is composed of six corrugated <b>scalar</b> <b>feed</b> horns in the Q band (38 to 45 GHz) and two more in the Ka band (26 to 36 GHz) with one of the six Q-band horns connected to an ortho-mode transducer for extraction of both polarizations incident on the single feed. The system has a minimum beam size of 200 with an average sensitivity of 900 mu K root s per receiver. This paper describes the design and performance of the BEAST instrument and provides the details of subsystems developed and used toward the goal of generating a map of CMB fluctuations on 200 scales with sensitivity in l space between l similar to 100 and l similar to 500. A map of the CMB centered on the north celestial pole has been generated from the BEAST telescope in a 9 degrees wide annulus at declination 37 degrees with a typical pixel error of 57 +/- 5 mu K when smoothed to 300 resolution. A brief summary of the map and results generated by an observing campaign at the University of California White Mountain Research Station are also included...|$|E
40|$|Compact antenna test ranges {{intended}} for low cross-polarization antenna measurements {{require the use}} of feeds with polarization ratios typically greater than 40 dB across the included angle of the quiet zone as well as across the frequency band of interest. The design for a series of circular corrugated aperture feeds to meet these requirements is presented. The feeds are based on a circular waveguide OMT covering a full waveguide frequency band with interchangeable corrugated apertures to cover three sub-bands. In order to validate the design of this series of <b>scalar</b> <b>feeds,</b> high accuracy cross-polarization data was collected. The primary limiting factor in the measurement of the polarization ratio was the finite polarization ratio of the source antennas. A technique for correcting for the polarization ratio of the source is presented along with measured data on the feeds. The technique begins with the accurate characterization of the linear polarization ratio of the standard gain horns using a three antenna technique, followed by pattern measurements of the feeds, and ends with the removal of the polarization error due to the source antenna from the measured data. Measured data on these feeds is presented before and after data correction along with data predicted using the CHAMP ® moment method software...|$|R
40|$|Taking the Randall-Sundrum {{models as}} {{background}} scenario, we derive generalized Israel-Lanczos-Sen thin-shell junction conditions for systems in which several bulk scalar fields are non-minimally coupled to gravity. We {{demonstrate that the}} form of the junction conditions (though arguably not the physics) depends on the choice of frame. We show that generally (in any frame except the Einstein frame) the presence of a thin shell induces discontinuities in the normal derivative of the scalar field, {{even in the absence of}} any direct interaction between the thin shell and the scalar field. For some exceptional scalar field configurations the discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric and the <b>scalar</b> fields can <b>feed</b> back into each other and so persist even in the absence of any thin shell of stress-energy.

40|$|Automatically verifying safety {{properties}} of programs is hard, {{and it is}} even harder if the program acts upon arrays {{or other forms of}} maps. Many approaches exist for verifying programs operating upon Boolean and integer values (e. g. abstract interpretation, counterexample-guided abstraction refinement using interpolants), but transposing them to array properties has been fraught with difficulties. In contrast to most preceding approaches, we do not introduce a new abstract domain or a new interpolation procedure for arrays. Instead, we generate an abstraction as a <b>scalar</b> problem and <b>feed</b> it to a preexisting solver, with tunable precision. Our transformed problem is expressed using Horn clauses, a common format with clear and unambiguous logical semantics for verification problems. An important characteristic of our encoding is that it creates a nonlinear Horn problem, with tree unfoldings, even though following "flatly" the control-graph structure ordinarily yields a linear Horn problem, with linear unfoldings. That is, our encoding cannot be expressed by an encoding into another control-flow graph problem, and truly leverages the capacity of the Horn clause format. We illustrate our approach with a completely automated proof of the functional correctness of selection sort...|$|R

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of the chaotic and fractal behaviour of the weather system, even when it appears to be stable and predictable on a large spatial scale, in some restricted regions the meteorological conditions can suddenly change [31]. The local, short time range variations of estimated flow shown in Figure 6 A constitute an example of motion which is mainly in opposite direction with respect to the average stream, dictated by the pressure distribution (Figure 5 A) and in agreement with the local flow estimated on a long time range (Figure 6 C). The goal of local weather nowcast is to provide precise predictions of the intensity, location, onset, and extinction of significant events. Both time and space scales must be sampled at high resolution. The proposed algorithm, together with a technique to extend the estimated flow, could be used to perform local nowcast, even though the time range of the reliable prediction could be limited by the short spatial range of investigation, in particular in case of convective precipitations. Other methods to perform local predictions are based on the analysis of a few time-series representing meteorological variables measured in the location in which the forecast is of interest. The prediction is not based on a simple linear extension of the present conditions, but on a nonlinear algorithm comparing the actual state with similar ones found in the past [29, 31]. However, local variables usually contain poor information about the stability or instability of weather conditions, which is important to perform a reliable forecast. Indeed, predicting the onset or the duration of rainy events from local measurements is very difficult, as it requires identifying the transition between two completely different weather states. The task could benefit from some specific indication extracted from a short range investigation indicating if the weather is stable or not. The algorithm presented here could provide information about the presence of rainy clouds {{in the vicinity of the}} local position of interest, their movements (possibly related to the wind at high altitude), which could be turbulent or stationary, and cloud formation and growing. All this information could be converted into a set of <b>scalar</b> time-series <b>feeding</b> a predictor model, together with the other time series already used, in order to improve the reliability of the forecast.|$|R
