At the receiver of such systems, multiple Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) blocks, each corresponding to one receive antenna, {{are required to}} be used. This induces considerable complexity. In this paper, we propose a pre-DFT processing scheme for the receiver of MIMO-OFDM systems with space-time-frequency coding. With the proposed scheme, the number of DFT blocks at the receiver can be any number {{from one to the}} number of receive antennas, thus enabling effective complexity and performance tradeoff. Using the pre-DFT processing scheme, the number of input signals to the space-time-frequency decoder can be reduced compared with the <b>subcarrier</b> based <b>space</b> processing. Therefore, a high dimensional MIMO system can be shrunk into an equivalently low dimension one. Due to the dimension reduction, both the complexity of the decoder and the complexity of channel estimation can be reduced. In general, the weighting coefficients calculation for the pre-DFT processing scheme should be relevant to the specific space-time-frequency code employed. In this paper, we propose a simple universal weighting coefficients calculation algorithm {{that can be used to}} achieve excellent performance for most practical space-time-frequency coding schemes. This makes the design of the pre-DFT processing scheme independent of the optimization of the space-time-frequency coding, which is desirable for multiplatform systems...|$|R

This results in an equality in (14) regardless of the channel decorrelation period. This approach would result in throughput reduction as the transmitters must wait in idle mode for the channel to decorrelate. Throughput loss can be avoided by having multiple JCMA groups accessing the channel in a TDMA fashion, so that one group uses the channel while the others wait for it to decorrelate. Alternatively, the protocol can be applied to only some of the <b>subcarriers</b> preferably <b>spaced</b> apart as much as possible across the bandwidth.|$|R

40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multicarrier modulation technique that {{is widely used}} in wireless broadband communication systems. The spectral e ciency of OFDM is very high since the <b>subcarriers</b> are <b>spaced</b> {{as closely as possible}} while maintaining orthogonality. However, one of the major problems with OFDM that can cause performance degradation is carrier frequency o set (CFO) which impairs the orthogonality among OFDM subcarriers, as a consequence, results in inter-subcarrier interference. In this thesis, an iterative algorithm for joint CFO estimation and data detection in OFDM systems over frequency selective channels is proposed. The proposed algorithm is performing both CFO estimation and data detection in the frequency domain based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm can achieve the same bit-error-rate (BER) performance as that of its time-domain counterpart with much lower complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge after three iterations and an estimate of CFO can be obtained with high accuracy...|$|R
