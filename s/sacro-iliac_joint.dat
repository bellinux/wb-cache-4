40|$|The spondyloarthritides (or spondyloarthropathies) (SPAs) are chronic, inflammatory, rheumatic {{diseases}} of unknown origin, which share certain clinical, epidemiological, and genetic characteristics. They include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis (also {{known as the}} Reiter Syndrome), psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic spondyloarthropathy (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease), undifferentiated spondyloarthritis, juvenile spondyloarthritis, and formes frustes such as acute anterior uveitis, spondyloarthritic carditis, and balanitis circinata. In the past, the SPAs were considered variants of rheumatoid arthritis, but {{it is now clear}} that they differ from the latter disease in terms of the pattern of articular and extra-articular involvement, their lack of association with seropositivity for rheumatoid factor, and their strong association with <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> bacino= pelvis <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> the class I human leukocyte antigen B 27. <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> bacino= pelvis <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> Their general characteristics are axial involvement; enthesitis; peripheral arthritis involving the lower limbs, which is usually asymmetric; dactylitis; extra-articular manifestations involving the skin, eyes, bowel, and genitals.

40|$|Abstract: Ankylosing {{spondylitis}} is a spondyloarthropathy {{affecting the}} <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joints</b> with subsequent progression to the spine and the hip joints. The hip joints {{are affected by}} synovitis, enthesial inflammation, involvement of medullary bone, progressive degeneration and secondary osteoarthritis. Clinical presentation is usually {{in the form of}} pain and stiffness progressing to disabling fixed flexion contractures and in some instances, complete ankylosis. Hip arthroplasty should be considered for hip pain, postural and functional disability, or pain in adjacent joints due to hip stiffness. We conducted a literature review to determine peri-operative considerations and outcome in ankylosing spondylitis patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. In this review, we have discussed pre-operative surgical planning, thromboprophylaxis, anaesthetic considerations and heterotopic ossification.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to propose a biomechanical model of <b>sacro–iliac</b> <b>joint</b> dysfunction {{as a cause of}} low back pain. <b>Sacro–iliac</b> <b>joint</b> is known {{to be a source of}} low back pain. We also know that it is a very stable joint with little mobility. Surrounding lower limb and back muscles contribute a major part of this stability. Gait analysis studies have revealed an orderly sequence of muscle activation when we walk – that contributes to efficient stabilisation of the joint and effective weight transfer to the lower limb. Gluteus maximus fibres-lying almost perpendicular to the joint surfaces are ideally oriented for this purpose. Biceps femoris is another important muscle that can also influence joint stability by its proximal attachment to sacrotuberous ligament. Altered pattern of muscle recruitment has been observed in patients with low back pain. But we do not know the exact cause–effect relationship. Because of its position as a key linkage in transmission of weight from the upper limbs to the lower, poor joint stability could have major consequences on weight bearing. It is proposed that <b>sacro–iliac</b> <b>joint</b> dysfunction can result from malrecruitment of gluteus maximus motor units during weight bearing. This results in compensatory biceps over activation. The resulting soft tissue strain and joint instability may manifest itself in low back pain. If our hypothesis holds true, it may have positive implications for patients with <b>sacro–iliac</b> <b>joint</b> dysfunction – who could be offered a definite diagnosis and targeted physiotherapy. It may be possible to identify patients early in a primary care setting and offer direct physio referral. They could benefit from exercises to improve strengthening and recruitment of the affected muscles...|$|E
40|$|Necrotizing {{soft tissue}} {{infection}} of an extremity {{is a rare}} but life-threatening disease. The disease is an infection that involves the soft tissue layer and is characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation (especially of the fascial planes and the surrounding tissues) with a high mortality. Early diagnosis {{is essential for the}} outcome of the patients. Radical surgical debridement is the treatment of choice. The predisposing factors are immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus and drug abuse. This report presents a case of necrotizing fasciitis in the thigh, following an abscess of the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint,</b> as a rare complication in a young, immunosuppressed woman. The patient’s history revealed intra-venous drug abuse and hepatitis C. After immediate diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging, radical surgical debridement was required and performed.

Here, we assessed the feasibility of arthroscopic exploration of the dislocated <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint.</b> Materials and methodsIn the first step of our study, we used ligament section to induce loss of <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> coaptation in a cadaver. We then studied 5 patients with Tile C pelvic ring injuries. Arthroscopy was used to clear the joint of fibrous tissue and to roughen the bone to subchondral level in order to induce sacro-iliac arthrodesis. In addition, posterior fixation was performed using a hinge system or an ilio-sacral screw. ResultsThe cadaver study confirmed the feasibility of sacro-iliac arthroscopy after disruption of the strong posterior inter-osseous ligament. In the clinical part of the study in 5 patients with Tile C pelvic ring injuries, arthroscopy allowed direct visualisation extending to the anterior part of the joint space. A power burr and synovial knife were introduced to remove the interposed fibrous tissue and to roughen the bone to subchondral level in order to induce joint fusion. In addition, percutaneous or open posterior fixation was performed in all 5 patients. No infectious complications were recorded.

40|$|My {{interest}} in the mechanism and injuries of the pelvis was roused when, {{during the course of}} dissections on the cadaver, it became necessary to remove the sacrum from in front. This at first appeared a difficult task, but it soon became apparent that the symphysis pubis was the key. Once the interpubic ligaments and the fibrocartilage had been severed, the pelvis opened out like the covers of a book and the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joints</b> offered little resistance; in fact they acted as hinges upon which rotation took place. Hyperextension of the hips gave further appreciable assistance in gaining a wide diastasis at the symphysis. FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY Special dissections were made ofthe interpubic ligaments and they revealed the importance of the anterior interpubic ligament. Although not all text-books ofanatomy stress its importance this ligament completely dwarfs in strength the superior and inferior interpubic ligaments. These appear to have no independent existence, being merely the superior and inferior portions of the great anterior ligament (Figs. 1 to 3).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Most {{women who}} give birth {{for the first}} time {{experience}} some form of perineal trauma. Second-degree tears contribute to long-term consequences for women and are a risk factor for occult anal sphincter injuries. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a multifaceted midwifery intervention designed to reduce second-degree tears among primiparous women. METHODS: An experimental cohort study where a multifaceted intervention consisting of 1) spontaneous pushing, 2) all birth positions with flexibility in the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joints,</b> and 3) a two-step head-to-body delivery was compared with standard care. Crude and Adjusted OR (95 % CI) were calculated between the intervention and the standard care group, for the various explanatory variables. RESULTS: A total of 597 primiparous women participated in the study, 296 in the intervention group and 301 in the standard care group. The prevalence of second-degree tears was lower in the intervention group: [Adj. OR 0. 53 (95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 84) ]. A low prevalence of episiotomy was found in both groups (1. 7 and 3. 0 %). The prevalence of epidural analgesia was 61. 1 percent. Despite the high use of epidural analgesia, the midwives in the intervention group managed to use the intervention. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reduce second-degree tears among primiparous women with the use of a multifaceted midwifery intervention without increasing the prevalence of episiotomy. Furthermore, the intervention is possible to employ in larger maternity wards with midwives caring for women with both low- and high-risk pregnancies...|$|R
40|$|In {{a review}} of 130 {{patients}} with psoriatic arthritis, spondylitis was noted in 40 per cent. Sacro-iliitis was observed in 21 per cent and was present either when axial disease was predominant (seven patients) or in association with peripheral polyarthritis (15 patients). The groups differed in {{that most of those}} with axial disease were males who had developed psoriasis later in life. In those with disease of the axial skeleton, nail dystrophy was less common, and iritis, chronic back pain and restriction of spinal mobility were more common. They had higher values of E. S. R. In both there was a high incidence of the histocompatibility antigen B 27. The axial group resembled idiopathic ankylosing spondylitis and the New York criteria were fulfilled by 86 per cent compared with 27 per cent of those who had peripheral arthritis as well. This latter group was frequently without symptoms or signs of spondylitis. Syndesmophytes are accepted as a radiological manifestation of spondylitis. They were noted in 25 per cent of patients and in 60 per cent of these the sacroiliac joints were normal radiologically. Anterior syndesmophytes alone were found only in the cervical spine and were more common in patients without sacro-iliitis. Lateral syadesmophytes were most commonly found in the lumbar and lower dorsal vertebrae and were slightly less common in patients without sacro-iliitis.

METHODS: The DESIR cohort included patients with inflammatory back pain (IBP; ≥ 3  months, but < 3  years), suggestive of axSpA. Local radiologists/rheumatologists (local-reading) and two central readers (central-reading) evaluated baseline images. Agreement regarding positive MRI (pos-MRI) between central readers and between local-reading and central-reading was calculated (κs). Number of patients classified differently (ASAS criteria) by using local-reading instead of central-reading was calculated. RESULTS: Inter-reader agreement between the two central readers and between local-reading and central-reading was substantial (κ= 0. 73 and κ= 0. 70, respectively). In 89 / 663 MRI-SIs (13. 4 %) local-reading and central-reading disagreed; 38 / 223 patients (17. 0 %) with pos-MRI (local-reading) were negative by central-reading; 51 / 440 patients (11. 6 %) with neg-MRI (local-reading) were positive by central-reading. In 163 / 582 patients eligible for applying ASAS criteria (28. 0 %), local-reading and central-reading disagreed on positive imaging (MRI-SI and/or X-SI; κ= 0. 68). In 46 / 582 patients (7. 9 %) a different evaluation resulted in a different classification; 18 / 582 patients (3. 1 %) classified no-SpA (central-reading) were axSpA by local-reading; 28 / 582 patients (4. 8 %) classified axSpA (central-reading) were no-SpA by local-reading. Among axSpA patients (central-reading), 16 / 419 patients (3. 8 %) fulfilling imaging-arm by central-reading fulfilled clinical-arm by local-reading; 29 / 419 patients (6. 9 %) fulfilling clinical-arm by central-reading fulfilled also imaging-arm by local-reading. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent onset IBP, trained readers and local rheumatologists/radiologists agree well on recognising a pos-MRI.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with clinical-anatomical, biomechanical, and radiological properties of the sacro-iliac joints. It was initiated in order to acquire {{a better understanding of}} these 'enigmatic' joints. We started with researching the macroscopic anatomy of the auricular surfaces of the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint.</b> Macroscopic alterations of these surfaces have been described by several authors. Generally, such changes are considered to be pathological (Sashin, 1930; Bowen & Cassidy, 1981). If that were true, it could be expected that such changes would cause pain or sacro-iliac problems in (older) men since the changes become gradually more apparent from puberty onwards and are more prominent in men than in women. However, in the view presented in this study, macroscopic changes such as coarse texture and the appearance of ridges and grooves, reflect adaptations to stability, promoted by the increase in weight during the adolescent growth spurt. One reason for our view is the presence of coarse texture and ridges and. grooves in, practically. all male sacro-iliac joints (chapter 1). Another reason is the observation that the ridges and grooves in the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> are complementary, and as a rule covered by intact cartilage, even in specimens of old age. All these features are more outspoken in men than in women. Differences between men and women may be attributed to child-bearing and to differential localization of the centre of gravity in relation to the sacroiliac joints (chapter I) ...|$|E

It was hypothesised that all the chosen treatment protocols would be effective in treating a dysfunctional Piriformis muscle, while it was hoped that the Chiropractic Manipulative Therapy of the Sacroiliac Joint would be the superior choice in treating a dysfunctional Piriformis muscle. Participants were recruited via posters and flyers in and around the University of Johannesburg Campuses. Forty five participants were recruited and randomly divided into three groups (Groupl received Chiropractic Manipulation of the Sacroiliac joint, Group 2 received Chiropractic Manipulation of the Sacroiliac joint combined with lschemic compression of the Piriformis muscle and Group 3 received only lschemic compression of the Piriformis muscle) by drawing a number from a box marked one, two and three for the different treatment protocols.

40|$|Women {{commonly}} sustain {{some form}} of perineal and vaginal injury when giving birth. Posterior perineal injuries have short- and long-term consequences for women which may lead to reduced quality of life. AIM: The aim of this thesis was to investigate midwives’ management and experiences of {{the second stage of}} labour in relation to perineal injuries of different severity. Furthermore, the aim was to evaluate whether an intervention based on woman-centred care reduces second-degree tears in primiparous women. METHODS: Study I, a population-based cohort study of planned home births in four Nordic countries (n= 2992). The aim was to assess whether birth positions with flexibility in the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joints</b> defined as flexible- or non-flexible sacrum positions were associated with perineal trauma. To explore midwives’ experiences of a birth where the woman sustains severe perineal trauma (Study II), in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 midwives. A phenomenological reflective lifeworld design was used. Study III is an experimental intervention study using a cohort design to reduce second-degree tears, in which 597 primiparous women participated. A multifactorial intervention consisting of 1) spontaneous pushing, 2) flexible sacrum positions, and 3) a two-step head-to-body birth was compared to standard care. Study IV explores the relationship between directed practices used during the second stage of labour and perineal trauma, using data from 704 primiparous women participating in the intervention study. For the quantitative studies (I, III, IV) bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for risk factors were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The majority (65. 2 %) of women in Study I gave birth in flexible sacrum positions and these positions were not associated with severe perineal trauma. The experience of being a midwife when the woman sustains severe perineal trauma (Study II) was expressed as being caught between an accepted truth and a more complex belief. The accepted truth is that a skilled midwife can prevent severe perineal trauma while the more complex belief suggests that these injuries cannot always be avoided. Balancing between the two created a deadlock for the midwives which was difficult to resolve. The results from Study III showed that fewer women in the intervention group sustained a second-degree tear. The intervention remained protective even after adjusting for potential confounders and known risk factors (adj. OR 0. 53; CI 95 % 0. 33 – 0. 84). The most common practices used in Study IV were directed pushing (57. 1 %) and digital stretching of the vagina (29. 8 %). None of the practices used were associated with perineal trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible sacrum positions were not associated with severe perineal trauma in the home birth setting. A multifactorial woman-centered intervention reduced second-degree tears in primiparous women and was possible to implement without having negative side effects for women and their babies. Moreover, the directed practices midwives use during the second stage of labour were not associated with perineal trauma. Midwives experience various conflicting emotions when the woman suffers severe perineal trauma...|$|R
40|$|A man aged 40 years {{began to}} notice in 1945 {{difficulty}} in walking, due to stiffness of the right knee, with slight pain, which disappeared after several days. This recurred in 1947 and a lesion of the external meniscus was diagnosed. The knee was immobilized in plaster for a month, with some relief. In 1949 the pain recurred, now in both knees and the neck, and lasted a week, recurring occasionally after this. By June, 1951, he showed transient signs of arthritis in the elbow, ankles, left knee, interphalangeal joint of the right thumb, cervical spine, shoulders and left temporo-mandibular joint. There was a diastolic apical murmur, mild fever, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 60 mm. /hr. The electrocardiogram and x rays of cervical spine, <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint,</b> and hands were normal, but there wa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hodgkin's disease (HD) most {{commonly}} presents with progressive painless enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes, especially around the cervical region. A few children have systemic symptoms and weight loss. At {{the time of}} diagnosis, osseous involvement is uncommon Case presentation A case is described of Primary Multifocal Osseous Hodgkin's Lymphoma in a seven-year-old boy. He presented with a painful swelling in the sternum, and further investigations revealed deposits in his L 1 vertebra, the left <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> and the right acetabulum. Conclusion The clinical, radiological and histological features of this disease can mimic other medical conditions, including Tuberculosis, making the diagnosis difficult and often leading to delays in treatment. This is a very rare condition and we believe {{this to be the}} youngest reported case in the literature. </p...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a series of}} four cases of {{children between the ages}} 5 and 14  years with bone or joint infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnosed between June 2006 and March 2008 in the Blackburn area of England. All of the cases were of South Asian descent. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of M. tuberculosis on the culture of bone, synovium or joint fluid, or by the presence of the typical histology of tuberculosis (TB). The sites of tuberculous disease were the hip joint, the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint</b> and the talus. A recent paper by Sandher et al. (J Bone Joint Surg Br 89 : 1379 – 1381, 2007) illustrated only two cases of childhood bone and joint TB in the same geographical area in the preceding 17  years...|$|E
30|$|There are no unifying {{international}} {{recommendations for}} imaging in JIA {{and both the}} choice of imaging modality and when and whom to refer for radiological investigations vary between centres. One of the major challenges when interpreting imaging studies is to distinguish between normal findings and pathology {{in the early stages}} of the disease, particularly on MRI. Moreover, the lack of standardised scoring systems for all modalities makes the objective evaluation of the degree of inflammation and destruction challenging. Plain radiographs of the affected joint are often not helpful to establish the diagnosis but are advised as a baseline study for longitudinal follow-up and to help narrow the list of differentials or suggest alternative diagnoses, for example an underlying bone tumour or a fracture. Ultrasound and MRI form the basis of more advanced imaging assessment in paediatric arthritis, while cone-beam computed tomography play a role in imaging of the TMJs and conventional CT in imaging of the <b>sacro-iliac</b> and facet <b>joint</b> of the cervical spine [7].|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} based on the {{analysis}} of the results of surgery on 34 patients with vertically unstable injuries of the pelvis at the age 16 - 61 operated on the period 2006 - 2010. Two following major methods of operative treatment were used: external fixation and combination of external and internal fixation. According to characteristics of posterior part of pelvis injuries patient were distributed as following: 19 patients with rupture of <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint,</b> 15 patients with fracture of sacrum. In 18 patients injuries were associated with neuropathy of plexus sacralis. Follow-up long term results were estimated by Majeed scale. In the group of patients with vertically unstable injuries excellent results were achieved in 15 (45 %) cases, good - in 10 (30 %), satisfactory - in 9 (25 %) patients...|$|E
40|$|NoThe {{auricular}} {{surface is}} located on the os coxae (pelvis) and forms part of the <b>sacro-iliac</b> <b>joint.</b> Changes in appearance of the auricular surface have been used to estimate adult age-at-death. Two main methods are used in bioarcheology: the Lovejoy method and the Buckberry-Chamberlain (revised auricular surface) method. As with many age estimation methods, neither auricular surface method reaches the gold standard of being both accurate and precise, however the age-related changes of the auricular surface do extend into the later decades of life.
