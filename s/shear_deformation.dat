5|$|Two {{regions of}} smooth plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution. Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by <b>shear</b> <b>deformation.</b> The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed {{a number of small}} impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.|$|E

25|$|The tower {{consists}} of four columns. Each roughly pentagonal column {{consists of}} four tapering and/or straight sections, joined end-to-end by external plates and internal stringer finger joints secured with fasteners. The columns are also joined horizontally by sacrificial box structures. These box joins are intended to absorb earthquake-induced motion by elastic and plastic <b>shear</b> <b>deformation</b> as the tower sways. Under a severe earthquake, this deformation absorbs energy that could otherwise lead to destructive tower motion, thus protecting the primary structure of the span. It is expected that this design will allow the immediate use of the bridge for emergency vehicles, with the joins being replaced as needed to restore the bridge to its original condition. Uniquely, the tower has no direct connection to the roadbeds, with enough space to allow swaying under severe earthquakes without collision.|$|E

40|$|It {{is already}} {{well known that}} the shear lag phenomenon, {{generated}} by <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> in the flanges of box girders, {{can result in a}} very non-uniform distribution, across the flange width, of longitudinal normal stresses, and consequently can then influence girder deflections. The shear lag effects become even more pronounced in cases where flange width increases in relation to girder span. However, in box girders, where the cross-sectional area of webs usually represents a fraction of the total cross sectional area, also <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> of webs can significantly affect the magnitudes of girder deflections.

40|$|International audienceDeep box-type beams, {{consisting}} of framing members and sheathings, {{are sensitive to}} <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> and hence appropriate refined theories or complicated magnification factors are needed {{to be used to}} obtain accurate results. For sheathings or webs between the framing members that are weak in <b>shear,</b> additional <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> occur corresponding to the relative axial displacement between the framing members. These sandwich -type or partial interaction-type of in-plane shear behaviour between the framing members, needs to be taken into account, especially when the web shear stiffness is very low. The composite box-type beam treated here is composed of three framing members with sheathings on both sides. To incorporate effects of the sheathings <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> between the framing members on the deflection, the sheathings, here called web interlayers, are modelled as shear media with equivalent slip moduli corresponding to a partially interacting composite beam model. Governing equilibrium equations of the model are obtained using the minimum total potential energy principle and solved explicitly. The obtained results are compared with those based on different conventional beam theories and 3 -D finite element (FE) simulations. It is shown that the model is capable of predicting accurately the deflection {{for a wide range of}} geometry and property parameters. It is demonstrated that the deflection of such deep box-type beams can be expressed as the summation of three different effects, namely bending <b>deformations,</b> conventional <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> in the framing members and sheathings, and additional in-plane <b>shear</b> <b>deformations</b> or <b>shear</b> slips of the weak web causing relative axial displacements between the framing members...|$|R
