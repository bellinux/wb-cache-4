The first chapter reviews the applications of nickel electrodes; the structures of nickel, nickel hydroxides, and nickel hydrides; and techniques for measuring the electrochemically active surface area (AECSA) of nickel. In the second chapter, electrochemically precipitated nickel hydroxide materials are fully characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). This work unifies and simplifies the large body of literature on the topic by considering two fundamental phases, α- and β-Ni(OH) 2, and various types and extents of structural disorder.

The {{aim of this study}} was to morphologically investigate the age-related changes in the capillary architecture of the tibial nerve in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>aging</b> and with aerobic exercise intervention in rats. [Subjects] Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 15) were used in the present study. [Methods] The rats were divided into control (Cont, n= 5), elderly (Elder, n= 5), and elderly with aerobic exercise (Elder+Ex, n= 5) groups. Aerobic training of low inten-sity was performed for 10 weeks using a treadmill starting at 96 weeks of age by the Elder+Ex group. The capillary diameter, cross-sectional area and number of microvascular ramifications in the tibial nerve were compared among the Cont (20 -week-old), Elder (106 -week-old) and Elder+Ex groups using three-dimensional images gained from confocal laser scanning microscopy. [Results] The capillary diameter, cross-sectional area and number of micro-vascular ramifications in the Elder group were significantly smaller than those observed in the Cont and Elder+Ex groups. [Conclusion] These findings suggest that the capillaries in the peripheral nerve degrade with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>aging</b> and that aerobic exercise of low intensity promotes angiogenesis, and protects the capillary from oxidative stress...|$|R

Surface mechanical properties are crucial for Y-TZP {{especially when it comes to}} osseointegration or contact loading, since it may undergo a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>aging</b> phenomenon when exposed to humid environment, creating a thin degraded layer that affects surface integrity. In this work, polished samples of Y-TZP have been artificially aged, and micropillars with diameters in the range 3. 3 - 0. 3 mu m have been milled by FIB inside the degraded layer and in the reference non-aged surface. Reproducible stress strain curves were obtained by testing the micropillars in compression, demonstrating that this technique is suitable for assessing the degraded surface properties. Mechanical and failure behavior are significantly different for the degraded micropillars due to the presence of microcracks, while important differences are observed when reducing the micropillar diameter.

When ovulated oocytes were cultured continuously in vitro without fertilization stimulation, they underwent several phenotypic changes, including non-activation, activation, fragmentation, and lysis. To investigate {{the effects of}} DMSO on these changes, I cultured ovulated oocytes with various concentrations of DMSO and evaluated the phenotypic changes for up to 3  days. After 3  days of culture, the frequency of oocyte fragmentation was significantly lower in oocytes treated with 2 and 4 % DMSO (7 and 5 %, respectively) than in control oocytes (80 %). All control oocytes were activated or fragmented after 3  days of culture in vitro.

The kinetics of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) generation and gelatinase release {{of blood and}} milk neutrophils, with or without stimulation of phorbol 12 -myristate, 13 -acetate ester (PMA), were used to characterize their responses to inflammatory stimuli. Neutrophils isolated from goat milk were highly segmented and contained multi-lobed nuclei. Ultrastructurally, milk neutrophils were more ruffled on the surface compared to blood neutrophils. Approximately 30 % of milk neutrophils were undergoing cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis, in contrast to 8 % of blood neutrophils. The ROI production of activated milk neutrophils peaked earlier than blood neutrophils, but the duration and the intensity were much less. Neutrophils from both sources augmented the release of gelatinase in response to PMA (1 ng/mL). However, the amount of gelatinase released from milk neutrophils was lower (P < 0. 05) than that of blood neutrophils. In summary, more neutrophils become apoptotic and necrotic in the mammary gland, presumably due to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>aging,</b> the process of diapedesis, and the interaction with milk components.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (Cnr 2) in regulating susceptibility to osteoarthritis in mice. MethodsWe analysed the severity of knee osteoarthritis as assessed by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system in mice with targeted deletion of Cnr 2 (Cnr 2 −/−) and wild type (WT) littermates. Studies were conducted in mice subjected to surgical destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) and in those with spontaneous age-related osteoarthritis (OA). ResultsOsteoarthritis was more severe following DMM in the medial compartment of the knee in Cnr 2 −/− compared with WT mice (mean ± sem score =  4. 9  ±  0. 5 vs 3. 6  ±  0. 3; P =  0. 017). Treatment of WT mice with the CB 2 -selective agonist HU 308 following DMM reduced the severity of OA in the whole joint (HU 308  =  8. 4  ±  0. 2 vs vehicle =  10. 4  ±  0. 6; P =  0. 007). <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>age</b> related osteoarthritis was also more severe in the medial compartment of the knee in 12 -month old Cnr 2 −/− mice compared with WT (5. 6  ±  0. 5 vs 3. 5  ±  0. 3, P =  0. 008).

However, the frequency, phenotypic impact, and mechanisms underlying <b>spontaneous</b> mutagenesis during <b>aging</b> are unclear. Here, we report two mechanisms of genome instability in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that cause phenotypic alterations in the aging intestine. First, we found frequent loss of heterozygosity arising from mitotic homologous recombination in ISCs that results in genetic mosaicism. Second, somatic deletion of DNA sequences and large structural rearrangements, resembling those described in cancers and congenital diseases, frequently result in gene inactivation. Such modifications induced somatic inactivation of the X-linked tumor suppressor Notch in ISCs, leading to spontaneous neoplasias in wild-type males. Together, our findings reveal frequent genomic modification in adult stem cells and show that somatic genetic mosaicism has important functional consequences on aging tissues...|$|R

Ovarian aging is the root cause of menopausal symptoms including skin aging, hot flashes, osteoporosis, mood changes, night sweat, and insomnia. Menopausal symptoms are conventionally treated with hormone replacement therapy which may induce side effects, such as {{the risk of breast cancer}} and stroke. However, the mechanism of ovarian aging has not been fully understood. Result from our proteomics study indicated that iron overload is possibly correlated to ovarian aging. But few studies have been performed to investigate the effects of iron overload on ovarian aging. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of iron overload on the process of ovarian aging and unveil it’s the mechanism. METHODS: Naturally aging female SD-rats at different ages including 3, 9, 17 and 22 months old (n= 3 - 4) were used as an animal model of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>aging.</b> The experiments had been approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR Ref. 3203 - 14) of the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. ~ 10 mg ovarian tissue was homogenized thoroughly in 150 μl ice-cooled PBS (pH= 7. 4). The tissue homogenates were centrifuged (10, 000 g) at 4 ℃ for 20 min. Then the supernatants were retained and used for determination of protein content, iron level and nitrate/nitrite level. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-rad, USA) at 595 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-rad, USA). Ovarian iron level was determined with QuantiChromTM Iron Assay Kit (DIFE- 250, BioAssay Systems, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For nitrate/nitrite detection, the tissues homogenates were ultrafiltered with Nanosep 10 K Omega Centrifugal Devices (P/N OD 010 C 33, Pall the Corporation, USA) at 14, 000 g for 20 min at 4 ℃, then nitrate/nitrite level was quantified with Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit (78001, Cayman Chemical, USA) following the manufacturer’s manual. The levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD and iron metabolism related proteins including transferrin, ferritin heavy/light chain and transferrin receptor were determined with Western blotting analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ovarian iron levels were significantly higher in the 17 and 22 months old SD rats than those in the 3 and 9 months old one. Similarly, the nitrate/nitrite (final products of NO) level increased with aging, which possibly caused an oxidative stress, and thereby tissue degeneration. However, the level of the antioxidant enzyme SOD decreased with aging, though no significant difference was detected. The levels of proteins associated with iron metabolism including transferrin, ferritin heavy/light chain and transferrin receptor demonstrated a significant increase with aging. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the aberrant up-regulation of transferrin and ferritin induced an iron-overload via transferin receptor 1, thereby oxidative stress, thus inducing ovarian aging. It is worthwhile to conduct further studies on the mechanism of iron homeostasis and the development of a platform for screening of drugs to chelate the excess iron and thereby retarding ovarian aging...|$|R
40|$|A single {{intra-articular}} injection with bacterial collagenase in {{the right}} knee joints of 10 -week-old male C 57 bl 10 mice led to osteoarthritic lesions {{within a few weeks}} in these joints. The collagenase-induced osteoarthritis was characterized by severe degenerative cartilage lesions on the medial side of the femorotibial joint associated with patellar dislocation to the medial side of the joint, sclerosis of subchondral bone below the cartilage erosions, osteophyte formation, and consequent deformity of the knee joints. The osteoarthritic alterations in the collagenase model closely resembled the changes observed in <b>spontaneous</b> osteoarthritis in <b>aged</b> mice. The intra-articular injection with collagenase probably results in damage to collagen type I-containing joint structures, such as tendons, ligaments and menisci, leading to an instable knee joint that results in the osteoarthritic joint lesions observed in this model. The collagenase-induced osteoarthritis model offers the possibility of studying experimental osteoarthritis in large animal groups of inbred strains within a restricted time span at low costs...|$|R
40|$|Endothelial cells, under given circumstances, can {{initiate}} contraction (constriction) of the vascular {{smooth muscle}} cells that surround them. Such endothelium-dependent, acute increases in contractile tone can {{be due to}} the withdrawal of the production of nitric oxide, to the production of vasoconstrictor peptides (angiotensin II, endothelin- 1), to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals (superoxide anions) and/or the release of vasoconstrictor metabolites of arachidonic acid. The latter have been termed endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) as they can contribute to moment-to-moment changes in contractile activity of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells. To judge from animal experiments, EDCF-mediated responses are exacerbated by <b>aging,</b> <b>spontaneous</b> hypertension and diabetes. To judge from human studies, they contribute to the blunting of endothelium-dependent vasodilatations in aged subjects and essential hypertensive patients. Since EDCF causes vasoconstriction by activation of the TP-receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells, selective antagonists at these receptors prevent endothelium-dependent contractions, and curtail the endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and diabetes. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Early {{postnatal}} maternal separation (MS) {{can play}} an important role in the development of psychopathologies during ontogeny. In the present study, we investigated the effects of repeated MS (4 h per day from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21) on locomotor activity and anxiety behavior in open field, spatial learning and reversal learning in Morris water maze of male and female juvenile (PND 21), adolescent (PND 35) and early adult (PND 56) Wistar rats. The results indicated that MS increased locomotor activity of rats across all ages and reduced anxiety behavior of adolescent rats in open field test. MS also increased swim distance in spatial learning and decreased escape latency in reversal learning in adolescent and early adult rats. Additionally, for socially reared rats, there was increased <b>spontaneous</b> locomotion with <b>age,</b> decreased reversal learning ability with age. The present study provides novel insights into the consequences of MS and demonstrates unique age-dependent changes at the behavioral levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
