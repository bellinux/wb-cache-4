5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} way {{of holding}} the violin is with {{the left side of}} the jaw resting on the chinrest of the violin, and supported by the left shoulder, often assisted by a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> (or a sponge and an elastic band for younger players who struggle with shoulder rests). The jaw and the shoulder must hold the violin firmly enough to allow it to remain stable when the left hand goes from a high position (a high pitched note far up on the fingerboard) to a low one (nearer to the pegbox). (In the Indian posture the stability of the violin is guaranteed by its scroll resting on the side of the foot).|$|E
2500|$|The M14 rifle {{was first}} {{furnished}} with a walnut stock, then with birch and finally with a synthetic (fiberglass) stock, which was adopted {{for use in}} damp jungle environments in Vietnam, since the wood versions would often become warped and swollen with moisture. [...] The stock was also fitted with a hinged <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> for improved user comfort when firing from a prone position. [...] Original equipment walnut and birch stocks carry the Department of Defense acceptance stamp or cartouche (an arc of three stars above a spread-winged eagle). These stocks also carried a proof stamp, a P within a circle, applied after successful test-firing.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> is an {{accessory}} {{that can be}} found on violins and violas. It may be made of wood, aluminium, carbon fiber or plastic. Usually, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> attaches {{to the edge of the}} back of the violin with [...] "feet" [...] padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic. The goal of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> is to allow a more comfortable attitude while playing by adding height to the shoulder and preventing the instrument from slipping (Kreitman, p. 30). A <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> generally follows the curve of the shoulder; some shoulder rests are bendable, others are made of sponge-like material, and a few have an extension that hooks further over the shoulder for stability. It is a relatively recent invention, and though it is quite commonly used among modern violinists and violists, it is not universally used. Depending on body type and style of clothes, some musicians need no more than a thin sponge, a cloth or sometimes nothing at all under the instrument.|$|E

The gigantic statue was removed in the late 1940s and has been lost ever since.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> can {{dampen the}} instrument's tone by {{decreasing}} the vibrations {{of the back}} of the instrument. According to the renowned violinist and professor Leopold Auer, the use of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> could take away more than one-third of the violin's natural volume; although more recent scientific studies suggest it to be less. [...] The shoulder alone can also hinder the instrument's tone if it is pressing against the back of the instrument. Many great violinists, including Tibor Varga, Aaron Rosand, Arthur Grumiaux, Anne-Sophie Mutter, David Oistrakh, Jascha Heifetz, Joseph Szigeti, Yehudi Menuhin, Henryk Szeryng, Ivry Gitlis, Mischa Elman, Nigel Kennedy, Nathan Milstein, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Michael Rabin, Fritz Kreisler, Efrem Zimbalist, Isaac Stern, and Eugène Ysaÿe have not used a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> {{is largely}} an {{invention}} of the middle-to-late 20th century. Prior to its invention, violinists and violists employed a number of stratagies to hold their instruments: the violin in particular was often depicted in the 16th and 17th centuries being held on or below the collarbone, though this does restrict shifting somewhat. Leopold Mozart is portrayed holding his violin quite low on his shoulder. Large violas were typically played {{with the aid of}} straps around the neck, and violins could be attached to the players' cravat. On the whole the <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> does little to enhance technique or sound, and is largely undesirable in the world of Historically Informed Performance.|$|E
50|$|Though orchestral violin playing uses varied techniques, the {{position}} is usually very regal in a sense; the performer {{is meant to}} sit up {{on the edge of}} their seat, with the violin sitting on a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest</b> and more often than not, right out of their periphery. Blues fiddle is almost exactly opposite. The playing position is left entirely up to the player, usually without the utilization of a <b>shoulder</b> <b>rest,</b> with the fiddle leaned substantially forward where the player can see the whole fingerboard. This {{is due to the fact}} that most blues fiddlers improvise their music. The bow is typically played closer to the fingerboard, depending upon the style of the piece and the individual player. The actual bow is played closer to the frog, which is the bottom of the bow.|$|E

50|$|Early violins and viols were {{typically}} held against the left chest, below the shoulder. By the 18th century, the typical position {{was a little}} higher, {{on top of the}} shoulder, with the chin occasionally making contact with the violin. Chin-rests and shoulder-rests are not used - the chin rest which is universally used on a modern violin was not invented until the early 19th century, though Abbe Fils used some kind of device for a similar purpose. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>rests</b> were absent, being a 20th-century invention.|$|R
