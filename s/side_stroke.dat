5|$|The {{inscription}} {{created a}} sensation as it mentions four distant countries {{that were the}} targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same patina as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal r-rune with an open <b>side</b> <b>stroke,</b> something which is usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented {{that there could be}} no expert on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was grikir.|$|E
60|$|Gerald {{suddenly}} turned, and {{was swimming}} away swiftly, with a <b>side</b> <b>stroke.</b> He was alone now, alone and immune {{in the middle}} of the waters, which he had all to himself. He exulted in his isolation in the new element, unquestioned and unconditioned. He was happy, thrusting with his legs and all his body, without bond or connection anywhere, just himself in the watery world.|$|E
60|$|We went by some swimmers, whose white shadowy bodies trembled {{near the}} side of the steamer under water. One man with a round, fair head lifted his face and one arm from the water and shouted a {{greeting}} to us, {{as if he were a}} Niebelung, saluting with bright arm lifted from the water, his face laughing, the fair moustache hanging over his mouth. Then his white body swirled in the water, and he was gone, swimming with the <b>side</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E

60|$|On this {{occasion}} {{the tide was}} almost full, {{the water in the}} cove was pleasantly warm and bright sunlight streamed down upon it, showing the white shingle a fathom beneath the surface. Now and then Frank went down toward it, for he had learned to swim under water and look about him while he did so, but by and by he headed for the entrance to the cove with the overhand <b>side</b> <b>stroke</b> which Harry had taught him. Swinging his left arm forward over his head, his face dipped under and then rose {{in the midst of a}} ripple as his hollowed palm swept backward under his crooked elbow to his thigh, while his legs swung across each other like a pair of scissors. The brine gleamed and sparkled as it slipped past him, and when he reached the entrance to the cove he slid up and down the smooth, green undulations with a pleasant lift and fall. It was so exhilarating that he went farther than he had intended, and he was feeling a little breathless when at last he turned back, but when he reached the spot where he had undressed trouble awaited him.|$|E
60|$|Give my best love to M. Milsand, {{beside the}} photographs, and {{thank him for}} not being {{offended}} in his 'patriotism' by my Congress poems. If he approved of the preface as he says, I can't see how he can have written anything about 'intervention' which I would not accept. Nothing could have ended the intervention of Austria, except the intervention of France; {{and it was on}} that account that we feel the latter to be a great and chivalrous action. Italy is grateful. And if France were in difficulty she might count on this delivered nation, as on herself. In spite of all the bad words hurled at me in every English newspaper and periodical nearly (and I assure you I have been put in the pillory among them) the poems are going into a second edition, Chapman says, and 'Aurora Leigh' into a fifth. Also Chapman junior, who has come out here to see after Lever, smoothes me down a little about Robert, and says that the sale is bettering itself, and that a new edition of the 'Poems' will soon be wanted. I just now see a pleasant notice of myself in 'Bentley's Magazine.' Abuse of the 'Congress Poems,' of course. Then a <b>side</b> <b>stroke</b> at 'Aurora Leigh,' which was original, of course, because it's my way to stand alone and attack people; but the principal merit of which otherwise was the suggestion of 'Lucille' (Lytton's new poem)--'Lucille,' says the critic, being superior in holiness and virtue {{and that sort of thing}} to 'Aurora'! Of course.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} large and lofty, with long rows of hams and salted meats {{dangling}} from the smoke-browned rafters, as is usual in Somersetshire farmhouses. A high black clock ticked in a corner, and a rude table, with plates and dishes laid out as for a meal, stood in the centre. Right {{in front of the}} door a great fire of wood faggots was blazing, and before this, to our unutterable horror, there hung a man head downwards, suspended by a rope which was knotted round his ankles, and which, passing over a hook in a beam, had been made fast to a ring in the floor. The struggles of this unhappy man had caused the rope to whirl round, so that he was spinning in front of the blaze like a joint of meat. Across the threshold lay a woman, the one whose cries had attracted us, but her rigid face and twisted body showed that our aid had come too late to save her from the fate which she had seen impending. Close by her two swarthy dragoons in the glaring red coats of the Royal army lay stretched across each other upon the floor, dark and scowling even in death. In the centre of the room two other dragoons were cutting and stabbing with their broad-swords at a thick, short, heavy-shouldered man, clad in coarse brown kersey stuff, who sprang about among the chairs and round the table with a long basket-hilted rapier in his hand, parrying or dodging their blows with wonderful adroitness, and every now and then putting in a thrust in return. Hard pressed as he was, his set resolute face, firm mouth, and bright well-opened eyes spoke of a bold spirit within, while the blood which dripped from the sleeve of one of his opponents proved that the contest was not so unequal as it might appear. Even as we gazed he sprang back to avoid a fierce rush of the furious soldiers, and by a quick sharp <b>side</b> <b>stroke</b> he severed the rope by which the victim was hung. The body fell with a heavy thud upon the brick floor, while the little swordsman danced off in a moment into another quarter of the room, still stopping or avoiding with the utmost ease and skill the shower of blows which rained upon him.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} were to compare paretic and non- paretic side’s bone mineral density (BMD) and to {{investigate}} whether demographic, clinical and some laboaratory findings were correlated with bone mineral loss or not in stroke patients. Patients and Methods: 46 unilateral stroke patients mean aged 61. 8 ± 5. 8 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were evaluated. Brunnstrom motor recovery scale, Turkish version of the FIM, Ashworth scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used for assessments. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry’s Biochemical’s data were collected. Statistics were analyzed using SPSS version 10. 0. Results: The BMDs of the paretic side were statistically significant lower than the non-paretic side at femoral neck BMD/T scores and distal radius T scores (p< 0. 05). BMDs and T scores of left <b>sided</b> <b>stroke</b> patients were statistically significant lower than non-paretic side at distal radius and femur, but BMD and T scores of right <b>sided</b> <b>stroke</b> patients were not statistically significant different than their non-paretic side BMD of women were statistically significant lower from than men’s BMD, (p< 0. 05) There were a correlation BDI and mobilization, r=- 0, 379 (p< 0. 05). Lower functional independence measurements score were found a relationship with osteoporosis. Conclussion: Low FIM scores can predict low BMD. Early walking and mobility must be targeted in stroke rehabilitation. Bigger sample sized, prospective studies must designed for observation of depression effect on osteoporosis in stroke.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{directional}} wavelet approach to remove images of interfering strokes {{coming from the}} back of a historical handwritten document due to seeping of ink during long period of storage. Our previous work required mapping of both sides of the document in order to identify the interfering strokes to be eliminated. Perfect mapping, however, is difficult due to document skews, differing resolutions, non-availability of the reverse side and warped pages during scanning. The new approach does not require double-sided mapping but instead uses a directional wavelet transform to distinguish the foreground and reverse <b>side</b> <b>strokes.</b> Experiments have shown that the directional wavelet operation effectively removes the interfering strokes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Document image {{enhancement}} {{is a well}} investigated field of research. Many approaches based on nonlinear anisotropic diffusion have been proved efficient for removing some com-mon artifacts such as bleed-through. However, the proposed methods are somewhat ineffective in removing bleed-through artifacts while strengthening original <b>side</b> <b>strokes.</b> The pur-pose of this work is to propose a novel nonlinear anisotropic diffusion approach which enhances foreground edges co-herence while smoothly removes background artifacts. The proposed method {{is based on a}} structure tensor using a new parameter which permits to better distinguish between fore-ground and artifacts characters. The diffusion scheme is expressed through a new set of equations using the tensor eigenvalues. This system allows to perform a second dis-crimination between foreground/background strokes. The performance of the proposed enhancement scheme is evalu-ated by means of objective measures and perceptual judgment of the obtained results on real images.

40|$|Use of {{electrical}} stimulation early in stroke rehabilitation may benefit recovery of function. This case report describes the clinical outcomes following electrical stimulation for the supraspinatus of a 25 -year-old patient {{four weeks after}} a right <b>sided</b> <b>stroke.</b> In this patient, use {{of electrical}} stimulation {{for a total of}} four hours in 4. 5 weeks, appeared to have a number of benefits: subluxation was reduced and patient attention to the arm was increased. There was also a notable improvement in functional use of the arm when task-specific upper limb training was incorporated. Whilst not conclusive, the results of this case study reinforce the value of electrical stimulation in the early management of the upper limb in a stroke patient who clearly demonstrated inattention to his upper limb. The results also highlight the need for well controlled studies to investigate the benefits of electrical stimulation and to establish the optimal timing and parameters for this intervention. Therapists can then more effectively optimise effective upper limb rehabilitation following stroke...|$|R

50|$|The combat <b>side</b> <b>stroke</b> is a {{relaxing}} and very efficient swim stroke {{that is an}} updated version of the traditional sidestroke. The CSS is a mix of sidestroke, front crawl, and breaststroke. The combat <b>side</b> <b>stroke</b> allows the swimmer to swim more efficiently and reduce the body's profile in the water in order to be less likely to be seen during combat operations if surface swimming is required. The concept of CSS has been that it can be used with or without wearing swim fins (flippers), the only difference being that when wearing swim fins the swimmer's legs will always be kicking in the regular flutter kick motion without the scissor kick. This stroke is one of the strokes {{that can be used for}} prospective SEAL candidates in the SEAL physical screening test (PST), which includes a 500-yard swim in 12 minutes 30 seconds to determine if the candidate is suitable to go to the Basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL school.|$|E

5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off <b>side</b> <b>strokes</b> helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} {{to clean up}} a large collection of historical handwritten documents kept in the National Archives of Singapore.

Perfect matching, however, is difficult due to document skews, differing resolutions, inadvertently missing out reverse side and warped pages during image capture. A new approach is now proposed to do away with double side mapping by using a directional wavelet transform that is able to distinguish the foreground and reverse <b>side</b> <b>strokes</b> much better than the conventional wavelet transform.
