5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one <b>synapse</b> is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate <b>synapse</b> is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated <b>synapse</b> to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either <b>synapse),</b> both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a <b>synapse,</b> or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a <b>synapse</b> is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E
5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a <b>synapse,</b> it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorylation is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation {{to carry out the}} two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the <b>synapse</b> during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the <b>synapse,</b> future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.|$|E

40|$|The 'disector' {{method was}} used to {{estimate}} number and size of simple non-perforated and complex 'perforated' <b>synapses</b> and their 'perforations' in the hippocampal CA 3 area of 3, 12, 24 and 30 months old rats. A decrease with age from 3 to 24 months {{of age in the}} number of non-perforated <b>synapses</b> per neuron was found. Both non-perforated and perforated <b>synapses</b> increase in size with age. The perforations in the perforated <b>synapses</b> increase in size and number from 3 to 24 months. In all 4 age-groups, perforated <b>synapses</b> are larger and more complex (perforations) than non-perforated <b>synapses.</b> The increase in size (and complexity) of the <b>synapses</b> with age was considered as increased efficacy of the <b>synapses.</b> It was suggested that this enhanced efficacy of synaptic transmission may reflect a compensatory reaction of <b>synapses</b> proper in response to the observed loss of <b>synapses.</b> The latter, in itself, may lead to impairment of the synaptic circuitry...|$|R

40|$|Thalamic ventrobasal (VB) relay neurons receive {{information}} via {{two major}} types of glutamatergic <b>synapses,</b> that is, from the medial lemniscus (lemniscal <b>synapses)</b> and primary somatosensory cortex (corticothalamic <b>synapses).</b> These two <b>synapses</b> influence and coordinate firing responses of VB neurons, but their precise operational mechanisms {{are not yet}} well understood. In this study, we compared the composition of glutamate receptors and synaptic properties of corticothalamic and lemniscal <b>synapses.</b> We found that the relative contribution of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) to non-NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs was significantly greater in corticothalamic <b>synapses</b> than in lemniscal <b>synapses.</b> Furthermore, NMDA receptor 2 B-containing NMDA receptor- and kainate receptor-mediated currents were observed only in corticothalamic <b>synapses,</b> but not in lemniscal <b>synapses.</b> EPSCs in corticothalamic <b>synapses</b> displayed the postsynaptic summation in a frequency-dependent manner, in which the summation of the NMDA receptor-mediated component was largely involved. The summation of kainate receptor-mediated currents also partially contributed to the postsynaptic summation in corticothalamic <b>synapses.</b> In contrast, the contribution of NMDA receptor-mediated currents to the postsynaptic summation of lemniscal EPSCs was relatively minor. Furthermore, our {{results indicated that the}} prominent NMDA receptor-mediated component in corticothalamic <b>synapses</b> was the key determinant for the late-persistent firing of VB neurons in response to corticothalamic stimuli.

5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the <b>synapse,</b> thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled <b>synapse</b> firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological <b>synapse.</b> Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological <b>synapse</b> in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that biological <b>synapses</b> have {{a limited number of}} discrete weight states. Memory storage with such <b>synapses</b> behaves quite differently from <b>synapses</b> with unbounded, continuous weights, as old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories. Consequently, there has been substantial discussion about how this affects learning and storage capacity. In this paper, we calculate the storage capacity of discrete, bounded <b>synapses</b> in terms of Shannon information. We use this to optimize the learning rules and investigate how the maximum information capacity depends on the number of <b>synapses,</b> the number of synaptic states, and the coding sparseness. Below a certain critical number of <b>synapses</b> per neuron (comparable to numbers found in biology), we find that storage is similar to unbounded, continuous <b>synapses.</b> Hence, discrete <b>synapses</b> do not necessarily have lower storage capacity...|$|R
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, <b>synapse</b> specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has {{reached the end of}} one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the <b>synapse</b> to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective <b>synapse</b> strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{distribution}} of key SNARE proteins in glutamatergic and GABAergic <b>synapses</b> of the adult rat cerebellar cortex using light microscopy immunohistochemical techniques. Analysis was made of co-localizations of vGluT- 1 and vGluT- 2, vesicular transporters of glutamate and markers of glutamatergic <b>synapses,</b> or GAD, the GABA synthetic enzyme and marker of GABAergic <b>synapses,</b> with VAMP- 2, SNAP- 25 A/B and syntaxin- 1. Results The examined SNARE proteins were found to be diffusely expressed in glutamatergic <b>synapses,</b> whereas they were rarely observed in GABAergic <b>synapses.</b> However, among glutamatergic <b>synapses,</b> subpopulations which did not contain VAMP- 2, SNAP- 25 A/B and syntaxin- 1 were detected. They included virtually all the <b>synapses</b> established by terminals of climbing fibres (immunoreactive for vGluT- 2) and some <b>synapses</b> established by terminals of parallel and mossy fibres (immunoreactive for vGluT- 1, and for vGluT- 1 and 2, respectively). The only GABA <b>synapses</b> expressing the SNARE proteins studied were the <b>synapses</b> established by axon terminals of basket neurons. Conclusion The present study supplies a detailed morphological description of VAMP- 2, SNAP- 25 A/B and syntaxin- 1 in the different types of glutamatergic and GABAergic <b>synapses</b> of the rat cerebellar cortex. The examined SNARE proteins characterize most of glutamatergic <b>synapses</b> and only one type of GABAergic <b>synapses.</b> In the subpopulations of glutamatergic and GABAergic <b>synapses</b> lacking the SNARE protein isoforms examined, alternative mechanisms for regulating trafficking of synaptic vesicles may be hypothesized, possibly mediated by different isoforms or homologous proteins. </p...|$|R

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides {{are highly}} {{concentrated in the}} brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and {{the first two years of}} life, but which can also continue up to 5–10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain’s gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and <b>synapse</b> formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that <b>synapse</b> with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus.

If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a <b>synapse</b> that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
