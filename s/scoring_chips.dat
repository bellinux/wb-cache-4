40|$|Intermediate-stage {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC), defined {{according to the}} Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, is a heterogeneous condition with variable clinical benefits from transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This study aimed to develop a simple validated prognostic score based on the predictive factors for survival in patients with intermediate-stage HCC treated with TACE. Three-hundred and fifty patients with intermediate-stage HCC undergoing initial TACE at Chiba University Hospital (training cohort; n = 187) and two affiliated hospitals (validation cohort; n = 163) were included. Following variables were entered into univariate and multivariate Cox regression models to develop a points-based clinical scoring system: gender, age, etiology, pretreatment, Child-Pugh score, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, C-reactive protein, alfa-fetoprotein, size of the largest lesion, and number and location of lesions. The number of lesions and the Child-Pugh score were identified as independent prognostic factors in the training cohort. The development of a 0 - 7 -point prognostic score, named the Chiba HCC in intermediate-stage prognostic (<b>CHIP)</b> <b>score,</b> {{was based on the}} sum of three subscale scores (Child-Pugh score = 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively, number of lesions = 0, 2, or 3, respectively, HCV-RNA positivity = 0 or 1, respectively). The generated scores were then differentiated into five groups (0 - 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, and 6 - 7 points) by the median survival time (65. 2, 29. 2, 24. 3, 13. 1, and 8. 4 months, respectively; p < 0. 0001). These results were confirmed in the external validation cohort (p < 0. 0001). The <b>CHIP</b> <b>score</b> is easy-to-use and may assist in finding an appropriate treatment strategy for intermediate-stage HCC...|$|R
40|$|The cohesin protein complex {{contributes}} to transcriptional regulation in a CTCF-independent manner by colocalizing with master regulators at tissue-specific loci. The regulation of transcription involves the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) and cohesin's {{role in this}} context of combinatorial TF binding remains unexplored. To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, {{as well as a}} collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive correlation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC sites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also show that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy between TF motif <b>score</b> and <b>ChIP</b> signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses in wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad 21 -cohesin haploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large protein-DNA complexes. Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels.
