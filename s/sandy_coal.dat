2500|$|On March 31, 1908, the Bald Eagle Valley Railroad was at last {{merged into}} the PRR, {{including}} the Snow-Shoe and other branches. The PRR would construct {{a few more}} mine branches, extending the Sugar Camp Branch [...] in 1914 and 1915. The extension continued east out of Clarence, then climbed steeply north to Poorman Side, then descended along Contrary Run and (Big) Sandy Run to Cherry Run #4 Mine of the Big <b>Sandy</b> <b>Coal</b> Company near Shettleston. The Big Sandy Branch, built in 1915, left the Sugar Camp Branch along Big Sandy Run and climbed out of its valley and along that of an unnamed tributary, extending [...] to Lehigh Valley Coal Co. #25 Mine.|$|E
30|$|The Taiyuan {{formation}} (C _ 3 t), {{which has}} the average thickness of about 79.76 Â m, is the primary coal-bearing stratum; and it is composed of gray sandstone, dark gray <b>sandy</b> mudstone and <b>coal</b> seam. The contact relationship with the underlying stratum is a conformity.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Contaminated {{media at}} Superfund sites {{typically}} consist of complex mixtures of organic and inorganic chemicals which {{are difficult to}} characterize, both analytically and toxicologically. The current EPA approach to risk assessment uses solvent extraction to remove chemicals from the soil {{as a basis for}} estimating risk to the human population. However, contaminants that can be recovered with a solvent extract may not represent the mixture of chemicals that are available for human exposure. A procedure using an aqueous extraction was investigated to provide a more realistic estimate of what chemicals are bioavailable. A study was conducted with two soil types: creosote-contaminated <b>sandy</b> soil and <b>coal</b> tar-contaminated clay soil spiked with benzo(a) pyrene [B(a) P], and trinitrotoluene (TNT). Samples were extracted with hexane:acetone and water titrated to pH 2 and pH 7. HPLC analysis demonstrated up to 35 % and 29 % recovery of contaminants using the aqueous extracts. The estimated cancer risk for the aqueous extract was one order of magnitude less than that for solvent extracts. Analysis using the Salmonella/microsome assay demonstrated that solvent extracts were genotoxic (133 revertants/mg) with metabolic activation while aqueous extracts of clay soil were not genotoxic. Sandy soil showed genotoxicity both with and without metabolic activation. These results suggest that solvent extraction techniques may overestimate the concentration of contaminants that are available for human exposure and, hence, the risk associated with the presence of the contaminants in soil...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{mineralogy}} and geochemistry of natural aquifer materials {{associated with a}} uranium (U) ore deposit at the Smith Ranch-Highlands Mine, Wyoming, USA. The ore occurs in a roll front deposit and is mined via in situ recovery (ISR). This method of mining is used to recover U from low-grade deposits while producing no tailings or waste rock. This method of mining can, however, contaminate adjacent aquifers with residual U and other elements. The objective of this project is to characterize core taken down-gradient of a mined unit to provide information on the capacity of down-gradient aquifer solids to attenuate U. Core samples were obtained from hydraulically down-gradient of the mine unit B at two locations. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses showed the presence of quartz, clays, feldspar, goethite and pyrite. Electron microprobe analysis, scanning electron microscopy and physical examination confirmed that the core is a heterogeneous mixture of grain sizes with different shapes and composed of clays, <b>sandy</b> materials and <b>coal</b> lenses. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping revealed the close association of U with Fe, V, Ca and coal lenses in the sediments. Uranium X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) showed the presence of both U(IV) and U(VI) in samples containing coal lenses. Carbon (C) XANES indicated the presence of several C functional groups representative of organic C; however, inorganic C was not identified in the C-K-edge XANES analysis. Iron and S XANES also confirmed the presence of reduced and oxidised Fe and S species. Clays, coal lenses, Fe- oxides and pyrite observed in the core samples may control U concentrations and mobility in groundwater. Geochemical modelling using PHREEQC software showed that primary and secondary U minerals may not control U mobility in these materials but the presence of carbonate, Fe oxides and clays may control U concentrations and mobility through sorption, reduction and precipitation processes. Information from this work {{can contribute to the}} quantification and estimation of the risk of downstream/down-gradient human exposure in fate-and-transport models...|$|R
