5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E

5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. <b>Some</b> <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school.

Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians.
