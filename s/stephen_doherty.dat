50|$|David Vine {{continued}} {{to be the main}} host for BBC TV coverage until 2000. For some years commentary was primarily by Ted Lowe, Clive Everton and Jack Karnehm although John Pulman, Vera Selby and others were used. In 1986 Jim Meadowcroft, John Spencer and John Virgo were used as summarisers. From 2001-2009 the BBC coverage has been hosted by Hazel Irvine or Ray Stubbs. Since 2010 Hazel Irvine has taken over with highlights presented by Rishi Persad. In February 2013, the BBC announced that Rishi Persad had been replaced by Jason Mohammad. Commentators included Willie Thorne, Dennis Taylor, John Virgo, John Parrott, Steve Davis, Ken <b>Doherty,</b> <b>Stephen</b> Hendry, Terry Griffiths and Neal Foulds: however, the presence of the commentary team varies with all four events covered by the BBC. All the listed commentators are involved during the World Championships, but only Willie Thorne and Terry Griffiths commentate during the Welsh Open, as other Welsh players are used instead (such as Terry and Darren Morgan) in replacement of the other usual commentary team. Neal Foulds only ever commentates for the World Championship and is mostly present on Eurosport coverage instead.|$|R
