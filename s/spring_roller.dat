Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification tolerance stack up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress riser. The detent assembly was removed and replaced with parts that were on the low-side of the tolerance stack up to eliminate the potential for high loads on the detent roller.

The most popular used ASCs are green manure, catch-crop, and living mulch. Efficiency of ASC crops under Latvia agro-ecological conditions for vegetable growing has not been investigated till now. Field trials where established in the Institute of Agricultural Resources and Economics during the season of 2015 / 2016 in Dižstende, Latvia with the aim to clarify the influence of ASC application on cabbage and onion crops yield and compare with traditional soil management systems: (i) green manure - in which ASC biomass of winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and winter rape (Brassica napus L.) was incorporated in the soil in the <b>spring,</b> (ii) <b>roller</b> crimper – in which ASC rye and rape was flattened by a roller-crimper before vegetable planting to create a mulch layer. These four ASC treatments were compared with: control 1 (no ASC, with soil tilled before crop planting) and control 2 (cattle manure ploughed into the soil before vegetable planting). There was not stated sharp difference in agrochemical composition between tested soil management variants. More expressed are differences between vegetables – cabbage has reduced nitrate content in the soil, whereas onion has not reduced nitrates content in the soil almost at all. From the one season results we can conclude that ASC crops have some positive influence on the maintenance of mineral nutrients balance in vegetable cropping systems, which has to be investigated for longer time period to find particular regularities...|$|R
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil <b>spring.</b> As the <b>rollers</b> are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and validation of interactive computer software that aids the design procedures for cam mechanism design, thereby facilitating the optimised design of the mechanism. Attention is focussed on the disc cam-translating roller follower mechanism with respect to which a series of analytical programs have been developed which addresses the design of the complete mechanism. This broad view of the mechanism design as opposed to concentrating on specific features thereof as has hitherto been the case, has been a major objective of the work reported in this thesis. Each analytical program shows the means adopted to satisfy the limiting conditions imposed by kinematic constraints and strength limitations encountered in cam design. The software enables the establishment of the design specification for the manufacture of the cam itself along with as much data on the other features of the mechanism (i. e. the <b>spring,</b> follower, and <b>roller</b> on follower) as project time could permit. A typical run of the software is shown, with the results presented in graphical as well as tabular format. This includes a graphical layout of the cam profile, the roller profile on the cam, and the roller and cutter paths around the cam profile. These results have been checked against independent work with good correlation...|$|R

40|$|Observations {{with radio}} telescopes address key {{problems}} in cosmology, astrobiology, heliophysics, and planetary science {{including the first}} light in the Universe (Cosmic Dawn), magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the lunar ionosphere. The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the driven roller. The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} driven <b>roller.</b> <b>Springs</b> preload the passive roller against the driven roller, and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to drive the antenna roller. This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user to automatically deploy the thin-film antenna at a rate proportional to the wheel speed as it drives the rover along its trajectory. The software allows Axel to deposit the film onto the ground to prevent or minimize relative motion between the film and the terrain to avoid the risk of scraping and antenna with the terrain...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for melt-free transformation of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single crystalline area, comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a way}} that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles on a cover or simultaneously cutting the fibers of bundles or all bundles vertically to fiber direction {{in such a way that}} short fibers are received. The fibers are transported over a transport line on which the fanning out takes place, where the fanning out takes place by electrostatic loading of the fibers by guiding the fiber bundles through column between two oppositively loaded electrodes, tightening and relaxing the fibers of the fiber bundles in oscillating manner, guiding the fibers through a compressed air pillow and recrystallizing the fibers in a hot gas stream. The process is continuously carried out and the fiber bundle tension is constantly held over the temperature line. The hot gas stream through which the fiber bundle is guided for recrystallization has a temperature of 0. 8 - 0. 85 T of melt related to the absolute melting temperature of the fiber. The hot gas stream is generated through the combustion of propane-oxygen-mixture containing inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The transport speed of the fiber bundle is 150 - 300 mm/h and/or the fiber bundle tension is 0. 2 - 0. 1 N. The tightening and relaxing of the fiber is carried out by a spiked roller. The fiber bundle tension is adjusted by redirection rods, tensor <b>roller,</b> <b>spring</b> sheet metal and/or transport roller pair in a value of 0. 15 - 0. 18 N.
