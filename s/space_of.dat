5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the <b>space</b> <b>of</b> physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert <b>space</b> <b>of</b> physical colors to the Euclidean <b>space</b> <b>of</b> human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E

5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle <b>space</b> <b>of</b> a graph {{is defined as}} the family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut <b>space</b> <b>of</b> a graph {{is defined as the}} family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle <b>space</b> <b>of</b> any planar graph and the cut <b>space</b> <b>of</b> its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

40|$|These {{lecture notes}} have been {{prepared}} for the Summer school on ”Moduli spaces and arcs in algebraic geometry”, Cologne, August 2007. The goal is to explain the relevance <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> arcs to birational geometry. In the first section we introduce the <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> arcs and their finite-dimensional approximations, the <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> jets. In the second section we see how to relate the <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> arcs of birational varieties. If f is a proper birational morphism between varieties Y and X, then the induced map f ∞ at the level <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> arcs is ”almost bijective”. The key result is the Birational Transformation Theorem, which shows that if X and Y are nonsingular, then the geometry of f ∞ is governed by the order of vanishing along the discrepancy divisor KY/X. In the third section we give some applications to invariants of K-equivalent varieties, and to {{the description of the}} log canonical threshold in terms of the codimensions of certain subsets in <b>spaces</b> <b>of</b> arcs. 1.
