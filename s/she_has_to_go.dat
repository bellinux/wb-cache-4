25|$|The World Champs are the Croatian's {{first major}} {{championship}} outdoors since Daegu 2011. On 27 August, {{she makes it}} to the finals and there, two days later, earned the silver medal behind Russia's Mariya Lasitskene (former Kuchina) who beats her on countbacks (Vlašić as one miss at 1,92 m). To her, the silver medal feels like gold after all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through in the recent years, and more specifically recalling she could not walk for days in early July.|$|E
25|$|As the {{two women}} sip coffee Kitty admits <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{hospital}} {{for a few days}} and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of {{what it would be like}} to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, Greenlee asks David {{for help}} about her leg numbness. She tells David {{that she saw}} someone else besides herself, him and Gale, in the {{hospital}} room. He admits that there is someone {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness. The only reason she went with David was so that she could see Leo. David injects her with something before leaving. When Greenlee wakes up, she sees Leo, laying on the hospital bed. On August 5, when Greenlee and Leo share a kiss, it turns out that Greenlee was dreaming; it is revealed that the person who was next to her was Zach. She is soon brought back from The Orpheus Project that David created.|$|E
60|$|And by {{that time}} she was so tired, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> luncheon.|$|R
5000|$|... "Church Home" [...] - Jaylyn {{takes the}} {{spotlight}} by being baptized in a church. Neffe wanted Frankie {{to support her}} grandson in that moment but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|R
5000|$|PS {{stated that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{hospital}} because Hot Wings hit her really hard during their wrestling performance.|$|R
500|$|Jack is {{involved}} in negotiations to acquire a German cable television network, but is struggling to juggle his job and his relationship with C.C., whose work has taken her to Washington DC. Unable {{to see each other}} when they want to, the couple decide to [...] "meet in the middle" [...] (in a betting parlor in Pennsylvania), but this arrangement proves unsuitable and they later decide to break up. Jack, in conversation with Liz, compares his relationship to Liz's previous relationship with Floyd, and Liz declares in song that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
500|$|Afterward Nikki vanishes {{with the}} cougar (whom she names [...] "Murray"). Loudon visits Mr. Bell to {{apologize}} for losing the animal, to find Nikki had delivered Murray and {{was waiting for him}} at Mr. Bell's home. He has created a Brazilian rainforest filled with animals on top of his roof. There Nikki and Loudon— who had become close with each other on their journey— express their love for each other, and Murray finds a partner. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki becomes broken-hearted, realizing that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. While on the bus, she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an embezzler and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki gate-crashes the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested and proclaims her love for Loudon. The film ends with Nikki and Loudon riding off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.|$|E
500|$|Loud Tour Live at the O2 {{begins with}} Rihanna {{and her team}} {{arriving}} with a ferryboat on a dock. Rihanna continues to walk through and explains how it's a very sad day because the Loud Tour just finished and she is so emotional about that right now. The singer starts crying and further explains {{that she and her}} team have done very good things this year and she believes those things wouldn't happen without the support of her fans. However, now <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Los Angeles where she doesn't have any friends, her [...] "very best" [...] friends travel with her around the world. Before getting into a van, Rihanna says that the tour was one of her best experiences of her life and talks how she will miss her fans the next upcoming year. Scenes are intercut with the start of the show at The O2 Arena. After the interlude Rihanna starts the show with the opening song [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Emerging from a purple ball, the singer performs the song while wearing a blue electric dress and is surrounded by four backup dancers. As [...] "Disturbia" [...] starts she removes the dress and reveals a colorful daisy duke. For the performance of [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] a car is present during the scene, to which Rihanna climbs to its top while performing. The set finishes with a rendition of [...] "Man Down".|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she will}} tell you so many things and I shall not hear them," [...] grumbled Mab, who felt herself in {{the first volume of}} a {{delightful}} romance and obliged to miss some chapters because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pupils.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{must have}} been horrible," [...] I assented. [...] "And then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away ultimately--I suppose. You didn't say anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave her}} no {{opportunity}} of self-satisfaction, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on unaided, {{which she did}} in a vanquished tone, verging on tears: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This girl hasn't {{been very}} good, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from the village, or else her family have. He {{wants me to}} find a place for her in London." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> but {{not till}} {{she has given}} her mother a kiss that is a {{challenge}} to the world. Then to the bewilderment of Steve two human frames are rocked with laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and {{he prepares}} his {{face for the}} {{reception}} of the invalid. PHOEBE comes in without her cap, the ringlets showing again. She wears a dressing jacket and is supported by MISS SUSAN.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{four blocks}} <b>to</b> the nearest drug-store {{that would be}} open {{at this time of}} night, and there {{telephone}} the doctor.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned toward}} the door ready <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{but in order to}} reach it from where <b>she</b> stood, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> past the foot of the bed.|$|R
60|$|Ethel lighted up, {{and enjoyed}} herself when talking was going on--her periods of ennui were when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> set about any home employment--when Aubrey's lessons {{did not go}} well--when she wanted {{to speak to her}} father, and could not catch him; and even when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Cocksmoor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Louise is most frightfully sorry," [...] she explained, [...] "but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down to Streatham {{to open a}} bazaar, and she can't {{possibly}} be {{back in time to}} dine before the theater. Can you guess what she dared to suggest?" ...|$|E
60|$|But Juno {{tells her}} to wipe her splashed boots. The child gropes {{for a piece}} of paper. Juno tells her to take her pocket handkerchief. Feebly the sick girl-child wipes her boots, then leans back. But no good. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the {{corridor}} and be sick again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think we}} shall {{do very well}} with her, Bertie; but well or ill <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> She will not let her husband go without her, which is natural enough, {{considering}} how long we shall be away, and that the journey will be a dangerous one. But really I think she will be an acquisition to the party. She is bright and pretty, as you no doubt noticed, and what is of more importance, she is a capital cook." ...|$|E
60|$|And so her {{afternoon}} was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three times <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down stairs on errands--that is, <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> six glimpses of him, in the aggregate, {{without seeming to}} look in his direction; {{and she tried to}} endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{home and}} confess to her master, who first scolded her and {{afterwards}} beat her. 'Now go,' he ended, 'and {{look after the}} pigs!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Minot {{wanted to}} laugh at Jack's indignation, but the bell rang, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and pull in the basket, much amused at the new game.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess he's got {{a better}} reason for stayin' tonight," [...] she said. [...] "It'll be a great card for that Maria when the Glenford people knows it, and they'll know it you may be sure, if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and walk the soles of her feet off tellin' them. One thing's mighty sure," [...] she continued. [...] "I'm not goin' to stay here {{with her in the}} house. He'll have to get {{somebody}} else to help him take toll. But I guess she'll want to do that herself. Nothin' would suit her better than to be sittin' all day in the tollhouse talkin' scandal to everybody that goes by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the {{way with}} men; they never do mean; they never use the little sense they have got. I don't expect that there's a man, woman, or child in Carnesford that wouldn't have known better. Here you had her down here for well nigh a month as bad as she could be; then she gets that terrible shock and goes off fainting all day; then <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into court, and as if that wasn't enough for her, you comes and blurts out before her that you found as Captain Mervyn murdered his cousin. I wouldn't call myself a man if I was you, Hiram Powlett. I had {{a better idea of}} you before." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [Rising.] I suppose, Windermere, {{you would}} like me to retire into a convent, or become a {{hospital}} nurse, or something of that kind, as people do in silly modern novels. That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don't do such things--not {{as long as we}} have any good looks left, at any rate. No--what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure. Repentance is quite out of date. And besides, if a woman really repents, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her. And nothing in the world would induce me to do that. No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives. My coming into them has been a mistake--I discovered that last night.|$|E
50|$|The {{visit to}} Charleston was for {{electronic}} equipment repair. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in at low tide, and lightning rods <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be lowered to pass under the Charleston bridge.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 she {{was badly}} burnt in a shack fire. In 2009 <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into hiding {{following}} threats and attacks against her {{and various other}} Abahlali baseMjondolo leaders.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "No; Agnes engaged {{her at the}} intelligence-office, {{and told}} her we should meet her here, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back for her purse, and left me to explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leslie's {{going to}} take him," [...] she announced. [...] "She jumped at the chance. She {{wants to make a}} little money to shingle the roof of her house this fall, and she didn't know how she was going to manage it. I expect Captain Jim'll be more than {{interested}} when he hears that a grandson of the Selwyns' is coming here. Leslie said to tell you she hankered after cherry pie, but she couldn't come to tea because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and hunt up her turkeys. They've strayed away. But she said, if there was a piece left, for you {{to put it in the}} pantry and she'd run over in the cat's light, when prowling's in order, to get it. You don't know, Anne, dearie, what good it did my heart to hear Leslie send you a message like that, laughing like she used to long ago.|$|E
60|$|Mistress Carmen's {{little room}} was {{opposite}} to Thatcher's, and once or twice, the doors being open, Thatcher had a glimpse across {{the passage of}} a black-haired and a sturdy, boyish little figure in a great blue apron, perched on a stool before an easel, and on the other hand, Carmen had often been conscious of the fumes of a tobacco pipe penetrating her cloistered seclusion, and had seen across the passage, vaguely enveloped in the same nicotine cloud, an American Olympian, in a rocking chair, with his feet on the mantel shelf. They had once or twice met on the staircase, on which occasion Thatcher had greeted her with a word or two of respectful yet half-humorous courtesy,--a courtesy which never really offends a true woman, although it often piques her self-aplomb by the slight assumption of superiority in the humorist. A woman is quick to recognize the fact that the great and more dangerous passions are always SERIOUS, and may be excused if in self-respect she is often induced to try if there be not somewhere under the skin of this laughing Mercutio the flesh and blood of a Romeo. Thatcher was by nature a defender and protector; weakness, and weakness alone, stirred the depths of his tenderness,--often, I fear, only through its half-humorous aspects,--and on this plane he was pleased to place women and children. I mention this fact {{for the benefit of the}} more youthful members of my species, and am satisfied that an unconditional surrender and the complete laying down at the feet of Beauty of all strong masculinity is a cheap Gallicism that is untranslatable to most women worthy the winning. For a woman MUST always look up to the man she truly loves,--even if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down on her knees to do it.|$|E
60|$|The islands {{belong to}} Portugal, and {{everything}} in Fayal has Portuguese characteristics about it. But more of that anon. A swarm of swarthy, noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship's sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of any country. We landed under {{the walls of a}} little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders, which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it. The group on the pier was a rusty one--men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars. They trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. It was very flattering to me {{to be part of the}} material for such a sensation. Here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on. This hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is unfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head is hidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. There is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote, as they call it--it is just a plain, ugly dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of the wind with one of them on; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before the wind or not at all. The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.|$|E
60|$|She {{crouched}} quite {{still on}} the hearth. He turned aside his face. After {{a moment or two}} he went out. She stirred her pot slowly and sadly. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> downstairs for something.|$|R
60|$|So {{all went}} well and happily for a time, {{but then she}} began to be very sad and sorrowful, for all day long <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about alone; and she did so wish <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home <b>to</b> her father and mother and {{brothers}} and sisters. Then the White Bear asked {{what it was that}} she wanted, and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about all alone, and that in her parents' house at home there were all her brothers and sisters, and it was because she could not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> them that she was so sorrowful.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not find}} the notes. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the {{managing}} editor, trembling, all her good little heart wild with pain. The editor's brows made a V at her report, and he grunted, [...] "Well--" ...|$|R
