40|$|In many biofuel and {{biochemical}} productions, Acetyl-CoA is {{an essential}} intermediate. In nature, routes that convert glycerol to Acetyl-CoA are not efficient in carbon conversion due to its release of CO 2 molecule. To eliminate this carbon loss step, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>glycerol</b> utilization pathway has been constructed inspired by the non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) pathway. The new pathway, which is termed glycerol condensation cycle (GCC), is different from NOG pathway due to its ATP-independent manner.

In addition, compared to pathways in nature, GCC pathway requires minimum number of enzymes and presents as the most thermodynamically favorable route for Acetyl-CoA production from glycerol. Enzyme amounts were adjusted using experiments from ensemble modeling, FSA glycerol inhibition, and trial and error. For demonstrating its practicality, in vitro theoretical conversion of glycerol into a valuable compound mevalonate was conducted, and final carbon yield of 108. 51 % ï¿½ 25. 20 % was achieved using purified enzymes...|$|E

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of the parent strain and salt-sensitive HL 25 / 8 mutant of Dunaliella tertiolecta {{have shown that the}} mutant is sensitive to salt concentrations in a range (0. 17 to 1. 0 M NaCl) in which the parent strain is able to grow. The mutant grew in 0. 17 M NaCl at about half the rate of the parent strain. The optimum growth temperature of the parent strain increased with salinity but did not do so in the mutant, and gassing of the culture with 5 % mixture of C 02 in air extended the duration of exponential growth rate of both strains. The mutant had lower carbonic anhydrase activity than the parent strain. It is suggested that this reduced carbonic anhydrase activity affects carbon transport and assimilation in a way that largely, if not wholly, diminishes the salt tolerance of the mutant. In both light and dark conditions, salt stress caused alkalization of the intracellular pH. The mutant had about half the photosynthetic activity (14 C-fixation and photosynthetic oxygen evolution) of the parent strain, which increased with salinity in the parent strain but gradually decreased in the mutant. The results also suggest that the mutant had a higher photorespiratory activity than the parent strain. The glycerol pool in Dunaliella has a turnover rate that is low in comparison to the Benson-Calvin cycle, therefore an osmoregulatory response to salt stress would require an accelerated glycerol synthesis. It is suggested that the synthesis and dissimilation of glycerol does not in any way constitute a metabolic cycle comparable to the established cycles such as the Krebs and Benson-Calvin cycles. Dunaliella tertiolecta has a limited capacity of salt-induced photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Photosynthetic C 02 -fixation is stimulated by mild to moderate salt stress (0. 17 to 0. 7 M NaCl) but inhibited at severe stresses. The results show that increasing magnitude of salt stress leads to a preferential incorporation of photosynthetically fixed carbon into glycerol. During a salt stress, both photosynthesis and starch breakdown contribute carbon to the glycerol synthesis. The relative contribution of these two processes depends on the magnitude of salt stress. During a dilution stress glycerol does not leak into the medium, but it is dissmilated biochemically. During a salt stress the <b>glycerol</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathway is stimulated and the glycerol dissimilation pathway is suppressed, conversely, during a dilution stress glycerol dissimilation pathway is stimulated and <b>glycerol</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathway is suppressed. The regulation of salt-induced conversion of starch to glycerol was investigated by examining the properties of some key enzymes of phosphorolysis, amylolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and glycerol synthesis as well as by following the changes in the concentrations of some metabolites. Phosphate concentrations which normally occur in vivo in the dark or after a salt stress, stimulate phosphorylase activity. Phospofructokinase is sensitive to DTT, whereas amylase activity requires thiol reagents for its maximal activity. Enzymes of both hydrolytic and phosphorolytic starch degradation are resistant to NaCl, whereas phosphofructokinase or enzymes involved in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway or the enzymes of <b>glycerol</b> <b>synthetic</b> pathway are not. Both in the light and dark, concentrations of Pi, PGA, and glycerol- 3 -P increased upon a salt stress. It is suggested that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is switched on during a salt stress in the light. Based on the enzymic activities of Dunaliella, other results of this thesis and the results of previous studies by other authors, possible pathways for the synthesis and dissimilation of glycerol during salt and dilution stress are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The 58, 000 -Mr form (58 K form) of the polyomavirus middle T antigen (mT) is a {{minor species}} {{distinguished}} by its phosphorylation in vivo on serine and by its efficient phosphorylation on tyrosine in immune complexes (B. S. Schaffhausen and T. L. Benjamin, J. Virol. 40 : 184 - 196, 1981). Here we report that the tumor promoter 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, rapidly stimulates phosphorylation of this mT species when added to cultures of wild-type polyomavirus-infected or polyomavirus-transformed 3 T 3 cells. Incubation with TPA leads to an accumulation of the 58 K mT species to levels 1. 5 - to 5 -fold higher than that in untreated cells within 15 min. TPA specifically stimulates phosphorylation of the 58 K mT species without affecting that of the 56 K species. Mapping by partial proteolysis shows that TPA-stimulated phosphorylation occurs {{at or near the}} site in 58 K mT that is normally phosphorylated in the absence of TPA. A <b>synthetic</b> diacyl <b>glycerol,</b> 1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetyl-glycerol, also specifically stimulates phosphorylation of 58 K mT in vivo, while an inactive phorbol analog does not. TPA fails to induce phosphorylation of a 58 K mT species encoded by certain nontransforming virus mutants with altered mT proteins that normally fail to undergo phosphorylation at the 58 K site. These results indicate that the 58 K form of mT is phosphorylated by or through the action of protein kinase C. TPA treatment of infected cells also leads to increased levels of 58 K mT as measured in the immune complex kinase reaction, in which mT becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine by pp 60 c-src. These results are discussed in terms of a possible role for protein kinase C in activating mT function(s), including the formation of stable complexes with pp 60 c-src...|$|R

40|$|Purification {{of crude}} {{glycerol}} by employing membrane separation {{as a mechanism}} {{involved in the process}} had been widely conducted due to its environmentally process and sustainability of energy. Realizing that hybrid membrane has better thermal and mechanical stability as well as better processing flexibility as compared to membrane from pure organic polymer and inorganic material, this research investigated on the use of hybrid membrane as a barrier layer in thin film composite (TFC) for permeation of crude glycerol. In this study, thin film composite membrane consists of polysulfone as base support and hybrid membrane as the barrier layer. In a hybrid membrane formulation, a polymer blend of polyvinyl alcohol with polyethylene glycol was chosen as organic polymer which was cross-linked with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). Glycerol was added as an organic additive to improve the plasticizing effect of hybrid membranes. There were three stages of work involved in the research. The first stage was investigating on base support where suitable concentration of polysulfone had been determined by water flux evaluation and investigation on suitable range of organic polymer, TEOS and glycerol concentrations. The evaluations were carried out through physical and chemical characterization and performance evaluation particularly on thin film composite through separation of crude glycerol solution. Besides good thermal and mechanical stabilities, and high surface hydrophilicity of hybrid membranes as compared to base support and membrane from pure polymer, the incorporation of glycerol had enhanced flexibility of membrane's matrix. These properties had overcome the rigidity of structure and brittleness of ordinary hybrid membranes. Major findings from this stage revealed that the suitable range of total polymer was between 5 to 7 wt. % and TEOS concentrations between 1 to 4 wt. % for formulation of hybrid membranes particularly in permeation process of crude glycerol. The second stage of research involves characterization of crude glycerol and permeation of <b>synthetic</b> crude <b>glycerol</b> which consists of glycerol, water, methanol and NaCl through the fabricated thin film composite. The main purpose was to evaluate the separation pattern of NaCl and glycerol through the TFC. Based on the evaluations, formulation of hybrid membranes with high percentage of polymer and tetraethylorthosilicate had led to high salt rejection but it suffered with low permeation of glycerol. Therefore the best formulations of hybrid membrane particularly in term of polymer and tetraethylorthosilicate concentrations and condition for feed solution that yields high NaCl rejection, high percentage permeation of glycerol and reasonable volume of flux had been determined by using design of experiment. Result showed that the regression equations generated from the experiment were accurate to predict all the responses and the best formulation was achieved at 5 wt. % total polymer with 4 wt. % TEOS, and feed condition with 75 % w/w water addition. The resulted responses were 36 % NaCl rejection, 85 % permeation of glycerol and 43 L/m². day of flux rate. Permeation of crude glycerol through the fabricated thin film composite, which exhibits a nanofiltration behaviour with a pore flow model as a transport mechanism, has been found as a potential pathway for crude glycerol purification which has some advantages over the existing process that employs membrane such as operation at low pressure and at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntersections of Nutrient Availability, Heterochromatic Silencing, Growth, Aging and DNA Damage Repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeByDavid Frankel McClearyDoctor of Philosophy in Molecular and Cell BiologyUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Jasper D. Rine, ChairCalorie {{restriction}} extends lifespan in organisms {{as diverse}} as yeast and mammals through incompletely understood mechanism(s). The role of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, known as Sirtuins, in this process, particularly in the yeast S. cerevisiae is controversial. In Chapter 1, I measured chronological lifespan of wild-type and sir 2 Δ strains over a higher glucose range than typically used for studying yeast calorie restriction. sir 2 Δ extended lifespan in high-glucose synthetic complete medium, and had little effect in low-glucose medium, revealing a partial role for Sir 2 in the calorie restriction response under these conditions. I measured growth, glucose consumption, and pH of these cultures and revealed a mild effect of sir 2 Δ that inhibited growth, lowered glucose consumption, and increased extracellular pH. Buffering of growth medium eliminated the sir 2 Δ-dependent extension of chronological lifespan, as did replacing stationary-phase media with water. Replacing medium with water at stationary phase actually led to a sir 2 Δ-dependent reduction in lifespan in high-glucose. Growth on high levels of other fermentable sugars still resulted in the sir 2 Δ-dependent extension of lifespan, whereas growth on high levels of glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source, did not allow for sir 2 Δ-dependent lifespan extension. When cells were grown in high- or low-glucose yeast peptone medium, large amounts of stationary-phase adaptive regrowth were observed, especially in high-glucose cultures. This regrowth complicated analysis of chronological aging. Interestingly, high-glucose yeast peptone cultures had dramatically decreased initial viability as compared to low-glucose yeast peptone or any other media tested. Also of interest, adaptively regrown cells from high-glucose yeast peptone cultures displayed enhanced growth, a trait that was heritable. In Chapter 2, I measured chronological lifespan of wild-type and sir 2 Δ strains in rich yeast peptone medium with a newly-developed genetic strategy. This approach revealed that sir 2 Δ shortened lifespan in low glucose while having little effect in high glucose, revealing a partial role for Sir 2 in calorie restriction-mediated lifespan extension in yeast peptone medium. In complete minimal media like synthetic complete, Sir 2 shortened lifespan as glucose levels increased, whereas in rich media, Sir 2 extended lifespan as glucose levels decreased. Both of these phenotypes are consistent with roll(s) for Sir 2 in the calorie restriction response. Using a second genetic strategy to measure the strength of gene silencing at HML, I determined increasing glucose stabilized Sir 2 -based silencing during growth on complete minimal media. Conversely, increasing glucose destabilized Sir-based silencing during growth on rich media, specifically during late cell divisions. In rich medium, silencing was far less stable in high glucose than in low glucose during stationary phase. Therefore, Sir 2 {{is involved in a}} response to nutrient cues including glucose that regulates chronological aging, possibly through Sir 2 -dependent modification of chromatin or deacetylation of a non-histone protein. In Chapter 3, I investigated the origins of a color change of the growth medium at stationary phase when sir 2 Δ cells were grown on 3 % <b>glycerol</b> <b>synthetic</b> complete medium. sir 2 Δ cultures eventually turned a yellow-brown color while wild-type cultures remained near-white throughout stationary phase. To determine whether the color change was caused by wild-type and sir 2 Δ cells having different levels of anabolism or catabolism of any small molecules, I performed gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy on filtered medium from wild-type and sir 2 Δ stationary-phase cultures. Quinoline and several chemical derivatives were highly enriched in filtered sir 2 Δ medium relative to wild-type. These molecules in solution are reported to have a yellow-brown color, consistent with my observations. GC-MS analysis of fresh 3 % <b>glycerol</b> <b>synthetic</b> complete medium revealed that these quinoline compounds were present before cultures were seeded. Thus, wild-type cultures catabolized these molecules at a higher rate than sir 2 Δ cultures, removing them from the extracellular environment. The quinoline compounds identified here are biosynthesized from tryptophan in some organisms, and are closely related to known UV-degradation products of tryptophan. Closely related compounds including kynurenine and quinolinic acid are also chemical intermediates of the yeast kynurenine pathway, which generates NAD+ from tryptophan. Since sirtuins including Sir 2 are the only enzymes that consume NAD+ in yeast, loss of Sir 2 could lead to less kynurenine pathway activity, limiting consumption of quinoline compounds that formed either through UV-degradation or catabolism of tryptophan. In Chapter 4, I exploited a microfluidics approach to investigate yeast replicative lifespan using the same calorie restriction paradigm used to investigate chronological lifespan in past chapters. I used a microfluidics chip, provided by Dr. Hao Li, which was designed to trap aging mother cells while washing away smaller, newborn daughter cells. By filming multiple positions on the chip {{over the course of a}} single experiment, I was able to count the number of offspring given off by dozens of cells at once. Surprisingly, wild-type cells had the same replicative lifespan in high- and low-glucose, defying the logic of calorie restriction and the results of past studies of the effects of calorie restriction on replicative lifespan. Since classical replicative lifespan experiments involve micromanipulating daughter cells away from a stationary mother cell growing on solid media, that mother cell is experiencing a changing environment as it metabolizes essential nutrients locally and generates waste. In the case of my microfluidics approach, mother cells are experiencing a static environment, since fresh media is constantly flowing through the chip. Therefore, a changing extracellular environment is likely necessary for calorie restriction to increase replicative lifespan. Additional experiments will be necessary to determine this with certainty. Finally, in Chapter 5, we investigate a report claiming Sir 2 protein was recruited to dicentric chromosomes under tension, and such chromosomes are reported to be especially vulnerable to breakage in sir 2 Δ mutants. We found that the loss of viability in such mutants was an indirect effect of the repression of non-homologous end joining in Sir- mutants, and that the apparent recruitment of Sir 2 protein to chromosomes under tension was likely due to methodological weakness in early chromatin immunoprecipitation studies...|$|R
