25|$|An {{increase}} in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could <b>support</b> <b>housing</b> growth at industrial and commercial {{areas in the}} Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils. To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% {{increase in}} capacity when Route 4 was extended to Wimbledon. To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in South Wimbledon or Colliers Wood and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon. This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed South London Metro at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon. The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur. New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), {{as well as an}} additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services. This plan may be in service by 2023.|$|E

Statistically significant increases in activity and minor challenging behaviour were also found when all active <b>support</b> <b>houses</b> were compared with all non-active <b>support</b> <b>houses.</b> In the non-active <b>support</b> <b>houses,</b> all measures decreased, {{with the exception of}} mean level of staff contact in one house.

Chapter one outlines options for education of persons with disabilities after 1948, explains <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> for persons with learning disability, its individual types, and the target group for the <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> social services. The final section of chapter one clarifies legislative support for the <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> social service. Chapter two describes the objective, methods, and selection of research participants. The subsequent subchapters discuss quality of life of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> clients and focus on opinions of persons with learning disability on this type of housing and mention views of some parents of children with learning disability concerning this service. The final part of the chapter summarizes the results of research conducted by the author.

40|$|<b>Supported</b> <b>housing</b> is {{a service}} model that couples {{provision}} of independent housing with provision of community-based supports {{for individuals with}} psychiatric disabilities at risk of homelessness. Despite its promise {{as an alternative to}} traditional sequential residential rehabilitation programs, <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> has not been evaluated to an extent that supports firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of specific program elements. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> and similarly labeled programs, to determine the degree of clarity in the <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> model and the degree of fidelity to that model within the empirical literature, and to determine whether lack of clarity or fidelity are barriers to widespread, systematic program implementation and evaluation. We encountered a number of limitations in the literature, including conflicting use of program labels, inconsistent definitions of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> and its elements, and use of inadequate measurement indices in assessing adherence to program elements. Our findings suggest that greater model clarity, better specification of model elements, and greater standardization in measurement of program dimensions would aid in <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> program implementation and evaluation.

40|$|<b>Supported</b> <b>housing</b> for {{individuals}} with severe mental illness strives to provide the services necessary to place and keep individuals in independent housing that is integrated into the community and in which the consumer has choice and control over his or her services and <b>supports.</b> <b>Supported</b> <b>housing</b> can be contrasted to an earlier model called the “linear residential approach” in which individuals are moved from the most restrictive settings (e. g., inpatient settings) {{through a series of}} more independent settings (e. g., group homes, supervised apartments) and then finally to independent housing. This approach has been criticized as punishing the client due to frequent moves, and as being less likely to result in independent <b>housing.</b> In the <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> model (Anthony & Blanch, 1988) consumers have choice and control over their living environment, their treatment, and supports (e. g., case management, mental health and substance abuse services). Supports are flexible and faded in and out depending on needs. Results of this systematic review of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> suggest that there are several well-controlled studies of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> and several studies conducted with less rigorous designs. Overall, our synthesis suggests that <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> can improve the living situation of individuals who are psychiatrically disabled, homeless and with substance abuse problems. Results show that <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> can help people stay in apartments or homes up to about 80 % of the time over an extended period. These results are contrary to concerns expressed by proponents of the linear residential model and housing models that espoused more restrictive environments. Results also show that housing subsidies or vouchers are helpful in getting and keeping individuals housed. Housing services appear to be cost effective and to reduce the costs of other social and clinical services. In order to be most effective, intensive case management services (rather than traditional case management) are needed and will generally lead to better housing outcomes. Having access to affordable housing and having a service system that is well-integrated is also important. Providing a person with <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> reduces the likelihood that they will be re-hospitalized, although <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> does not always lead to reduced psychiatric symptoms. <b>Supported</b> <b>housing</b> can improve clients’ quality of life and satisfaction with their living situation. Providing <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> options that are of decent quality is important in order to keep people housed and satisfied with their housing. In addition, rapid entry into housing, with the provision of choices is critical. Program and clinical supports may be able to mitigate the social isolation that has sometimes been associated with <b>supported</b> <b>housing.</b> National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, Grant # (H 133 A 050006...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the past}} two decades, consumers, {{providers}} and policy makers have recognized the role of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> intervention for persons diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) {{to be able to}} live independently in the community. Much of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> research to date, however, has been conducted in large urban centers rather than northern and rural communities. Northern conditional and contextual issues such as rural poverty, lack of accessible mental health services, small or non-existing housing markets, lack of a continuum of <b>support</b> or <b>housing</b> services, and in some communities, a poor quality of housing challenge the viability of effective <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> services. The current research proposal aims to describe and evaluate the processes and outcomes of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> programs for persons living with SMI in northern and rural communities from the perspective of clients, their families, and community providers. Methods This research will use a mixed method design guided by participatory action research. The study will be conducted over two years, in four stages. Stage I will involve setting up the research {{in each of the four}} northern sites. In Stage II a descriptive cross-sectional survey will be used to obtain information about the three client outcomes: housing history, quality of life and housing preference. In Stage III two participatory action strategies, focus groups and photo-voice, will be used to explore perceptions of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> services. In the last stage findings from the study will be re-presented to the participants, as well as other key community individuals in order to translate them into policy. Conclusion <b>Supported</b> <b>housing</b> intervention is a core feature of mental health care, and it requires evaluation. The lack of research in northern and rural SMI populations heightens the relevance of research findings for health service planning. The inclusion of multiple stakeholder groups, using a variety of data collection approaches, contributes to a comprehensive, systems-level examination of <b>supported</b> <b>housing</b> in smaller communities. It is anticipated that the study's findings will not only have utility across Ontario, but also Canada. </p...|$|R
