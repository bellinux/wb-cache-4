50|$|<b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> (Croatian: Socijalistička stranka Hrvatske or Socijalistički savez Hrvatske - Savez socijalista Hrvatske, SSH) is {{now defunct}} left-wing {{political}} party in Croatia.|$|E
50|$|The SSH {{should not}} be mistaken for <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> - Left Alternative (Croatian: Socijalistička partija Hrvatske), which had been formed by people around Stipe Šuvar, {{at the time a}} {{dissident}} of Socialist Labour Party of Croatia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Degen entered politics, {{becoming}} {{a leader of}} the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> As such, he made a minor upset in the Croatian presidential election, 1992, by finishing fifth with 108,979 or 4.07% of the vote.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> {{adopted the}} first name <b>of</b> the <b>party</b> on its {{formation}} 1997 {{but it is not}} an all-Yugoslav party (nor does it have ambitions to be). The Communist <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> formed in 2005 by dissidents from the <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> adheres to Titoism, but they have never started functioning.|$|R
50|$|The Left also {{announced}} a coalition with <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> {{one month before}} the elections.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after, a {{minority}} of members left to form <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> - Left Alternative, mostly due to personal disputes. The activist core, including the youth wing and the entire editorial board of Hrvatska ljevica (which worked beside the late Stipe Šuvar) is still {{a part of the}} SRP.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Communist Party of Croatia there was a Croatian-Slavonian Provincial Committee of the Socialist Workers Party of Yugoslavia (Communists) and there was a developed party structure of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> and Slavonia. Dalmatia had its own structures up to 1937.KPH, just like KPJ, was illegal and, therefore, remained marginalised, especially after the 1939 Cvetković-Maček Agreement and the creation of the banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> - Left Alternative (Socijalistička partija Hrvatske - lijeva alternativa) was {{a leftist}} party formed in 2004 when several members left the Socialist Labour Party of Croatia. In the local {{elections}} in 2005, {{the party had}} a joint lists with the Social Democratic Party of Croatia {{in the town of}} Glina and with the Independent Democratic Serb Party in Sisak-Moslavina County, where it gained one seat in the assembly.|$|E

50|$|Except {{the ruling}} Social Democratic Party, the {{remaining}} opposition left <b>parties</b> were the <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> <b>of</b> Stipe Šuvar and the Social Democratic Union which was notable only thanks to Vladimir Bebić. Both of them failed miserably in the 2000 and 2003 parliamentary elections.|$|R
5000|$|Stipe Šuvar {{would give}} an {{interview}} {{from time to}} time but he was mostly ignored by the mass media. His book which spoke about politics in the early Croatian state, [...] "The Croatian merry-go-round" [...] in 2003 was a hit and shortly after the 2nd edition came. He was always admired as an honest politician even by people who disagree with his politics. He resigned as president of the Socialist Labour Party and passed away shortly after in June 2004. After his death, part of the members left the party and founded a separate party called <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> - Left Alternative. It remained marginalised.|$|E
50|$|With {{the rise}} of {{nationalism}} and end of Communism in Yugoslavia in 1989-90, Mikelić {{found himself in a}} republic, Croatia, caught between two rival nationalisms - Croatian and Serbian. Mikelić opposed both, and, in August 1990 he {{and a number of other}} Serbs, Croats and others in the SKH formed the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> - Party of Yugoslav Orientation, to oppose the SDP under Ivica Račan and the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) led by Jovan Rašković. The party's secretary was a Croatian, Goran Babić, and the membership and leadership included a large number of Croats, and also Muslims, Hungarians and other nations and nationalities, though pro-Yugoslav Serbs were most numerous. The party supported the preservation of federal Yugoslavia and Croatia as an equal republic of that federation, with the Serbs as a constituent nation as they were until July 1990, opposing both demands for confederalisation and Croatian independence and autonomy for the Serbs or the redrawing of borders.|$|E
50|$|The 2nd {{elections}} {{took place}} on 2 August 1992. The president and parliament were both elected on the same day. For the presidential elections, the Social Democratic Party supported Silvije Degen, president of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia,</b> a minor left-wing party. Silvije Degen finished 5th with 4,1% {{of the popular vote}} while Franjo Tuđman won with a majority of 56.73% of the vote. Antun Vujić was also the candidate for president but finished last with only 0,7% of the vote. On the parliamentary elections, the Social Democratic Party won only 3 seats with 5.52% of the popular vote but managed to get 11 thanks to the Serb minority seats in parliament which were guaranteed by the constitution. The Social Democratic Union managed to win 1.2% which was a great result for such a party. The Social Democratic Union was led by the famous economist Branko Horvat and the votes were a result of support from the ethnic Serbs living in the government-controlled territory. The Social Democrats of Croatia won only 0,6% of the vote.|$|E

50|$|As a teenager, Markovina was a sympathizer {{and friend}} of Stipe Šuvar and his <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2014, he said on a TV talk show {{that he is not}} a member <b>of</b> any <b>party</b> but he {{believes}} that the far-left Workers' Front has a perspective and that he wishes them all the best.

50|$|In 1997, former {{minister}} of culture in SR <b>Croatia</b> and Vice-President <b>of</b> the Presidency of SFR Yugoslavia, Stipe Šuvar founded the <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> It was the first democratic <b>socialist</b> <b>party</b> in modern Croatia. Šuvar was a strong critic of the Tuđman regime and he spoke about the war crimes that the Croatian Army committed after liberating Kninska Krajina in 1995. While dining in a restaurant {{with his wife in}} Zagreb, Šuvar was brutally attacked and suffered heavy injuries because of his political views.|$|R
50|$|SDU {{had some}} success in the local {{elections}} held a few months later, but the biggest boost came to them with parliamentary status gained when Vladimir Bebić, a colourful member of Sabor from Rijeka, decided to join their ranks. Bebić, who enjoyed {{a great deal of}} popularity in the Croatian public, gradually became the party's leader. In the 1995 election he managed to increase SDU's vote margin, but with increased vote threshold (5%), SDU failed to enter Sabor. This, the appearance of more mainstream left-wing parties, and the establishment of a rejuvenated SDP as Croatia's main opposition party, led to SDU becoming more marginalised, struck with internal divisions and gradually phased out in late 1990s. After the <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> (SRP) was formed, many SDU members joined that organization.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 1990, he {{left the}} League <b>of</b> Communists <b>of</b> <b>Croatia</b> (SDP-SKH) just 2 days before the party {{convention}} on which they would be reformed to a social democratic party. He stated his reasons in a letter saying that SDP-SKH {{was no longer a}} left-wing or a revolutionary party but an ordinary civil party {{just like the rest of}} the political spectrum. After he had left the political scene, Šuvar returned to Zagreb University as a professor of sociology. In 1994 he founded the magazine Hrvatska ljevica (The Croatian Left) and in 1997, he returned to politics by creating the <b>Socialist</b> Labour <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Croatia.</b> Šuvar succeeded in bringing some respectable personalities around the party, but the party itself never got more than 1% of the votes in Croatian parliamentary elections. He was its chairman until 2004, when, shortly before his death, he resigned.|$|R
50|$|Stipe Šuvar (February 17, 1936 - June 29, 2004) was {{a leading}} Croatian and Yugoslav {{politician}} and sociologist.
