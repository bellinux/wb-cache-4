25|$|English {{secondary}} schools are mostly comprehensive, although the intake of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially {{in urban areas}} with several local schools. Nearly 90% of state-funded {{secondary schools}} are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects in which the school specialises, which can <b>select</b> <b>up</b> to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism (though relatively few of them have taken up this option). In a few areas children can enter a grammar school if they pass the eleven plus exam; {{there are also a}} number of isolated fully selective grammar schools and a few dozen partially selective schools. A significant minority of state-funded schools are faith schools, which are attached to religious groups, most often the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|Superelevation {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and maintenance practices, as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum cross slope of 6 to 8%. While steeper cross slope makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower cross slope increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed skidding is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves have the benefit of greater net safety when designers <b>select</b> <b>up</b> to 8% superelevation, instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E

500|$|The {{engine and}} playstyle for Skullgirls were {{intentionally}} modeled after , incorporating several similar game mechanics such as tag team-based combat, character assists, snapbacks, and delayed hyper combos. The game {{can be played}} using different ratios of characters (similarly to [...] ), with each player able to <b>select</b> <b>up</b> to three fighters on their team. The teams are then balanced {{based on the number}} of team members. A single character possesses more health and deals more damage, while larger teams gain the ability to perform character assists and recover health when tagged out. Players can also customize their character assist attacks.|$|E
500|$|The Vanuatu National Olympic Committee (NOC) {{selected}} two athletes via wildcards.

However, since Vanuatu had no athletes that met either standard for any event, they were allowed to select their best two athletes, one of each gender, to represent the nation at the Games. This was to make sure that every nation had a minimum of two representatives in the Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Athens games were Moses Kamut in the Men's 400 meters and Katura Marae in the Women's 100 meters.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{services}} that AT aggressively promotes is its Rollover Minutes service, which allows customers to keep unused minutes from month to month on a twelve-month rolling cycle on its popular nationwide plans. Beginning in July 2007, AT allows its AT Unity plan users to have Rollover, a service which was exclusive to the Nation plans. AT also launched video share in 2007, in which a mobile caller can stream live video from one phone to another over the 3G network with video share capable phones. This allows one mobile phone user to view video from another user's camera through the mobile phone in real time. AT also had A-list, similar to former competitor Alltel's program launched on April 20, 2006 branded [...] "My Circle." [...] AT rolled out the A-list program on September 20, 2009. Customers with individual Nation plans of $59.99 or higher could use A-List with Rollover to <b>select</b> <b>up</b> to five domestic phone numbers to call anytime—including landlines and wireless numbers on any network—without using any of the minutes in their plan. FamilyTalk customers with plans of $89.99 or more could <b>select</b> <b>up</b> to ten numbers which any person in the FamilyTalk plan can call {{as much as they}} want. Effective September 1, 2011, the A-List feature is no longer available to new consumer and IRU customers. Existing customers who had A-List on their account prior to September 1, 2011, are able to keep the feature as long as they stay on a qualifying rate plan. As of October 25, 2013 AT no longer offers Nation Plans or Family Talk Plans to its new customers. New customers are now required to have one of AT Mobile Share Value plans which include unlimited Talk, Text and a shareable bucket of data start at $45 for a smartphone. As of January 8, 2016 AT no longer offers 2 year contracts for subsidized smart phones to its consumer customers. Customers who currently have 2 year contracts are grandfathered, until they upgrade to a new device they will have to choose from AT's NEXT installment plans for smartphones. AT has also reintroduced unlimited data plans for its customers who also have either AT U-verse or AT's newly acquired DirecTV. Unlimited data plans may be speed throttled after 22 GB of data have been used. With the inclusion of these new plans AT has also introduced a free roaming in Mexico feature for its postpaid customers.|$|E
