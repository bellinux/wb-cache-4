25|$|Neuronal spiking can be {{classified}} by their activity patterns. The excitability of neurons can be subdivided in Class I and II. Class I neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength, whereas Class II neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band, which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength. Class II neurons are also more prone to display <b>sub-threshold</b> oscillations in membrane potential.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{generate}} action potentials {{resulting from}} {{changes in the}} electric membrane potential. Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for neural coding and information transfer in the brain. Spike trains can form all kinds of patterns, such as rhythmic spiking and bursting, and often display oscillatory activity. Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in <b>sub-threshold</b> fluctuations in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons.|$|E

5000|$|Connectivity noise: Noise {{that arises}} {{from the number of}} {{connections}} and non-uniformity that a neuron has with other neurons within a neuronal network. There is a stronger presence of <b>sub-threshold</b> noise when the interconnectivity is strengthened, or the number of connection to other neurons is increased. The opposite remains true, too. If the interconnectivity of the neurons is decreased so then is the level of <b>sub-threshold</b> noise.|$|E

50|$|Eating {{disorder}} {{not otherwise}} specified (EDNOS) is an eating disorder that {{does not meet the}} criteria for: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating.

50|$|One {{method of}} {{removing}} TCA from tainted wine is to soak polyethylene (a plastic used for {{applications such as}} milk containers and plastic food wrap) in the affected wine. The non-polar TCA molecule has a high affinity for the polyethylene molecule, thereby removing the taint from the wine. The surface area of polyethylene needed to reduce the taint to <b>sub-threshold</b> levels {{is based on the}} TCA level in the affected wine, temperature, and the alcohol level of the wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{skin was}} {{mechanically}} stimulated with a broadband pressure signal with varying amounts of broadband noise using the up-and-down motion of a cylindrical probe. The {{intensity of the}} pressure signal was tested without noise and then set at a near <b>sub-threshold</b> intensity that would evoke 10 action potentials over a 60-second stimulation time. Several trials were then conducted with noise of increasing amplitude variance. Extracellular recordings were made of the mechanoreceptor response from the extracted nerve.|$|E

50|$|Following his PhD, Markram {{went to the}} United States as a Fulbright Scholar at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), {{where he}} studied ion {{channels}} on synaptic vesicles. As a Minerva Fellow he {{then went to the}} Laboratory of Bert Sakmann at the Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg, Germany, where he discovered calcium transients in dendrites evoked by <b>sub-threshold</b> activity, and by single action potentials propagating back into dendrites. He also began studying the connectivity between neurons, describing in great detail how layer 5 pyramidal neurons are interconnected.|$|E
50|$|As the transmembrane {{potential}} rises, {{the value}} of m increases, thus increasing {{the probability that the}} activation gate will be open. And as the transmembrane potential drops, {{the value of}} h increases, along with the probability that the inactivation gate will be open. The rate of change for an h gate is much slower than that of an m gate, therefore if one precedes a <b>sub-threshold</b> voltage stimulation with a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse, the value of h may be temporarily increased, enabling the neuron to fire an action potential.|$|E

50|$|Intrinsic {{plasticity}} is {{the continuous}} modification of intrinsic electrical properties of a neuron by synaptic or neuronal activity. It can affect diverse processes as synaptic integration, <b>sub-threshold</b> signal propagation, spike generation, spike back-propagation, and meta-plasticity {{as it is}} mediated by changes in the expression level or biophysical properties of ion channels in the membrane. The function of intrinsic plasticity in behaving animals is uncertain but there is experimental evidence for several distinct roles: {{as part of the}} memory engram itself, as a regulator of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, and as a component of homeostatic regulation.|$|E
50|$|An {{adjustment}} disorder (AD)—sometimes called exogenous, reactive, or situational depression—occurs when {{an individual}} is unable to adjust to or cope with a particular stress or a major life event. Since people with this disorder normally have symptoms that depressed people do, such as general loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness and crying, this disorder is sometimes known as situational depression. Unlike major depression, the disorder is caused by an outside stressor and generally resolves once the individual is able {{to adapt to the}} situation. One hypothesis about AD is that it may represent a <b>sub-threshold</b> clinical syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Power {{dissipation}} within traditional {{metal oxide}} semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) generates a bottleneck when dealing with nano-electronics. Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) may become an alternative to traditional MOSFETs because {{they can have a}} smaller subthreshold slope and supply voltage, which reduce power dissipation. Computational studies showed that silicene based TFETs outperform traditional silicon based MOSFETs. Silicene TFETs have an on-state current over 1mA/μm, a <b>sub-threshold</b> slope of 77 mV/decade and a supply voltage of 1.7 V. With this much increased on-state current and reduced supply voltage, power dissipation within these devices is far below that of traditional MOSFETs and its peer TFETs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{patch test}} evokes a delayed, Type IV {{hypersensitivity}} reaction, {{which is a}} cell-mediated, antibody independent, immune response. Patch testing is the [...] "gold standard" [...] diagnostic tool for Ni-ACD. In this sense, a positive patch test to nickel establishes that the subject has been previously exposed and is therefore sensitized to nickel. It does not necessarily indicate that the patch reaction {{is the cause of}} the current clinical disease. A negative test demonstrates that the patient is <b>sub-threshold,</b> either minimally or not sensitized. Cumulatively, clinical reasoning and a patch test help determine if nickel could be the cause of a current dermatitis reaction.|$|E
50|$|From {{a pool of}} callers to the ADAA, 1000 {{individuals}} were selected to answer a 97 item questionnaire in order to ascertain information relating to social anxiety disorder, as well as <b>sub-threshold</b> social anxiety disorder. The ADAA found that those individuals suffering from SAD {{were likely to be}} younger in age, unmarried, and in lower income brackets than those non-sufferers in the control group. The ADAA found that sufferers of SAD made more extensive use of the health care system, and were also disadvantaged in many ways. In light of these facts, the ADAA strives to bring about public consciousness of the mental health issue and highlight the importance of early diagnosis and effective treatment, with the broad goal of improving people's lives.|$|E
50|$|James Fadiman is {{currently}} conducting {{a study on}} psychedelic micro-dosing for improving normal functioning. Micro-dosing (or sub-perceptual dosing) means taking <b>sub-threshold</b> dose, which for LSD is 10-20 micrograms. The purpose of micro-dosing is not intoxication but enhancement of normal functionality (see nootropic). In this study the volunteers self-administer the drug approximately every third day. They then self-report perceived effects on their daily duties and relationships. Volunteers {{participating in the study}} include a wide variety of scientific and artistic professionals and students. So far the reports suggest that, in general, the subjects experience normal functioning but with increased focus, creativity and emotional clarity and slightly enhanced physical performance. Albert Hofmann was also aware of micro-dosing and has called it the most under-researched area of psychedelics.|$|E
