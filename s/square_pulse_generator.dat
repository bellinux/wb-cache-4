40|$|The Anti Collision {{device is}} a {{detection}} device {{meant to be}} incorporated into cars {{for the purpose of}} safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The device is intended {{to find a way to}} implement a minimum spacing for cars in traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver. Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers. To achieve this design, 555 timers coupled both as astable and monostable circuits were used along with a 38 KHz <b>Square</b> <b>Pulse</b> <b>generator.</b> The device works by sending out streams of infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle, both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared beams. At the end of the design and testing process, overall system was implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures, Journal pape...|$|E
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScConventional power electronics and electronic control circuits have been replacing by {{the intervention of the}} microprocessors/microcontrollers in modern industrial applications. This is mainly because with their applications the whole systems becomes more and more compact while enhancing the durability. On the other even with the more robust applications hand more accurate & fine operation could achieve by using such modern programming devices. This project was origin from based on an actual requirement of designing (10 v battery charging panel (to energize the batteries in spring charge type breakers) for electrical engineering division of Jaya Container Terminal(J. C. T) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority. But this technique would use to not only to charge batteries of spring charge breakers. but also batteries widely use in YHF communication hand held sets, explosive detectors, emergency lamps, etc [...] Rechargeable batteries are vital to portable electronic equipment such as laptop computers and cell phones. Fast charging circuits must be carefully designed and are highly dependent on the particular battery's chemistry. The most popular types of rechargeable batteries in use today are the Sealed-Lead-Acid (SLA), Nickel-Cadmium(NiCd), Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion). Li-Ion is fast becoming the chemistry of choice for many portable applications because it offers a high capacity-tosize (weight) ratio and a low self-discharge characteristic. Depending on the battery chemistry the charging characteristics of a battery differs to each other. In this project simply what I have done is allows the particular battery to follow its charging characteristic curve when they where you could not find in conventional charging techniques. The charging process is controlled by the software program microcontroller (PIC 16 F 876). Since the battery chemistries are different for different types of batteries, several sets of programs would have to written to the controller for each battery given by the manufacturer. There are some theoretical design calculations included for designing of power electronics modules. DCDC converter, <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator,</b> single rail power & dual rail power supplies,(etc [...] ) Calculations have been done based on highly theoretical facts. Therefore some practical observations are tends to differ from the theoretical approach. Most of the theories studied in the power electronic lessons of my M.

At the beginning the actual target was to built a battery charging panel of 110 V,tut due to some limitations of purchasing of high capacity transformer which suit to this application,the project was limited to 40 V panel only. But the concept, approach & the guide line would be more or less same for the more advanced systems also...|$|E

HPM generation by virtual cathode devices such as Vircators put high demands on the source.

This thesis describes the construction and tests of several inductive high power <b>pulse</b> <b>generators.</b> The <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> were designed {{with the intent to}} deliver a pulse with fast rise time and rectangular voltage.

40|$|In this thesis, {{methods and}} {{computational}} techniques for predicting the static and steady state {{characteristics of a}} switched reluctance motor drive are developed and the predicted characteristics are compared with experimental results. Because of high local saturation and narrow airgap in the SR motor, accurate calculation of the static characteristics of the torque, flux linkage, inductances, and speed emf from its FE field solution is not straightforward. For {{the purpose of this}} study, a two-dimensional finite element model is developed to handle the nonlinear magnetic field inside the machine. Based on a thorough study of the potential sources of errors in the field solution and in the computational methods used in postprocessing, new guidelines are developed regarding the shape and uniformity of the mesh in the airgap and the preservation of these qualities of the mesh as the rotor is rotated. When the proposed guidelines on the mesh configuration and its rotation were used, significant improvement in the accuracy of the field distribution and in the accuracy of the predicted torque/angle characteristics as compared to the experimentally measured torque was observed. Furthermore, all three methods of torque calculation, namely global virtual work, local virtual work, and Maxwell-stress tensor methods are converging to the same results and the torque/angle characteristics are smooth. Improvement in the prediction of such static characteristics is also essential to a realistic prediction of the steady state behavior. In the study of steady state performance of the SRM drive, the converter is approximated by a controlled, <b>square</b> wave <b>pulse</b> <b>generator.</b> In the integration process, the coefficients of the governing differential equation, being dependent on the phase current and rotor angle, are updated using surface interpolation method on the static characteristics.
