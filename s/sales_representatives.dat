In response to the issues, the release of the First on the British carriers EE and Orange was indefinitely delayed so Facebook could focus on making improvements to the Home software.|$|E

25|$|What now {{constitutes}} {{the city was}} originally developed in 1962 as Deltona Lakes by Elliott, Robert and Frank Mackle as a planned residential community through the purchase of 17,203 acres of land. The development would open to potential land buyers on November 18, 1962, and included out-parcels for drainage retention, apartments, churches, parks, commercial centers, an industrial area, a community center, and a golf course. Deltona Lakes was heavily marketed throughout the United States, including Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. <b>Sales</b> <b>representatives</b> would also market {{in places such as}} Germany, Puerto Rico, Latin America and the Far East.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data {{continued}} to undermine marketing until the mid-1970s. Sales personnel had low wages, {{little to no}} influence on product development, high turnover, and were often trained in engineering rather than business. In the first years, ND <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> wore jeans and would present the products to other engineers and computer personnel, with {{the focus on the}} technical details. This changed in the mid-1970s when the company started selling computers to the business sector, where the customer representatives typically were heads of the accounting or warehouse departments. These instead expected suit-dressed salesmen and were interested in issues regarding efficiency and reliability. Profits, and the profit-based bonuses, sank through these years, giving an incentive for technical personnel to give marketing increased importance.|$|E

25|$|When {{the project}} Norsk Data was without orders. <b>Sales</b> <b>representatives</b> were not {{appreciated}} {{in the company}} and were typically fired about once a year. The company's strategy was to create excellent products which could sell themselves. As the twenty-five {{people involved in the}} Nordic project were not required elsewhere, they were moved to the marketing department. It was first with this move that the company's management started realizing the importance of marketing. However, other non-technical departments, especially finances, had also not been keeping up with the company's growth. Kolbjørn Johansen was therefore hired as chief financial officer in 1969. The board decided on 18 October 1972 to replace Monrad-Krohn with Johansen as CEO, with the former becoming chair of the board. He would within a few years leave Norsk Data and establish Mycron and Tiki Data.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, four <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> for Eli Lilly filed {{separate}} qui tam {{lawsuits against}} the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

2500|$|Vortex vice {{president}} Rick Giolito {{noted that there}} was [...] "pressure" [...] by their clients [...] "to incorporate Hollywood-type production, techniques, and corporate structure." [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook agreed that Creative Wonders had streamlined its production process and produced partnerships and alliances between previously unrelated companies {{in a similar fashion}} to the [...] "'best practices' of Hollywood". Giolito asserted that publishers forced the company to create prototypes for pre-testing by focus groups before products would receive complete funding, investment, or a purchase commitment, which lead to shoe-horned Madeline prototypes that were made on a bootstrap budget. [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook wrote that the developer was required to have a [...] "lean production" [...] in order to ensure success of the multi-company entity. EA required the developer to create technical design documents which would state the project milestones based on required technical aspects like game engines that need proof of concept, how long each element would take, the amount of human resources invested which then determined the shipping date; according to executive producer Michael Pole this was a favourable alternative to choosing a release date then working backwards and it helped developers stick to a timeline and understand which assets they were able to deliver. The publisher wanted the prototype stage to be preliminary deadline, with a trivial monitary investment that would identify any [...] "technical hurdles" [...] early on; this was followed by [...] "delivery of levels and game tuning" [...] by the developer. They would only back a project once [...] "one room of an environment that includes art and animation up and running, some collision detection and some gameplay" [...] was created, thereby demonstrating a viable investment; the preliminary artwork and prototype had to be completed within four months. The outsourcing of development to Vortex was a cost-cutting measure, as [...] "software publishers ha found that they mae more money distributing and selling software than developing it"; this led to a [...] "garage developer phenomenon" [...] where companies like Vortex made games like Madeline out of houses and basements. Madeline game artists worked double shifts, and shared computers, desks, and phone lines. In terms of marketing, EA would start devising strategy early on by discussing the chosen genre, and making sure the content and design fit the genre and were [...] "demographically correct"; for instance Pole asserted that [...] "Madeline doesn't belong on the Sony Playstation". In addition to Madaline already being a recognisable brand through its 60-year history, many national <b>sales</b> <b>representatives</b> in the interactive software industry had previously worked in the book and toy space, which meant that they were especially familiar with elements of the Madeline franchise. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, Madeline Thinking Games, and Madeline European Adventures were published by Creative Wonders in 1995–6, and Madeline would become Creative Wonders' [...] "flagship product". Interactive Publisher's Handbook believes that the marketing of the games would have been in vain if the games didn't live up to the expectations of Madeline branded content, and noted that its financial success paid off for DIC's original gamble, and that the critical praise of the premiere title coupled with ABC's desire to run children's programming led to the network picking up the second season of DIC's animated version of Madeline and airing it under the title The New Adventures of Madeline (the previous season and specials had aired on the Family Channel).|$|E
