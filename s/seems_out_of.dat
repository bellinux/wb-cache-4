25|$|Christmas {{music is}} a popular stunt format, used when a station is {{transitioning}} to a different format. For instance, a rock music station changing to a rhythmic oldies format will often air Christmas music in-between. This can occur at times when Christmas music <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, such as in summer. The end of the calendar year is a common time of year for format switches. As such, Christmas music may be aired for a prolonged period of time from as early as October and/or extend as late as New Year's Day, while the station prepares the switch. Conversely, when 94.9 in Atlanta changed from adult contemporary to country music {{in the middle of}} December 2006, it abruptly stopped playing its annual Christmas music a week before the holiday.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, the Town of Oyster Bay board {{unanimously}} denied LILCO {{a permit}} to further expand the plant with five 50 MW gas turbines, citing air-quality concerns {{and the effects of}} the 1970s energy crisis. [...] Town Supervisor John W. Burke at the time noted the board's recognition that [...] "in view of the fuel shortage, construction of gas turbines just <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> step with the direction being taken by the average consumer, who lowers his thermostat and wears a sweater in his home {{to reduce the amount of}} fuel burning." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Todd Titon {{and several}} other writers have {{suggested}} that Lead Belly had significant help with its authorship and claim {{it is not a}} genuine protest song. This theory stems from the idea that Lead Belly did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by Lomax. Since the music that Lomax recorded was sold to northerners sympathetic to Civil Rights, {{it has been suggested that}} Lomax helped him write a song attractive to a white audience. [...] Lead Belly admitted that the term [...] "bourgeois" [...] was unfamiliar to him, and it <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place compared to the vocabulary of his past work.|$|E

500|$|Engels {{felt that}} the three largest {{influences}} on the series as a whole were the 1960s television series The Wild Wild West, Mayberry R.F.D. and The Fugitive—the inclusion of a one-armed character in Twin Peaks was a direct homage to the latter of these. Engels has {{also noted that the}} series would make use of normal, conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a [...] "familiar" [...] framework, allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop—he particularly cites this episode's parole hearing for Hank Jennings as an example, as it offers {{nothing out of the ordinary}} other than the single domino which Jennings is playing with at all times, drawing attention to the item as it is the only thing which <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place.|$|E
500|$|In his 2010 book on Harrison for the Praeger Singer-Songwriter series, Ian Inglis {{comments}} that the song had neither the [...] "overt political message" [...] of Lennon's Christmas single nor the [...] "unashamed commercialism" [...] of Paul McCartney's [...] "Wonderful Christmastime", and writes that [...] "Ding Dong"'s [...] "somewhat halfhearted festive appeal" [...] <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place on Dark Horse. Simon Leng views the song as an [...] "intermittently amusing rocker", {{but with the}} perilous state of Harrison's voice on the recording, [...] "Ding Dong" [...] would have benefited from [...] "hibernating another winter". Author Robert Rodriguez opines that whereas Harrison's [...] "rough-hewn" [...] vocals on [...] "Dark Horse" [...] had enhanced that song, his [...] "Father Time impression" [...] did nothing for [...] "Ding Dong".|$|E
500|$|The poem's {{common name}} comes from the Greek myth of Tithonus, which is {{mentioned}} in lines 9 to 12 of the poem. [...] According to legend Tithonus was a Trojan prince, loved by Eos, the goddess Dawn. [...] She asked that Zeus make her lover immortal; he granted the request, but as she {{did not ask for}} eternal youth for Tithonus, he continued to age for eternity. [...] The story of Tithonus was popular in archaic Greek poetry, though the reference to him in this poem <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place, according to Rawles. [...] However, Page duBois notes that the use of a mythical exemplum to illustrate the point of a poem, such as the story of Tithonus in this poem, is a characteristic feature of Sappho's poetry – duBois compares it to Sappho's use of the story of Helen in fragment 16.|$|E

500|$|BuddyTV {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{was an example}} of the best the series could get. The {{reviewer}} praised all of the interconnecting subplots, Jason Dohring's performance, and the episode's pacing, writing, [...] "Anybody who was kvetching over the slow pace of the last few weeks of Veronica Mars got a huge payoff tonight." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While he was positive towards Lamb's death, he criticized the subplot involving Mac, Logan, Parker, and Bronson. Regarding Lamb, he opined that it made him realize how much he had enjoyed the role; however, he thought that [...] "knowing that the show is almost finished limits its impact." [...] He was positive towards Keith's role in the episode but referred to the Valentine's Day plot as out of character for the show for its happy feel. [...] "It's cute. And cuteness in an episode with the shocking death of a recurring character <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
2500|$|From the 18th {{century to}} the late 1960s, negro (later capitalized) was {{considered}} to be the proper English-language term for people of black African origin.

2500|$|In {{another ten}} years the [...] "alternative view" [...] was {{becoming}} the standard one. JP Mallory wrote in 1989 concerning the various hypotheses of proto-Greek {{that had been}} put forward since the decipherment:"Reconciliation of all these different theories <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question ... {{the current state of}} our knowledge of the Greek dialects can accommodate Indo-Europeans entering Greece at any time between 2200 and 1600 BC to emerge later as Greek speakers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the subject}} matter <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> keeping with Bouré's monumental and public works, his friend Rodin was also {{sculpting}} children during his time in Belgium in the 1870s, when Bouré was a visitor to his studio. Several years later, Rodin produced the bronze Les enfants au lézard (Children with a Lizard), depicting {{a little girl who}} retreats to her older sister's arms in fear of the small lizard below. Despite a similarity of subject matter, the work bears little resemblance to Bouré's sinuous reclining figure. Rodin's approach to representing children as [...] "well-fed babies" [...] has been related to his practice in drawing cupids (erotes) for various two-dimensional media.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous books, special collections, and journal {{articles}} on E.P. Thompson's scholarly work and legacy appeared {{soon after his}} death in 1993. Since then, however, interest in Thompson has waned. The reasons for this are perhaps easily enough summarized. Today, Thompson's histories are viewed as old-fashioned, while his socialist politics are believed extinct. [...] Class is considered neither a fruitful concept of historical analysis nor an appropriate basis for an emancipatory politics. [...] Nuclear weapons proliferate, but no anti-nuclear movement grows up alongside their proliferation. Civil liberties are a minority, and increasingly [...] "radical," [...] interest {{in the age of the}} [...] "war on terror." [...] Internationalism, as ideology and practice, is the preserve of capital not labour. [...] At the beginning of the twenty-first century, then, Thompson <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Farber of Daily News {{commented that}} Knowles' [...] "gymnastic style" [...] during the song, overshadowed Keys' vocals. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the song a mixed review {{stating that the}} song [...] "is fun, though not entirely {{in sync with the}} record's lush, midtempo vibe." [...] USA Today {{negatively}} stated [...] "The only one that <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place is the club anthem 'Put It in a Love Song', a collaboration with Beyoncé that's catchy but ultimately underwhelming, considering the talents involved." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe stated [...] "in high vamping mode, has already made its way to radio, but it’s a slip of a song, coasting on its contagious chorus and delivering little more." [...] While reviewing The Element of Freedom, Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole gave a negative review for the song saying, [...] "The upbeat numbers, which ought to stand out given their infrequency, incline toward the forgettable, though the cutesy club-ready duet with Beyoncé, 'Put It in a Love Song,' is especially embarrassing—not only because the song is bad, but also because Beyoncé delivers what is, by a rather large margin, the best vocal performance of the album's second half." [...] That was somehow echoed by Tyler Lewis of PopMatters who said, [...] "In fact, when she shares a song with Beyoncé—the contemporary queen of pointless bombast—Keys' weakness in this arena is startingly apparent. Beyoncé completely steals the song away and Beyoncé fans will love it, even though it’s a terrible song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes; there's {{no doubt}} of that. But, {{with one or two}} {{unimportant}} exceptions, they're conventional and prejudiced. They believe in what they see; the prosperity of Allinson's, the dividends coming in. They distrust anything that <b>seems</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the usual course, and they couldn't bring themselves to think there should be anything wrong with the firm. I, whom they good-naturedly look down on, have to convince them to the contrary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "I fancy it does.
