He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E

Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends...

500|$|The idea of {{a monster}} buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998 [...] "story summit" [...] in Burbank with {{employees}} from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a [...] "story summit" [...] was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days. Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it. Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film. Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.|$|E
500|$|They find a small structure, {{and from}} its top the woman spots people. As {{they leave the}} structure, they think of their sand castle, {{wondering}} about its fate. The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E

2500|$|Despite being {{advised by}} their governments not {{to travel to}} Lockerbie, many of the passengers' relatives, most {{of them from the}} US, arrived there within days to {{identify}} the dead. Volunteers from Lockerbie set up and staffed canteens, which stayed open 24 hours a day and offered relatives, soldiers, police officers, and social workers free sandwiches, hot meals, coffee, and <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> The people of the town washed, dried, and ironed every piece of clothing that was found once the police had determined they were of no forensic value, so that as many items as possible could be returned to the relatives. The BBC's Scotland correspondent, Andrew Cassell, reported on the 10th anniversary of the bombing that the townspeople had [...] "opened their homes and hearts" [...] to the relatives, bearing their own losses [...] "stoically and with enormous dignity", and that the bonds forged then continue to this day.|$|E
2500|$|The Rankin-Bass production, which spells {{the title}} with an ampersand, truncates {{much of the}} story (it ran in a one-hour time slot) and {{simplifies}} some of the motivations, but its major alterations are setting up the hearing over the Mantle of Immortality as a frame story explaining just why Claus (J. D. Roth/Earl Hammond) deserves the mantle, although there is an edit {{that makes it difficult}} to realize that the scene in which Ak (Alfred Drake) calls the council when first finding the infant in the woods does not occur in the same time period as the main story. In addition, Shiegra accompanies Claus to the Laughing Valley, in which, unlike the book, it is always Winter. A similar compromise toward popular culture is Claus's now eight reindeer, albeit unnamed. Peter Knook, a rather crusty but amiable fellow, replaces most of the other Knooks, save the Protector (King) and two strangers, and declares [...] "only on Christmas Eve" [...] for the reindeer without any argument or explanation. One important new character, Tingler, a Sound Imp (Robert McFadden) also accompanies Claus and gives him <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E

The story is set in Northamptonshire, England, just after the Second World War (<b>someone</b> wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Churchill, but it is revealed Clement Attlee is the PM); in one chapter Maria plays at being General Eisenhower greeting grateful subject peoples. Yet {{there is also a}} strong flavour of the 18th century, both the fictional land of Lilliput and the British Empire of Swift, Gibbon, and Pope. Imperialism, and the need for self-governance, is a major theme in the novel.|$|R

These findings generalize across many cultures (Okamoto & Tanaka, 2004).

These findings also extend across many cultures. Many of these sex differences in relationships and health first appear during adolescence.

When the area needs to address something with city authorities, they choose <b>someone</b> articulate <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the city, but officially s/he represents no one.

25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs <b>someone</b> wise <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|R

The patients' suicide affected their mental, life, and job performance.

Also, the interventions by the professionals of mental care or embalming were requested. Some of them hoped to have the study and training, especially about the impacts to their own. These results suggest that nurses don't have enough support by their organization, though {{they tend to be}} influenced by the patients' suicide.
