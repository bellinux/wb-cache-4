Suggestions of the RSA team included decreasing the speed limit, placement of appropriate warning signs, elimination of plantation on horizontal curves, improvement of road surface skid resistance and speed limit enforcement. In order to increase speed limit compliance, the RSA team proposed the use of automatic speed cameras. It is worth noting however that speeding should be treated with a combination of measures including roadway treatments and behavioral countermeasures [20]. The RSA team proposed for pilot awareness campaigns to promote the acceptance by the public of the use of automatic speed cameras (section 4.2).|$|R

40|$|Geometric design {{guidelines}} provide deterministic analytical formulas {{to facilitate the}} calculation of the distance required to perform emergency stops on highways. Such expressions include several pre-fixed parameters that may produce an oversized or even an uneconomical outcome. Moreover, this deterministic approach provides little knowledge {{about the effects of}} deviating from the standards. Furthermore, the estimation of required <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distances</b> (SSD) considers the grade in an imprecise manner since it may change along the section travelled by the vehicle during the stopping maneuver, e. g. in sag or crest. For these reasons, this paper proposes a new probabilistic approach in order to estimate SSD. First, the authors have adopted the equation provided by the German guidelines, which takes the effect of grade into account along the section travelled during the stopping maneuver. The simulation performs 100, 000 trials of emergency stops on the alignment of a real highway in order to test the reliability of the method, comparing the results to the available <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> (ASD). ASD values have been computed through software based on geographic information systems, using a digital surface model for a better three-dimensional depiction of the highway and its roadsides. The simulation has assigned random variation to several SSD and ASD factors in order to reflect the uncertainty related to this phenomenon. The results made it possible to determine the most hazardous zones in terms of visibility conditions, which corresponded in most cases to the tightest alignment elements...|$|R

Because the <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> far exceeds the actual stopping distance under most conditions, an otherwise capable driver who uses the full <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance,</b> which results in injury, may be negligent for not stopping sooner.|$|E

Many of the parameters used in the current <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> equation were developed in the 1950 s and may not accurately reflect the driver and vehicle population currently on the transportation network. An accident causation study was conducted to determine if roadways with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> present a safety hazard for the transportation network. Rural two-lane and multilane roadways with limited sight distance crest vertical curves were identified in three states, and accident narratives for the most recent three to five years were obtained for the selected roadways. After analyzing the accident narratives, it was determined that only 18 of the 439 accident narratives evaluated had limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance,</b> during the daytime or nighttime, as a possible contributing factor. Ten of the 18 accidents with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor were caused by a vehicle striking another vehicle. There has been a concern that roadways with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> present a significant problem for the older driver as well as large trucks. The percentage of older drivers on the selected two-lane and multilane study sites with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> was similar to the percentage of older drivers in all accidents, reported by the National Safety Council. Only 30 of the accident narratives evaluated were large truck accidents. In addition, only one of the large trucks was involved in an accident with <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a possible contributing factor. Older drivers and large trucks {{did not appear to be}} overrepresented in accidents on roadways with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> All the accidents with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor occurred on vertical curves with a K value less than 125, which corresponds to 400 feet of <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> Most of the accidents with limited <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> as a contributing factor occurred on vertical curves with a K value less than 100, which corresponds to 350 - 375 feet of <b>stopping</b> <b>sight</b> <b>distance.</b> Available sight distances less than 350 - 400 feet may present a safety problem...|$|E

This article concentrates on <b>sight</b> <b>distance</b> of at-grade intersections. Intersections inherently introduce points of conflict between traffic movements, An accident at these points of conflict is influenced by driver behavior, traffic control, and geometric design.
