5|$|The {{remnants}} of the Ottoman II Corps, previously in the Maan region, surrendered to Chaytor's Force {{at the end of}} September. By 29 September, the remaining soldiers of the Fourth, <b>Seventh,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Ottoman Armies, in total 6,000 men, were retreating towards Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> episodes of the fourth series. Sarah Jane would have, {{as a result of}} a lightning storm, come face to face with her father who has been dead for over 55 years.|$|E
5|$|In the Jordan Valley, Chaytor's Force {{would hold}} the {{occupied}} {{area and the}} right flank against attack by the Ottoman Fourth Army and prevent that force from withdrawing troops, which could be sent to reinforce the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies in the Judean Hills. When the Ottoman force began its withdrawal, they were to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{divisions}} were to ride northwards up {{the coastal}} Plain of Sharon, then eastwards over the Mount Carmel Range {{and onto the}} Esdraelon Plain (also known as the Jezreel Valley and the plain of Armageddon), to block the line of retreat of the Ottoman <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies fighting the XX and XXI Corps in the Judean Hills. If the Esdraelon Plain could be quickly captured, while the two Ottoman armies continued fighting the British Empire infantry, the lines of retreat by railway and road could be cut. The success of this plan depended on a rapid advance to simultaneously almost encircle the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies in the Judean Hills and capture Liman von Sanders and the Yilderim Army Group general headquarters. Further, in order to consolidate their success, the cavalry {{would be required to}} hold these places for some time. Operating many miles from their base, they would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward from base.|$|E

5|$|Through the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> centuries, the two abbeys {{followed}} their mission of evangelism, along with forest clearance. With {{the decline of}} the Carolingian Empire, however, the abbeys suffered the same decay as elsewhere, leaving the principality in the custody of lay abbots—temporal guardians—from 844 to 938, including Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Adalard the Seneschal, and Reginar and Giselbert, dukes of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|While the Ottoman Fourth Army {{continued}} to hold {{the eastern side of}} the Jordan Valley, Es Salt, Amman and the Hejaz railway, Chaytor's smaller force was to continue the EEF's occupation of the Jordan Valley. As soon as possible, Chaytor's Force was to advance northwards to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, which would cut a main line of retreat for the Ottoman <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies. This was also a main line of communication between the two armies west of the Jordan River in the Judean Hills with the Fourth Army in the east. The expectation was that, the attacks on the Eighth Army by the XXI and Desert Mounted Corps, and the start of the Battle of Nablus attacks on the Seventh Army, would force the Fourth Army to withdraw northwards along the Hejaz railway to conform with the withdrawals of the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies.|$|E
5000|$|But then Shostakovich {{dropped the}} {{composition}} for three months. He resumed work on 26 July 1945 and finished on 30 August 1945. The symphony {{turned out to}} be a completely different work from the one he had originally planned, with neither soloists nor chorus and a much lighter mood. He forewarned listeners, [...] "In character, the Ninth Symphony differs sharply from my preceding symphonies, the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Eighth.</b> If the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> the <b>Eighth</b> symphonies bore a tragic-heroic character, then in the Ninth a transparent, pellucid, and bright mood predominates." ...|$|R

5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it had {{too much of the}} feel of the 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|Allenby reorganised {{his forces}} along more {{conventional}} lines. The EEF now included the Desert Mounted Corps, under Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel; XX Corps under Lieutenant General Sir Phillip Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin. In October 1917, they defeated the Turkish {{forces in the}} third battle of Gaza and the Battle of Mughar Ridge, which succeeded in causing the Ottoman <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies to withdraw towards Jerusalem and Haifa respectively. This led to the capture of Jerusalem in December 1917.|$|E
5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} 36 hours of battle, from 04:30 on 19 September until 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line {{had been cut}} by infantry, and the cavalry had passed through the gap to reach their {{objectives}} at Afulah, Nazareth, and Beisan. The continuing British Empire infantry attack in the Judean Hills had forced the Ottoman <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Armies to withdraw northwards towards the waiting Desert Mounted Corps.|$|E

5|$|The Odin class, the <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> of Caprivi's {{proposed}} ten coastal defenders, was {{a modified}} version of the Siegfried design; the primary differences were a slightly improved armor layout, a second funnel, and two military masts. In 1888, before the two Odins were laid down, Caprivi's successor, Vice Admiral Alexander von Monts, ordered the construction of the four large battleships of the , to replace what would have been two more Odin-class coastal defense ships; this marked the end of Germany's coastal battleship program.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} phase was the sixth, which saw {{the restoration of}} the eastern and western external walls after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers. A northeastern salient bastion, much smaller than the eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The <b>seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>eighth</b> phases both consisted of heightening al-Rahba's western external walls.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to be denied to the <b>Seventh</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eighth</b> Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills. The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
