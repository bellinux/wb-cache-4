40|$|Human {{behavior}} {{is a mix}} of automatic perceptually-triggered habits and intentional goal-directed actions. We have implemented a <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> that automatically executes actions based on internal and external context. The result of the <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> is a homeostatic mechanism with implicit goals that balances the physical needs of a physical robot with other factors such as interaction with human partners. By acting automatically on salient context elements, the robot intersperses the use of its conversational interface with self-preservation and curiosity drives. Ultimately, having both a goal and a <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> governing robot behavior will allow a very rich platform for embodied, grounded semantics.

40|$|According to dual-system accounts, {{instrumental}} {{learning is}} supported by both a goal-directed and a habitual system. Although behavioral control by the goal-directed system, through outcome-action associations, dominates with moderate training, stimulus-response associations are thought to form concurrently in the <b>habit</b> <b>system.</b> It is therefore challenging to isolate the neural substrate of the goal-directed system in neuroimaging research with healthy human volunteers. Recently, however, de Wit et al. (2007) developed an instrumental discrimination task that distinguishes between goal-directed and habit-based responding. In this task, cues are congruent, unrelated, or incongruent with subsequent outcomes. Whereas performance on congruent and control trials can be supported by both the goal-directed and habitual system, performance on the incongruent discrimination relies solely on the <b>habit</b> <b>system.</b> In the present study, we used this task with healthy participants undergoing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to demonstrate that engagement of the goal-directed system during learning is reflected in increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, using a subsequent outcome devaluation manipulation, we show that this area is involved in guiding decision making when goal values change, {{even in the absence of}} external cues to guide performance. We can therefore exclude a purely Pavlovian account of ventromedial prefrontal function and unequivocally demonstrate its involvement in the acquisition as well as deployment of goal-directed knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Language has {{severally}} {{been viewed}} {{as a collection of}} words, phrases, and sentences. For some, it is a <b>habit</b> <b>system,</b> acquired accidentally and extrinsically. It is further regarded as a structure of forms and concepts based on a system of rules that determine their interrelations, arrangement, and organization. Language also has a relationship with the world and how we talk about the world. It is often likened to a tool, perhaps man’s most important one; more useful it seems than fire, the wheel, or atomic energy. However, language like any tool has its limitations. This limitation is very obvious in the discussions of the behavior of sub-atomic quantum particles of reality since the ordinary everyday language of this macro-world does not fit into the picture of the behavior of elementary particles of physics.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of goal-directed action selection is differentiating between actions that {{are more or less}} likely to be reinforced. With repeated performance or psychostimulant exposure, however, actions can assume stimulus-elicited—or “habitual”—qualities that are resistant to change. We show that selective knockdown of prelimbic prefrontal cortical Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) increases sensitivity to response–outcome associations, blocking habit-like behavioral inflexibility. A history of adolescent cocaine exposure, however, occludes the “beneficial ” effects of Bdnf knockdown. This finding highlights a challenge in treating addiction—that drugs of abuse may bias decision-making toward <b>habit</b> <b>systems</b> even in individuals with putative neurobiological resiliencies. Both humans and rodents can learn to associate specific actions with their outcomes. Such actions are considered “goal-directed,” meaning their performance is sensitive to changes in the pre-dictive relationship between the behavior and its outcome. Extended training, certain reinforcement schedules, and drugs of abuse can induce a shift from goal-directed to automated, or “habitual, ” response strategies that are defined by insensitivity to changes in the contingency between the behavior and the out-come (Yin et al. 2008; Balleine and O’Doherty 2010). Within the prefrontal cortex, the prelimbic subregion is intimately linked with goal-directed decision-making. For example, rodents with prelimbic-selective lesions are insensitive to changes in outcome value or modifications in response–outcome associative contin...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} behavior requires predicting when and what an individual will choose. However, the actual temporal and sequential dynamics of successive choices made among multiple alternatives remain unclear. In the current study, {{we tested the}} hypothesis {{that there is a}} general bursting property in both the timing and sequential patterns of foraging decisions. We conducted a foraging experiment in which rats chose among four different foods over a continuous two-week time period. Regarding when choices were made, we found bursts of rapidly occurring actions, separated by time-varying inactive periods, partially based on a circadian rhythm. Regarding what was chosen, we found sequential dynamics in affective choices characterized by two key features: (a) a highly biased choice distribution; and (b) preferential attachment, in which the animals were more likely to choose what they had previously chosen. To capture the temporal dynamics, we propose a dual-state model consisting of active and inactive states. We also introduce a satiation-attainment process for bursty activity, and a non-homogeneous Poisson process for longer inactivity between bursts. For the sequential dynamics, we propose a dual-control model consisting of goal-directed and <b>habit</b> <b>systems,</b> based on outcome valuation and choice history, respectively. This study provides insights into how the bursty nature of behavior emerges from the interaction of different underlying systems, leading to heavy tails in the distribution of behavior over time and choices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new hypothesis concerning {{the formation of}} habits in the cortex of primates under the implicit supervision of the basal ganglia. This hypothesis has been formulated using a theoretical model and confirmed experimentally in monkeys. To do so, and prior to learning, we inactivated the internal part of the globus pallidus (GPi, the main output structure of the BG) with injections of muscimol and we tested monkeys on a variant of a two-armed bandit task where two stimuli are associated with two distinct reward probabilities (0. 25 and 0. 75 respectively). Unsurprisingly, their performance in such conditions are at the chance level. However, the theoretical model predicts {{that even if the}} performance is random, the value of the stimuli are implicitly evaluated and learned. This has been tested and confirmed on the next day, when inhibition has been removed: monkeys instantly showed quasi-optimal performances, demonstrating they knew the relative value of the two stimuli. Said differently, we managed to explicitly dissociate reinforcement learning from Hebbian learning and demonstrated covert learning inside the basal ganglia. These results suggest that a behavioral decision results from both the cooperation (acquisition) and competition (expression) of two distinct but entangled memory systems, the goal-directed <b>system</b> and the <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> that may represent the two ends of the same graded phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are widely {{believed}} {{to be involved in}} the learned selection of actions. Building on this idea, reinforcement learning (RL) theories of optimal control have had some success in explaining the responses of their key dopaminergic afferents. While these model-free RL theories offer a compelling account of a range of neurophysiological and behavioural data, they offer only an incomplete picture of action control in the brain. Psychologists and behavioural neuroscientists have long appealed to the existence of at least two separate control systems underlying the learned control of behaviour. The <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> is closely identified with the basal ganglia, and we associate it with the model-free RL theories. The other system, more loosely localised in prefrontal regions and without such a detailed theoretical account, is associated with cognitively more sophisticated goal-directed actions. On the critical issue of which system determines the ultimate output when they disagree, there is a wide range of experimental results and sparse theoretical underpinning. Here, we extend the RL account of neural action control by first interpreting goal-directed actions in terms of an alternative model-based strategy for RL. Then, by considering the relative uncertainties of model-free and model-based controllers, we offer a new and more comprehensive account of the confusing ex-perimental results about how the systems trade off control. Our theory offers a more sharply delineated view of the contributions of the basal ganglia to learned behavioural control. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{behaviour}} exhibits {{properties that}} change with experience and partially dissociate {{among a number}} of brain structures. Here, we review evidence from rodent experiments demonstrating that multiple brain systems acquire information in parallel and either cooperate or compete for behavioural control. We propose a conceptual model of systems interaction wherein a ventral emotional memory network involving ventral striatum, amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex triages behavioural responding to stimuli according to their associated affective outcomes. This system engages autonomic and postural responding (avoiding, ignoring, approaching) in accordance with associated stimulus valence (negative, neutral, positive), but does not engage particular operant responses. Rather, this emotional system suppresses or invigorates actions that are selected through competition between goal-directed control involving dorsomedial striatum and habitual control involving dorsolateral striatum. The hippocampus provides contextual specificity to the emotional system, and provides an information rich input to the goal-directed system for navigation and discriminations involving ambiguous contexts, complex sensory configurations, or temporal ordering. The rapid acquisition and high capacity for episodic associations in the emotional system may unburden the more complex goal-directed system and reduce interference in the <b>habit</b> <b>system</b> from processing contingencies of neutral stimuli. Interactions among these systems likely involve inhibitory mechanisms and neuromodulation in the basal ganglia to form a dominant response strategy. Innate traits, training methods, and task demands contribute to the nature of these interactions, which can include incidental learning in non-dominant systems. Addition of these features to reinforcement learning models of decision making may better align theoretical predictions with behavioural and neural correlates in animals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Clinical {{evidence}} suggests that initial attempts to regulate weight gain quickly become habit-like in individuals with eating disorders. These behaviors are controlled excessively in patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and are controlled more intermittently, with periods of lost control, in patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN). We suspect that abnormalities in frontostriatal systems that subserve self-regulatory control and habit learning {{may contribute to the}} development and perpetuation of AN and BN. We summarize previous findings and present a pathophysiological model that provides a framework for understanding the shared and non-shared clinical phenotypes of AN and BN. Whereas dysregulated control systems produce heightened self-regulatory control, permitting individuals with AN to sustain excessive dietary restriction, dysregulated control systems likely result in impaired self-regulatory control in patients with BN, releasing feelings of hunger and urges to binge, thereby resulting in overeating. Interactions with cultural ideals of thinness and impaired <b>habit</b> learning <b>systems</b> may then allow the dieting behaviors of individuals with restricting-type AN to spiral into the habitual and restrictive eating behaviors that typify the disorder. Although these cultural factors likely contribute to the compensatory purging behaviors in BN, interactions with normal <b>habit</b> learning <b>systems</b> may explain the higher recovery rate of BN relative to AN, in which habit learning may be impaired. We describe neuroimaging methods that we are using to test these hypotheses and emphasize the potential utility of studying AN and BN early in the course of illness, to disentangle their causes from epiphenomena or compensatory responses. We believe that this innovative approach to studying eatin...|$|R
40|$|Cortico-basal ganglia {{circuits}} are key {{parts of}} the brain's <b>habit</b> <b>system,</b> but little is yet known about how these forebrain pathways function as ingrained habits are performed. We simultaneously recorded spike and local field potential (LFP) activity from regions of the frontal cortex and basal ganglia implicated in visuo-oculomotor control as highly trained macaque monkeys performed sequences of visually guided saccades. The tasks were repetitive, required no new learning, and could be performed nearly automatically. Our findings demonstrate striking differences between the relative timing of striatal and cortical activity during performance of the tasks. At {{the onset of the}} visual cues, LFPs in the prefrontal cortex and the oculomotor zone of the striatum showed near-synchronous activation. During the period of sequential-saccade performance, however, peak LFP activity occurred 100 – 300 msec later in the striatum than in the prefrontal cortex. Peak prefrontal activity tended to be peri-saccadic, whereas peak striatal activity tended to be post-saccadic. This temporal offset was also apparent in pairs of simultaneously recorded prefrontal and striatal neurons. In triple-site recordings, the LFP activity recorded in the supplementary eye field shared temporal characteristics of both the prefrontal and the striatal patterns. The near simultaneity of prefrontal and striatal peak responses at cue onsets, but temporal lag of striatal activity in the movement periods, suggests that the striatum may integrate corollary discharge or confirmatory response signals during sequential task performance. These timing relationships may be signatures of the normal functioning of striatal and frontal cortex during repetitive performance of learned behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Instrumental {{learning}} and decision-making rely on two parallel systems: a goal-directed and a habitual system. In the past decade, several paradigms {{have been developed}} to study these systems in animals and humans by means of e. g. overtraining, devaluation procedures and sequential decision-making. These different paradigms are thought to measure the same constructs, but cross-validation has rarely been investigated. In this study we compared two widely used paradigms that assess aspects of goal-directed and habitual behavior. We correlated parameters from a two-step sequential decision-making task that assesses model-based and model-free learning with a slips-of-action paradigm that assesses the ability to suppress cue-triggered, learnt responses when the outcome has been devalued and is therefore no longer desirable. Model-based control during the two-step task showed a very moderately positive correlation with goal-directed devaluation sensitivity, whereas model-free control did not. Interestingly, parameter estimates of model-based and goal-directed behavior in the two tasks were positively correlated with higher-order cognitive measures (e. g. visual short-term memory). These cognitive measures seemed to (at least partly) mediate the association between model-based control during sequential decision-making and goal-directed behavior after instructed devaluation. This study provides moderate support for a common framework to describe the propensity towards goal-directed behavior as measured with two frequently used tasks. However, we have to caution that the amount of shared variance between the goal-directed and model-based system in both tasks was rather low, suggesting that each task does also pick up distinct aspects of goal-directed behavior. Further investigation of the commonalities and differences between the model-free and <b>habit</b> <b>systems</b> as measured with these, and other, tasks is needed. Also, a follow-up cross-validation on the neural systems driving these constructs across different paradigms would promote the definition and operationalization of measures of instrumental {{learning and}} decision-making in humans...|$|R
