500|$|Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, {{in their}} {{encyclopedia}} of commemorative coins, {{suggested that the}} decision to have multiple designs was [...] "through some unrecorded agreement". [...] The legislation was ambiguous enough to permit such an interpretation, and numismatist Farran Zerbe urged the Mint to strike more than one type of coin, stating that sales would be increased if this was done. Zerbe was not only a collector (he would serve as president of the American Numismatic Association from 1908 to 1910), but he also promoted numismatics with his traveling exhibition, [...] "Money of the World". [...] He was involved in the distribution of commemorative coins from the Columbian half dollar of 1892 to the Panama-Pacific issue of 1915, and would be the <b>sole</b> <b>distributor</b> of Louisiana Purchase dollars.|$|E

500|$|I Not Stupid earned just S$46,000 {{during a}} limited sneak preview run, {{prompting}} Raintree Pictures {{to embark on}} a massive publicity campaign, including invitations for teachers to discuss the film. After showing for four months on 30 screens the movie earned S$3.8 million, becoming the second-highest grossing Singaporean movie after Money No Enough. Following its success in Singapore, I Not Stupid was released in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. The movie also screened at the Pusan International Film Festival, Tokyo International Film Festival, the Jakarta International Film Festival and the 2005 Singapore Season cultural exhibition in London.

500|$|The {{company was}} founded in January 1955 by Arizona {{businessman}} Jim Hensley [...] on a $10,000 loan. It originally had 12 workers, sold 73,000 cases of beer a year (a case typically being twenty-four 12-oz. bottles or cans), and had a 6 percent market share. [...] While it initially handled many brands of beer, Hensley accepted an offer later in 1955 to become Anheuser-Busch's <b>sole</b> <b>distributor</b> for Maricopa County in return for selling only that brand. [...] Under the names Hensley & Company Distributors and Hensley & Company Wholesale, the company saw decades of steady growth, aided by the Phoenix area {{becoming one of the}} fastest-growing regions of the country while the company still maintained exclusivity with Anheuser-Busch. [...] Jim Hensley's tireless sales efforts and the generous wages and benefits he gave employees were also key success factors. [...] Regarding technology, Hensley & Co. were the first Anheuser-Busch distributor to invest in refrigerated warehouses, which subsequently became standard in the industry. [...] By 1970, Hensley & Co. had a 20percent market share; by 1980, that had grown to 50percent, the business had become quite successful, and Jim Hensley was a multi-millionaire.|$|E
