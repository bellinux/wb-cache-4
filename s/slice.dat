40|$|Abstract: Y 172 fiber <b>slicer</b> (also says Hartz <b>slicer)</b> {{is often}} used in <b>slicing</b> fiber in fabric inspection. However, there are some {{problems}} {{for this kind of}} <b>slicer,</b> such as low success, low efficiency, poor safety and so on. A new fiber automatic <b>slicing</b> instrument is proposed in this paper. Some creative designs are done, in aspects of <b>slicing</b> thickness adjustment, automatic fiber cutting, blade constant clamping and gravity pressure. This fiber <b>slicing</b> instrument changed traditional <b>slicing</b> method, and effectively resolved the problems of Y 172 fiber <b>slicer.</b> A reliable and efficient instrument is provided for fast and accurate <b>slicing</b> fiber...|$|R

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a <b>slice</b> of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another <b>slice</b> and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

40|$|Static program <b>slicing</b> {{is often}} {{proposed}} for software maintenance-related tasks. Due to different causes static <b>slices</b> {{are in many}} cases overly conservative and hence too large to reduce the program-part of interest meaningfully. In this paper we further investigate the concept of union <b>slices,</b> which are defined as the unions of dynamic <b>slices</b> computed for the same (static) <b>slicing</b> criteria, but for different executions of the program. We verify on real-world Java programs their usefulness as a replacement to static <b>slices.</b> For this we investigate the sizes {{of a number of}} backward and forward dynamic and union <b>slices,</b> also by comparing them to the corresponding static <b>slices.</b> Our results show that the union <b>slices</b> are precise enough (backward <b>slices</b> are 5 – 20 % of the program and forward <b>slices</b> are 5 – 10 %, the corresponding static <b>slices</b> being 25 – 45 %), and that with the saturation of the overall coverage given many different executions, union <b>slices</b> also reach a steady level and typically do not grow further by adding new test cases...|$|R

5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to <b>slice</b> the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple interprocedural algorithm for amorphous <b>slicing</b> and illustrates {{the way in}} which interprocedural amorphous <b>slicing</b> improves upon interprocedural syntax{preserving <b>slicing.</b> The paper also presents results from an empirical study of an implementation of this algorithm for Ward's Wide Spectrum Language, WSL. The implementation uses the FermaT transformation workbench. It combines FermaT transformations with the results produced by a syntax-preserving <b>slicer</b> for WSL. Finally, it is shown that the combination of amorphous <b>slicing</b> and conditioned <b>slicing</b> can be particularly attractive, by combining results from the amorphous <b>slicer</b> with results from a prototype conditioned <b>slicer</b> for WSL...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic <b>slicing</b> {{algorithms}} {{have been}} considered to aid in debugging for many years. However, {{as far as we}} know, no detailed studies on evaluating the benefits of using dynamic <b>slicing</b> for detecting faulty statements in programs have been carried out. We have developed a dynamic <b>slicing</b> framework that uses dynamic instrumentation to efficiently collect dynamic <b>slices</b> and reduced ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (roBDDs) to compactly store them. We have used the above framework to implement three variants of dynamic <b>slicing</b> algorithms including: data <b>slicing,</b> full <b>slicing,</b> and relevant <b>slicing</b> algorithms. We have carried out detailed experiments to evaluate these algorithms. Our results show that full <b>slices</b> and relevant <b>slices</b> can considerably reduce the subset of program statements that need to be examined to locate faulty statements.

Since UML class models do not explicitly embody any behavioral aspect by themselves, models <b>slices</b> are computed in a context-free manner. The paper defines context-free model <b>slicing</b> and presents an algorithm for computing <b>slices</b> on class models. Concrete applications of model <b>slicing</b> to address particular software maintenance questions are presented to support the usefulness and validity of the method. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the role of ethylene action, via use of the ethylene antagonist 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), on the senescence and quality of fresh-cut ripe papaya (Carica papaya L. `Sunrise Solo') fruit. Ripe papaya fruit were treated with 2. 5 μL·L- 1 1 -MCP and immediately processed into fresh-cut <b>slices</b> or left intact. At 2 -day intervals over 10 days at 5 °C, continuously stored <b>slices</b> were monitored for ethylene production, firmness, electrolyte leakage, color, sensory changes, and pathogen incidence. <b>Slices</b> freshly prepared from intact fruit stored under identical conditions were measured similarly. Ethylene production did not differ significantly between the treatments, although production rates were slightly but consistently higher in <b>slices</b> from intact control compared with intact 1 -MCP-treated fruit. Mesocarp firmness of continuously stored <b>slices</b> and <b>slices</b> from fruit stored intact was significantly retained by 1 -MCP. Firmness of continuously stored <b>slices</b> from 1 -MCP-treated fruit declined 50 % compared with 75 % for control <b>slices.</b> Firmness of fresh-cut <b>slices</b> prepared from intact control and 1 -MCP-treated fruit at each sampling interval declined 26 % and 15 %, respectively. Electrolyte leakage remained low and changed little in <b>slices</b> freshly prepared from fruit stored intact. Leakage from continuously stored papaya <b>slices</b> increased after 4 days, and after 6 days controls increased significantly compared with stored <b>slices</b> derived from papaya fruit initially treated with the ethylene antagonist. The flesh color of continuously stored <b>slices</b> or <b>slices</b> prepared from fruit stored intact was influenced by 1 -MCP only during the later periods of storage. Microbial counts in stored <b>slices</b> or <b>slices</b> prepared at each sampling were generally unaffected by 1 -MCP. Informal sensory analysis indicated that the edible shelf life was 6 days in stored <b>slices</b> from 1 -MCP-treated fruit compared with 2 to 3 days for stored <b>slices</b> from control fruit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSlicing is {{a program}} {{analysis}} technique {{which can be used}} for reducing the size of the model and avoid state explosion in model checking. In this work a static <b>slicing</b> technique is proposed for reducing Rebeca models with respect to a property. For applying the <b>slicing</b> techniques, the Rebeca dependence graph (RDG) is introduced. As the static <b>slicing</b> usually produces large <b>slices,</b> two other slicing-based reduction techniques, step-wise <b>slicing</b> and bounded <b>slicing,</b> are proposed as simple novel ideas. Step-wise <b>slicing</b> first generates <b>slices</b> overapproximating the behavior of the original model and then refines it, and bounded <b>slicing</b> is based on the semantics of non-deterministic assignments in Rebeca. We also propose a static <b>slicing</b> algorithm for deadlock detection (in absence of any particular property). The applicability of these techniques is checked by applying them to several case studies which are included in this paper. Similar techniques can be applied on the other actor-based languages...|$|R
