Furthermore, in September 2009 easyrec was awarded a special recognition in the category “Award for Innovations - IT Innovations for an economic upswing” by the jury of the Austrian state prize for multimedia and e-business. After a comprehensive refactoring phase and the integration of the evaluation results easyrec was published on SourceForge on 18 February 2010.
