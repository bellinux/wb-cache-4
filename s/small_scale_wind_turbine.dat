40|$|Recent {{demand for}} {{decentralized}} renewable energy on a <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> {{has led to}} the advancement of micro-wind turbines and customized control systems. In this work, the arising need for an innovative control system for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> particularly suited to a low wind speed urban environment has been addressed. This work focuses on the stand-alone application of a vertical-axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (VAWT) cross-flow prototype with the prospect of being able to grid-tie the system without any major modification to the control system. This constraint {{has led to the}} inclusion of a magnetic brake with various advantages over conventional braking methods which are addressed in the literature review of this thesis. Furthermore, the latter revealed lack of computerized models for the setup described, therefore it has been decided in this work to focus on software-based controller development utilizing models which have been validated by various experiments. In the first development stage, a novel test bench prototype has been developed for prior evaluation of the brake characteristics. The prototype has been utilized for deriving a model dedicated to the low-speed region and for developing an efficient design strategy to be able to customize control systems for future <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> The second development stage has been dedicated {{to the development of a}} suitable model for the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> Different modelling strategies are evaluated, i. e. the use of look-up tables (LUT), analytical models and CFD models, and the most suitable selected.

40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{power sources}} such as photovoltaic solar cells, <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and fuel cells are particularly suitable for distributed generation systems, but typically produce a relatively low magnitude DC voltage output that can vary significantly as operating conditions change.

Such an inverter should be light weight, low cost, efficient, and provide galvanic isolation between the source and the AC output/grid connection. It is also often preferable that the inverter draws constant DC current from the input energy source, which means it must smooth out the double-fundamental-frequency energy flow of a single phase AC load connection. These requirements can be met with a double conversion system incorporating a high frequency DC-DC step up converter to produce a relatively constant high voltage DC output from the varying DC input, and a high voltage DC-AC inverter and filter to produce the final AC output...|$|R
