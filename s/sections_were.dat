5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> without a majority in support.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998.

However, some <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> built using a balanced cantilever design, where spans were first built {{on their own and}} then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had to be built {{in the middle of the}} Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the off-peak hours, causing congestion on the Van Wyck.|$|E

Two parts of the route were sub-standard at the time; however, those <b>sections</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt in the early and mid-1930s.
