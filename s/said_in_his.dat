5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography {{that there was}} greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players {{to work with and}} was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|While heavily recruited, Campbell {{narrowed his}} choices to Houston, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Baylor. After in-home visits from Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell {{ultimately}} chose Texas. Switzer, who unsuccessfully recruited Campbell, <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 1989 book that Campbell {{was the only}} player he ever saw who could have gone straight {{from high school to}} the NFL and immediately become a star.|$|E

5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995–97, <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{autobiography}} that Fowler was {{the best}} player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore {{were among the most}} prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Whitman also {{influenced}} Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, {{and was the}} model for the character of Dracula. Stoker <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death. Other admirers included the Eagle Street College, an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, Bolton, to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the poet's birthday.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

25|$|Robert Ardrey, {{an admirer}} of Eugène Marais's, {{attributed}} Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck.

25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon. Dr. Steve Olvey, CART Director of Medical Affairs, would later report that two drivers felt dizzy and disoriented after running their cars at over , and that they felt they could not control their cars.

Stuart Law said that he would think 'twice' before using the Mongoose, while MS Dhoni <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> column that he believed in Hayden's ability 'no matter what means he uses'. After a quiet start to the third edition of the IPL, Hayden made a blistering 93 off 43 deliveries to kickstart his campaign.|$|E
25|$|When Trotsky was eight, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} Odessa to be educated in a Jewish school. He was {{enrolled}} in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa {{as a result of the}} Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook. Although Trotsky <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography My Life that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.|$|E
