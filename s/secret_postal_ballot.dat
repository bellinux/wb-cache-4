5000|$|Each Foundation Trust has a Council of Governors. This {{is made up}} {{of elected}} Governors and {{appointed}} Governors. Elected Governors are chosen by a <b>secret,</b> <b>postal</b> <b>ballot,</b> of the membership. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a [...] "public member" [...] constituency consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition there are appointed Governors, appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local Councils, local medical Schools, and local Voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors. The size of the Council of Governors and its exact composition is determined by the constitution of the particular Trust. Each Trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. (For example, a majority of the Council of Governors must be elected Governors and Governors must be unpaid volunteers. They are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors. [...] Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the Rochdale Principles into their constitution and aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual as well as local organisations. [...] But on the whole [...] "Foundation Trusts have... not deepened in terms of democratic practice and participation".|$|E

If a presiding officer receives a <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> pack in a polling station, it is sealed inside a packet which is later delivered to the returning officer {{at the close of}} poll together with a form recording the number of <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> packs received by the presiding officer.|$|R

50|$|Where an elector {{has applied}} for a <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> {{to be sent to}} an {{overseas}} address, the returning officer should prioritise the dispatch of their <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> packs (over those sent to UK addresses), send them by air mail and ensure that the <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> pack includes a return envelope with sufficient postage to be sent to the UK from abroad.|$|R
5000|$|When issuing each <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> paper, {{the officer}} marks {{on a list}} (called the {{corresponding}} number list) next to the <b>postal</b> <b>ballot's</b> unique identification number the elector number of the voter to whom the <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> is sent, and then makes a mark next to the voter's name in a separate list of postal voters.

The local authority name and address {{and the name of}} the constituency/ward are printed on both envelopes [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B".

50|$|Returning {{officers}} {{issue and}} despatch <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> packs at 5 p.m. on the eleventh working day before polling {{day at the}} earliest. Issue of <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> is not open to the scrutiny of candidates and their agents; by law, only the returning officers, their staff, representatives of the Electoral Commission and observers accredited by the Electoral Commission are permitted to attend.

50|$|Voters return their <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> {{together}} with <b>postal</b> voting statements filled {{in with their}} date of birth and signature either by post or by hand directly to the returning officer, or by hand to the presiding officer on polling day at a polling station situated within the constituency/ward printed on the <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> return envelope.

25|$|The age {{required}} {{to have the right}} to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age {{required to}} stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to <b>postal</b> <b>balloting</b> and had lengthened the legislative term from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. <b>Postal</b> <b>balloting</b> was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would not be known until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). <b>Postal</b> <b>ballots</b> had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a spot check in Salzburg, 20% of <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested <b>postal</b> <b>ballots,</b> which meant that <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> could decisively change the election outcome.|$|R
