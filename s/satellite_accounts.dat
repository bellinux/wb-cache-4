5000|$|In 1992, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce {{initiated}} intensive work {{to create}} an environmental accounting system. [...] The BEA began by creating <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal. The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic <b>Satellite</b> <b>Accounts</b> (IEESA) in 1994. [...] The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth. [...] Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon Alan Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored {{an amendment to the}} 1995 Appropriation Bill. In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in environmental accounting, and to obtain an external review on their findings.|$|E

The Tourism <b>Satellite</b> <b>Account</b> (TSA) has become the internationally recognized framework and an important tool by which to measure tourism activity in an economy. The goal of this handbook is to make the CTSA and its inner workings as transparent as possible. By sharing the Canadian practical experiences in development of the TSA, it should benefit other countries and other interested practitioners {{in the process of developing}} and understanding TSAs. This handbook covers information on the relevant tourism and national accounting concepts and definitions related to the CTSA. The various survey data sources and the methods used to move this data into the TSA framework are discussed.

The paper demonstrates that a consistent accounting of tourism industry activity potentially provides new information for policymakers and the tourism industry itself.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of the input-output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such {{can be used to}} calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input-output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input-output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by IMPLAN and Regional Input-Output Modeling System. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called [...] "key" [...] or [...] "target" [...] industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input-output analysts have extended the approaches application {{to a wide variety of}} uses.|$|E

The TSA are a complement {{to the information}} in the national accounts for transport activities, which are only partially described in this general framework.

40|$|Economic Accounting is {{relatively}} well developed in Norway {{especially on the}} national level, {{but also on the}} regional level. Satellite accounting is used for focusing certain features of the economy, a. o. for tourism. A satellite account for tourism has been developed on the national level. Because the tourists'activities are regional activities, and because the impacts of tourism are significant not only on the national, but also on the regional level, a regional satellite account for tourism was developed by us during the past two years. Such <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> on the regional level are, to our knowledge, not developed worldwide. The data can a. o. be used for moderating existing input-output models, so they can become more tailor-made for analysing impacts of tourists' economic activities. We propose a paper that focuses on our work - methods for regionalising <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> for tourism, - indicators applied for this regionalisation, - how regional satellite account figures can be adapted into existing input-output models of the Norwegian economy (on the regional level), and - an example, showing how the regional <b>satellite</b> <b>accounts</b> for tourism can be used for simulating the regional impacts of tourism by the use of input-output techniques. ...|$|E
