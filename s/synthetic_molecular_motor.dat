Although the term [...] "molecular motor" [...] has traditionally {{referred to a}} naturally occurring protein that induces motion (via protein dynamics), some groups also use the term when referring to non-biological, non-peptide synthetic motors. Many chemists are pursuing the synthesis of such <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> The prospect of <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> was first raised by the nanotechnology pioneer Richard Feynman in 1959 in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.|$|R
50|$|The motor by Kelly and {{co-workers}} is an elegant {{example of how}} chemical energy {{can be used to}} induce controlled, unidirectional rotational motion, a process which resembles the consumption of ATP in organisms in order to fuel numerous processes. However, it does suffer from a serious drawback: the sequence of events that leads to 120° rotation is not repeatable. Kelly {{and co-workers}} have therefore searched for ways to extend the system so that this sequence can be carried out repeatedly. Unfortunately, their attempts to accomplish this objective have not been successful and currently the project has been abandoned.

In 2011 his research group described the smallest molecular knot prepared to date (a 76-atom-loop trefoil knot - three crossing points) and also a 160-atom-loop pentafoil knot (five crossing points). In 2013 the Leigh group reported a small-molecule machine capable of detaching and assembling a series of amino acid building blocks from a track into a peptide of specific sequence, a very primitive version of the task performed by the ribosome. They also invented the first autonomous chemically-fuelled <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motor</b> and demonstrated a small-molecule 'robotic arm' able to transport molecular fragments between sites 2 nm apart on a molecular platform, marking the start of so-called 'small-molecule robotics'. In 2017 the Leigh group reported the synthesis of an 819 knot, the most complex molecular knot made to date.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{molecular}} motors use chemical energy, {{mostly in}} the form of ATP hydrolysis, and convert it to mechanical energy. Correlated thermal fluctuations are essential for the function of a molecular machine and it is the hydrolysis of ATP that modifies the correlated fluctuations of the system. Correlations are consequences of the molecular architecture of the protein. The idea that synthetic molecular machines may be constructed by designing the proper molecular architecture is challenging. In their paper, Sarkar et al (2016 New J.

40|$|<b>Molecular</b> spiders are <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> {{featuring}} multiple {{legs that}} each can interact with a substrate through binding and cleavage. Experimental studies suggest {{the motion of}} the spider in a matrix is biased toward uncleaved substrates and that spider properties such as processivity can be altered by changing the binding strength of the legs to substrate [R. Pei, S. K. Taylor, D. Stefanovic, S. Rudchenko, T. E. Mitchell, and M. N. Stojanovic, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 12693 (2006) ]. We investigate the origin of biased motion and <b>molecular</b> <b>motor</b> properties of bipedal spiders using Monte Carlo simulations. Our simulations combine a realistic chemical kinetic model, hand-over-hand or inchworm modes of stepping, and the use of a one-dimensional track. We find that stronger binding to substrate, cleavage and spider detachment from the track are contributing mechanisms to population bias. We investigate the contributions of stepping mechanism to speed, randomness parameter, processivity, coupling, and efficiency, and comment on how these <b>molecular</b> <b>motor</b> properties can be altered by changing experimentally tunable kinetic parameters...|$|R
40|$|Improving our {{understanding}} of biological motors, both to fully comprehend their activities in vital processes, and to exploit their impressive abilities for use in bionanotechnology, is highly desirable.

We use circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and disulfide rearrangement studies to demonstrate the ability of this six-peptide set to form the structure designed for the Tumbleweed motor.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{continuous}} efforts {{to understand the}} structures and functions of biomolecules. Biomolecular activities, critical to viability of living organisms, are often accomplished {{through a series of}} chemical reactions. A number of methodologies have been developed to probe and study biomolecular reactions, using radioactive, electrochemical, piezoelectric, or magnetic measurements. These techniques, however, are unable to provide non-invasive, comprehensive, and dynamic information about the biomolecular reactions. To overcome these limitations, optical methods have received significant attention because they are capable of acquiring and transferring dynamic information in-situ, in real-time non-intrusively with minimal perturbation to samples during the measurements. ^ This thesis focuses on designing and exploring novel optical nanosystems that directly monitor and analyze various biomolecular reactions including molecular recognition and enzymatic activities. By integrating novel optical nanomaterials such as nucleic acid-functionalized nanocrystals and single-wall carbon nanotubes, we have probed biomolecular reactions at the nanoscale and studied their reaction kinetics. Theoretical kinetic models have been developed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in such molecular reactions and to understand the relevant kinetics. In this study, we have demonstrated two independent platforms - optical biosensors and synthetic DNA motors. In our first model system, efforts have been made to enable optical detection of physiologically important molecules in-situ, in real-time, non-invasively. Here, we used insulin as target analytes and optically monitored their secretion profiles from live pancreatic cells in a temporally and spatially resolved fashion using near-infrared fluorescent carbon nanotubes. The sensors modulate their emission properties upon binding to the analytes. A high selectivity (detection limit of ∼ 10 nM) is achieved by integrating nanotubes with molecular recognition elements such as insulin-binding aptamers. In theory, the sensitivity may reach the single-molecule level with single nanotube spectroscopy. The sensors are extremely robust such that they can be regenerated via proteolysis indefinitely, and thus, they are suitable for long-term measurements. Our theoretical model reveals the diffusion and binding reaction kinetics of analyte molecules of kr = ∼ 0. 129 sec- 1. ^ In our second model system, we have demonstrated a DNA enzyme based <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motor</b> that transports inorganic nanoparticles, walking along carbon nanotubes. This system is reminiscent of cargo-carrying, microtubule-based intracellular protein motors such as kinesins and dyneins. In our design, a semiconductor nanocrystal and a carbon nanotube are used as model cargo and track, respectively. The DNA motors extract chemical energy from RNA molecules decorated on the nanotube track and convert that energy to direct processive, autonomous, unidirectional movement through a series of conformation changes. The translocation of the DNA motors has been visualized in real-time using spectrally resolved emission properties of the nanocrystal cargo and carbon nanotube track. We have identified and studied the critical parameters that govern the kinetics of the motor 2 ̆ 7 s programmed walking. Such parameters include enzymatic core sequence/structure and recognition arm lengths as well as environmental factors such as buffer temperature, pH, and types and concentration of metal cations. The maximum translocation speed observed in our experiments is approximately 1 nm sec- 1. A theoretical kinetic model, based on the probability distributions of single molecule reactions, describes mechanistic details of the motor operation. The numerical calculations indicate that the single turnover time is roughly 1 min, where dissociation of the upper recognition arm and branch migration of the lower recognition arm are the rate-limiting steps for a given enzyme motor. By incorporating photoisomerizable azobenzene moieties into the DNAzyme sequences, we also have shown that the translocation kinetics of DNA motors can be effectively controlled by external light irradiation. The optical nanosystems studied in this thesis form a novel bioanalytical platform to probe and study biomolecular reactions both at the single-molecule and ensemble levels. Our integrated experimental and theoretical study ultimately generates kinetics-based design principles for DNA walkers and optical biosensors. The findings advance our understanding of DNA reactions and should be valuable to the field of DNA nanotechnology and biomolecular diagnostics in general. ...|$|E

These systems can be categorized into linear and rotary motors, depending on the motion induced. This brief account will discuss the state of affairs of the research on light-driven rotary <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> <b>MOLECULAR</b> ROTARY MOTION Inspired by the unidirectional rotary motion found in F 1 -ATPase[1], current pursuits towards nanomachines and <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> focus on systems that allow controlled molecular rotation and translation. Intramolecular rotary motion itself is trivial as, e. g. most single bonds in organic molecules freely rotate under ambient conditions. Already in the late sixties, Akkerman et al. [2] tried to exert control over the rotation of a carbon-carbon single bond, a concept that was later exploited by Mislow et al. [3]. In their molecular gear systems, two intramolecular rotations are coupled due to steric effects. However, no control over the direction is exerted and the motion is merely an oscillation as is the case for most reported examples of forced rotary motion, like e. g. in catenane systems[4], double-decker metal complexes[5] an...|$|R

40|$|<b>Molecular</b> spiders are <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> {{based on}} DNA nanotechnology. While natural <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> have evolved towards very high efficiency, {{it remains a}} major {{challenge}} to develop efficient designs for man-made <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> Inspired by biological motor proteins like kinesin and myosin, molecular spiders comprise a body and several legs. The legs walk on a lattice that is coated with substrate which can be cleaved catalytically. We propose a novel molecular spider design in which n spiders form a team. Our theoretical considerations show that coupling several spiders together alters {{the dynamics of the}} resulting team significantly. Although spiders operate at a scale where diffusion is dominant, spider teams can be tuned to behave nearly ballistic, which results in fast and predictable motion. Based on the separation of time scales of substrate and product dwell times, we develop a theory which utilises equivalence classes to coarse-grain the micro-state space. In addition, we calculate diffusion coefficients of the spider teams, employing a mapping of an n-spider team to an n-dimensional random walker on a confined lattice. We validate these results with Monte Carlo simulations and predict optimal parameters of the molecular spider team architecture which makes their motion most directed and maximally predictable.

40|$|Biological {{molecular}} {{machines are}} able to rectify random thermal motions to generate directional force and carry out tasks on both the molecular and macroscopic length scales 1. Although some artificial nanomachines have been synthesized 2 - 4 and used to collectively carry out mechanical tasks 5 - 8, the direct measurement of the mechanical processes at the single molecule level {{has yet to be}} realized. We show that biased Brownian motion of the sub-molecular components in a hydrogen bonded [2]rotaxane 9 -a molecular ring threaded onto a molecular axle-can be harnessed to generate significant directional forces. We applied a mechanical load to the ring by atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever during single molecule pulling-relaxing cycle. Using fluctuation theorems, we were able to relate the measurements of the work done at the level of individual molecules to the free energy change measured previously by ensemble measurements. The results show that individual rotaxane molecules can generate directional forces of similar magnitude to biological machines, and extend the capabilities of AFM-based single molecule mechanics to the world of small molecules. 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} a novel smart surface to modulate the orientation of immobilized double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the conforma-tion of a polymer scaffold through variation in buffer pH and ionic strength. An amphoteric poly(dimethylacrylamide) based coating containing weak acrylamido acids and bases, which are copolymerized together with the neutral monomer, is covalently bound to the surface. The coating can be made to contain any desired amount of buffering and titrant ionogenic monomers, allowing control of the surface charge when the surface is bathed in a given buffer pH. Spectral self-interference fluorescence microscopy (SSFM) is utilized to precisely quantify both the DNA orientation and the polymer conformation with subnanometer resolution.

40|$|We {{deal with}} the issue of {{quantifying}} and optimizing the rotation dynamics of <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> For this purpose, the continuous four-stage rotation behavior of a typical light-activated <b>molecular</b> <b>motor</b> was measured in detail. All reaction constants were determined empirically. Next, we developed a Markov model that describes the full motor dynamics mathematically. We derived expressions for a set of characteristic quantities, i. e., the average rate of quarter rotations or "velocity," V, the spread in the average number of quarter rotations, D, and the dimensionless Peclet number, Pe = V/D. Furthermore, we determined the rate of full, four-step rotations (Omega(eff)), from which we derived another dimensionless quantity, the "rotational excess," r. e. This quantity, defined as the relative difference between total forward (Omega(+)) and backward (Omega(-)) full rotations, is a good measure of the unidirectionality of the rotation process. Our model provides a pragmatic tool to optimize motor performance. We demonstrate this by calculating V, D, Pe, Omega(eff), and r. e. for different rates of thermal versus photochemical energy input. We find that for a given light intensity, an optimal temperature range exists in which the motor exhibits excellent efficiency and unidirectional behavior, above or below which motor performance decreases...|$|R

A DNAzyme-capped CdS nanoparticle and a RNA-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) were used as a walker and a track in the motor platform, respectively. As a walking mechanism, the DNAzyme cleaved the RNA substrates {{in the presence of}} metal cations. The RNA molecules were functionalized with SWCNTs using pi-pi stacking. Due to their fluorescent properties under specific light excitations, they were visualized to track the position of our motor.

It is useful to study the basic elements that constitute the sub-cellular components using model systems, which mimic {{certain parts of the}} overall system, in order to better understand the system as a whole. Here we present a number of tools, which enable the study of a few model systems that mimic specific components of <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> and cellular membranes. The tools we use are nano- and microstructures that allow for the control and monitoring of two model biological systems: <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors</b> and supported lipid bilayers, in order to probe their basic functions and interactions with the artificial environment. The two synthetic motors of interest, that mimic cellular bipedal <b>molecular</b> <b>motors,</b> utilize either rectified diffusive motion or changes in motor conformation to take steps. The synthetic motors have been designed to isolate these aspects previously observed in natural bipedal motor stepping. We have fabricated and tested microand nanofluidic devices which make it possible to control the motors’ stepping with simultaneous observation using optical microcopy. Additionally, these devices are designed to enable testing of the motors’ performance against a load force. We have also used a microfluidics device with a natural helicase motor that moves along DNA, {{in much the same way}} as one of the synthetic motors is designed to do. In this study we have successfully controlled the motor motion with addition and withdrawal of the motor’s fuel supply, ATP, in the surrounding solution, and we have monitored single protein motors as they move and stop along the DNA track. These devices and techniques set the stage for future measurements of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> Additionally, these fluidic devices have a number of other potential applications in single-molecule studies, as they allow for the changing of the chemical environment surrounding single-molecules whilst causing little disturbance to these. Supported lipid bilayers are a simplified model version of the complex cell membrane, which contains not only lipids, but also a number of other intra-membrane components needed for cellular function. We have used a substrate with a large number of vertical nanowires standing parallel to one another to study the bilayer interaction on a highly curved support. This type of support has interesting applications in the field of localized injection into cells. In this application it is still unclear how the cellular membrane responds to the nanowire supports, and how injection can occur. Using the nanowire devices, we have formed a supported lipid bilayer that follows the nanowires, which could allow for future studies focusing on the interaction between lipid membranes and the nanowires. Additionally, because the membrane follows the nanowires, this device could be used as a platform to study lipids at high curvature, for example membrane components, such as proteins, that favor high curvature.

Brownian dynamics simulations predict that Inchworm's stall force is determined by its entropic spring constant and is ∼ 0. 1 pN. Operation of the motor requires periodic cycling of four different buffers surrounding the DNA inside a nanochannel, while keeping constant the hydrodynamic load force on the DNA. We present a two-layer fluidic device incorporating 100 nm-radius nanochannels that are connected through a few-nm-wide slit to a microfluidic system used for in situ buffer exchanges, either diffusionally (zero flow) or with controlled hydrodynamic flow. Combining experiment with finite-element modeling, we demonstrate the device's key performance features and experimentally establish achievable Inchworm stepping times {{of the order of}} seconds or faster...|$|R

A combination of DFT calculations and various spectroscopic techniques is employed {{to study the}} effect of the bridging group in {{the lower half of the}} molecule on the conformational dynamics. It was found that the extent to which the bridging group can accommodate the increased folding in the transition state is the main factor in rationalizing the differences in barrier height and, as a consequence, the rotary speed.

40|$|In systems {{possessing}} spatial or dynamical symmetry breaking, Brownian motion {{combined with}} unbiased external input signals, deterministic and random alike, can assist directed {{motion of particles}} at submicron scales. In such cases, one speaks of ``Brownian motors. {''} In this review the constructive role of Brownian motion is exemplified for various physical and technological setups, which are inspired by the cellular molecular machinery: the working principles and characteristics of stylized devices are discussed to show how fluctuations, either thermal or extrinsic, {{can be used to}} control diffusive particle transport. Recent experimental demonstrations of this concept are surveyed with particular attention to transport in artificial, i. e., nonbiological, nanopores, lithographic tracks, and optical traps, where single-particle currents were first measured. Much emphasis is given to two- and three-dimensional devices containing many interacting particles of one or more species; for this class of artificial motors, noise rectification results also from the interplay of particle Brownian motion and geometric constraints. Recently, selective control and optimization of the transport of interacting colloidal particles and magnetic vortices have been successfully achieved, thus leading to the new generation of microfluidic and superconducting devices presented here. The field has recently been enriched with impressive experimental achievements in building artificial Brownian motor devices that even operate within the quantum domain by harvesting quantum Brownian motion. Sundry akin topics include activities aimed at noise-assisted shuttling other degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, or even heat and the assembly of chemical <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors.</b> This review ends with a perspective for future pathways and potential new applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Robots in {{medicine}} deserve enhanced attention, being a field where their instrumental ids enable exacting options. The availability of oriented effectors, capable {{to get into}} the human body with no or negligible impact, is challenge, evolving while micro-mechanics aims at nanotechnology. The survey addresses sets of known achievements, singling out noteworthy autonomous in body devices, either co-robotic surgical aids, in view of recognizing shared benefits or hindrances, to explore how to conceive effective tools, tailored to answer given demands, while remaining within established technologies. Robotics for medical applications started fifteen years ago while for biological applications it is rather new (about five years old). Robotic surgery can accomplish what doctors cannot because of precision and repeatability of robotic systems. Besides, robots are able to operate in a contained space inside the human body. All these make robots especially suitable for noninvasive or minimally invasive surgery and for better outcomes of surgery. Today, robots have been demonstrated or routinely used for heart, brain, and spinal cord, throat, and knee surgeries at many hospitals in the United States (International Journal of Emerging Medical Technologies, 2005). Nanorobotics is the still largely hypothetical technology of creating machines or robots at or close to the scale of a nanometer(10 - 9 meters). Also known as nanobots or nanites, they would be constructed from nanoscale or molecular components. So far, researchers have only been able to produce some parts of such a machine, such as bearings, sensors, and <b>synthetic</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>motors,</b> but they {{hope to be able to}} create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individual cells), utility fog, manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning. This presentation provides a survey of current developments, in the spirit of focusing the trends toward the said turn...|$|R
