5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in <b>sinusitis,</b> pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that <b>sinusitis</b> occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, <b>sinusitis</b> pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary <b>sinusitis</b> or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his <b>sinusitis</b> by inserting a pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic <b>sinusitis,</b> and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term <b>sinusitis</b> is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, <b>sinusitis,</b> tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic <b>sinusitis.</b> In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hergé {{also contributed}} to L'Ouest (The West), a {{newspaper}} run by his friend Raymond De Becker. L'Ouest urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Hergé supported, creating the Mr Bellum strip to argue this position. Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with <b>sinusitis</b> and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down, part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with <b>sinusitis</b> and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about to be caught in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Wade {{averaged}} 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6.0 rebounds while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets. Wade continued his high level of play in the second round by averaging 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards. The Heat's playoff run was stopped by the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions, in 7 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with <b>sinusitis,</b> the flu, and a knee strain. He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the Conference Finals that prevented him from playing in the series' sixth game and limited him in the seventh. The Heat lost the series in the seventh game despite leading three games to two after the fifth game and holding a lead with three minutes remaining in Game 7.|$|E
5|$|Mark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage {{winners in}} the past two editions of the Giro, were absent from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam. These {{included}} Tyler Farrar, André Greipel, and Alessandro Petacchi, all of whom had themselves won Grand Tour stages in 2009 and figured to be top favorites for the Giro's flat stages. Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but he pulled out due to <b>sinusitis</b> shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and <b>sinusitis</b> (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary <b>sinusitis,</b> which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic <b>sinusitis,</b> bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a <b>sinusitis</b> operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
25|$|All {{these types}} of <b>sinusitis</b> have similar symptoms, and are thus often {{difficult}} to distinguish. Acute <b>sinusitis</b> is very common. Roughly ninety percent of adults have had <b>sinusitis</b> {{at some point in}} their life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinusitis</b> is {{a common}} condition. It affects between about 10% and 30% of people {{each year in the}} United States and Europe. Women are more often {{affected}} than men. Chronic <b>sinusitis</b> affects approximately 12.5% of people. Treatment of <b>sinusitis</b> in the United States results in more than 11 billion USD in costs. The unnecessary and ineffective treatment of viral <b>sinusitis</b> with antibiotics is common.|$|E
25|$|Health care {{providers}} distinguish bacterial and viral <b>sinusitis</b> by watchful waiting. If {{a person has}} had <b>sinusitis</b> for fewer than 10 days without the symptoms becoming worse, then the infection is presumed to be viral. When symptoms last more than 10 days or get worse in that time, then the infection is considered bacterial <b>sinusitis.</b> Imaging by either X-ray, CT or MRI is generally not recommended unless complications develop. Pain caused by <b>sinusitis</b> is sometimes confused for pain caused by pulpitis (toothache) of the maxillary teeth, and vice versa. Classically, the increased pain when tilting the head forwards separates <b>sinusitis</b> from pulpitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinusitis</b> is {{a common}} condition, with between 24 and 31 million cases {{occurring}} in the United States annually. Chronic <b>sinusitis</b> affects approximately 12.5% of people.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>sinusitis</b> {{is usually}} precipitated by an earlier upper {{respiratory}} tract infection, generally of viral origin, mostly caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, and metapneumovirus. If the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Until recently, Haemophilus influenzae {{was the most common}} bacterial agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the H. influenza type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased H. influenza type B infections and now non-typable H. influenza (NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less commonly, gram negative bacteria. Viral <b>sinusitis</b> typically lasts for 7 to 10 days, whereas bacterial <b>sinusitis</b> is more persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral <b>sinusitis</b> results in subsequent bacterial <b>sinusitis.</b> It is thought that nasal irritation from nose blowing leads to the secondary bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>sinusitis</b> may be {{accompanied}} by thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color and may contain pus (purulent) and/or blood. Often a localized headache or toothache is present, and it is these symptoms that distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Another way to distinguish between toothache and <b>sinusitis</b> is that the pain in <b>sinusitis</b> is usually worsened by tilting the head forwards and with valsalva maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{episodes of}} <b>sinusitis</b> can also result from fungal invasion. These infections are {{typically}} seen {{in patients with}} diabetes or other immune deficiencies (such as AIDS or transplant patients on immunosuppressive anti-rejection medications) and can be life-threatening. In type I diabetics, ketoacidosis {{can be associated with}} <b>sinusitis</b> due to mucormycosis.|$|E
25|$|For chronic <b>sinusitis</b> {{it can be}} an {{effective}} add-on therapy. It is also reported to be {{an effective}} measure against chronic sinus symptoms induced by work-place exposure to sawdust. Further evidence suggests that nasal irrigation causes relief for both hay-fever and the common cold. Nasal irrigation could also be an effective treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic <b>sinusitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Breathing {{low-temperature}} steam such {{as from a}} {{hot shower}} or gargling can relieve symptoms. There is tentative evidence for nasal irrigation. Decongestant nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline may provide relief, but these medications {{should not be used}} for more than the recommended period. Longer use may cause rebound <b>sinusitis.</b> It is unclear if nasal irrigation, antihistamines, or decongestants work in children with acute <b>sinusitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A more recent, {{and still}} debated, {{development}} in chronic <b>sinusitis</b> {{is the role}} that fungi play in this disease. It remains unclear if fungi are a definite factor {{in the development of}} chronic <b>sinusitis</b> and if they are, what the difference may be between those who develop the disease and those who remain free of symptoms. Trials of antifungal treatments have had mixed results.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{bacterial}} <b>sinusitis</b> due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. Other agents, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate {{are generally}} preferred, however.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of studies on}} the association between secondhand smoke exposure and <b>sinusitis</b> have found a significant association between the two.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{irritation}} {{can also}} trigger <b>sinusitis,</b> commonly from cigarette smoke and chlorine fumes. Rarely, {{it may be}} caused by a tooth infection.|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence for}} benefit of saline irrigation in acute {{upper respiratory tract}} infections such as the common cold and acute <b>sinusitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{skeletal}} analysis included findings of maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> Approximately 60% {{of the remains}} recovered from the Moatfield ossuary exhibited skeletal pathology consistent with maxillary <b>sinusitis.</b> Although not all cases of this pathology will leave evidence on bone, the results do provide a significant indicator of living conditions and overall health of the population. The predominance of individuals {{under the age of}} 12 showed minimal symptoms, however after reaching adulthood prevalence increases and remains high throughout all age groups.|$|E

25|$|Recommended {{treatments}} for most cases of <b>sinusitis</b> include rest and drinking {{enough water to}} thin the mucus. Antibiotics are not recommended for most cases.|$|E
25|$|The European Medicines Agency {{has advised}} that for pneumonia, acute {{bacterial}} <b>sinusitis,</b> and acute exacerbations of COPD, it {{should only be}} used when other antibiotics are inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} reported by patients treated with ZYFLO CR were <b>sinusitis</b> (6.5%), nausea (5%), and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5%) vs. placebo, 4%, 1.5%, and 4% respectively.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the general indications for {{all members of the}} tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease, chronic prostatitis, <b>sinusitis,</b> pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, rosacea, and rickettsial infections.|$|E
