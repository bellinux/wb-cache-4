500|$|The VR Disc {{was also}} {{released}} in the PAL region as a [...] "data disc" [...] titled Metal Gear Solid: <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> on October 29, 1999. Unlike the Japanese and American versions, <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> requires a PAL copy of the original Metal Gear Solid {{in order to be}} played. This change was done since the original Metal Gear Solid was released in multiple languages in Europe and <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> determines the language it uses based on which version of the original game the player owns. When the <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> disc is loaded into the PlayStation console, the game will ask the player to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid in order to load voice and language data before asking the player to switch back to the <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> disc to start the game. This requirement renders <b>Special</b> <b>Missions</b> incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made prior to the SCPH-70000 model.|$|R

5|$|In February 1918, {{the call}} {{went out for}} volunteers to {{participate}} in a <b>special</b> <b>mission</b> to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships. Although many aboard Australia volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel—10 sailors and an engineering lieutenant—were selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The lieutenant was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his efforts. The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole. All ten sailors survived—Australia was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid—and three were awarded the DSM, while another three were mentioned in dispatches. One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but he did not receive the award.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the end of}} 1790 {{and summer}} of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz, {{receiving}} a more conservative education than at Strasbourg, a city the return to which was now unsafe. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1792 Francis succeeded his father Leopold as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall. To this he added the honour of opening the accompanying ball alongside Louise of Mecklenburg. In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792–7) and making Metternich's further study in Mainz impossible. Now {{in the employment of}} his father, he was sent on a <b>special</b> <b>mission</b> to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners. Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes, later looking back on these as substantial lessons about warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England on, ostensibly on official business helping Viscount Desandrouin, the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1650s, Parchevich {{had entered}} major European {{politics}} {{and was the}} central figure of a significant anti-Ottoman plot. In 1656, Parchevich arranged a meeting in Târgovişte between {{the members of the}} plot, which included the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia and high-ranking clerics, including the Serbian Patriarch. After the meeting, Parchevich sent revolutionary messages to Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania and Greece, hoping to incite a rebellion. His plans were backed by the rulers of the Romanian lands which border Bulgaria north of the Danube: Gheorghe Ştefan of Moldavia and Constantin Şerban of Wallachia. However, the lack of clear support by key accomplice Austria meant an eventual uprising had to be delayed. In 1657, Parchevich was received by Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, whom he visited on a <b>special</b> <b>mission.</b> In the same year, he was granted the noble title of baron by the Habsburgs owing to his merits in defending Christianity. As an Austrian noble, he was styled Peter Freiherr von Parchevich.|$|E
