50|$|Clyde's Vegetable Garden Planner is an easy-to-use {{vegetable}} gardening <b>slide</b> <b>chart</b> {{for the home}} and hobby gardener. It was created in 1991 by Clyde Majerus, an industrial engineer and avid gardener from Grovespring, Missouri. By 2009, over 100,000 charts had been printed and distributed throughout the US and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|A volvelle or wheel chart {{is a type}} of <b>slide</b> <b>chart,</b> a paper {{construction}} with rotating parts. It {{is considered}} an early example of a paper analog computer. Volvelles have been produced to accommodate organization and calculation in many diverse subjects. Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of astronomy books. They {{can be traced back to}} [...] "certain Arabic treatises on humoral medicine" [...] and to the Persian astronomer, Abu Rayhan Biruni (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{hand-held}} mechanical calculating {{devices such}} as slide rules and addiators, which {{have been replaced by}} electronic calculators and computer software, wheel <b>charts</b> and <b>slide</b> <b>charts</b> have survived to the present time.

50|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>chart</b> {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{in the early}} 1990s, when Majerus lived in Centralia, MO. He was attempting to plan {{the sequence of events}} in his 50'x120' garden around the upcoming birth of his third child, who was due in June 1991; Majerus wanted to plant beans in his garden so he would be available to help his wife in the delivery without having to worry about his garden going to waste. During that time, he happened to be studying time phasing as a part of his engineering day job; many manufacturing companies use a time-phased plan known as MRP (material requirements planning) for raw materials and parts requirements, in order to ensure on-time delivery of the final product. MRP involves using a horizontal calendar and planning backward from the customer’s expected delivery date. Beginning with a horizontally oriented calendar, Majerus scribed a line for the average frost date and a second line for the expected baby’s birth. Next, the various garden vegetables were listed, first to last, in order as they are planted relative to the frost date. Counting weeks from the frost to first planting date, Majerus realized that if the frost line could be made to slide, the chart would be useful as a tool for gardeners throughout the country.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the {{general-purpose}} mechanical calculators, <b>slide</b> <b>charts</b> {{are usually}} devoted to {{carrying out a}} particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process.

Another example of a wheel chart is the Planisphere, which shows the location of {{stars in the sky}} for a given location, date, and time.|$|R
40|$|When {{neural network}} based systems are used {{within the field}} of {{financial}} analysis, either as price oracles or autonomous traders, they are primarily used with a sliding price window. This paper presents a novel approach where the indirectly encoded neural network system, just like the technical analysts, looks directly at the candlestick style <b>sliding</b> <b>chart</b> instead, the actual geometrical-patterns within it, to make its predictions. The results presented demonstrate that this approach results in a higher and more consistent generalization to previously unseen financial data, while maintaining a profit level on par with the neuroevolutionary system which uses a standard sliding window...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} imposed displacement and initial coating thickness on fretting wear behaviour of a thermally sprayed coating. Initial coating thickness and imposed displacement between two mating components are important parameters affecting durability of a thermally sprayed coating under fretting conditions. Nevertheless, the effects of imposed displacement and coating thickness at flat-and-rounded frictional contacts of aerospace dovetail connections are not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, fretting wear experiments with a double-layer thermally sprayed coating are performed under different displacement and coating thickness conditions. The effects of the parameters are then identified by directly comparing the ratio of maximum tangential force to normal force. Experimental {{results show that the}} ratio evolutions are similar on the ratio versus accumulated reciprocal <b>sliding</b> distance <b>chart</b> within the displacement range of 0. 4 - 0. 6. mm. In addition, it is demonstrated that durability of the coating is increased with increasing the initial thickness of the coating. Finally, the effect of the initial coating thickness is described with exponential evolution law of fretting damage. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

25|$|In France, Avant que l'ombre... {{became the}} singer's fifth number-one album, debuting atop the French Albums Chart with nearly 150,000 (Gold) units {{sold in the}} first week. Although Farmer did not promote the album, it {{remained}} at number one for three non-consecutive weeks, alternating with Grégory Lemarchal's album, Je deviens moi. Avant que l'ombre... logged {{in more than two}} months in the top ten, and 23 consecutive weeks in the top 50 before <b>sliding</b> down the <b>chart</b> later in autumn, which partially resulted from the six-month difference between the release of the second and the third singles. It re-entered in the top 20 in January after an intense advertising campaign, an interview on TF1 and the concerts at Bercy. The album ultimately logged a total of 77 weeks on the album chart. In spite of a good chart trajectory, the album did not reach the sales of Farmer's previous studio albums, which were all million plus sellers in France. The album was certified Platinum, then Double platinum on 6 July 2006. It was the eighth best-selling album of 2005 in France.|$|R

50|$|To produce 35mm slides on the Genigraphics system, the {{operator}} created the <b>slide</b> information (bar <b>chart,</b> line graph, pie chart or graphics and background artwork) without actually viewing {{this on the}} screen. The slide would be created in full and then the screen was 'regenerated'. It took about a minute for the screen to regenerate and produce the visual representation of the slide. The textual and other non-graphic input {{was sent to the}} processor with a set of commands (x,y coordinates etc.). Vector artwork was generated by dropping a set of vertices on the screen using a pen, tablet and 'puck' (a three button box operated with the free hand). Whilst drawing your graphic by dropping the vertices on the screen, a pink wireframe with the vertices as small squared would show you where each plotted point would be. Fill colours and borders where then plotted to the finished vector. The background could be graduated from one colour to a second colour using 2000 lines to reproduce a very smooth graduation effect.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{clearly more}} an album act than a singles act, Dokken's album sales {{were tied to}} the videos for the singles from those albums.

It was during {{the run of the}} third single [...] "Alone Again" [...] that the album, <b>sliding</b> down the <b>charts</b> after [...] "Just Got Lucky" [...] faded, reversed course and hit its peak of No. 49. This time, Tooth and Nail would be certified Gold by the RIAA in August 1985, [...] the band's first certification, and would linger on the charts {{for the remainder of the}} year.

The mean temperature of cases (37. 9 °) was significantly higher (P= 0. 012) than that of the controls (37. 3 °). The cases had lower white blood cell (WBC) counts compared to controls (13. 6 versus 16. 7, P= 0. 04). Pathological diagnosis identified 4 cases of diverticulosis, 5 cases of diverticulitis, 6 cases of diverticulosis with acute appendicitis, and 10 cases of diverticulitis and appendicitis.
