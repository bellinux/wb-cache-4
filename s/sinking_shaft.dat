5000|$|The Hamstead Colliery Company {{was formed}} in April 1875. It {{acquired}} land {{in an area of}} Staffordshire, on what is now the north west border of Birmingham, from G.C. Calthorpe of nearby Perry Hall, and in 1876 <b>sank</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{grandson}} {{of one of}} Desloge's friends and business colleagues, Harry Cantwell, Sr, said, [...] "They say that grandfather and Desloge (Firmin Desloge) were riding in a surrey one day trying to decide where to <b>sink</b> a <b>shaft.</b> Desloge spit off {{one side of the}} surrey and said there was where they would <b>sink</b> the <b>shaft.</b> Grandfather didn't agree with the location of the spit and split with Desloge to form his own company," [...] Cantwell said. Desloge soon <b>sank</b> a <b>shaft</b> and struck the same main vein and deposits as that of those he had worked at Bonne Terre before the fire.|$|R

5000|$|In January 1916, the 173rd Tunnelling Company {{moved to}} the Hulluch-Loos area. The unit began <b>sinking</b> <b>shafts</b> and driving {{galleries}} to counter an enemy mining initiative immediately {{to the south and}} east of Loos. [...] When 255th Tunnelling Company was formed the same month, some experienced officers and men from 173rd Tunnelling Company were attached to the new unit.|$|R

At least 80 were slain along the river, but James Galdie escaped with some of his men through a <b>sink</b> <b>shaft</b> under a watermill. The English penetrated the castle courtyards at night without resistance.|$|R
50|$|Copper was {{discovered}} on Virgin Gorda. Local legends also suggest the shafts were dug by Spanish adventurers to mine {{silver in the}} late fifteenth century, but no documentary evidence can be found to support this theory, and no firm evidence of Spanish occupation of the islands prior to the Dutch settlement exists, much less the size of settlement which {{would be needed to}} <b>sink</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|It represent, {{not only}} some of the most {{striking}} scenery upon the line, but the peculiar manual and mechanical operations connected with the execution of the principal works. Amongst them the process of tunnelling, the formation of embankments and cuttings, the gear and machinery used in <b>sinking</b> <b>shafts,</b> and the subterraneous works of the stationary engine-house at Camden Town, are at once remarkable and interesting.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, while {{construction}} workers were <b>sinking</b> <b>shafts,</b> an underground explosion killed {{one man and}} injured twelve, trapping them {{at the bottom of}} the 1900 ft shaft. The accident was attributed to a misunderstanding in signalling, when men at the top mistakenly believed that the men at the bottom had left the pit and commenced demolition sending tonnes of rock and debris down the shaft.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Snt3jP83c&feature=related ...|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time Dickson was also working on a {{contract}} from the Mersey Railway. This company had been incorporated in 1871 with powers to build a railway under the river between Liverpool and Birkenhead. Dickson was awarded a contract to <b>sink</b> <b>shafts</b> to the depth at which the boring of the actual tunnel could be undertaken by the Diamond Boring Machine Co. He started work in April 1872 by <b>sinking</b> a <b>shaft</b> on the Birkenhead side and by March 1873 this shaft had been sunk to full tunnel depth. In November 1873 the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board accepted a tender from Dickson for the enlargement and alteration of the Canada basin and other related works but it is doubtful if any significant progress was made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} South Hetton {{is closely related}} to South Hetton Colliery. The South Hetton Coal Co., owned by Colonel Thomas Bradyll, first <b>sank</b> <b>shafts</b> in 1831. Large scale {{production}} began two years later and corresponded with a large increase in population. Employment peaked in the 1930s when over 1400 people worked at the colliery.

40|$|To {{separate}} {{residual materials}} from a heterogeneous material flow an intensive mechanical treatment is necessary. In most cases multistage processes of crushing-, sorting-, and sieving steps {{are used to}} meet the quality specifications concerning sorting purity of secondary raw materials. Bulk materials of waste origin have often a fluctuating composition of different material fractions. As a consequent specific behaviors (e. g. flight, particle interaction, and ignition) vary from particle to particle. In mechanical waste treatment plants wind sifting or optical sorting devices are often used to separate a specific fraction from the material flow. In both technologies the material flow {{is divided into two}} or more material flows using the separation criteria trajectories of the si ngle fractions. To reach a clean separation a precise knowledge of the flight behavior of the single fractions is required. At Fraunhofer UMSICHT a <b>sink</b> <b>shaft</b> was developed and implemented to determine time-resolved the particle trajectories and particle movement depending at the physical particle properties. Based on the results of <b>sink</b> <b>shaft</b> experiments and further developed simulation tools, well-founded predictions about the behavior of bulk materials are possible...|$|R

25|$|Large drills {{are used}} to <b>sink</b> <b>shafts,</b> {{excavate}} stopes, and obtain samples for analysis. Trams {{are used to}} transport miners, minerals and waste. Lifts carry miners {{into and out of}} mines, and move rock and ore out, and machinery in and out, of underground mines. Huge trucks, shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore. Processing plants utilize large crushers, mills, reactors, roasters and other equipment to consolidate the mineral-rich material and extract the desired compounds and metals from the ore.|$|R

The Pacific Coast Borax Company prospected in the same area, with almost the same results: basalt at 190 ft. However, persistence paid off. That same year Suckow <b>sank</b> another <b>shaft</b> just a little south of his last one and found a 70 ft thick bed of colemanite at 210 ft. In 1925 the Suckow Chemical Company produced a few hundred tons of colemanite from this shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Gold at Nome was {{concentrated}} in three ancient beach lines, now inshore, above sea level, and buried under roughly fifty feet of permafrost overlain by {{two feet of}} tundra.
