5|$|Young schoolboy William Taswell had bolted {{from the}} early morning service in Westminster Abbey. He saw some {{refugees}} arrive in hired lighter boats near Westminster Stairs, a mile west of Pudding Lane, unclothed and covered only with blankets. The services of the lightermen had <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> extremely expensive, and only the luckiest refugees secured a place in a boat.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E

25|$|In the {{drinking}} song that follows, Verdi {{makes use of}} the bassoons and other low instruments in order to represent the internal effects of alcohol upon Cassio. However, this is gradually eclipsed by the merry themes which follow in the orchestra and chorus ("Chi all'esca ha morso").

The full orchestra builds up to a climax as they fight whilst Iago orders Roderigo to go and alert the entire town until the ordeal is interrupted by a loud statement made by the entering Otello.|$|E

25|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, Maximilian I of the House of Habsburg {{had become}} king in 1486. Seven years later, {{he took over}} the {{possessions}} of his cousin Sigismund of Austria, which included Tyrol, uniting all Habsburg possessions in his hands. The general rise of power of the Habsburgs and their dynastic politics had brought them in conflict with the French kings. Maximilian's second marriage to Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan in 1493 opposed him directly to the French kings who also claimed the Duchy of Milan; a conflict that would escalate to the Italian Wars. The alpine passes in the southern Grisonsand in particular the Umbrail Pass in Val Müstairhad <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> strategically important as a direct route from the Tyrol to northern Italy, and the Habsburgs redoubled their efforts to control that region.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 1837, {{conscious}} {{that he had}} not long to live, Yohannan designated as coadjutor and 'guardian of the throne' Gregory Peter di Natale, metropolitan of Gazarta, presumably with the intention of excluding his nephew Eliya from the patriarchal dignity. However, he did not promise the succession to his coadjutor, and {{in order to ensure that}} the hereditary principle would play no part in the selection of the next patriarch the Vatican appointed by a bull of 25 September 1838 Nicholas Zaya, metropolitan of Salmas, Yohannan’s coadjutor with the right of succession. The reason given in the bull for this decision was the growing infirmity of the patriarch and the desirability of avoiding inconvenience and harm should the patriarchate <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> vacant. Zaya was Persian by birth, from Khosrowa, and as such could lay claim to the protection of the foreign consuls in Turkey. He had also been educated at the Propaganda, and it was hoped that after Yohannan's death he would loyally implement Vatican policy.|$|E

Bottsford pressed Riley for marriage several times, but Riley refused.

Freema Agyeman, Terrence Mann, Anupam Kher, Naveen Andrews and Daryl Hannah also star. In the second season Toby Onwumere replaces Ameen.

The song extolled {{the virtues of the}} town, offset against how unsatisfying the best place in the world can <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> when the one you love is no longer there: [...] "a market town that lacks quintessence / that's Chatteris without your presence".

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in {{his work}} on U.S. coins, took a more positive view of Barber's coinage: [...] "the last word as to their aesthetic merits {{has yet to be}} written. Little admired or collected for more than three generations after their appearance , these essentially conservative but most dignified coins have <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> extremely popular with collectors". Vermeule argued that [...] "the designs of Barber's coins were more attuned to the times than he perhaps realized. The plumpish, matronly gravitas of Liberty had come to America seven years earlier in the person of Frédéric Bartholdi's giant statue ... He suggested that the features of Daniel Chester French's huge statue Republic, created for the World Columbian Exposition, [...] "were absolutely in harmony with what Charles Barber had created for the coinage in the year of the Fair's opening".|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Selous Scouts in late 1973 countered the new ZANLA tactics very effectively, perhaps because those of the Scouts were deliberately similar. A squad of Selous Scouts and [...] "turned" [...] insurgents would move into a captured area, formerly occupied by the guerrillas, and {{give the appearance of}} being cadres themselves. In doing so they would win the trust of both the local people and any insurgents operating nearby, which would allow them to discover the enemy camps and gathering points. These would then be given to the conventional troops, who would move in to attack with the Selous Scouts escorting them. The Scouts and their unorthodox tactics resolved the problem encountered a year before when intelligence had <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> scarce. The security forces now once again knew where their enemy was and could confront him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1840s, Mina {{travelled}} through Europe {{with her family}} {{so that they might}} [...] "learn languages and finish [...] education". The trip started in 1847, when Mina journeyed to Dresden due to her mother's desire for her daughters to learn German. From 1847 to 1849, she and her family lived in Paris near the Arc de Triomphe, and were kindly received by the French Royal Family headed by Louis Philippe I and Queen Marie Amelie. They left soon after the king and queen's fall from power, as the city had <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> unsafe for those of their rank. In 1850, they visited the court of Hanover and were received by Ernest Augustus I of Hanover and his family; later that year, they returned to Kensington Palace and Mina and Millicent came out in society.|$|E

After his agent informed him {{it would be a}} recurring role, and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show, Kosterman decided to take the job. To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not see any reason why his character would <b>suddenly</b> <b>become</b> evil.
