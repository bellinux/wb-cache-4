5|$|During the 17th century, the <b>salt</b> <b>extraction</b> {{activities}} gradually {{went into}} decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt {{produced in the}} Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century.

His group, having people like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coast of the town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British.

5|$|The valley {{was used}} during Romano-British period {{when it was}} the site of <b>salt</b> <b>extraction.</b> At the time of King Arthur the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. According to legend this lake is one of the {{locations}} suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. John Leland noted in the 16th century that the bridge had four arches, while W. Phelps in an 1839 illustration as having only two arches, one pointed, probably from the 14th or 15th century, and the other round. Excavations in 1912 found the remains of a second round arch regarded as 12th century work. The current concrete arch bridge was built in 1911 and extended in 1972. It carries the A39 road over the Brue.|$|E
50|$|While most {{commercial}} <b>salt</b> <b>extractions</b> {{are done}} from the huge deposits {{on the shores}} of the lake, there is also another novel way of extraction done by wading through the lake waters.

Traditional methods of nutrient sampling such as <b>salt</b> <b>extractions</b> can only be done {{at the end of an}} experiment, are impractical for sampling locations precisely and give total nutrient values which can overestimate the nutrients available to the roots. In contrast, microdialysis provides a non-invasive, continuous method for sampling available nutrients in the soil. Here for the first time we have used microCT imaging to position microdialysis probes at known distances from the roots and then measured the available nitrate and ammonium.

40|$|The {{salinity}} of {{the ocean}} in the past can be reconstructed by using knowledge of the existing evaporite deposits on land and in the offshore. We assume that evaporites on land follow the same rates of sedimentary cycling as other sedimentary materials to determine the flux of salts to the sea. However, the salt {{can be stored in}} the ocean until conditions appropriate for deposition occur. We assume that salt removals into the deep offshore, continental margin and marginal sea deposits, are not yet part of the recycling system. We conclude that during most of the Cenozoic salinities have been higher than they are today. Each of the major <b>salt</b> <b>extractions</b> into the offshore has caused a rapid decrease of oceanic salinity by a few per mille. In the Early Cretaceous mean ocean salinities ranged between 38 and 42 ‰, and the Jurassic and Triassic they were between 43 and 53 ‰...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{bioavailability}} is a {{key factor}} in risk assessment procedures for contaminated sites. The goal of our study was to evaluate metal bioavailability and toxicity in long-term contaminated soils in the Tarnowskie Gory area of the Silesia region of Poland. Forty diverse soils were collected throughout the study area. Metal availabil-ity was measured using neutral <b>salt</b> <b>extractions,</b> a sequential extraction and an in vitro test for Pb bioaccessibility. Effects of soil contamination on microbial activity and wheat growth were examined in a pot study. The study demonstrated relatively low availability of metals in long-term contaminated soils. In the sequential extractions zinc and lead were mainly present as poorly available fractions defined as associated with iron and manganese oxides or the residual fraction. Cadmium was mainly present in the exchangeable fraction but also occurred in the immobile fractions. Extractable metals and their contents in wheat were mostly dependent on soil pH and were not correlated to their total soil concentrations.

Although the albumin remains largely cytosolic in recipient cells, the glycolytic enzymes rapidly (less than 30 min) become insoluble, as measured by detergent and <b>salt</b> <b>extractions.</b> The microinjected glycolytic enzymes appear to form disulphide-linked aggregates, are found in a cell fraction rich in vimentin-containing intermediate filaments and histones (nuclear-intermediate-filament fraction), and are degraded slowly by a lysosomal mechanism, as judged by the effects of inhibitors (NH 4 Cl, leupeptin, 3 -methyladenine). 125 I-labelled bovine serum albumin appears to be degraded rapidly and non-lysosomally. Prolonged treatment (96 h) of cultured cells with leupeptin results in the accumulation of pulse-labelled ([35 S]methionine for 24 h) endogenous cell proteins in the detergent-and salt-non-extractable residue, but NH 4 Cl and 3 -methyladenine do not have this effect.

40|$|Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), {{the first}} enzyme in {{polyamine}} biosynthesis, is highly regulated by many trophic stimuli, {{and changes in}} its levels and organization correlate with cytoskeletal changes in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). NHEK ODC exhibits a filamentous perinuclear/ nuclear localization that becomes more diffuse under conditions that alter actin architecture. We have thus asked whether ODC colocalizes with {{a component of the}} NHEK cytoskeleton. Confocal immunofluorescence showed that ODC distribution in NHEK was primarily perinuclear; upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D, ODC distribution was diffuse. The ODC distribution in untreated NHEK overlapped with that of keratin in the perinuclear but not cytoplasmic area; after treatment with cytochalasin D, overlap between staining for ODC and for keratin was extensive. No significant overlap with actin and minimal overlap with tubulin filament systems were observed.

In addition, an ultrastructural analysis on thin sections and a morphometric study by means of semiautomated image analysis of phase contrast micrographs have been performed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} evidence of discrete roles of phosphoinositidase C (PIC) isoforms and {{the assessment of}} their localization in the cytoskeleton and in the nucleus support the involvement of particular isotypes of this enzyme in signal transduction at multiple levels. PC 12 rat pheochromocytoma {{is one of the}} few cell lines expressing three immunologically distinct isoforms of PIC. We have analyzed the subcellular distribution of the PIC beta 1, gamma 1 and delta 1 isoforms using confocal and electron microscope immunocytochemistry. PIC beta 1 is mainly found in the nucleus and is associated with interchromatin domains. On the other hand, the PIC gamma 1 isoform is found in the nucleus and in the cytosol, while PIC delta 1 is exclusively cytoplasmic. Immunoblot and immunocytochemical experiments indicate that the various PIC isoforms are differently bound to structural cell compartments, such as cytoskeletal and nuclear matrix elements. In fact, PIC beta 1 and PIC gamma 1 isoforms are tightly associated with the nuclear matrix, while only about 50 % of PIC gamma 1 is associated with the cytoskeleton after DNase I and high <b>salt</b> <b>extractions.</b> PIC gamma 1 is almost completely soluble under these conditions. These results further confirm the complexity of the inositide signal transduction mechanism, which involves several PIC isoforms, specifically localized in different cell compartments and support the existence of a membrane-unrelated inositol lipid-dependent signalling in the nuclear interior...|$|R

40|$|When Mucor hiemalis NRRL 3103 {{was grown}} in soybean medium, {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the proteinase produced by the organism appeared in the culture filtrate, whereas the bulk of the enzyme was bound to the mycelial surface. Optimal pH of the proteinase ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 5. Inclusion of sodium chloride or other ionizable salts in the growth medium, however, resulted in the liberation from the mycelium of the loosely bound enzyme as it was formed. Maximal release of proteinase was achieved at a sodium chloride concentration of 0. 5 m. The loosely bound proteinase was eluted also from intact resting mycelium by ionizable salts but not by water or by nonionizable substances. The amount of enzyme eluted from the mycelium depended upon the concentration of sodium chloride up to 0. 3 m. Since liberation took place rapidly even at 0 C, a loose ionic linkage must exist rather than a biochemical binding of the enzyme to the mycelium. The recovery of proteolytic activity from repeated <b>salt</b> <b>extractions</b> was greater than that originally detected in the intact mycelium, possibly owing to unmasking of more active enzymes or functional groups. Further proteinase activity was released when salt-extracted mycelium was ruptured.

By using various methods to fractionate the microtubule preparation into subfractions (e. g., phosphocellulose chromatography to obtain purified 6 S tubulin and soluble microtubule-associated proteins, and gel exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel A- 150 m to obtain 10 -nm filaments), we found that all the fractions exhibited some enzymic activity, but {{that most of the}} phosphodiesterase activity was localized in the 10 -nm filament fraction. By using cyclic GMP as substrate, a specific activity of 921 ± 168 pmol/mg of filament protein·min was determined. Also, 10 -nm filaments were prepared directly from brain homogenates by differential centrifugation and gel exclusion chromatography. This fraction also contained phosphodiesterase activity but of slightly lower specific activity (752 ± 9 pmol/mg of protein·min). The filament-associated enzymic activity was stable during storage (- 70 °C) and to several <b>salt</b> <b>extractions</b> at moderate ionic strength (0. 5 M); the latter finding indicates that the phosphodiesterase is not adsorbed to the filaments via nonspecific electrostatic interactions. Although a chelating agent was present in the initial homogenization buffer and generally in all buffers used in preparing fractions, an activator of a smooth muscle phosphodiesterase was released upon boiling the 10 -nm filaments. This activator obtained in the boiled supernatant was Ca 2 +-sensitive, trifluoperazine-sensitive, and stimulated smooth muscle phosphodiesterase to nearly the same extent as purified (exogenous) CDR; thus, it probably represents filament-associated CDR...|$|R
