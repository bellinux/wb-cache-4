25|$|In {{choosing}} the best design for their carriers, the British {{had to consider}} {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of hangar design. There was a choice between open or closed hangar and the position of the armour. The placing of the strongest deck affected the strength of the hull. The further apart the deck and the keel, the stronger the design. If the flight deck was placed above the main deck then it had to be built to allow for movement with expansion sections. A closed hangar design was the strongest structurally and made for a lighter hull and the RN carried this concept one step further and designed the armoured flight deck to also act as the <b>strength</b> <b>deck</b> without any underlying plating, thus achieving an armoured flight deck on the lowest possible displacement.|$|E

500|$|One {{suggestion}} from C was to {{make the}} belt armor a load-bearing member by connecting plates end to end. This was found inordinately difficult to be practical and, while it would have added girder strength where most badly needed, was considered too radical a proposition to be truly safe. Another idea, subsequently adopted, was to design the forecastle to break abaft the turrets. The challenge then became to continue the longitudinal strength contributed by the armored deck past this point {{to the end of the}} stern. This became a difficult design problem, especially with the need to save weight wherever possible and the fact that light structural members combined with heavy armament weight had become a source of grief for the British. One proposed solution was to use a combination of three decks—a <b>strength</b> <b>deck</b> at the top of the hull, a protective deck which would rest atop the belt armor, [...] above the waterline, and a splinter deck below that, just above the waterline. [...] A third idea, also adopted, was to continue the longitudinal bulkhead between the protective and splinter decks down to the bottom of the ship to add strength. The severity of the strength and weight challenges necessitated a larger displacement of 33,000 tons and a hull of [...] instead of [...] to give enough internal volume to accommodate all the needed machinery. Even so, the size of the power plant meant pushing the main turrets further toward the ends of the ships, which increased hull stress. This was why the idea was adopted to place half the boilers above the armored deck.|$|E

These connections are sensitive to fatigue cracking due to high concentrated stress and residual stress at welded connections. In this paper practical fatigue failure cases at the welded connections, ease to occur fatigue cracking, are presented, and analyzed through a numerical modeling of orthotropic deck via FE (finite element) software. Furthermore, the improvement technologies of fatigue are also discussed. The results of the analysis can be contributed to the evaluation of the fatigue design for the orthotropic deck...|$|R

Some of the follow on classes to the Forrestals also had armoured flight decks although deck armour is of little to no use against modern anti-ship missiles, it may help limit the damage from flight deck explosions.

2500|$|The US {{carriers}} {{after the}} Lexington {{class and the}} earlier Japanese carriers had their armour placed at the hangar deck, essentially treating the hangar spaces and flight deck as superstructure – making these areas very vulnerable to the blast from GP bombs and other explosions, which in turn caused massive casualties in comparison to RN designs. A bomb that struck the flight deck would likely penetrate and explode in the hangar deck, but the armour there could still protect the ship's vitals – including the engine spaces and fuel storage. The flight deck could also possibly fuze light bombs prematurely, which would reduce the chance of them going through the hangar deck. Such a design allowed for larger, open-sided hangar bays (improving ventilation but making the ship very vulnerable to chemical weapon attack) and the installation of deck-edge elevators. USN carriers with hangar deck armour only, usually had wooden decking over thin mild steel flight decks which were easy to repair.

2500|$|The chief proponent {{for the new}} large carrier was Admiral Marc Mitscher. He {{wanted a}} carrier that {{would be able to}} handle the most {{effective}} weapons of the day.

These were faster, larger and significantly heavier than the aircraft the [...] and -class carriers were handling {{at the end of the}} Second World War. It was thought that the aircraft carried would have to have longer range to allow the carrier to operate farther away from the target. The deck would have to be able to handle the weight of the heavy jet aircraft landing on the deck. The overall implication was that the ship's <b>strength</b> <b>deck</b> would have to be the flight deck rather than the hangar deck, as had been the case for earlier U.S. carriers.

40|$|Researchers at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, {{and at the}} Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) have {{successfully}} enhanced the <b>strength</b> of <b>deck</b> slabs by further exploiting their arching action. With the help of tests on both large- and small-scale laboratory models, they have concluded that a deck slab supported by parallel longitudinal beams does not required any reinforcement, provided that the slab is suitably confined in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. In the longitudinal direction, the deck slab is confined by making it composite with the beams, and by edge beams with suitably high flexural rigidity in {{the plane of the}} slab. In the transverse direction, the confinement is provided by ensuring that the supports of the slab, i. e. the top flanges of the girders, are restrained effectively against relative lateral movement; such confinement can be provided, for example, by welding steel straps to the top flanges of the girders.

2500|$|Long also {{suspected}} that Titanics breakup {{may have begun}} with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated {{the loss of life}} by causing Titanic to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on Titanics younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of Britannics expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the Titanic. To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary Titanic's Achilles Heel, partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that Titanics expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the <b>strength</b> <b>deck</b> (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder.

2500|$|While {{flight deck}} level armour was {{eventually}} {{adopted by the}} Americans for the [...] design, the <b>strength</b> <b>deck</b> remained on the hangar level. Midway had originally been planned {{to have a very}} heavy gun armament (8-inch weapons). The removal of these weapons freed up enough tonnage to add [...] of armour at the flight deck level. While this made a great deal of sense from an air group perspective, the Midway ships sat very low in the water for carriers (due to their much greater displacement), certainly much lower than the smaller Essex-class carriers, and {{had a great deal of}} difficulty operating in heavy seas. [...] Flight deck armoured ships almost universally (except for the Midway class as completed) possessed a hurricane bow, where the bows were sealed up to the flight deck; wartime experience demonstrated that ships with the hurricane bow configuration (also including the American Lexington class) shipped less water than ships with an open bow. Late-life refits to Midway to bulge her hull and improve freeboard instead gave her a dangerously sharp roll, and made flight operations difficult even in moderate seas. This was therefore not repeated on Coral Sea (Franklin D. Roosevelt had been decommissioned years earlier). After the war, most of the Essex-class ships were modified with a hurricane bow and in the case of Oriskany the wooden flight deck surface was replaced with aluminium for improved resistance against the blast of jet engines, making them appear to have armoured flight decks, but in fact their armour remained at hangar level.|$|E

Therefore, a flexural theory was used and a punching shear model was modified to fully utilize the effect of strength enhancement by CMA.

This is of high significance because in The Netherlands about 70 bridges have to be investigated, with very thin decks cast between the flanges of long prestressed beams.
