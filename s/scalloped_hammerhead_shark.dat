40|$|Abstract Sharks and {{rays are}} highly {{sensitive}} to chemi-cal stimuli {{in their natural}} environment but several hypotheses predict that hammerhead sharks, with their expanded head and enlarged olfactory epithelium, have particularly acute olfactory systems. We used the electro-olfactogram (EOG) technique to compare the relative response of the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna lewini) olfactory epithelium to 20 proteinogenic amino acids and determine the sensitivity for 6 amino acids. At micromolar concentrations, cysteine evoked the greatest EOG response which was approximately {{twice as large as}} that of alanine. The weakest response was obtained for proline followed by aspartic acid and isoleucine. The olfactory epithelium showed adaptation to sequential stimulation, and recovery was related to the inter-stimulus time period. Estimated EOG response thresholds were in the sub-nanomolar range for both alanine (9. 2 9 10 - 11 M) and cysteine (8. 4 9 10 - 10 M) and in the micromolar range for proline and serine. These thresholds from 10 - 10 to 10 - 6 M for the <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> are compa-rable or lower than those reported for other teleost and elasmobranch species.

The knowledge about their reproductive biology in the area is nonexistent, despite their being listed worldwide as endangered by the IUCN. To determine the basic biology of reproduction in this shark would give important data to establish management or conservation plans for this species in Mexico. Samples were collected of 991 hammerhead sharks (342 females and 649 males), including juveniles (45 - to 160 -cm TL) and adults (170 - to 288 -cm TL), from September 2004 to June 2006. The sex ratio was 1 F: 2 M. The scalloped hammerhead was present year round in the study area with the greatest catch from May to July, the season when pregnant females were present. The females reached sexual maturity at 220 -cm LT based on characteristics and measurements of reproductive organs. A histological analysis showed that testes in males are a diametric type and have a compound spermatozeugmata in the seminal vesicle, indicating sexual maturity in males at 180 -cm LT. We recorded 40 pregnant females, with 14 to 40 embryos per female. The births occurred in July and August with a embryo size between 41 - and 51 -cm LT.

In this context, we undertook a multi-year fisheries-independent survey of shark occurrence along a 400 -km stretch of tropical coastline. Logistic regression was used to identify spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variations in the occurrence of neonate and young-of-the-year (YOY) blacktip Carcharhinus limbatus/Carcharhinus tilstoni, pigeye Carcharhinus amboinensis, <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> Sphyrna lewini and spot-tail Carcharhinus sorrah sharks.

30|$|Recently, animal-borne accelerometers {{have been}} used to record the pitch angle of aquatic animals during swimming.

In this study, we attached accelerometers to 17 free-ranging <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna lewini) pups from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Although there are methods to calibrate attachment angles of accelerometers, we confirmed that previous methods were not applicable for hammerhead pups. According to raw data, some sharks ascended with a negative angle, which differs from tank observations of captive sharks.

30|$|An {{accurate}} {{determination of}} pitch angle {{is critical to}} gain detailed information about the diving and foraging strategies of aquatic animals. For example, air-breathing aquatic animals that forage underwater control pitch angle and allocate their submerged time. In African penguins, steeper ascent angles presumably occur when they have depleted their oxygen stores and must return to the surface more quickly to breathe [1]. In macaroni penguins, pitch angle is significantly correlated with time spent at the bottom-phase of the dive [2]. A steep pitch angle during ascent indicates that they encountered a prey patch and a shallow pitch angle contributes to movement into a more profitable area in the following dive, due to increasing the horizontal distance [2]. While in fish, Nakaya [3] said that <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> (Sphyrna lewini) have great maneuverability due to a movable large plate on head. Based on the observation of swimming behavior, {{it is apparent that}} sharks make a sharp dorsal turn at the bottom, consume food items, and swim away along the bottom [3].

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} adaptive significance of the sphyrnid cephalo-foil, including potential advantages of spacing the olfac-tory organs at the distal tips of the broad surface. We employed comparative morphology to test whether the sphyrnid cephalofoil provides better stereo-olfaction, in-creases olfactory acuity, and samples a greater volume of the medium compared {{to the situation in}} carcharhiniform sharks. The broadly spaced nares provide sphyrnid spe-cies with a significantly greater separation between the olfactory rosettes, which could lead to an enhanced ability to resolve odor gradients. In addition, most sphyrnid spe-cies possess prenarial grooves that greatly increase the volume of water sampled by the nares and thus increase the probability of odorant encounter. However, despite a much greater head width, and a significantly greater number of olfactory lamellae, <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> do not possess a greater amount of olfactory epi-thelial surface area than the carcharhiniform sandbar sharks. Therefore, sphyrnid sharks might not possess any greater olfactory acuity than carcharhinids. Despite this, there are clear olfactory advantages to the cephalofoil head morphology that could have led to its evolution, persistence, and diversification. J. Morphol. 264 : 253 – 263...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{drivers of}} reef shark demography across {{a large and}} isolated marine protected area, the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Reserve, using stereo baited remote underwater video systems. We modelled shark abundance against biotic and abiotic variables at 35 sites across the reserve {{and found that the}} biomass of low trophic order fish (specifically planktivores) had the greatest effect on shark abundance, although models also included habitat variables (depth, coral cover and site type). There was significant variation in the composition of the shark assemblage at different atolls within the reserve. In particular, the deepest habitat sampled (a seamount at 70 - 80 m visited {{for the first time in}} this study) recorded large numbers of <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> (Sphyrna lewini) not observed elsewhere. Size structure of the most abundant and common species, grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), varied with location. Individuals at an isolated bank were 30 % smaller than those at the main atolls, with size structure significantly biased towards the size range for young of year (YOY). The 18 individuals judged to be YOY represented the offspring of between four and six females, so, whilst inconclusive, these data suggest the possible use of a common pupping site by grey reef sharks. The importance of low trophic order fish biomass (i. e. potential prey) in predicting spatial variation in shark abundance is consistent with other studies both in marine and terrestrial systems which suggest that prey availability may be a more important predictor of predator distribution than habitat suitability. This result supports the need for ecosystem level rather than species-specific conservation measures to support shark recovery. The observed spatial partitioning amongst sites for species and life-stages also implies the need to include a diversity of habitats and reef types within a protected area for adequate protection of reef-associated shark assemblages...|$|R

Life history characteristics, diet, nursery habitat use and {{metabolic}} {{rates of}} brown stingrays, Dasyatis lata, were evaluated {{to determine their}} ecological impacts in Kāne'ohe Bay, Oahu, through a bioenergetics model. The maximum age based on analysis of vertebral samples (28 years) was among the oldest for any dasyatid aged to date. Edge and marginal increment analyses, as well as recapture of two stingrays previously marked with oxytetracycline, verified deposition of a single growth band per year. Growth characteristics varied between sexes, with females attaining larger sizes and exhibiting lower growth coefficients. Brown stingray life history characteristics are similar to other elasmobranchs {{in that they are}} long lived, grow slowly and mature at a late age. Stomach content, bulk and amino acid stable isotope analyses were used to assess the diet and habitat use of juvenile brown stingrays in Kāne'ohe Bay. A shift in stingray diet and an increase in relative trophic position were apparent with increasing size. Results indicate stingrays foraged within their Kāne'ohe Bay nursery for the majority of their juvenile lives before shifting to offshore habitats with the onset of sexual maturity. Underestimates of trophic position from amino acid analyses suggest that urea retention in elasmobranchs may have important implications for estimates of absolute trophic position determined using this method. Potential prey resources were portioned between stingrays and sympatric juvenile <b>scalloped</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks,</b> Sphyrna lewini. Standard metabolic rates were estimated for juvenile brown stingrays through respirometry. Temperature and mass had significant effects on metabolic rates. The energy budget of juvenile stingrays was heavily weighted towards metabolism, which accounted for 68 % of total consumed energy. A large metabolic demand coupled with very slow growth indicated potential limitation of food resources. Daily rations estimated from the bioenergetics model declined from a high of 2. 72 %BW/d to 1. 23 %BW/d with age. Results suggest the potential for strong top-down effects on prey populations due to stingray predation. Use of Kāne'ohe Bay as a nursery habitat for brown stingrays appears to be a trade-off between increased juvenile survival and a late age at first maturity due to slow growth rates...|$|R
