40|$|Com o propósito de avaliar a colhedora Penha CLM- 350, visando fornecer subsídios aos projetos e usuários, realizou-se o presente trabalho, onde foi estudada a eficácia do sistema espigador, determinando-se a porcentagem de milho colhido para os diversos tratamentos estudados. Definiu-se um parâmetro adimensional U, que é a relação entre a velocidade periférica dos roletes e a velocidade de deslocamento da colhedora. Procurou-se relacionar as diversos tratamentos U, com os valores percentuais de grãos de milho colhidos e perdidos no solo. Os resultados foram estudados através da análise de variância, empregando-se o teste F, aos níveis de 1 % e 5 % de probabilidade e o teste Tukey para a comparação estatística entre as médias. This {{work was}} {{designed}} {{with the aim}} of evaluating the performance of the Penha CLM- 350 corn combine, to furnish data to designers and users. The efficiency of the ear picking system was studied, and the percentage of the harvested corn was determined for the various treatments considered. A dimensionless U parameter was defined as the ratio between the peripheral speed of the <b>snapping</b> <b>rolls</b> and the speed of the harvester. The U terms were related to the percentages of corn harvested and corn lost on the ground. The analysis of variance with the F test at 1 % and 5 % probability levels was utilized to analyse the data, and Tukey's test was utilized for comparison between means. The statistical analysis showed that the treatment were not significant for the percentage of harvested corn, the efficiency maintained above 84, 42 % for the test conditions. For the conditions tested the values were limited by mechanical characteristics of the combine, particularly the transmission ratio. This suggests the design of a mechanism, which should provide the possibility of changing the transmission ratio from the tractor power take-off to the <b>snapping</b> <b>rolls.</b> This would provide a wider range of variation for U and could provide a mathematical relationship with efficiency...|$|E

40|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>roll</b> is a {{phenomenon}} which has plagued the sub-marine designer {{since the advent of}} the high speed submarine A description of <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> and its possible causes is pre-sented in this thesis. A computer program is developed which simulates a submarine in surge, sway, yaw and roll. It is verified that <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> is very sensitive to the metacentric height. Additionally, it is seen that reducing the sail size does not have as large an effect on reducing the roll angle as anticipated. Rudder sequencing and speed reduction are two other methods examined. The results of the four investigations are presented in graphic form. The conclusions include a justification {{for the use of the}} simulation computer model as a design tool...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The use of differentially deflected fairwater planes to control submarine rolling is studied. Because of coupling between pitch and <b>roll</b> angles, the <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> {{that occurs in}} a high speed hard turn affects the stability of a submarine {{not only in the}} horizontal plane but also in the vertical plane. Direct roll control was achieved by making use of the fairwater planes in a differentially deflected mode such that they could give counter moment to reduce the <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> A roll controller was designed as a position and velocity feedback controller. Controlled roll angle improved the depth and pitch stability of submarine. [URL] Turkish Nav...|$|R
2500|$|Spin testing entered from level flight, <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> {{and turning}} stalls {{failed to produce}} a spin {{condition}} as the WT-11 just mushed to level flight. These tests resulted in the company billing the aircraft as [...] "Won't Spin".|$|R

50|$|The <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> is an {{aggressive}} roll. The aircraft rotates about all axes {{at the same}} time, the predominant rotation being about the longitudinal axis. This sometimes violent maneuver is accomplished one of two ways. A positive, or inside, snap is executed by going hard over on all controls: full aileron, full rudder, and full up elevator. A negative, or outside, snap, is executed differently: full aileron, full opposite rudder, full down elevator.|$|R
50|$|While a grain {{platform}} can be {{used for}} corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row.|$|R

Type approved in 1977 and produced as 1978 to 1985 model years. The following aerobatic maneuvers are approved: chandelles, steep turns, barrel <b>rolls,</b> <b>snap</b> <b>rolls,</b> loops, vertical reversements, lazy eights, spins, aileron rolls, Immelmann turns, Cuban Eights and stalls (except whip stalls).|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} Yak-5 first flew on 7 September 1944. The new fighter-trainer's handling proved {{popular with}} its test pilots, and the aircraft successfully passed official evaluation. In the end, neither the UT-2L or the Yak-5 entered production because the Soviet Air Force command believed wooden aircraft were becoming obsolete, which {{would result in}} production of the all-metal Yakovlev Yak-18 trainer in late 1945. The sole Yak-5 was destroyed when it suffered failure of the wooden wing during a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> and crashed.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these modifications, the P-51Bs and P-51Cs, and {{the newer}} P-51Ds and P-51Ks, {{experienced}} low-speed handling problems {{that could result}} in an involuntary [...] "snap-roll" [...] under certain conditions of air speed, angle of attack, gross weight, and center of gravity. Several crash reports tell of P-51Bs and P-51Cs crashing because horizontal stabilizers were torn off during maneuvering. As a result of these problems, a modification kit consisting of a dorsal fin was manufactured. One report stated:"Unless a dorsal fin is installed on the P-51B, P-51C and P-51D airplanes, a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> may result when attempting a slow roll. The horizontal stabilizer will not withstand the effects of a <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> To prevent recurrence, the stabilizer should be reinforced in accordance with T.O. 01-60J-18 dated 8 April 1944 and a dorsal fin should be installed. Dorsal fin kits are being made available to overseas activities"The dorsal fin kits became available in August 1944, and available as retrofits for P-51Bs and P-51Cs (but rarely used on the [...] "razorback" [...] -B and -C Mustangs), and to early P-51Ds and P-51Ks that had not already been built with them. Also incorporated was a change to the rudder trim tabs, which would help prevent the pilot over-controlling the aircraft and creating heavy loads on the tail unit.|$|R

50|$|The {{remaining}} F-105 {{found himself}} in the sights of another MiG-17 who he could not shake. In desperation, he tried a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> which slowed his plane so that the MiG-17 over-shot him, as his captain had recommended. Finding himself on the MiG's tail, he was too surprised to attempt to shoot down the MiG with his gun. The fortunate pilot was briefed the day before about this maneuver by Captain John Boyd from Nellis Air Force Base, who would later become a significant voice in the design of America's fighter aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The 'Skyote' is a {{conventional}} open-cockpit biplane design, with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The wings are slightly swept for center-of-gravity and lateral stability reasons {{and to improve}} performance in <b>snap</b> <b>rolls.</b> The equal-span, staggered wings are braced together with conventional struts and wires that form a single bay. Neither the upper nor lower wings have any dihedral, and ailerons are fitted to all four wings. The fuselage is built from welded steel tubing with wooden stringers and formers to give it shape, the wing structure is aluminum, and the entire aircraft is covered in fabric.|$|R
50|$|Before about World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand (as {{it still}} is {{in most of the}} other countries where it is grown). This often involved large numbers of workers and associated social events. Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use but the corn combine was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested which then requires a separate operation of a corn sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of corn were often stored in corn cribs and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of corn is too large to pass through a slit in a plate and the <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> pull the ear of corn from the stalk so that only the ear and husk enter the machinery. The combine separates the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|R

According to witnesses, having completed a vertical climb, she had pushed the nose {{over at the}} top in order to descend vertically. She then performed a one and one-quarter <b>snap</b> <b>roll.</b> The objective was to stop rotation after the aircraft has rolled one and one-quarter times, but rotation in this case only slowed, continuing to the ground.

2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the <b>snap</b> <b>rolls</b> pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|R
5000|$|Intention: tumble the {{airplane}} continuously with each tumble's plane turned {{relative to the}} previous one. Enter from a near vertical climb then let the airspeed decay to near zero and initiate a <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> by using full down elevator and, for a clockwise rotating engine, full left rudder. The aircraft will rotate on all three axes and perform three end-over-end negative [...] "g" [...] tumbles, each tumble being at about 45° to {{the plane of the}} last. The maneuver ends when the aircraft runs out of momentum and begins falling with enough speed for the airflow past the control surfaces to stop the tumbling. Neutralising the controls then causes the aircraft to recover nose down.|$|R
500|$|Mayer's {{final score}} stood at 102 {{when he was}} shot down and killed in action by a P-47 Thunderbolt near Montmédy on 2 March 1944.

50|$|Stroud co-starred in Roger Corman’s film Von Richthofen and Brown (1971). Stroud played Roy Brown {{opposite}} John Phillip Law’s Baron von Richthofen. Corman used Lynn Garrison's Irish aviation facility. Garrison taught Stroud the {{rudiments of}} flying {{so that he could}} manage to take off and land the aircraft, making some of the footage more realistic. On September 16, 1970, during a low-level sequence flying a two-seat SV4C Stampe biplane across Lake Weston, a large bird flew through the propeller’s arc, striking Garrison in the face, knocking him unconscious. The aircraft flew into five powerlines, <b>snap</b> <b>rolled</b> and plunged into the lake inverted. Garrison and Stroud were rescued some time later. Stroud was unhurt.

On Boise State's drive, the Broncos came down to 4th and 2 on the Sooners' 5yard line and decided to run their second trick play, a wide receiver rollout option from {{a variant of the}} Wildcat offense. Zabransky ran in motion to his left while backup wide receiver Vinny Perretta, lined up as a running back, took the <b>snap,</b> <b>rolled</b> to his right, then threw a touchdown pass to tight end Derek Schouman, who had lined up as a wide receiver, to bring Boise State within one point at 42–41.|$|R
50|$|As Sugimoto {{approached}} Weaver from behind, Weaver radioed he {{was attacked}} and cut {{inside of the}} turn to present a more difficult shot. McGuire eased up on his turn rate {{in an effort to}} draw the attacker off of his wingman and onto himself. Sugimoto took the bait and switched his attack to McGuire. As Sugimoto approached from behind, McGuire rapidly increased his turn rate. This extremely dangerous maneuver, performed at an altitude of only 300 ft (contrary to McGuire's own dictates never to engage at a low altitude), caused McGuire's P-38 to stall. It <b>snap</b> <b>rolled</b> inverted and nosed down into the ground. Despite the low altitude, McGuire nearly pulled out successfully; had he jettisoned his drop tanks {{at the start of the}} dogfight, he might have managed it. McGuire was killed on impact.|$|R
50|$|On 15 September 1970, Charles Boddington, {{a veteran}} of both The Blue Max and Darling Lili, was killed when his S.E.5 spun in during a {{low-level}} manoeuvre over the airfield.

The aircraft then ran through five powerlines, <b>snap</b> <b>rolled</b> and plunged into the River Liffey inverted. Garrison and Stroud were rescued from the water. Stroud was uninjured, but Garrison required 60 stitches to close a head wound. Both incidents occurring in such a short period resulted in Irish authorities grounding the production.

50|$|The {{instruction}} {{given at}} the CPSs was an adaptation of the primary phase formerly taught at Randolph Field. Each student in primary was required to make at least 175 landings. As {{given at the}} height of the effort, primary flying training was divided into four standard phases. In the pre-solo phase students became familiar with the general operation of a light aircraft. In the second, or intermediate phase, pre-solo work was reviewed, and precision of control was developed. The third, or accuracy, phase demanded high proficiency in various types of landing approaches and landings, and the fourth, or acrobatic, phase required ability to perform loops, Immelmann turns, slow <b>rolls,</b> half-rolls, and <b>snap</b> <b>rolls.</b> In 1944, after the training demand had peaked, the course length was increased back to ten weeks.|$|R
5000|$|Variations {{include the}} Half Cuban Eight and Reverse Half Cuban Eight, {{intended}} as directional changes {{and which are}} listed below.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the steady and unsteady aerodynamics {{of the space shuttle}} orbiter has been performed. It is shown that slender wing theory can be modified to account for the effect of Mach number and leading edge roundness on both attached and separated flow loads. The orbiter unsteady aerodynamics can be computed by defining two equivalent slender wings, one for attached flow loads and another for the vortex-induced loads. It is found that the orbiter is in the transonic speed region subject to vortex-shock-boundary layer interactions that cause highly nonlinear or discontinuous load changes which can endanger the structural integrity of the orbiter wing and possibly cause <b>snap</b> <b>roll</b> problems. It is presently impossible to simulate these interactions in a wind tunnel test even in the static case. Thus, a well planned combined analytic and experimental approach is needed to solve the problem...|$|R
