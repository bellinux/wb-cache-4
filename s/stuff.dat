5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through <b>stuff.</b> I mean the <b>stuff</b> they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal <b>stuff,</b> a lot of family <b>stuff</b> this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} ancient Roman, as well as medieval, cooked <b>stuffed</b> animals with other animals.

50|$|Almost {{anything}} {{can serve as}} a <b>stuffing.</b> Many popular Anglo-American stuffings contain bread or cereals, usually together with vegetables, herbs and spices, and eggs. Middle Eastern vegetable stuffings may be based on seasoned rice, on minced meat, or a combination thereof. Other stuffings may contain only vegetables and herbs. Some types of <b>stuffing</b> contain sausage meat, or forcemeat, while vegetarian stuffings sometimes contain tofu. Roast pork is often accompanied by sage and onion <b>stuffing</b> in England; roast poultry in a Christmas dinner may be <b>stuffed</b> with sweet chestnuts. Oysters are used in one traditional <b>stuffing</b> for Thanksgiving. These may also be combined with mashed potatoes, for a heavy <b>stuffing.</b> Fruits and dried fruits can be added to <b>stuffing</b> including apples, apricots, dried prunes, and raisins. In England, a <b>stuffing</b> is sometimes made of minced pork shoulder seasoned with various ingredients, sage, onion, bread, chestnuts, dried apricots, dried cranberries etc. The <b>stuffing</b> mixture may be cooked separately and served as a side dish. This may still be called <b>stuffing</b> or it may be called dressing.|$|R

5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying <b>stuff</b> {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that <b>stuff</b> doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{an effort}} to find a lighter shield, the wood <b>stuffed</b> shield was {{proposed}} in this paper based on the wood properties such as low density, low cost, high yield strength when the strain rate is high. Hypervelocity impact tests (Ф= 5. 5 mm, V= 4. 79 km/s∼ 4. 96 km/s) were carried out to compare the shielding capabilities of the pinewood <b>stuffed</b> shield, aluminum triple-wall shield and Nextel/Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield with the same areal density. It was found in all the tests that a perforation with diameter of 2. 0 mm was formed in the rear plate of the aluminum triple-wall shield. No perforation but slight deformation was found in the rear plates of both pinewood <b>stuffed</b> shield and Nextel /Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield. The height of the deformation on the rear plates of the pinewood <b>stuffed</b> shield was 1. 99 mmm, and that on the Nextel/Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield was 2. 01 mm. Results show that, with the same areal density, the shielding capability of the wood <b>stuffed</b> shield is greater than that of the aluminum triple-wall shield and {{is similar to that of}} Nextel /Kevlar fabric <b>stuffed</b> shield which is widely used on the spacecraft. To explore the reason why the shielding capability of the wood <b>stuffed</b> shield is prominent, the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulation on the glass-epoxy <b>stuffed</b> shield was carried out...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi <b>Stuff</b> {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E

It's all feeble <b>stuff</b> but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E
