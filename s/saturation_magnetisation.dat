Like conventional metamaterials, their properties arise from geometrical structuring, {{rather than their}} bandstructure or composition directly. Small spatial inhomogeneities create an effective macroscopic behaviour, leading to properties not readily found in nature. By alternating parameters such as the relative permeability or <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation,</b> there exists the possibility to tailor 'magnonic' bandgaps in the material. By tuning {{the size of this}} bandgap, only spin wave modes able to cross the bandgap would be able to propagate through the media, leading to selective propagation of certain spin wave frequencies.|$|E

A composition dependent magnetic compensation behaviour points to the role conversions of the magnetic constituents. In this work, we have investigated the thermodynamics of cation disorder in Co(Cr_ 1 -xMn_x) _ 2 O_ 4 system and it's consequences on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties, using results from first-principles electronic structure calculations. We have computed the variations in the cation-disorder {{as a function of}} Mn concentration and the temperature and found that at the annealing temperature of the experiment many of the systems exhibit cation disorder. Our results support the interpretations of the experimental results regarding the qualitative variations in the sub-lattice occupancies and the associated magnetisation behaviour, with composition. We have analysed the variations in structural, magnetic and electronic properties of this system with variations in the compositions and the degree of cation disorder from the variations in their electronic structures and by using the ideas from crystal field theory. Our study provides a complete microscopic picture of the effects that are responsible for composition dependent behavioural differences of the properties of this system. This work lays down a general framework, based upon results from first-principles calculations, to understand and analyse the substitutional magnetic spinel oxides A(B_ 1 -xC_x) _ 2 O_ 4 in presence of cation disorder.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a process for the continuous removal of heavy metals from waste water using magnetic separators. Investigations concerning the formation of magnetite (Fe_ 3 O_ 4) and heavy-metal ferrites (MFe_ 2 O_ 4) were carried out. By the addition of these mostly ferri- or ferromagnetic substances, the magnetic properties of mixed precipitation products can be improved such that satisfactory separation efficiencies can be achieved even at moderate flux densities. When selecting the reaction temperature, ion concentrations and oxidation conditions, particular attention was paid to them being practicable in waste water treatment. The reaction variants which were applied included (1) the oxidation of an iron(II) -hydroxide suspension with air ('oxidation method') and (2) the hydroxide precipitation of iron(II) and iron(III) salt solutions ('mixing method'). The solids generated were characterised using various solid-state analytical methods and investigated with regard to their magnetic properties. Depending on the reaction conditions chosen, the precipitates were varying mixtures of the following solids: magnetite, maghemite, geothite, #delta#-FeOOH and amorphous iron(III) -oxide hydrates mostly containing sulphate. With up to about 1 mg L"-" 1 min"-" 1 oxygen being supplied to the reactor ('oxidation method'), magnetite was seen to be formed sufficiently at temperatures equal to and above 15 C. Using the 'mixing method' this was already achieved at a temperature of 5 C. Increasing concentrations of heavy-metal ions (e. g. Cu" 2 "+, Cd" 2 "+, Zn" 2 "+) or certain anions (e. g. of phosphoric or carbonic acid) lead to a reduction in the ferrite proportion of the reaction products. The <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisations</b> of the precipitates achieved under suitable reaction conditions (60 - 80 A m" 2 kg"-" 1) are totally sufficient for the panned use. The results were confirmed in a technical-scale facility with a continuously operating packed bubble column for the generation of the magnetite suspension and a magnetic separator operated continuously in accordance with the magnetic barrier principle.

Thermomagnetic analysis was carried-out using laboratory device that allows automatic registration of sample magnetization with the temperature (the rate of sample heating/cooling was 65 - 80 °/min). The reduction reaction of synthetic goethite for all carbohydrates {{starts at the}} temperature of 250 °C while reduction of goethite ore for all carbohydrates starts at the temperature of 450 °C. We could relate this increasing of reduction start temperature with shielding effect of admixtures in the ore.

30|$|Fe 3 O 4 -PNIPAAm- 1 showed highest thermal {{nanocomposite}} stability, {{along with}} the lowest weight lost. Up to 200  °C, {{the main source of}} weight loss was through loss of water and physical adsorption of the polymer layer [22]; above 200  °C, however, losses were mainly due to decomposition of the chemical layer bonding the PNIPAAm. The sample residue, which became stable above 400  °C, represented 87 % of the original weight, which corresponds with the amount of magnetic nanoparticles in the nanocomposite. One aim of this preparation process was to produce a nanocomposite with magnetic properties preventing aggregation and enabling it to re-disperse rapidly as soon as the magnetic field is turned off. Such properties would allow its use in a range of different fields, including hyperthermic treatment of tumours, as contrasting agents in magnetic resonance imaging, in tissue repair, biomedical device coating, immunoassay, cell separation and biomagnetic separation of biomolecules [18, 23 – 26]. We tested our nanomaterials through <b>magnetisation</b> <b>saturation,</b> which assesses the maximum possible magnetisation of the substance beyond which no further change takes place despite an increase in the magnetic field. Our results showed Fe 3 O 4 -PNIPAAm- 2 to have the highest <b>magnetisation</b> <b>saturation</b> level of the three nanocomposites tested. Our values were lower (53.7  emu/g) than those previously reported for uncoated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (92  emu/g) [27], however, presumably due to surface order/disorder interactions in the magnetic spin moment and an increase in nanocomposite weight and volume due to the presence of the PNIPAAm polymer layer.|$|R

At room temperature, Fe 3 O 4 -PNIPAAm- 3 displayed highest <b>magnetisation</b> <b>saturation.</b> Presence of Fe 3 O 4 -PNIPAAm nanocomposites at both {{low and high}} concentrations caused significant damage to both E. coli and S. aureus DNA, even after short exposure, {{and led to a}} decrease in cell viability.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with solution-phase synthesis of nanoparticles and growth of nanoparticles in solution. A facile synthesis route was developed to produce nanoparticles of iron, iron carbide and ruthenium. In general, the synthesis involved the reaction/decomposition of a metal precursor in solution, {{in the presence of}} a stabilising agent, in a closed reaction vessel, under a hydrogen atmosphere. The crystallinity, crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of the nanoparticles obtained were studied primarily by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Scanning quantum interference device magnetometry (SQUID) was used to characterise the magnetic properties of iron and iron carbide nanoparticles. In situ synchrotron-based XRD was employed to investigate the growth of platinum nanoparticles of different morphologies. The synthesis of iron and iron carbide nanoparticles was investigated at temperatures 80 - 160 °C. Syntheses at 130 °C and above produced mainly single-crystal α-Fe nanoparticles, whereas those at lower temperatures yielded products consisting of α-Fe and Fe₃C nanoparticles. Nanoparticles of larger than 10 nm oxidised on the surface leading to core/shell structures, and those of smaller size oxidised completely upon exposure to air. Core/shell nanoparticles of larger than 15 nm were observed to be stable under ambient conditions for at least a year, whereas those smaller in size underwent further oxidation forming core/void/shell structures. The magnetic properties of selected samples were characterised. The core/shell nanoparticles were shown to exhibit ferromagnetic behaviours, and <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisations</b> were obtained at the range of 100 - 130 emu g⁻¹. Nanoparticle size and size distribution, and morphology were found to be a result of combined effect of precursor concentration and the relative stabiliser concentration. In general, high-precursor concentration resulted in less controlled reaction and produced large nanoparticle size and size distribution. Under the high-concentration condition, the use of stabilisers in reduced amount then led to a diverse range of morphologies, which include dimer, porous and branched structures. As for the synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles, reactions of different precursors were investigated at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 140 °C. Highly crystalline ruthenium nanoparticles of different sizes and morphologies were obtained through different experimental conditions. The increase in nanoparticle size was found to be a result of increasing reaction temperature and/or decreasing stabiliser to ruthenium ratio. This trend was observed to be independent of the type of stabilisers and precursors used. The use of stabilisers with different binding characteristics has facilitated the formation of non-spherical nanoparticles; these include rod-like structures with high aspect ratios (of up to 12), hexagonal and truncated triangular plate-like structures, and tripods. The growth of faceted and branched structures of platinum nanoparticles was investigated by employing in situ XRD techniques. TEM was used to examine the intermediate structures. The two different morphologies were previously shown to be governed by precursor concentration. It was found that the growth in the low-concentration reaction was characteristic of a thermodynamically controlled regime, whereas that in the high-concentration reaction occurred at much greater rates under a kinetically controlled regime. Based on the observations obtained, different growth mechanisms were proposed and discussed. The former involved an oriented attachment mechanism, while the latter, a novel mechanism involving selective growth and etching processes. The results are followed by an overall discussion comparing and contrasting the various syntheses involved, and relating the results of syntheses to those of the growth studies...|$|R

On this basis, the thickness and deposition rates of Ta could also be monitored by adjusting the values of the density and the Z-factor for Ta in the deposition controller.|$|E

The maximum rotation frequency of the largest microfabricated elements agrees within error boundaries with theory. For smaller, and especially thinner, elements the measured frequencies are a factor of three to four too low. We suspect this is caused by incomplete <b>saturation</b> of the <b>magnetisation</b> in the elements, which is not incorporated in our model.

40|$|Fine {{particle}} magnetism {{is employed}} {{in a wide}} range of applications ranging from magnetic data recording to cancer therapies. Characterisation of nanoparticles is important for improving their applicability. This is a complex task, especially if magnetostatic interactions are to be considered. Here we have developed a methodology to investigate the inverse problem, which consists of extracting the magnetic properties such as anisotropy, size or <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation</b> from experimental magnetisation curves. For each set of magnetic properties a magnetisation curve can always be obtained, but from a magnetisation curve the parameters cannot always be uniquely determined. If interactions are significant the issue becomes complicated and the question of whether the parameters can be uniquely identified arises. To study this we simulated the magnetic behaviour of interacting nanoparticles with Monte-Carlo techniques and applied two different methods for studying the inverse problem. This allows to show that a unique extraction of model parameters is indeed possible only in a certain range of magnetic nanoparticle concentrations and temperatures. Using simulations we investigated the inverse problem for two parameters, anisotropy and <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation,</b> at different temperatures. At low temperature both parameters can be well determined, but the errors and the parameters correlation is dependent on the strength of the magnetostatic interaction. In the high temperature case, due to superparamagnetic behaviour, only the <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation</b> can obtain using the inverse problem approach. The methodology was also tested for a set of experimental measurements done on magnetite nanoparticles. ...|$|E

We compared leaf SIRM between land use classes with different urban habitat quality. In a multiple regression model, we tried to explain the spatial variability in the leaf SIRM by tree species, sampling height, distance to the nearest road and its traffic intensity, tram frequency and a measure for regional traffic emissions (derived from traffic intensity of and the distance to the most important highways around the city in the main four wind directions). We found that the leaf SIRM was significantly influenced by tree species, distance to the nearest road and its traffic intensity and tram frequency. The SIRM significantly increased with increasing traffic intensity and tram frequency and by decreasing distance to the nearest road.

Mineral magnetic investigations indicate uniform magnetic properties with magnetic mineralogy dominated by single and pseudo single domain magnetite and only small {{variations in the}} concentration of magnetic minerals, which makes them interesting targets for reconstructing relative palaeointensity. Three estimates of relative palaeointensity were obtained by normalising the natural remanent magnetisation after 30 mT alternating field (AF) demagnetisation (NRM 30 mT) by 1) lowfield magnetic susceptibility, 2) anhysteretic remanent magnetisation after 30 mT AF demagnetisation and 3) <b>saturation</b> isothermal remanent <b>magnetisation</b> imprinted at 1000 mT (SIRM 1000 mT). Comparison of the palaeointensity estimates with relative mean x-ray density reflecting variations in sediment composition, suggested the normalised records were carrying an environmental imprint, which contaminated especially the centennial features. This interpretation was confirmed by coherence analyses, which also indicated that NRM 30 mT/SIRM 1000 mT from Lake Lehmilampi was the most efficiently normalised. Despite the inevitable environmental imprint, relative palaeointensity record NRM 30 mT/SIRM 1000 mT from Lake Lehmilampi shows similar millennial features in comparison with relative palaeointensity reconstructions from other lakes in the area, archaeomagnetic records and CALS 7 K geomagnetic field model...|$|R
30|$|We {{measured}} the magnetic hysteresis loops {{of the resulting}} Co/Ta/Co trilayers, {{where one of the}} Co layers was 4 -nm-thick and obliquely deposited at 54 ° and the other layer was also 4 -nm-thick but normally deposited. These results are presented in Figures 2 and 3. Because the 6 -nm-thick Ta spacer layer prevented direct exchange coupling between the magnetic layers, the resulting Co 4 nm- 54 °/Ta/Co 4 nm- 0 ° trilayer behaved like the superposition of each of the individual Co layers, without averaging the magnetic properties in this case. Therefore, the hysteresis loops of the Co 4 nm- 54 °/Ta/Co 4 nm- 0 ° trilayer along the easy magnetisation axis revealed the existence of two nucleation fields that correspond to each of the Co layers (Figure 2 d). However, when the magnetic field was applied along the hard magnetisation axis (of the obliquely deposited Co layer), an initial increase in the magnetisation at a relatively low applied magnetic field was observed. Furthermore, this abrupt increase was followed by a progressive increase of the magnetisation as the value of the applied magnetic field was increased to 56 kA/m, at which the <b>saturation</b> of the <b>magnetisation</b> was reached (Figure 3 d). This behaviour reinforced the fact that the Ta spacer layer magnetically uncoupled, in this case, the obliquely and the normally deposited Co layers. Some schematic drawings of the normal and obliquely deposited layers and the magnetically coupled and uncoupled multilayers are shown in Figure 2.|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy images revealed a faceted and irregular morphology for the as-synthesised nanoparticles. Magnetic measurements revealed a ferromagnetic nature for the 14 and 9 nm particles and a superparamagnetic nature for the 6 nm particles. An increase in <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation</b> with increasing particle size was noted. Relaxivity measurements were carried out to determine T- 2 value {{as a function of}} particle size using nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The relaxivity coefficient increased with decrease in particle size and decrease in the <b>saturation</b> <b>magnetisation</b> value. The observed trend in the change of relaxivity value with particle size was attributed to the faceted nature of as-synthesised nanoparticles. Faceted morphology results in the creation of high gradient of magnetic field in the regions adjacent to the facet edges increasing the relaxivity value. The effect of edges in increasing the relaxivity value increases with decrease in the particle size because of an increase in the total number of edges per particle dispersion...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} are {{of great}} importance particularly {{in the field of}} biomedicine as well as nanotechnology and nano materials science and technology. Here, we synthesise magnetic alloy-filling carbon nanoparticles (MA@C NPs) via the following two-step procedure; (1) Irradiation of a laser beam of 266 nm wavelength into super-critical benzene, in which both ferrocene and cobaltocene are dissolved, at 290 °C; and (2) annealing of the particles at 600 and 800 °C. We find that the core particles are composed of cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O) and covered with carbon layers. The structure of the core particles as-synthesised, and annealed at 600 and 800 °C, is, respectively, amorphous, CoFe 2 O 4 and FeCo. We also investigate the viability of L 929 cells in the presence of MA@C NPs and find that there is no serious advert effect of the MA@C NPs on the cell viability thanks to the carbon layers covering the core particles. The magnetic properties are well characterised. The <b>saturation</b> and remnant <b>magnetisation</b> and coercivity increase and as a result, the hyperthermic efficiency becomes higher with an increase in the annealing temperature. The further modification of the surface of the present particles with several functional molecules becomes easier due to the carbon layers, which makes the present particles more valuable. It is therefore supposed that the presently synthesised MA@C NPs may well be utilised for nanotechnology-based biomedical engineering; e. g., nano bioimaging, nano hyperthermia and nano surgery...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} finite-size and surface {{effects on the}} thermal and spatial {{behaviors}} of the magnetisation of a small magnetic particle. We consider two systems: 1) A box-shaped isotropic particle of simple cubic structure with either periodic or free boundary conditions. This case is treated analytically using the isotropic model of D-component spin vectors in the limit D→∞, including the magnetic field. 2) A more realistic particle (γ -Fe_ 2 O_ 3) of ellipsoidal (or spherical) shape with open boundaries. The magnetic state in this particle is described by the anisotropic classical Dirac-Heisenberg model including exchange and dipolar interactions, and bulk and surface anisotropy. This case is dealt with by the classical Monte Carlo technique. It is shown that in both systems finite-size effects yield a positive contribution to the magnetisation while surface effects render a larger and negative contribution, leading to a net decrease of the magnetisation of the small particle {{with respect to the}} bulk system. In the system 2) {{the difference between the two}} contributions is enhanced by surface anisotropy. The latter also leads to non <b>saturation</b> of the <b>magnetisation</b> at low temperatures, showing that the magnetic order in the core of the particle is perturbed by the magnetic disorder on the surface. This is confirmed by the profile of the magnetisation.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} Carboniferous-Permian red beds of the Patquía Formation at Punta del Viento, Sierra de Umango and some previously reported localities, all in the Paganzo Basin (Argentina), have been stud-ied. Whereas all sites are characterized by hematite as the main magnetic carrier and a reversed-polarity magnetic remanence, we found a pattern of variation in {{magnetic properties}} along the integrated column for Patquía For-mation. The Lower Member (Late Carboniferous) showed higher intensity of natural and <b>saturation</b> isothermal remanent <b>magnetisation</b> (NRM and SIRM, respectively) than the Permian Upper Member. The fall in NRM in-tensity from the Lower to Upper Member of the Patquía Formation {{may be related to}} a change in quantity and/ or grain-size of the hematite pigment, which may reflect the change in environmental and/or depositional setting. As for directional values of NRM, paleomagnetic poles reported for both sections are clearly different. The lower section provided a pole position coincident with Late Carboniferous poles for Gondwana, while the upper section poles are departed from the Early Permian position. We cannot decide whether the Upper Member pole is due to a primary magnetisation at 290 Ma or to a remagnetisation at ~ 260 - 270 Ma; even so, the obtained paleomagnetic pole is robust and indicates a rapid apparent polar wander in a ~ 30 o counter clockwise rotation of the region, after deposition of the Late Carboniferous lower section, and in coincidence with the San Rafael Orogenic Phase. ...|$|R
