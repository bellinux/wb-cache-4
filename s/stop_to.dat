5|$|The United Nations {{also put}} {{pressure}} on Portugal to move for decolonisation. Portugal threatened to withdraw from NATO, which put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> this support and pressure, and the nationalist groups in Mozambique were forced to turn to help from the Soviet bloc.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E

5|$|A {{unilateral}} ceasefire {{was announced}} on 10 August by the Georgian government. An intention {{to pull out}} Georgian troops from South Ossetia was stated by the Georgian government. However, Russia did not embrace this ceasefire offer. After the ceasefire agreement was negotiated by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August, military action was to cease at 15:00 on 12 August, however Russian forces didn't <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> advance.|$|E
5|$|Aqil's victory entrenched {{his rule}} over Galilee and {{afterward}} he established stronger {{relations with the}} Europeans. After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced themselves from the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations {{with a grain of}} salt. In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not to intervene and put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, it was {{considered}} to convert the Columbus Circle station from a local <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> an express stop in order to serve the anticipated rise of ridership at the stop resulting from the proposed New York Coliseum and the expected redevelopment of the area. In 1955, the firm Edwards, Kelcey and Beck was hired as Consulting Engineers {{for the construction of}} the express station.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> think about what they're doing or why, {{and the story of}} Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and {{passed a resolution}} of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, {{by a vote of}} 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the details}} of these various {{arrangements}} could not conveniently be settled without many interviews, and thus very soon it came about that scarcely a day went by upon which Mr. Layard's dog-cart did not pass through the Abbey gates. Generally he came {{in the morning and}} <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> lunch; or he came in the afternoon and <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> tea. In fact, or thus it seemed to Morris, he always <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> something, so much so that although not lacking in hospitality, at times Morris found his presence wearisome, for in truth the two men had nothing in common.|$|R
5|$|The named plaintiff, Oliver L. Brown, was a parent, {{a welder}} in the shops of the Santa Fe Railroad, an {{assistant}} pastor at his local church, and an African American. He was convinced {{to join the}} lawsuit by Scott, a childhood friend. Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6km) away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{informed}} by events {{prior to the}} Great Depression when – {{in the opinion of}} Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> the process of lending.|$|E

5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|Along a highway, {{the group}} is forced to stop {{as a number of}} {{abandoned}} cars litter the road, making it impossible to pass; further, Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) must <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> fix his RV. As the others push cars {{out of the way and}} scavenge for supplies, a horde of walkers appear behind them. The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Bojić was in his final year at the University of Belgrade and had gotten engaged to his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The war put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> his education, and Bojić decided to postpone the marriage until peace was restored. He remained employed at Pijemont until 1915, when he left Belgrade with his family, never to return. While Todorović remained in the city, the Bojićes moved {{to the town of}} Aranđelovac in the Serbian interior. Shortly after, they moved to Niš as it was further from the frontlines. There, Bojić worked as a military censor. He wrote articles for the Niš Gazette (Niški glasnik) to pay his family's bills. In early February 1915, Bojić's mother died of cancer, leaving him {{to take care of his}} younger siblings.|$|E

Having discovered a time machine, Dan travels {{back in time to}} save Kiya in Whitechapel, merging with his past self to gain golden armour. As Dan finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the pages from him and uses them to summon a large blue demon.

When Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy that he {{read in a}} magazine that Bill Cosby hates him, Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders, a cabal of powerful African Americans (a reference to the 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off his Comedy Central show), are out to destroy his career. The Black Crusaders have managed to put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> all productions featuring Tracy. Fearing for his life, Tracy goes on the run to Cleveland and, from there, into Needmore, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Geetha arrests Rambabu and his family, and Veerabhadram uses {{force to}} beat the truth out of them. As Rambabu, Jyothi and Anju are {{severely}} injured, Geetha's husband, Prabhakar, asks her to put a <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> this. Out of fear, Anu reveals what she saw and Varun's friend describes the transgression at the camp. After digging up the compost pit, the police find the carcass of a pig instead of Varun's body, indicating that Rambabu had already moved it. Jyothi's brother, Rajesh, and her father call the media and Anu complains to them about Veerabhadram's ill-treatment of her family. After Veerabhadram manhandles Rambabu and his relatives, he is beaten by the local people who learn about him from the media. Rambabu's goodwill remains intact and all the locals extend their support to him. Veerabhadram is suspended, the remaining staff transferred, and Geetha resigns from her post as IG.|$|E
