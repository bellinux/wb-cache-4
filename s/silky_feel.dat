"No; but the Detector says, among fifty other things, that, if a good bill, it must have, {{thickened}} {{here and}} there into {{the substance of the}} paper, little wavy spots of red; and it says they must have a kind of <b>silky</b> <b>feel,</b> being made by the lint of a red silk handkerchief stirred up in the paper-maker's vat--the paper being made to order for the company." ...|$|E
60|$|The Scale-breasted Paradise Bird (Epimachus magnificus of Cuvier) is now {{generally}} {{placed with}} the Australian Rifle {{birds in the}} genus Ptiloris. Though very beautiful, these birds are less strikingly decorated with accessory plumage than the other species we have been describing, their chief ornament being {{a more or less}} developed breastplate of stiff metallic green feathers, and a small tuft of somewhat hairy plumes {{on the sides of the}} breast. The back and wings of this species are of an intense velvety black, faintly glossed in certain lights with rich purple. The two broad middle tail feathers are opalescent green-blue with a velvety surface, and the top of the head is covered with feathers resembling scales of burnished steel. A large triangular space covering the chin, throat, and breast, is densely scaled with feathers, having a steel-blue or green lustre, and a <b>silky</b> <b>feel.</b> This is edged below with a narrow band of black, followed by shiny bronzy green, below which the body is covered with hairy feathers of a rich claret colour, deepening to black at the tail. The tufts of side plumes somewhat resemble those of the true Birds of Paradise, but are scanty, about as long as the tail, and of a black colour. The sides of the head are rich violet, and velvety feathers extend on each side of the beak over the nostrils.|$|E
50|$|The Burmilla {{comes in}} two coat lengths, semi {{long hair and}} shorthair. Semi long hair Burmilla are known as Tiffanie in GCCF. The most common (standard) coat is the short-hair. This is a short, close-lying coat similar in {{appearance}} to the Burmese but with slightly padded feel due to the undercoat, {{it has a very}} soft, <b>silky</b> <b>feel.</b> The recessive longhair gene inherited from the Chinchilla can produce Longhair Burmilla. These cats have a semi-longhair coat following the lines of the body, with a soft, <b>silky</b> <b>feel</b> and a large plumed tail. The Shorthair gene is dominant, and where a cat receives one of each, the appearance will be Shorthair. Two Longhair Burmillas mated together will always produce Longhair kittens, while Shorthair matings depend on whether the Longhair genes are carried by the Shorthair parents.|$|E
50|$|The coat of the Small Greek Domestic Dog is {{of three}} lengths, {{of very good}} quality, and is easy to groom. Sometimes, it is {{slightly}} wavy, but it should always <b>feel</b> <b>silky.</b> The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof.|$|R
5000|$|Cap: It is whitish yellow in color. Spread over 10-15 cm across, it is convex {{and a bit}} flat, {{yellowing}} {{slightly at}} the center especially with age, and densely covered in minute fibrous scales of the same colour. It <b>feels</b> <b>silky.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lawn cloth or lawn is a {{plain weave}} textile, {{originally}} of linen but now chiefly cotton. Lawn is designed using fine, high count yarns, {{which results in}} a <b>silky,</b> untextured <b>feel.</b> The fabric is made using either combed or carded yarns. When lawn is made using combed yarns, with a soft feel and slight luster, it is known as [...] "nainsook". The term lawn is also used in the textile industry {{to refer to a}} type of starched crisp finish given to a cloth product. The finish can be applied to a variety of fine fabrics, prints or plain.|$|R
5000|$|Thirteen {{species of}} Adenanthos have leaves deeply divided into long, soft, slender laciniae, often {{covered in a}} fine down of soft hairs, giving them a soft, <b>silky</b> <b>feel,</b> in stark {{contrast}} to the sclerophyllous plants that dominate both the geographic range and taxonomic family of Adenanthos. These are collectively known as woollybushes, and many of these species contain woollybush in their common names.|$|E
50|$|Woollybush, woolly bush or woolly-bush is {{a common}} name for plants of the genus Adenanthos with leaves deeply divided into long, soft, slender laciniae, often covered in a fine down of soft hairs. These {{properties}} give the leaves a soft, <b>silky</b> <b>feel,</b> {{in stark contrast to}} the sclerophyllous plants that dominate both its geographic range (southern Australia) and its taxonomic family (Proteaceae). This softness accounts for the common name.|$|E
5000|$|High wet modulus rayon (HWM) is a {{modified}} version of viscose that has a greater strength when wet. It also has the ability to be mercerized like cotton. HWM rayons are also known as [...] "polynosic". Polynosic fibers are dimensionally stable and do not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They are also wear resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, <b>silky</b> <b>feel.</b> They are sometimes identified by the trade name Modal.|$|E
5000|$|David Rishty of Billboard {{described}} the song as [...] "a rumbling dance ballad {{that has the}} ingredients to take both acts to new heights in their flourishing careers". He opined that Khalid delivered [...] "crooning, soulful vocals", while Marshmello's production is [...] "vibrant" [...] and [...] "asserts simplicity, yet purpose". Erik of EDM Sauce called the song [...] "an incredibly powerful track", and described Khalid's vocals as [...] "booming and impressive". He wrote that [...] "after the intense build up and lyrical perfection from Khalid we wanted an equally as impressive drop", but [...] "we did not find it". Alex Ross of Vice called the song [...] "a good Marshmello song", and wrote that Marshmello [...] "cheated by getting Khalid to do the vocals". He thinks that it [...] "sounds a bit like" [...] Major Lazer's collaboration with Justin Bieber and MØ, [...] "Cold Water". Rolling Stone wrote that the song has [...] "shifting, snapping synths". Rap-Up felt that the song [...] "blends soulful R&B with atmospheric electronic sounds". Broadway World described Khalid's vocals as [...] "strong emotive", and thinks that Marshmello [...] "adopted a slower tempo than his usual upbeat productions to give the release a <b>silky</b> smooth <b>feel,</b> before launching into a his instantly recognisable chord-based drop".|$|R
50|$|The Pacific {{pocket mice}} all have {{different}} characteristics {{ranging from the}} male, female and the baby mice. Since the pocket mice are members on the Heteromyidae, which consists of animals surviving on seeds and grain, they have fur-lined cheek pouches externally. Most of the pocket mouse’s body is covered in fur that <b>feels</b> <b>silky.</b> The coats of the pocket mice are spineless and bristle free. The color of the Pacific pocket mouse {{has to do with}} the environment they live in, hence the color of the soil. The dorsal side of the pocket mouse is usually brown and pinkish while the ventral is usually white. On the pocket mouse, there are typically two patches of hairs that are lighter at the base of the ear. The tail of the pocket mouse can either be distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy, which are also the distinguishing marks on the Pacific pocket mouse along with the two patches of hair that are lighter at the base of the ear.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types and styles of yoga pants in {{addition}} to the traditional. The flared yoga pants are also commonly used as dancewear allowing it to stretch and for the ease of movement it affords. They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and <b>silky</b> appearance and <b>feel</b> when worn. Crop-fitted yoga pants lie above the ankle (similar to capri pants), and are oftentimes utilized for a more flattering, versatile, and dressier look during warmer times of the year. They are used commonly as casual wear, activewear, for making errands, lounging, or as clubwear on a night out. The flared yoga pants are often paired with flip-flops, running shoes, flats, or Ugg boots, worn along with hoodies, shawls, cardigans or wraps paired with a tank top or shirt tucked underneath. Due to their high elasticity, yoga pants are comfortable enough to wear for many purposes. They were originally created for practicing yoga, but have become popular as everday mainstream clothing item in classrooms, gymnasiums, restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs.|$|R
50|$|Silk {{amino acid}} (SAAs) {{also known as}} Sericin is a natural {{water-soluble}} glycoprotein extracted from raw silk. It is used as an additive in skin and hair care products due to its high levels of serine which has excellent moisture preservation characteristics. As a water-based additive {{it is used to}} provide a protective barrier and <b>silky</b> <b>feel</b> to lotions, soaps, personal lubricants, hair and skincare products. Silk amino acids are produced by hydrolyzing (or breaking apart) silk proteins into smaller peptide chains, typically 18 to 19 amino acids in length. Silk amino acids have a lower molecular weight than silk protein powders and are moisturizing to skin and hair.|$|E
5000|$|Pigeons {{primarily}} use powder down feathers for preening {{which gives}} them a soft and <b>silky</b> <b>feel</b> to their plumage which is unmatched by other birds. Pigeons have no preen gland or at times have very rudimentary preen glands and hence that oil is not used for preening. Powder down feathers are spread across the body which {{have a tendency to}} disintegrate and the powder, akin to talcum powder is used all over the feathers for plumage maintenance. [...] Some subspecies of domestic pigeons have modified feathers called [...] "Fat Quills". These feathers contain yellow oil like fat that derives from the same cells as Powder down. This is used while preening and helps in plumage maintenance by reducing bacterial degradation of feathers by feather bacilii.|$|E
50|$|Though its {{flowers are}} inconspicuous, A. sericeus is {{considered}} an attractive garden plant for the colour and texture of its dense foliage. Its high tolerance of salt-laden winds makes it an excellent screen plant in coastal areas. In the Albany area, branches or entire potted plants are used as Christmas trees, since young plants are shaped like small pine trees but have a <b>silky</b> <b>feel.</b> One study of application of controlled-release fertiliser to A. sericeus in pots found it benefited from increasing levels of fertiliser, whereas other species plateaued at lower levels. Propagation is by cuttings. These strike readily, but {{care must be taken}} not to mist the foliage too much, or it will rot. It requires very good drainage, and performs poorly in humid areas. Lacking a lignotuber, it tolerates only light pruning.|$|E
5000|$|... "Glamorous" [...] is a downtempo R&B {{song that}} has a smooth, <b>silky</b> <b>feel</b> and {{contains}} elements of techno. Music critics likened the song to Gwen Stefani's [...] "Luxurious" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Jenny from the Block". According to Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music, the song {{is comparable to the}} music of Janet Jackson. Spence D. of IGN noted that the song contained a mid-1980s vibe and influences of musical works by Madonna and Prince. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song was written in a key of C major. Having a beat measure of 130 beats per minute, it is set in common time and moves through a moderately fast tempo. The vocals range from a low register of E3 to a high register of C5. It has a basic sequence of G-Am7-Fmaj7 as its chord progression. Lyrically, [...] "Glamorous" [...] is an autobiographical account about how Fergie has remained true to her background, despite widespread fame and mainstream success.|$|E
5000|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought Branagh was miscast as Olivier, but {{she said}} he made up for that with [...] "his crisp, at times clipped, enunciation and a {{physical}} performance that gives Olivier enough vitality so that when, early in, the character sweeps into his production office with his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond, a wan placeholder for the original), he dazzles Clark and jolts this slow-stirring movie awake." [...] Of Williams, the film critic said she [...] "tries her best, and sometimes that's almost enough." [...] Dargis said the main problem is with Hodges' script, which [...] "offers a catalog of Monroe stereotypes." [...] Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy gave the film {{four out of five}} stars and she praised many of the cast's performances. Papamichael added [...] "While you won't learn anything new about Marilyn Monroe, you can revel in the <b>silky</b> <b>feel</b> of nostalgia." [...] Empire magazine's Angie Errigo gave My Week with Marilyn three out of five stars and she said [...] "At moments hilarious and others touching, it's a sweet, slight affair, more pretty pageant than pithy biographical drama. Expect awards nominations to stack up for Williams and Branagh." [...] The Wall Street Journal's film critic, Joe Morgenstern was negative about the film saying, [...] "When bad movies happen to good people, the first place to look for an explanation is the basic idea. That certainly applies to [...] "My Week with Marilyn," [...] a dubious idea done in by Adrian Hodges's shallow script and Simon Curtis's clumsy direction." [...] Nishi Tiwari of Rediff.com said Williams is [...] "a fascinating watch", but there is nothing about Monroe in the film that we did not know already.|$|E
