5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E

On 11 March, Lima Site 85 was struck by an attack spearheaded by the sappers of the 41st Dac Cong Battalion {{and supported by the}} 923rd PAVN Infantry Battalion and the site was quickly overrun. Five of the Air Force technicians manning the site managed to escape, but 11 more were never heard from again and were carried as missing in action.|$|E

5|$|After {{applying}} for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment {{for the new}} aircraft carrier , at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, {{until the end of}} December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, {{as well as in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro.|$|E

5|$|As many as 90 sorties a {{day were}} called in to {{suppress}} North Vietnamese forces around Hambleton. In contrast, prior to the Easter Offensive, the number of daily sorties was about 10, and during the action, peaked at about 300. During the multi-day effort to rescue the men, the Americans hit the North Vietnamese with over 800 air <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> direct support of the rescue. Search and rescue took priority over almost all strike targets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic, and subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only.

5|$|The February Revolution {{halted the}} Finnish {{economic}} boom {{caused by the}} Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but the workers who had a job gained an opportunity to resolve long-term problems of their laborious working life. The commoners call for eight-hour-per-day working limits, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> industry and agriculture.|$|E
50|$|On 25 February 1941, the Communist Party of the Netherlands {{called for}} a general strike, the 'February strike', in {{response}} to the first Nazi raid on Amsterdam's Jewish population. The old Jewish quarter in Amsterdam had been cordoned off into a ghetto and as retaliation for a number of violent incidents that followed, 425 Jewish men were taken hostage by the Germans and eventually deported to extermination camps, just two surviving. Many citizens of Amsterdam, regardless of their political affiliation, joined in a mass protest against the deportation of Jewish Dutch citizens. The next day, factories in Zaandam, Haarlem, IJmuiden, Weesp, Bussum, Hilversum and Utrecht joined <b>in.</b> The <b>strike</b> was largely put down within a day with German troops firing on unarmed crowds, killing nine people and wounding 24, as well as taking many prisoners. It was significant because opposition to the German occupation intensified as a result. The only other general <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> Nazi-occupied Europe was the general <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> occupied Luxembourg in 1942. The Dutch struck four more times against the Germans: the students' <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> November 1940, the doctors' <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> 1942, the April-May <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> 1943 and the railway <b>strike</b> <b>in</b> 1944.|$|R

5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting, most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay, later settling in Israel (Pardes Hanna-Karkur) and the United Kingdom. , 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried {{out a number of}} protests and general <b>strikes.</b> <b>In</b> 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company were laid off.|$|E
5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and an Alabama possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon.

Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning <b>strikes</b> <b>in</b> the immediate vicinity of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E
