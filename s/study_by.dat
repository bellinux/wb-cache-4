After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E

They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E

40|$|Photo nuclear {{reactions}} are {{shown to be}} used for studying neutrino/weak nuclear responses involved in astro-neutrino nuclear interactions and double beta decays. Charged current weak responses for ground and excited states are <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> using photo nuclear reactions through isobaric analog states of those states, while neutral current weak responses for excited states are <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> using photo nuclear reactions through the excited states. The weak interaction strengths are <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> measuring the cross sections of the photo nuclear reactions, and the spin and parity of the state are <b>studied</b> <b>by</b> measuring angular correlations of particles emitted from the photo nuclear reactions. Medium-energy polarized photons obtained from laser photons scattered off GeV electrons are very useful.
