The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|R

60|$|There were {{no doubt}} many such devices as Hero's toys devised and forgotten, time after time, in courts and palaces, but it needed that coal should be mined and burning with plenty <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> at hand before it dawned upon men {{that here was}} {{something}} more than a curiosity. And it is to be remarked that the first recorded suggestion for the use of steam was in war; there is an Elizabethan pamphlet in which it is proposed to fire <b>shot</b> out <b>of</b> corked <b>iron</b> bottles full <b>of</b> heated water. The mining of coal for fuel, the smelting <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> upon a larger scale than men had ever done before, the steam pumping engine, the steam-engine and the steam-boat, followed one another in an order that had a kind of logical necessity. It is the most interesting and instructive chapter {{in the history of the}} human intelligence, the history of steam from its beginning as a fact in human consciousness to the perfection of the great turbine engines that preceded the utilisation of intra-molecular power. Nearly every human being must have seen steam, seen it incuriously for many thousands of years; the women in particular were always heating water, boiling it, seeing it boil away, seeing the lids of vessels dance with its fury; millions of people at different times must have watched steam pitching rocks out of volcanoes like cricket balls and blowing pumice into foam, and yet you may search the whole human record through, letters, books, inscriptions, pictures, for any glimmer of a realisation that here was force, here was strength to borrow and use.... Then suddenly man woke up to it, the railways spread like a network over the globe, the ever enlarging iron steamships began their staggering fight against wind and wave.|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} platelet sonicates and mediators secreted by unstimulated and thrombin-stimulated platelets to facilitate the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin. Platelet sonicates and platelet conditioned media potentiated the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin. The rate <b>of</b> release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> was dependent on the pH of the reaction and amount of platelet sample added. Conditioned media from thrombin-stimulated platelets was more effective in mediating the release <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> from transferrin than was conditioned media from unstimulated cells. The rate <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> released from transferrin following addition of ATP and ADP in amounts equivalent to that present in platelet conditioned media was significantly less than the rate <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> released following the addition of conditioned media from platelets.
