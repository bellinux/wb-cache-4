The germanium exposure to cosmic rays on the Earth's surface are simulated with and without a <b>shielding</b> <b>container</b> using Geant 4 for a given cosmic muon, neutron, and proton energy spectrum. The production rates of various radioactive isotopes are obtained for different sources separately. We find that fast neutron induced interactions dominate the production rate of cosmogenic activation. Geant 4 -based simulation results are compared with the calculation of ACTIVIA and the available experimental data. A reasonable agreement between Geant 4 simulations and several experimental data sets is presented. We predict that cosmogenic activation of germanium can set limits to {{the sensitivity of the}} next generation of tonne-scale experiments. Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures, and 12 table...|$|E

These sources originated from Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) {{where they were}} used to calibrate neutron detection diagnostics. In 1999, PPPL and BNL began a collaborative effort to expand the use of an innovative pilot-scale technology and bring it to full-scale deployment to shield these sources for eventual transport and burial at the Hanford Burial site. The transport/disposal container was constructed of depleted uranium oxide encapsulated in polyethylene to provide suitable shielding for both gamma and neutron radiation. This new material can be produced from recycled waste products (DU and polyethylene), is inexpensive, and can be disposed with the waste, unlike conventional lead containers, thus reducing exposure time for workers. This paper will provide calculations and information that led to the initial design of the shielding.

This platform offers enough variability of reaction parameters and allows for a repeated return of a sample to the microfluidic chip. It may enhance the yield dramatically. CRAB – versatile platform for separation, formulation and simple labelling processes. The main parts of the system are two reactors, two selectors, peristaltic pump, 3 / 2 way valves, and the column.

Four positions are available for uploading the solvents into the reactor R 1 or on the SPE column. Splitting the separated radionuclide from the target matrix, including enriched material, is enabled thanks to the smart software checking the column output activity and controlling the splitting valves position.

40|$|Introduction Radiometals {{are finding}} {{more and more}} {{applications}} in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. For PET imaging, all the novel radiometals are directly or indirectly produced on cyclotrons. Key step in their production is achieving proper radionuclidic, radiochemical and chemical purity, as well as high specific activity. Automation of the process enhances reproducibility, shortens necessary operations and decreases radiation burden. We have, therefore, developed universal radio-metal automated laboratory workbench (RALW) that is focused on separation processes from solid and liquid (solution) targets via solid phase extraction (SPE). Material and Methods RALW is versatile platform for separation, formulation and simple labeling processes. The following FIG. 1 displays its basic scheme. RALW´s main parts are: two reactors, two selec-tors, peristaltic pump, 3 / 2 way valves, and separation column. Prime reactor R 1 is designed to carry out several functions. It can transport solid target material from <b>shielding</b> <b>container</b> to process position, or handle liquid target filling. In both cases, the reactor is leakagefree up to 5 bars. There are 4 positions available to bring solvents to the reactor 1 or applying on a SPE column according to the separation sequence with use of peristaltic pump. Smart software allows for collecting defined fractions leaving the column, e. g. enriched target matrix and the desired radionuclide, by monitoring activity profile and controlling the splitting valves. The system also minimizes losses during transport of the solvents/fractions to the reactor R 2 and the software also controls final volume settings (activity concentration) of the product. Up to three positions are available for bringing solvents/solutions to the reactor R 2 for formulation or simple labeling steps like chelation. The system’s hardware is driven by a PLC and I/O cards. The PLC is placed outside the module to avoid radiation damage. The module, PLC and host PC communicate via an Ethernet cable. This solution significantly reduced number of cables connecting the module with other component in the control chain. The PLC is controlled via host PC equipped with userfriendly interface. Results and Conclusion The presented RPLW system is rather versatile tool for separation of metal radionuclides and simple postprocessing (formulation/labelling) of the product in stable environment and easy control mechanisms.

40|$|The Small Gram Quantity (SGQ) {{concept is}} based on the {{understanding}} that small amounts of hazardous materials, in this case radioactive materials (RAM), are significantly less hazardous than large amounts of the same materials. This paper describes a methodology designed to estimate an SGQ for several neutron and gamma emitting isotopes that can be shipped in a package in compliance with 10 CFR Part 71 external radiation level limits regulations. The neutron and photon sources were calculated using both ORIGEN-S and RASTA. The response from a unit source in each neutron and photon group was calculated using MCNP 5 with each unshielded and <b>shielded</b> <b>container</b> configuration. Effects of self-shielding on both neutron and photon response were evaluated by including either plutonium oxide or iron in the source region for the case with no <b>shielded</b> <b>container.</b> For the cases of actinides mixed with light elements, beryllium is the bounding light element. The added beryllium (10 to 90 percent of the actinide mass) in the cases studied represents between 9 and 47 percent concentration of the total mixture mass. For beryllium concentrations larger than 50 percent, the increase in the neutron source term and dose rate tend to increase at a much lower rate than at concentrations lower than 50 %. The intimately mixed actinide-beryllium form used in these models is very conservative and thus the limits presented in this report are practical bounds on the mass that can be safely shipped. The calculated dose rate from one gram of each isotope was then used to determin the maximum amount of a single isotope that could be shipped in the Model 9977 Package (or packagings having the same or larger external dimensions as well as similar structural materials) and have the external radiation level within the regulatory dose limits at the surface of the package. The estimates of the mass limits presented would also serve as conservative limits for both the Models 9975 and 9978 packages. If a package contains a mixture of isotopes, the acceptability for shipment can be determined by a sum of fractions approach.
