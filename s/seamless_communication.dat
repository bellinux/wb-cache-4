40|$|ABSTRACT-Next {{generation}} {{wireless communications}} will likely rely on integrated networks consisting of multiple wireless technologies. Hybrid networks based, for instance, on {{systems such as}} WMAN and WLAN can combine their respective advantages on coverage and data rates. WLAN is provided in hotspots, places like coffee bars, airports, shopping centers etc. where the hotspots are covered by access points. As the mobile node moves, it may leave the current wireless network and enter another wireless network; vertical handoff {{should be taken to}} the new network so as to maintain the current connection. Existing methods require more time for the vertical handoff process, which causes serious problems for multimedia applications. Vertical handoff delay should be minimum to have <b>seamless</b> vertical handoff <b>communication.</b> To achieve <b>seamless</b> handoff <b>communication</b> a Layer 2 handoff method is proposed. In this method, a mobile with two radios of dualmode capability, and WLAN having the extended region capability is used. The second interface is switched between 802. 16 and 802. 11 to know ahead to which network it is about to enter. Mobile node comes to know about its nearby network before actually entering the network, thereby reducing vertical handoff delay, making it suitable to <b>seamless</b> vertical handoff <b>Communication.</b> Keywords-Horizontal handoff, Vertical handoff, IEEE 802. 11, WiMax...|$|R

5000|$|The Disaster Management eGov Initiative of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{determined}} in 2004 {{to launch a}} project to develop interagency emergency data communications standards. It called together a group of national emergency response practitioner leaders and sought their guidance on requirements for such standards. In June, 2004 the first such meeting identified {{the need for a}} common distribution element for all emergency messages. Subsequent meetings of a Standards Working Group developed detailed requirements and a draft specification for such a distribution element (DE).During the same period the DM Initiative was forming a partnership with industry members of the Emergency Interoperability Consortium (EIC) to cooperate in the development of emergency standards. EIC had been a leading sponsor of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). Both organizations desired to develop an expanded family of data formats for exchanging operational information beyond warning.EIC members participated {{in the development of the}} DE, and in the broader design of the design of a process for the development of additional standards. This was named Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL).The goal of the EDXL project is to facilitate emergency information sharing and data exchange across the local, state, tribal, national and non-governmental organizations of different professions that provide emergency response and management services. EDXL will accomplish this goal by focusing on the standardization of specific messages (messaging interfaces) to facilitate emergency communication and coordination particularly when more than one profession is involved. It is not just an [...] "emergency management" [...] domain exercise.It is a national effort including a diverse and representative group of local, state and federal emergency response organizations and professionals, following a multi-step process. Just as a data-focused effort targets shared data elements, the EDXL process looks for shared message needs, which are common across a broad number of organizations. The objective is to rapidly deliver implementable standard messages, in an incremental fashion, directly to emergency response agencies in the trenches, providing <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> and coordination supporting each particular process. The effort first addresses the most urgent needs and proceeds to subsequent message sets in a prioritized fashion. The goal is to incrementally develop and deliver standards.EDXL is intended as a suite of emergency data message types including resource queries and requests, situation status, message routing instructions and the like, needed in the context of cross-disciplinary, cross-jurisdictional communications related to emergency response.The priorities and requirements are created by the DM EDXL Standards Working Group (SWG) which is a formalized group of emergency response practitioners, technical experts, and industry.The draft DE specification was trialed by a number of EIC members starting in October, 2004. In November, 2004, EIC formally submitted the draft to the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee for standardization.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} provide <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> in mobile wireless networks. The goal of <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> {{is to make the}} motion of a mobile host transparent to the applications executing on it. Active handoffs (handoffs during an active connection) cause pauses in communication between the mobile host and the fixed network, resulting in applications seeing a substantial performance degradation. The motivation behind this study is to find a cost effective solution for minimizing impact of active handoffs on connection throughput. Existing solutions either provide total guarantee for <b>seamless</b> <b>communication,</b> incurring heavy network bandwidth usage (multicast based approach), or do not provide any guarantee for <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> (unicast based approach). Some other solutions are tuned to give good performance for specific protocols (e. g., fast-retransmit approach).

40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio networks (CRN), Out-of-Band (OoB) spectrum sensing provides <b>seamless</b> <b>communication.</b> Cognitive radio (CR) users, so called secondary users (SUs), should avoid interference with primary users (PUs), {{the owner of}} the licensed band, while trying to access the unused licensed or unlicensed band, for spectrum utilization. When PUs request to access their band, SUs need to vacate the band, thus it is inconvenient to provide <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> without OoB sensing. In this paper, we suggest an OoB sensing algorithm to guarantee <b>seamless</b> <b>communication</b> and also minimize the interference of SUs on PUs. Also we obtain analysis-based achievable throughput by considering the OoB sensing duration. To verify our algorithm, we perform simulation and find that the effect due to OoB sensing on the aggregate throughput is insignificant.

40|$|Appropriate {{wireless}} access point deployment (APD) is essential for ensuring <b>seamless</b> user <b>communication.</b> Optimal APD enables good telecommunication quality, balanced capacity loading, and optimal deployment costs. APD is a typical NP-complex problem because improving wireless networking infrastructure has multiple objectives (MOs). This paper proposes a method that integrates a goal-programming-driven model (PM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to resolve the MO-APD problem. The PM identifies the target deployment subject of four constraints: budget, coverage, capacity, and interference. The PM also calculates dynamic capacity requirements to replicate real wireless communication. Three experiments validate the feasibility of the PM. The results demonstrate the utility and stability of the proposed method. Decision makers can easily refer to the PM-identified target deployment before allocating APs...|$|R
