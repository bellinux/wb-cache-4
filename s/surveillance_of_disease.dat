40|$|Abstract. Sensitive {{diagnostic}} {{tools are}} crucial for an accurate assessment of helminth infections in low-endemicity areas. We examined stool samples from Tanzanian individuals and compared the diagnostic accuracy of a real-time {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) with the FLOTAC technique and the Kato-Katz method for hookworm and the Baermann method for Strongyloides stercoralis detection. Only FLOTAC had a higher sensitivity than the Kato-Katz method for hookworm diagnosis; the sensitivities of PCR and the Kato-Katz method were equal. PCR had a very low sensitivity for S. stercoralis detection. The cycle threshold values of the PCR were negatively correlated with the logarithm of hookworm egg and S. stercoralis larvae counts. The median larvae count was significantly lower in PCR false negatives than true positives. All methods failed to detect very low-intensity infections. New diagnostic approaches are needed for monitoring of progressing helminth control programs, confirmation of elimination, or <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> recrudescence...|$|E

This paper presents a model-based approach, which on the basis of available location data, provides a measure of the strength of association between cases in space and time and which is used to designate and visualise the most likely groupings of cases. The method was developed as a prospective surveillance tool to signal potential outbreaks, but it may also be used to explore groupings of cases in outbreak investigations.

The epidemiological relevance of the results was based on an outbreak of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) in Ontario in 2005. The total condemnations and condemnations due to arthritis and pneumonia patterns reflected the field infection of PCVAD in 2005 followed by the widespread use of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV- 2) vaccine in 2007. In contrast, increased rates of nephritis and enteritis suggested areas for enhanced surveillance for unexplained changes in disease patterns not identified through traditional passive surveillance.

40|$|Among {{the many}} roles a {{government}} plays in ourdaily lives, protecting the public’s health {{is one of}} themost conspicuous. The government provides goods and services such as registration of births and deaths, public health <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> and injury, outbreak investigations, research and education, health insurance {{for the poor and}} elderly, enforcement of laws and regulations, evaluation of health promotion programs, and assurance of a competent healthy workforce. In the past, economics in public health has almost exclusively focused on efficiency of programs through the use of cost-effectiveness or net present value measures clustered under the rubric of “economic evaluation. ” Efficiency measures are useful at the programmatic level. However, lack of full employment and market failures including public goods and the impact of consumers and producers actions not reflected in the markets (externalities) not only compromise efficiency but also generate health inequities. We propose an expansion of the scope of existing health economics research in an area characterized as public health economics—the study of the economic role of government in public health, particularly, but not exclusively, in supplying public goods and addressing externalities.

40|$|The Scottish Meningococcus and Pneumococcus Reference Laboratory (SMPRL) {{provides}} a national {{service for the}} laboratory confirmation of meningococcal and pneumococcal disease in Scotland. Part of this service includes the serogrouping of meningococcal isolates followed by typing and subtyping. The procedures for this are labor-intensive but important for the identification of linked cases and the <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> so that effective public health measures can be taken. However, different strains of meningococci, such as those within the electrophoretic type 37 complex, occurring during case clusters of disease are now indistinguishable by current methods. The SMPRL has started using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as a routine method for the characterization of isolates of Neisseria meningitidis. MLST produces nucleotide sequence data of seven housekeeping genes providing results that are useful for public health management. However, the method is laborious and time-consuming and therefore lends itself towards automation. The SMPRL therefore developed a semiautomated method for MLST using a 96 -well format liquid handler and an automated DNA sequencer. Semiautomated MLST is now provided as a reference service for Scotland. This work describes the methodology required for the characterization of N. meningitidis and highlights its usefulness for public health intervention...|$|E
40|$|Background: In a {{large part}} of the {{developing}} world, limited infectious disease surveillance is performed. In laboratory information management systems data on diagnostic requests is available and may be amenable to trend analyses. We explored this potential, using DENV diagnostic requests as a model. Method: Test results and anonymised information provided by clinicians were received for 8942 patients from diagnostic centres in the Netherlands from January 2000 to May 2011. The data were evaluated for completeness of a predefined minimal dataset and trends in DENV positive results by travel destination. Population travel data were obtained from a commercial registry, and dengue case notification data by country from WHO DengueNet. Results: Vaccination history was rarely reported (0. 4 %); travel destination was completed for 42 % of requests; trends in diagnostic requests and IgM positive tests for this subset correlated to the WHO DENV notifications for the three main travel destinations, with some discrepancies. Additionally, this approach may provide information on disease outbreaks with other pathogens causing diseases clinically similar to DENV. PCR data proved to be insufficient for trend monitoring by country. Conclusion: This approach is not straightforward, but shows potential for use as a source of additional information for <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Automated {{public health}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> counts for rapid outbreak, {{epidemic}} or bioterrorism detection using conventional control chart methods can be hampered by over-dispersion and background ('in-control') mean counts that vary over time. An adaptive cumulative sum (CUSUM) plan is developed for signalling unusually high incidence in prospectively monitored time series of over-dispersed daily disease counts with a non-homogeneous mean. Negative binomial transitional regression {{is used to}} prospectively model background counts and provide 'one-step-ahead' forecasts of the next day's count. A CUSUM plan then accumulates departures of observed counts from an offset (reference value) that is dynamically updated using the modelled forecasts. The CUSUM signals whenever the accumulated departures exceed a threshold. The amount of memory of past observations retained by the CUSUM plan {{is determined by the}} offset value; a smaller offset retains more memory and is efficient at detecting smaller shifts. Our approach optimises early outbreak detection by dynamically adjusting the offset value. We demonstrate the practical application of the 'optimal' CUSUM plans to daily counts of laboratory-notified influenza and Ross River virus diagnoses, with particular emphasis on the steady-state situation (i. e. changes that occur after the CUSUM statistic has run through several in-control counts). average run length, cumulative sum, monitoring, outbreak detection, surveillance,...|$|E

40|$|Disease risk {{varies in}} space and time due to {{variation}} in many factors, including environmental exposures such as air pollution, and the prevalence of lifestyle behaviors such as smoking. Quantifying and explaining this spatio-temporal variation in disease risk is vital to improving public health, as for example it allows risk factors to be highlighted to the general public, as well as allowing informed decisions to be made about the future allocation of health resources. Research in this area is collectively known as disease mapping and has a variety of aims including estimating the spatio-temporal pattern in disease risk, explaining the variation in the risk by covariate factors, identifying high-risk subregions (clusters) for focused action, and <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks. The data used in this field are typically counts of the numbers of disease cases in a set of nonoverlapping areal units, and in the simplest case these data are available for a single time period.

40|$|In this paper, I {{will show}} how {{applying}} a spatially explicit context to an existing environmental health surveillance framework {{is vital for}} more complete <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> and for disease prevention and intervention strategies. As a case study to test the viability of a spatial approach to this existing framework, the risk of human exposure to Lyme disease will be estimated.

The components will be used both collectively and individually, to assess exposure risk to infected ticks.

Hazard surveillance uses maximum entropy modeling and geographically weighted regression analysis to create spatial models that predict the geographic distribution of ticks in Texas. Exposure surveillance uses GIS methods to estimate the risk of human exposures to infected ticks, resulting in a map that predicts the likelihood of human-tick interactions across Texas, using LandScan 2008 TM population data.
