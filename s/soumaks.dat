50|$|<b>Soumaks</b> {{tend to be}} finely woven, and {{although}} not as durable as piled carpets, they are stronger than kilims. The soumak wrapping often covers the whole surface of a bag or rug, but it can equally be applied in decorative strips, contrasting with the plainer and thinner flatweave areas. For example, camel bags from Malatya in Eastern Turkey could be woven in simple flatweave stripes of red and blue, with broad strips of soumak weft-wrapping with motifs for fertility and protection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{of making a}} soumak involves wrapping wefts over {{a certain number of}} warps (usually 4) before drawing them back under the last two warps. The process is repeated from selvedge to selvedge. The wefts are discontinuous; the weaver selects coloured threads in turn, and wraps each within the area which is to have that particular colour. Unlike kilim, the back is left ragged, with all the loose ends of the differently-coloured weft threads visible, sometimes several inches long, providing extra thickness and warmth. Also unlike kilim, there are no slits where colours meet, as there is a supplementary or structural weft which supports the coloured pattern weft. Some late <b>Soumaks</b> made by the Kurds are however [...] "weftless", lacking the structural weft support, and the stitches naturally overlap.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soumak</b> (also spelled Soumakh, Sumak, Sumac, or Soumac) is a {{tapestry}} technique of weaving strong and decorative textiles used as rugs and domestic bags. Baks used for bedding {{are known as}} <b>Soumak</b> Mafrash. <b>Soumak</b> {{is a type of}} flat weave, somewhat resembling but stronger and thicker than kilim, with a smooth front face and a ragged back, where kilim is smooth both sides. <b>Soumak</b> lacks the slits characteristic of kilim, as it is usually woven with supplementary weft threads as continuous supports.|$|R
50|$|The {{tapestry}} {{is made of}} {{a mixture}} of linen and wool and woven in <b>soumak</b> technique; {{it is one of}} the last examples of <b>soumak</b> weaving technique in medieval Swedish textile art. Approximately 15 cm of the original tapestry's right side has been lost.|$|R
50|$|Bags were {{sometimes}} woven {{with a face}} of <b>soumak,</b> with a tapestry-woven kilim-like top creating slits between blocks of colour: a rope was threaded {{in and out of}} the series of slits to fasten and close the bag. Sizes vary, from carpet format through bags for bedding or for use on pack animals, to tiny tribal domestic bags. The following images show the appearance and construction of just such a <b>soumak</b> saddle bag, woven in Luristan at the end of the 20th century. The Lurs sometimes, as here, combine <b>soumak</b> and knotted carpet piling to adorn a single piece. To form the motifs, the weaver may push the weft threads about to form curves or slanting shapes as desired.|$|R

5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, <b>soumak</b> and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, <b>soumak</b> and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|R
25|$|A flatweave carpet {{is created}} by {{interlocking}} warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include kilim, <b>soumak,</b> plain weave, and tapestry weave. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, damask, list, haircloth, and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).|$|R

50|$|Pannier-style {{bags are}} {{sometimes}} fitted over a pack saddle used for packing gear {{on a horse}} or other pack animal (often, a mule or donkey) rather than for carrying a rider. In Turkish Anatolia, Iran and Baluchistan, saddlebags are traditionally woven in wool, with a front face decorated with <b>Soumak</b> and a plainer flatwoven back. Slits are left along the opening for a rope to close and secure the bag to the pack animal.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>Soumak</b> may plausibly {{derive from}} the old town of Shemakja in Azerbaijan, once a major trading centre in the Eastern Caucasus. Other {{theories}} include an etymology from Turkish sekmek, to skip up and down, meaning the process of weaving; or from any of about 35 species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae or sumac family, such as dyer's sumach (Cotinus coggygria), used to make dyestuffs. If this last {{is the source of}} the name, then it is derived from the Arabic and Syriac word summāq, red.|$|R
50|$|Turkish carpets are {{regarded}} as objects of art in their country of origin, {{but also in the}} Western world. In Europe, Turkish carpets appear in Renaissance paintings, providing a context of prestige and dignity which is still understood today. Since the late nineteenth century, Turkish and oriental carpets have been subject to art historic and scientific interest in the Western world. More recently, also flat woven carpets (Kilim, <b>Soumak,</b> Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.In the late twentieth century, projects started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.|$|R
50|$|Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is {{distinguished}} by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the Turkish, or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets {{date from the}} thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, {{as well as in}} villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets (Kilim, <b>Soumak,</b> Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.Following a decline which began {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, initiatives like the DOBAG Carpet Initiative in 1982, or the Turkish Cultural Foundation in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets {{are subject to}} use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. There is little archaeological evidence to support any theory {{about the origin of}} the pile-woven carpet. The earliest surviving carpet fragments are spread over a wide geographic area, and a long time span. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of felt, or a technique known as “extra-weft wrapping”. Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as extra-weft wrapping weaving, a technique which produces <b>soumak,</b> and loop woven textiles. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine pile rug. Typically, hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the thread after each single knot. The fabric is then further stabilized by weaving (“shooting”) in one or more strings of weft, and compacted by beating with a comb. It seems likely that knotted-pile carpets have been produced by people who were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques.|$|R
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20 th century, Caucasian carpets were in great demand among burgeoning European and American middle-class markets. With a history of carpet {{production}} going back at least three hundred years, rug-weaving in the Caucasus soared at {{the turn of}} the 20 th century, first with economic incentives and the encouragement of czarist regimes, later as part of the Soviet economic system. Today, in an age of perestroika and glasnost. rug-weaving in the Caucasus for commerce and export lends itself readily to individual initiatives and private enterprise. Commercial production of carpets continues to be recognized as a means of generating both income and hard currency. Drawing upon inferential, internal, and external sources of information, this paper seeks to identify and analyze three categories of carpets produced in the Caucasus for commerce. What distinguishes these categories is the nature of the evidence for their identification and interpretation. 2 ̆ 2 Dragon carpets 2 ̆ 2 comprise the first and earliest known group of Caucasian carpets. Physical features of the carpet suggest commercialized production. 2 ̆ 2 Dragon 2 ̆ 2 carpets, so-called because of the representation of pairs of dragons as one element in a complex composition of design and pattern, may have been directly influenced by the economic policies of the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas in the 17 th century. The interpretation of 2 ̆ 2 dragon 2 ̆ 2 carpets as commercial products relies upon inference. A second category of carpets are those for which evidence for identification is internal, based upon the relationship of structure and technology upon design. Carpets in this category exhibit designs which betray a stylistic influence that derives from other textile technologies. This group may be subdivided, based upon the identification of influence of indigenous traditions of embroidery, slit-tapestry, dove-tailed tapestry, and supplementary weft-wrapping (<b>soumak).</b> Many of the commercial rugs from the Caucasus, produced in the 19 th century, seem to fit within this category...|$|R
