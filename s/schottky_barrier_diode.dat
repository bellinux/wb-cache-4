5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diode,</b> SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{demand for}} {{increased}} efficiency in transportation, manufacturing equipment, and power generation and distribution {{has resulted in}} a strong research effort towards the development of solid-state devices capable of delivering large currents and withstanding high voltages without the need for bulky and expensive cooling systems. PiN diodes, used for rectification and transient suppression, have played important roles in all power electronic systems. The efficiency of these circuits can typically be improved by increasing the operating frequency. However, power lost during the switching transient of the diode also increases. Substituting <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> (SBD 2 ̆ 7 s) for the standard PiN diodes in such circuits can significantly reduce overall power dissipation, since SBD 2 ̆ 7 s exhibit almost no reverse recovery transient. ^ Silicon SBD 2 ̆ 7 s are limited to applications requiring a blocking voltage less than 100 V. Due to its large bandgap and high critical field, silicon carbide (SiC) SBD 2 ̆ 7 s have been demonstrated with breakdown voltages as high as 5 kV. A recent announcement by Infineon Technologies of plans to produce SiC <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> confirms the common speculation that SiC <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes</b> will become the first commercially available SiC power electronic device. However, several important issues have as yet not been fully addressed: (1) Optimization of SBD structures, (2) Definition of the boundary between the application spaces of PiN and <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diodes,</b> (3) Demonstration of the superior switching performance expected of SiC SBD 2 ̆ 7 s, and (4) Investigation of the impact of non-micropipe crystallographic and other electrically active defects that are known to be present in high concentrations.

[...] It consisted of a mineral crystal, usually galena, which was lightly touched by a fine springy wire (the [...] "cat whisker") on an adjustable arm. [...] The resulting crude semiconductor junction functioned as a <b>Schottky</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>diode,</b> conducting in only one direction. Only particular sites on the crystal surface worked as detector junctions, and the junction could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. So a usable site was found {{by trial and error}} before each use; the operator would drag the cat's whisker across the crystal until the radio began functioning. Frederick Seitz, a later semiconductor researcher, wrote:Such variability, bordering on what seemed the mystical, plagued the early history of crystal detectors and caused many of the vacuum tube experts of a later generation to regard the art of crystal rectification as being close to disreputable.The crystal radio was unamplified and ran off the power of the radio waves received from the radio station, so it had to be listened to with earphones; it could not drive a loudspeaker.

During the wireless era it was used in commercial and military longwave stations with huge antennas to receive long distance radiotelegraphy traffic, even including transatlantic traffic.
