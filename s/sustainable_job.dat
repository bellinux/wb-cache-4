Regional collaboration is essential for economic recovery because regions are the centers of competition in the new global economy and those that work together to leverage resources and use strengths to overcome weaknesses will fare better than those that do not.

Given that about 95 out of every 100 incarcerated people eventually rejoin society, it is crucial that there are educational programs in the prison system. Not only is it important to develop programs in prison that are educational but if recidivism is a goal then there also needs to be support programs in the community to support the reentry population where they can either continue their education or get assistance in finding a <b>sustainable</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP)was a {{socio-economic}} program {{aimed at}} addressing racial inequalities by creating business and employment opportunities for blacks. However, the RDP was a short-lived policy, mainly due to protest by investors and stakeholders {{who did not have}} any voice {{in the creation of the}} RDP. [...] Critics of the RDP argue that it emphasized macro-economic stability rather than social stability.Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)The Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 aimed to offer new economic opportunities to disadvantaged communities. Its goals include achieving the Constitutional right of equality, increasing broad-based participation of blacks in the economy, protecting the common economic market, and securing equal access to government services. Many scholars see BBBEE as capable of advancing economic growth, promoting new enterprises, and creating <b>sustainable</b> <b>job</b> opportunities for the previously disenfranchised. [...] Issues surrounding monitoring and enforcement are persistent obstacles to the success of BBBEE. Also of note is that BEE allows the beneficiaries to come exclusively from wealthy previously disadvantaged groups.

50|$|Another {{town that}} can be used to observe how the Small Towns Initiative {{implements}} its NC Step Program, is the small town of Old Fort, North Carolina. Incorporated in 1872, Old Fort grew into a productive society that was well known for its American Revolutionary historic influence. The presence of a recreated revolutionary fort, served the town as the main economic engine for most of the early 1900s. With time though, tourists seemed to lose interest in the attraction and tourism began to decline. Another factor that led to Old Fort's economic decline was the closure of two major employers, which were a furniture factory and a textile mill. With unemployment rising without restraint, community leaders felt as though economic development was just driving by the town on Interstate-40.At this time many other communities such as: West Jefferson, Crossnore, Bakerville, and Todd were facing the same economic issues as Old Fort, but were working together to combat the problem. These towns and cities were analogous to Old Fort in many ways but their historical attributes and economic problems were almost parallel. It was through these similarities, that the Rural Center's community coach for Old Fort helped community leaders join The High Country Cluster, which was a regional economic development cluster that had previously been established by the Rural Center. By Old Fort joining the cluster, they were aided by other communities and their coach to adopt a long-term economic development plan, which would incite <b>sustainable</b> <b>job</b> growth through, heritage tourism, arts and crafts production, and secondary home development.|$|E

In discussions with potential supporters in his possible governor bid, dozens of Pennsylvanians urged to challenge Specter, who was considered particularly vulnerable because he had supported the Democrats' stimulus plan. In early March, Toomey began to privately assure supporters he would run against Specter, and during a March 28 keynote address before the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference in Harrisburg he announced, [...] "It's very likely that very soon I will be a candidate for the U.S. Senate," [...] which resulted in a standing ovation from 600 audience members.|$|E
