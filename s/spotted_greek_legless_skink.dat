50|$|Acontias riepelli, or Woodbush <b>legless</b> <b>skink,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>legless</b> <b>skink.</b> It {{is found in the}} Wolkberg {{mountains}} of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Females of the species give birth to live young. This lizard species was formerly placed in a monotypic (single species) genus as Acontophiops lineatus. Morphologically the genus shows similarities to Acontias cregoi (formerly Typhlosaurus cregoi) and a recent review placed both of these within the genus Acontias, which, as Acontias lineatus was already occupied, required a new name for this species.|$|R
50|$|Acontias meleagris, the Cape <b>legless</b> <b>skink,</b> is {{a species}} of skink found in the {{southern}} Cape of South Africa. It has no limbs, like {{most members of the}} subfamily Acontinae.|$|R

50|$|Typhlacontias is a genus of <b>legless,</b> {{burrowing}} <b>skinks</b> in {{the family}} Scincidae, a genus endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. Its sister group is the clade consisting of the genera Feylinia and Melanoseps.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the snake}} is nocturnal, {{it relies on}} smell and taste to hunt its prey. This snake {{typically}} leaves its burrow or hole in search of smaller vertebrates nearby. It preys specifically on lizards, but has also been known to hunt vertebrates such as <b>legless</b> <b>skinks,</b> small rodents and sometimes other snakes. The snake is also known to target those vertebrates who are strictly diurnal, who are sleeping when {{it is on the}} hunt. This snake is known to rear up towards prey or when threatened and then strikes, injecting its venom. In captivity, these snakes are known to eat some types of fish, mice, small rats and also chicken legs, which are preferred by the juveniles.|$|R
50|$|The AMLR region {{comprises}} 68 {{species of}} native reptiles, including turtles, lizards, tortoises, geckos, <b>legless</b> lizards, <b>skinks,</b> snakes and goanna species.

40|$|The {{conservation}} status of relic melanistic lizard species {{occurring in the}} Saldanha- Langebaan area has been investigated. A contact zone between one melanistic form and a closely related non-melanistic form has been examined in detail. Apart from melanis- tic populations of the girdled lizards, Cordylus niger and C. polywnus, a melanistic morphotype of the Cape <b>legless</b> <b>skink,</b> Acontias meleagris meleagris also occurs in the area. The taxonomic status of this morphotype needs to be investigated. At Mauritz Bay, north of Saldanha, the ranges of C niger and the non-melanistic C cordylus are in contact over a distance of approximately 240 m, with maximum overlap of 70 m. The melanistic populations of C. polyz. onus and A. m. meleagris have relatively large ranges in the Saldanha-Langebaan area and are not threatened by urban development. The C niger population, however, is fragmented into several subpopulations, {{and those in the}} Saldanha area, including the contact zone, will be affected if urban development is allowed to continue in the area. As relic populations of other cool-adapted, melanistic invertebrate and lower vertebrate species may also occur in the area, the key areas demarcated by C. niger should be preserved...|$|R
50|$|The curl snake feeds mostly upon {{other small}} {{reptiles}} such as lizards {{but will also}} consume small mammals and frogs to supplement its diet. Mammals may account for up to 20% of the Suta suta dietary intake. The most commonly consumed reptiles include geckos, <b>skinks,</b> <b>legless</b> lizards, other snakes and dragons.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. This study {{examined}} the biogeography and taxonomic status of the Cape <b>legless</b> <b>skink,</b> Acontias meleagris species complex using phylogenetic analyses, population genetics, demographic history aspects, time of lineage diversification estimation, environmental statistic analyses and a morphological evaluation. A total of 231 specimens from 55 localities were collected from the entire known distribution range of the A. meleagris complex throughout the Eastern, Northern and Western Cape, South Africa. Partial sequence {{data were collected from}} two mitochondrial DNA loci, 16 S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit one (COI), and one protein-coding nuclear DNA locus, exophilin 5 (EXPH 5). DNA sequences were analyzed for phylogenetic methods and biogeographical dating, while population genetic analyses were conducted on the COI sequences. Geographical boundaries amongst cryptic lineages were determined and evolutionary drivers of cladogenesis within the species complex were inferred. Marked genetic structure was observed within the A. meleagris complex, and five clades were retrieved, most of which were statistically well supported. These five clades were also evident within the haplotypic analyses and were characterized by demographic stability. Lineage diversification and the current biogeographical patterning observed for lineages within the A. meleagris species complex reflect the impact of sea level oscillations on historical coastal habitat availability. Additional historical evolutionary drivers within this subterranean species complex were inferred and discussed. The five clades within this species complex were considered discrete species, characterised by phylogenetic and biogeographic distinctiveness. While, morphological characters {{that could be used to}} identify the five species demonstrated widespread overlap for morphometric and meristic characters as well as colour pattering. Consequently, the phylogenetic species concept was employed for a taxonomical revision of A. meleagris sensu lato. Here, three of the previously recognised subspecies A. m. meleagris, A. m. orientalis and A. m. orientalis–'lineicauda' were elevated to full species, and two new species A. caurinus sp. nov. and A. parilis sp. nov. were described.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which sexual {{dimorphism}} in snout–vent length, tail length and head shape (length, width and height) manifests itself in the <b>legless</b> fossorial <b>skink</b> subfamily Acontiinae was investigated in representatives of all four of its genera, Acontias, Microacontias, Acontophiops and Typhlosaurus. Where data were available fecundity selection and diet partitioning (ecological causation) were tested as possible proximate causes for dimorphisms found. The possibility of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density was also investigated. The data showed that significant sexual dimorphism in snout–vent length and head shape was present in {{only a minority of}} taxa and that it was absent with respect to tail length. There are indications of a relationship between head shape and microhabitat density, and head shape seems to become increasingly more pointed as SVL increases. A serious impediment to placing {{the findings of this study}} into a firm evolutionary context is the general lack of information about the ecology, social organization and behaviour of the taxa. </strong...|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} known for its {{diversity}} of mammalian fauna, including several species now extinct or greatly reduced on mainland Australia. 13 mammal species exist on the island, including the spectacled hare-wallaby, burrowing bettong (or boodie), golden bandicoot, black-flanked rock-wallaby, Barrow Island euro and Barrow Island mouse (Pseudomys nanus ferculinus). The island is also home to 43 species of terrestrial reptiles including a variety of dragons, <b>legless</b> lizards, geckos, <b>skinks,</b> snakes and monitors. The most recognisable of these is probably the perentie, Australia's biggest lizard and the island's top predator. The island represents important turtle nesting habitat for the green turtle and flatback sea turtle.|$|R

2500|$|The island {{group also}} has a rich fauna, {{including}} several endemic species of birds, such as the Socotra starling (Onychognathus frater), the Socotra sunbird (Nectarinia balfouri), Socotra bunting (Emberiza socotrana), Socotra cisticola (Cisticola haesitatus), Socotra sparrow (Passer insularis), Socotra golden-winged grosbeak (Rhynchostruthus socotranus), and a species in a monotypic genus, the Socotra warbler (Incana incana). Many of the bird species are endangered by predation by non-native feral cats. With only one endemic mammal, 6 endemic bird species and no amphibians, reptiles constitute the most relevant Socotran vertebrate fauna with 31 species. If one excludes the two recently introduced species, Hemidactylus robustus and Hemidactylus flaviviridis, all native species are endemic. There is {{a very high level}} of endemism at both species (29 of 31, 94%) and genus levels (5 of 12, 42%). At the species level, endemicity may be even higher, as phylogenetic studies have uncovered substantial hidden diversity. [...] The reptiles species include <b>skinks,</b> <b>legless</b> lizards, and one species of chameleon, Chamaeleo monachus. There are many endemic invertebrates, including several spiders (such as the tarantula Monocentropus balfouri) and three species of freshwater crabs (one Socotra and two Socotrapotamon).|$|R

40|$|Darwin's works {{provoked}} {{an enormous}} response in many disciplines including the literary world. This paper presents {{a portion of}} my doctoral thesis 3, which responds to a blind <b>spot</b> in <b>Greek</b> literary scholarship on evolutionary ideas in comparison to other Western countries. Little work to date focuses on modern Greek writers's responses to Darwinian and other evolutionary ideas. This paper explores the impact of Darwin in selected writings of Emmanuel Roidis and how Roidis satirised Darwinism in his essays and short stories, contributing to the Darwinian discourse on "man's place in nature" and by placing humanity on the same continuum as other primates. The year 2009 marks the 200 th anniversary of Darwin's birth and the 150 th anniversary of the first publication of his The Origin of Species. It is timely, then, to consider Darwin's impact on modern Greek literature...|$|R

500|$|The Battle of Lemnos {{resulted}} from an Ottoman plan {{to lure the}} faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to hunt down Hamidiye. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from its position. By mid-January, the Ottomans had learned that Georgios Averof remained with the Greek fleet, and so Kalyon Kaptanı (Captain) Ramiz Numan Bey, the Ottoman fleet commander, decided to attack the Greeks regardless. Turgut Reis, Barbaros Hayreddin, and other units of the Ottoman fleet departed the Dardanelles at 08:20 {{on the morning of}} 18 January, and sailed toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of [...] Barbaros Hayreddin led the line of battleships, with a flotilla of torpedo boats {{on either side of the}} formation.

40|$|In a {{syllable}} monitoring experiment, Greek and English speakers (N = 20 per language) monitored for [ma] {{embedded in}} Greek real and nonce words; [ma] was word-initial, word-medial or word-final, and stressed, unstressed or rhythmically stressed. Both groups spotted stressed [ma] faster than unstressed [ma]; unstressed [ma] was <b>spotted</b> faster by <b>Greek</b> than English participants. Rhythmically stressed [ma] patterned with unstressed [ma] for both groups. Word category (real or nonce) {{did not affect}} latencies. These results show that stress {{played an important role}} whether participants were responding to unfamiliar (nonce) stimuli (Greeks) or processing in an altogether unfamiliar language with different stress requirements (English). The importance of stress did not depend on rhythm class, as has sometimes been argued, though familiarity with language did affect responses. The results do not support the view that processing is related to rhythm class and confirm that Greek makes only a binary stress distinction...|$|R
