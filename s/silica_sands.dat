Enterprise is the largest mine on the island and accounted for 60% of the island's production in 2011. [...] It operates in close proximity to the Eighteen mile Swamp along a migrating dredge path with a buffer zone from the wetlands prescribed by the Queensland Government. Conservationists have expressed concern that these buffer zones, the smallest of which is 25 m, are inadequate to protect the RAMSAR listed wetlands from pollution and will fail to protect the waterways, citing evidence from the 1976 inquiry into sandmining on Fraser Island which found even 500 m buffer between areas mined and wetlands was ‘totally inadequate’. In 2009, 500000 t of minerals were being produced by mining about 50 million tonnes of sand. Sibelco Australia produces 500000 to 600000 t of sand annually (approximately one per cent of North Stradbroke Island's total sand). The silica extracted is used mainly in glass production, but also in digital tablets such as iPads. The mineral sands are used in paints, plastics, metals, cosmetics and biotechnological devices (such as prosthesis), both for domestic and international markets. The international market for Australian mineral sands, sold through Iluka resources, is mainly China where 80% of exports are used as pigment in paints.

The main properties of silica sand that are essentially related to the traditional moulding and core-making processes are: size distribution, clay content, pH, acid demand, and refractoriness. The silica sand used for 3 DP must also be appropriately selected for the layer-based manufacturing process involved in 3 DP. Properties such as grain size distribution, grain surface morphology, angularity, flowability, and recoating abilities have a particular importance when determining sand suitability.
