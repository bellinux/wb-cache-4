25|$|Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's {{home until}} {{the last week of}} June 1934; that on some {{occasions}} they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived {{on the north side of}} Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
500|$|Hill climbed {{with and}} became {{involved}} with climber John Long {{at the end of}} the 1970s. Their relationship began in the summer of 1978 when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> recite a poem he had written about a female climber and what kind of man she wanted.Hill and Long climbed together and worked out together, lifting weights and running. It was at his suggestion that she attempted to break the world record for the bench press in her weight class (...) however, while she could easily lift [...] while training, in competition she froze. Hill and Long spent the winter of 1981 in Las Vegas, Nevada climbing during the day and working nights at [...] "dead end jobs" [...] like pizza waitress.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, in vacant surprise, doubting whether <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> aright.|$|R
60|$|She ceased; <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> at last. <b>She</b> {{pressed her}} hand to her forehead.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not sure}} <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> {{and was about to}} repeat her question.|$|R
2500|$|Clara Schumann proved {{especially}} vehement. [...] After <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{play the}} Mendelssohn C minor Trio in 1857, she wrote that [...] "he so rattled it off that I {{did not know}} how to control myself ... and often he so annihilated fiddle and cello that I ... could hear nothing of them." [...] Nor had things improved in Clara's view a few years later, when Rubinstein gave a concert in Breslau. [...] She noted in her diary, [...] "I was furious, for he no longer plays. [...] Either there is a perfectly wild noise or else a whisper with the soft pedal down. [...] And a would-be cultured audience puts up with a performance like that! ...|$|E
2500|$|His third album, Viaggio Italiano, was {{released}} in Italy in 1996. He was invited to sing a duet with English soprano Sarah Brightman at the final bout of German boxer Henry Maske. Brightman had approached Bocelli after <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> singing [...] "Con te partirò" [...] whilst she was dining in a restaurant. Changing the title lyric of the song to [...] "Time to Say Goodbye", they re-recorded it as a duet {{with members of the}} London Symphony Orchestra and sang it as a farewell for Maske. The single debuted atop the German charts, where it stayed for fourteen weeks. With sales nearing three million copies, and a sextuple platinum award, [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] eclipsed the previous best-selling single by more than one million copies. He topped the Spanish singles chart in 1996 with a duet with Marta Sánchez, [...] "Vivo Por Ella", the Spanish version of [...] "Vivo per lei", recorded with Giorgia for his 1997 compilation album, Romanza. He also recorded a Portuguese version of the song with Brazilian singer Sandy.|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} of the room, and <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> walking about his room in the L, putting {{together}} his few belongings. Then <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> go down and open the furnace door, and she knew he was giving a final conscientious look at the fire. He closed it, and <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> close the basement door behind him, and knew that he was gone.|$|E
60|$|His {{sterling}} worth {{had worked}} a cure, <b>She</b> never <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> grumble; <b>She</b> saw his soul {{was good and}} pure, Although his rank was humble.|$|R
60|$|He bowed, and {{she turned}} away--standing there, averted, with {{her eyes on the}} ground, for some moments after <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> close the door of the room.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a number}} of {{complimentary}} and adulatory phrases to the Queen herself, and many ceremonial bowings towards the palace, as if <b>she</b> actually <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> the messenger spoke as follows-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him,</b> with {{a certain}} dogged resignation, to the end.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> in rapturous silence. Her kiss had {{answered}} for her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b> She {{lifted her}} feebly declining head. She looked. She knew.|$|E
60|$|But {{even then}} she could not believe. Something in her, made hard by the {{intensity}} of her suffering, refused to melt. And her head was throbbing, and <b>she</b> scarcely <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh Dick!' she said, when <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> to an end, 'how brave you are, and how proud. Yet I {{would not}} be proud with a father. I would tell him all.' ...|$|R
60|$|At ten {{that night}} he climbed the ladder in the haunted house, pale, weak, and wretched. Roxy was {{standing}} in the door of one of the rooms, waiting, for <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tears {{came into}} her eyes for very pity of herself as <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{go out at}} {{the front}} door, and felt some contrition.|$|E
60|$|Mr Merryboy ignored deafness. He {{continued}} {{to speak to}} his mother just as though <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|That evening, however, a lad who {{had been}} sent out of the town to drive in some cattle, had {{returned}} with the tidings which <b>she,</b> Mami, <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> deliver to Ibubesi with her own ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Dick!" [...] she said, when <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> to an end, [...] "how brave you are, and how proud! Yet I {{would not}} be proud with a father. I would tell him all." ...|$|R
60|$|She let the {{question}} pass, without {{a sign to}} show that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b> He angrily repeated it. She wrote on her slate, {{and held it out}} to him--still without raising her eyes to his face.|$|R
60|$|Corny did not reply. I {{doubt if}} <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b> Her soul still ached for her fallen queen.|$|E
60|$|To her amaze, Glenn laughed. When had <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> laugh? It thrilled her, yet nettled her a little.|$|E
60|$|She felt Oliver Haddo {{take her}} hands. She {{would not let}} him drag them away. Then <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak.|$|E
60|$|Antonio inquired {{whether she}} knew {{the name of this}} impetuous admirer? She replied that he had made his {{advances}} under a fictitious name; but that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> once called by the name of Don Ambrosio de Loxa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three or four months," [...] said Brooke, {{and looking}} up saw that the girl's {{eyes were fixed on}} him. She turned them away next moment, but he felt that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> and they would be companions that long.|$|R
50|$|Bates {{passed a}} {{rehabilitation}} program in 2008 at a Salvation Army center in Newark, N.J. Citing confidentiality laws, Capt. Carol Austin only indirectly acknowledged Bates' involvement, saying the last <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> {{was he was}} headed to Portland in 2008.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> coming down, {{and almost}} {{hoped to be}} spared the meeting, but, after a moment's pause, he entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allie." [...] He {{repeated}} {{her name}} before <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him.</b> Then she looked up. The depths--the tragic lonesomeness--of her eyes--haunted Neale.|$|E
60|$|He {{rose and}} went. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> turn {{the handle of}} the door, heard his {{footsteps}} upon the stone stairs outside.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, a little surprised. Always thoughtful, always sympathetic, {{generally}} stimulating, {{it was very}} seldom that <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak with so much real feeling. Suddenly {{he turned his head}} from the sea. His eyes seemed to challenge hers.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{promised he}} would not be rash and went off, half amused, to get some water. Carrie was very staunch, but he did not want her to be {{disturbed}} about him. He was sorry <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> steal out of camp.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> so {{far with}} a feeling that she had dropped some {{material}} word which made sense of the rest. She could hear no more of this unintelligible rambling without checking him. She {{felt that she was}} overhearing what was meant for another.|$|R
