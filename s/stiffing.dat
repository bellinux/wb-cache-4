5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for <b>stiffing</b> her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E

60|$|Next day Carley motored through Central Park, {{and out of}} town into Westchester County, {{finding some}} relief from the <b>stiffing</b> heat. But she seemed {{to look at the}} dusty trees and the worn greens without really seeing them. In the {{afternoon}} she called on friends, and had dinner at home with her aunt, and then went to a theatre. The musical comedy was good, but the almost unbearable heat and the vitiated air spoiled her enjoyment. That night upon arriving home at midnight she stepped out of the taxi, and involuntarily, without thought, looked up to see the stars. But there were no stars. A murky yellow-tinged blackness hung low over the city. Carley recollected that stars, and sunrises and sunsets, and untainted air, and silence were not for city dwellers. She checked any continuation of the thought.|$|E

The heat of that <b>stiffing</b> place oppressed me; my blood seemed to be afire. I {{knew that there was}} a stream in a gorge about half a mile away, for it had been pointed out to me. I longed for a swim in cool water, who, to tell truth, had found none for some days, and bethought me that I would bathe in this stream before I trekked from that hateful spot, for to me it had become hateful. Calling my driver, who was awake and talking with the voorloopers, for they knew what was passing at the kraal and were alarmed, I told them to get the oxen ready to start as I would be back presently. Then I set off for the stream and, after a longish walk, {{scrambled}} down a steep ravine to its banks, following a path made by Kaffir women going to draw water. Arrived there at last I found that it was in flood and rising rapidly, at least so I judged from the sound, for in that deep, tree-hung place the light was too faint to allow me to see anything. So I sat down waiting for the dawn and wishing that I had not come because of the mosquitoes.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we shall}} {{incorporate}} a <b>stiff</b> {{era in the}} Universe's evolution {{in the context of}} $F(R) $ gravity. After deriving the vacuum $F(R) $ gravity, which may realize a <b>stiff</b> evolution, we combine the <b>stiff</b> $F(R) $ gravity with an $R^ 2 $ model, and we construct a qualitative model for the inflationary and <b>stiff</b> era, with the latter commencing {{after the end of the}} inflationary era. We assume that the baryogenesis occurs during the <b>stiff</b> era, and we calculate the baryon to entropy ratio, which effectively constraints the functional form of the <b>stiff</b> $F(R) $ gravity. Further constraints on the <b>stiff</b> $F(R) $ gravity may come from the primordial gravitational waves, and particularly their scalar mode, which is characteristic of the $F(R) $ gravity theory. The <b>stiff</b> era presence does not contradict the standard cosmology era, namely, inflation, and the radiation-matter domination eras.

40|$|We shall {{discuss the}} general {{relativistic}} generation of spikes in a massless scalar field or <b>stiff</b> perfect fluid model.

We then present a new two-parameter family of non-OT G 2 <b>stiff</b> fluid spike solutions, obtained by the generalization of non-OT G 2 vacuum spike solutions to the <b>stiff</b> fluid case by applying Geroch's transformation on a Jacobs seed. The dynamics of these new <b>stiff</b> fluid spike solutions is qualitatively {{different from that of}} the vacuum spike solutions in that the matter (<b>stiff</b> fluid) feels the spike directly and the <b>stiff</b> fluid spike solution can end up with a permanent spike. We then derive the evolution equations of non-OT G 2 <b>stiff</b> fluid models, including a second perfect fluid, in full generality, and briefly discuss some of their qualitative properties and their potential numerical analysis. Finally, we discuss how a fluid, and especially a <b>stiff</b> fluid or massless scalar field, affects the physics of the generation of spikes...|$|R

50|$|An amour {{bulkhead}} generally {{consists of}} three parts, the bomb deck (decapping plate), the splinter deck, and the main armour deck/plate. The decapping plate is designed to detonate incoming ordnance on contact and cause it to break apart. The main armour deck is usually some form of material that is very efficient {{in its ability to}} dissipate heat. It is also generally highly compressed (dense) in the neighborhood of 50-80% and face hardened to ensure it not only stops the projectile, but absorbs the enormous amount of energy form the impact/blast. The main belt is usually corrugated, and or inclined, as this does not allow for an object to collide directly with it at an ideal 90 degrees, but rather deflects it and causes it to begin to tumble and break apart. If the armors work together as intended, the projectile will explode or break apart between the bomb/splinter deck and the main armour deck. The splinter deck is designed to contain any fragments and pieces of armour which might be broken off from the projectile or ship itself. Behind all this is usually some kind of dilatant shock absorbing material (dynamic sheer <b>stiffing</b> fluid) that will absorb and dissipate the shock. Newer armors like Chobham armour, ETC are shape-memory dynamic reactive armors. Usually a ballistic textile like Kevlar impregnated with ceramics containing nanoparticle substances like depleted uranium, titanium, ETC., in numerous layers. It is very likely Galactica has a very advanced composite type armor as well.|$|E

40|$|More {{beef cattle}} are {{slaughtered}} in Nebraska each year {{than in any}} other state. Beef tallow, beef fat, is the by-product of this industry. The objectives of this project were to utilize this by-product by converting it into biodiesel, methyl esters, and to optimize this conversion process. ^ Transesterification of beef tallow was investigated. The solubility of ethanol in beef tallow was much greater than that of methanol. At 68 °C the solubility of methanol was 13 % w/w, while the solubility of ethanol was 100 % w/w at 68 °C. The percentage of total methanol in the glycerol phase was higher than that in the beef tallow methyl ester (BTME) phase in a 90 : 10 blend of BTME and glycerol at room temperature. However, the percentage of total methanol in BTME (60 % w/w) was higher than that in glycerol (40 % w/w) in the same blend ratio at above 65 °C. After the reaction, the products were distilled to recover as much of the unreacted methanol as possible, which also made the subsequent phase separation of esters and glycerol quicker and easier. At neutral pH, the phase separation and water washing were easier because the emulsion was substantially reduced. ^ A simple BTME quantitation. method was developed, by which fatty acid methyl esters in the product can be calibrated with a standard curve of oleic acid methyl ester. ^ Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was more effective than sodium methoxide at catalyzing the transesterification. NaOH reached its maximum activity at 0. 3 % w/w of the beef tallow. The content of free fatty acids should be kept below 0. 5 % w/w and water content below 0. 4 % w/w. The transesterification of beef tallow was complete after 15 min. ^ For the transesterification of beef tallow and methanol, <b>stiffing</b> was very important to make the reaction occur Adding the NaOH-methanol solution to melted beef tallow after stirring was better than adding before <b>stiffing.</b> Lower stirring speeds and shorter stirring times lowered the energy requirements without sacrificing conversion efficiency. ...|$|E
