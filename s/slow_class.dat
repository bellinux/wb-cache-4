Myosin heavy chain expression was assayed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of extracted myosin and by immunostaining of cultures of myotubes. Myotubes that formed from embryonic day 5 - 6 pectoral myoblasts synthesized both a fast and a <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> of myosin heavy chain, which were electrophoretically and immunologically distinct, but only the fast class of myosin heavy chain was synthesized by myotubes that formed in cultures of embryonic day 8 or older myoblasts. Furthermore, three types of myotubes formed in cultures of embryonic day 5 - 6 myoblasts: one that contained only a fast myosin heavy chain, a second that contained only a slow myosin heavy chain, and a third that contained both a fast and a slow heavy chain. Myotubes that formed in cultures of embryonic day 8 or older myoblasts, however, were of a single type that synthesized only a fast class of myosin heavy chain. Regardless of whether myoblasts from embryonic day 6 pectoral muscle were cultured alone or mixed with {{an equal number of}} myoblasts from embryonic day 12 muscle, the number of myotubes that formed and contained a <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> of myosin was the same. These results demonstrate that the <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> of myosin heavy chain can be synthesized by myotubes formed in cell culture, and that three types of myotubes form in culture from pectoral muscle myoblasts that are isolated early in development, but only one type of myotube forms from older myoblasts; and they suggest that muscle fiber formation probably depends upon different populations of myoblasts that co-exist and remain distinct during myogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Many adult avian muscles contain {{two types}} of muscle fiber: those that receive {{innervation}} at single focal terminals and those with multiple terminals. The muscles of the syrinx, the vocal organ of birds, are such mixed muscles. To study this heterogeneity of fiber type and innervation, we combined immunocytochemistry to classify muscle fibers with techniques to visualize neuromuscular junctions. One monoclonal antibody, S 58, directed against a <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> of myosin, labels only fibers that have multiple terminals. We also examined the distribution of immunoreactivity for neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), which has been suggested {{to play a role}} in innervation of muscle and formation of neuromuscular junctions. S 58 -positive fibers have elevated N-CAM staining, indicating that multiple innervation of a fiber is correlated with the fiber's expression of high levels of N-CAM immunoreactivity. Most, and perhaps all, fibers that have multiple terminals also contain abundant N-CAM immunoreactivity. This suggests that N-CAM may play a role in the maintenance of multiterminal innervation in adult innervated muscle...|$|E
40|$|Using the tritium Sephadex method, {{the number}} of {{exchangeable}} protons in E. coli 5 S RNA and the kinetics of their exchange reactions have been measured at two different Mg++ concentrations (10 (- 2) M and 10 (- 3) M). A quantitative analysis of these results indicates the presence of two classes of protons exchanging with very different rates. The protons of the <b>slow</b> <b>class,</b> not seen in linear molecules of double helical RNA, exchange with a half-time of 0. 6 hour and their exchange kinetics are independent of Mg++ concentration. Reduction of the Mg++ concentration from 10 (- 2) ot 10 (- 3) M, however, results in a decrease in {{the number of}} these exchangeable protons form 26 to 19. Neither the total number, nor the exchange kinetics of the fast protons are affected by this change in Mg++ concentration. Comparison of these results with those previously obtained with tRNA, suggests the presence of a Mg++ dependent tertiary structure in 5 S RNA. The number of exchangeable protons obtained from extrapolation of the exchange curves (120 and 126 respectively for 10 (- 3) and 10 (- 2) M Mg++ concentration) are compared to the calculated number of exchangeable protons predicted by previous proposed structural models for E.

A field infiltration test was carried out and precipitation concentration index (PCI) was estimated for over a 30 year period. Soil bulk density was determined and porosity inferred. The PCI indicated that 100 % of rainfall in Northern Region for 1977 - 2012 has been uniform in distribution and should not pose flood threat assuming rainfall is the only determinant. For the same period in the Upper East Region, 46 % – 54 % of the rainfall distribution is indicative that could be succeptible to flash flood.

40|$|A clonal {{analysis}} was used to show that skeletal muscle myoblasts are committed to distinct cell lineages during development. Myoblasts taken from embryonic chicken hindlimb muscles of different ages were cultured at clonal density. The content of fast and slow classes of the myosin heavy chain isoforms in the myotubes of the resulting muscle colonies was determined immunocytochemically with specific monoclonal antibodies that served as markers for the different fiber types. The muscle colonies formed by cloning myoblasts from early hindlimbs (days 4 - 6 in ovo) were of three types: the most numerous type, in which all myotubes in a colony contained only the fast class of myosin heavy chain; a less numerous type, in which all myotubes in a colony contained both the fast and slow classes of myosin heavy chain isoforms; and a rare type, in which all myotubes in a colony contained only the <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> of myosin heavy chain. The muscle colonies formed by cloning myoblasts from later hindlimbs (days 10 - 12 in ovo) were, however, all of one type, in which every myotube in a colony contained only fast myosin heavy chain. Thus, myoblasts in the early embryo (days 4 - 6 in ovo) were a heterogeneous population committed to three myogenic lineages: fast, mixed fast/slow, and slow, whereas myoblasts from the later embryo (days 10 - 12 in ovo) were only in the fast myogenic lineage. These results suggest that muscle fiber formation is rooted in two developmental phases [...] an early phase in which diverse fiber types are formed from intrinsically diverse populations of myoblasts and a later phase in which fibers are formed from a single population of myoblasts...|$|E

In {{the presence of}} the phosphatase inhibitor NaF (10 mM), the redox dependency of phosphorylation is found to be essentially unchanged: Em = + 50 ± 3 mV, n = 1. 02 ± 0. 04. Thylakoid membranes were phosphorylated in the light and then incubated at various redox potentials for 15 min in the dark; no redox dependency was observed in the dephosphorylation of any of the 17 bands then distinguishable by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. The phosphoprotein phosphatase reactions can be divided arbitrarily into four kinetic classes: the fastest, class I, includes LHC II; the moderate class II includes D 1 and D 2; the <b>slow</b> <b>class</b> III includes CP 43 and the 9 kDa phosphoprotein; finally, a 19. 5 kDa protein exhibited no loss of 32 P at all. In separate experiments we measured thylakoid protein dephosphorylation initiated by changing the redox potential from − 140 to + 200 mV, in {{the presence or absence of}} fluoride. In this case the results are consistent with at least two kinetically distinguishable classes of phosphoprotein phosphatase reactions. We conclude that thylakoid protein phosphatase reactions are kinetically heterogeneous and redox-independent. It follows that the redox dependency of thylakoid protein phosphorylation is a property of thylakoid protein kinase reactions.

Myoblasts from the hindlimb bud, forelimb bud, trunk, and pectoral regions of the early chicken embryo and hindlimb bud of the early quail embryo (days 3 - 6 in ovo) were committed to three distinct lineages with 60 - 90 % of the myoblasts in the fast lineage, 10 - 40 % in the mixed fast/slow lineage, and 0 - 3 % in the slow lineage depending on the age and species of the myoblast donor. In contrast, 99 - 100 % of the myoblasts in the later embryos (days 9 - 12 in ovo) were in the fast lineage. Serial subculturing from a single myoblast demonstrated that commitment to a particular lineage was stably inherited for over 30 cell doublings. When myoblasts from embryos {{of the same age}} were cultured, the percentage of muscle colonies of the fast, fast/slow, and slow types that formed in clonal cultures was the same as the percentage of myotubes of each of these types that formed in high density cultures, indicating that intercellular contact between myoblasts of different lineages did not affect the type of myotube formed. An analysis in vivo showed that three types of primary myotubes- -fast, fast/slow, and slow [...] were also found in the chicken thigh at day 7 in ovo and that synthesis of both the fast and <b>slow</b> <b>classes</b> of MHC isoforms was concomitant with the formation of primary myotubes. On the basis of these results, we propose that in the avian embryo, there is an early phase of muscle fiber formation in which primary myotubes with differing MHC contents are formed from myoblasts committed to three intrinsically different primary myogenic lineages independent of innervation and a later phase in which secondary myotubes are formed from myoblasts in a single, secondary myogenic lineage with maturation and maintenance of fiber diversity dependent on innervation...|$|R

However, the hippocampus contains slow biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to the theta rhythm, either as a resonance activated by extrinsic input or as a purely local phenomenon.

Simulated interneuronal networks with fast and slow synaptic kinetics can generate mixed theta-gamma rhythmicity under restricted conditions, including strong connections among each population, weaker connections between the two populations, and homogeneity of cellular properties and drive. Under a broader range of conditions, including heterogeneity, the networks can amplify and resynchronize phasic responses to weak phase-dispersed external drive at theta frequencies to either GABAA,slow or GABAA,fast cells.

Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is an established switching paradigm for the initiation of core optical networks.

The electrophoretically <b>slower</b> <b>class,</b> NS 1, abundant in the intracellular soluble pool, has a lower activity in transcription; it contained six chymotryptic phosphopeptides.

In the electrophoretically faster nucleocapsid-associated NS 2 class of molecules, which support {{a higher rate of}} transcription, another group of eight phosphopeptides was superimposed on this pattern.
