40|$|In the {{academic}} {{literature in the}} West, Abul A'la Mawdudi and Sayyid Qutb are {{often referred to as}} the thinkers who have, through <b>their</b> <b>thinking</b> and activism, set the foundations for radical Islamist ideas which are said to have served as the basis for the emergence of jihadist movements. Moreover, <b>in</b> the West <b>their</b> intellectual heritage and thought have been to a great extent identified as the same. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show impartially the true nature of their political thought, and <b>in</b> addition to <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thinking</b> identify differences <b>in</b> <b>their</b> development, intellectual approach and activism. This attempt at differentiating opinions of the two Muslim intellectuals comes as a result of insight into the fact that scientists in the West are often inclined to a gross simplification and identifying of Islamic thinkers and movements for the sake of ideologically coloured academic prerequisites, and without deeper analyses. This paper will also provide terminology solutions for certain aspects of Islamic activism...|$|R
