50|$|<b>Shale</b> <b>shakers</b> are {{the primary}} solids {{separation}} tool on a rig. After returning {{to the surface of}} the well the used drilling fluid flows directly to the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers</b> where it begins to be processed. Once processed by the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers</b> the drilling fluid is deposited into the mud tanks where other solid control equipment begin to remove the finer solids from it. The solids removed by the shale shaker are discharged out of the discharge port into a separate holding tank where they await further treatment or disposal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shale</b> <b>shakers</b> are {{considered}} {{by most of}} the drilling industry {{to be the most important}} device in the solid control system as the performance of the successive equipment directly relates to the cleanliness of the treated drilling fluid.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the possum belly is to slow {{the flow of the}} {{drilling}} fluid (after it has gained momentum from coming down through the flow line) so that it does not shoot off of the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Supporting {{equipment}} is often required, and may include a drilling fluid (mud) recycling system, <b>shale</b> <b>shaker,</b> mud cleaner, centrifugal pump, and mud tanks.|$|R
50|$|A Possum belly, on a {{drilling}} rig, is a metal container {{at the head}} of the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> that receives the flow of drilling fluid and is directly connected to and at the end of the flow line. A possum belly may also be referred to as a distribution box or flowline trap.|$|R
50|$|Solids {{control is}} a {{technique}} used in a drilling rig to separate the solids in the drilling fluids that are crushed by the drill bits and carried out of the well surface. Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the mud tank, <b>shale</b> <b>shaker,</b> vacuum degasser, desander, desilter, and centrifuge. The <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75μm, the desander addresses solids from 45-74μm, and the desilter segregates solids between 15-44μm. Sometimes the desander and desilter are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a vacuum degasser is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted {{on the top of}} the mud tank. After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again.|$|R
50|$|The possum belly {{is used to}} {{slow the}} flow of {{returning}} drilling fluid before it hits the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers.</b> This enables the shale shaker to clean the cuttings out of the drilling fluid before it is returned to the pits for circulation.|$|E
5000|$|A Bell nipple is {{a section}} of large {{diameter}} pipe fitted {{to the top of}} the blowout preventers that the flow line attaches to via a side outlet, to allow the drilling fluid to flow back over the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers</b> to the mud tanks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shale</b> <b>shakers</b> are {{components}} of drilling equipment {{used in many}} industries, such as coal cleaning, mining, oil and gas drilling. They are {{the first phase of}} a solids control system on a drilling rig, and are used to remove large solids (cuttings) from the drilling fluid ("Mud").|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} mud gas separator is relatively simple. On the figure, {{the mud and}} gas mixture is fed at the inlet allowing it to impinge {{on a series of}} baffles designed to separate gas and mud. The free gas then is moved into the flare line to reduce the threat of toxic and hazardous gases and the mud then discharges to the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> and to the tank.|$|R
5000|$|Some shakers {{come with}} an {{optional}} third motor on the shaker bed, this motor {{is most often}} used to modify the elliptical motion of the basket making it more circular therefore [...] "soften" [...] the motion, but comes {{at a cost of}} decreased G's and slower conveyance of the cuttings. This motion is usually used for sticky solids.NOV Brandt VSM 300 <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> is the world’s first balanced elliptical motion shaker.|$|R
50|$|Desanders and desilters {{are solid}} control {{equipment}} {{with a set}} of hydrocyclones that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluids in drilling rigs. Desanders are installed on top of the mud tank following the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> and the degasser, but before the desilter. Desander removes the abrasive solids from the drilling fluids which cannot be removed by shakers. Normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45~74μm, and 15~44μm for desilter.|$|R
50|$|Drill {{cuttings}} {{are produced}} as the rock is {{broken by the}} drill bit advancing through the rock or soil; the cuttings are usually carried to the surface by drilling fluid circulating up from the drill bit. Drill cuttings can be separated from liquid drilling fluid by <b>shale</b> <b>shakers,</b> by centrifuges, or by cyclone separators, the latter also being effective for air drilling. In cable-tool drilling, the drill cuttings are periodically bailed out of {{the bottom of the}} hole. In auger drilling, cuttings are carried to the surface on the auger flights.|$|E
50|$|For a new well in {{the process}} of being drilled, this would be the void between the drill string and the {{formation}} being drilled. An easy way to visualise this would be to stand a straw (purple in diagram) straight up in the center of a glass of water. All of the water in between the straw and the sides of the glass would be the annulus (yellow area in diagram), with the straw itself representing the drill string and the sides of the glass representing the formation. While drilling, drilling fluid is pumped down the inside of the drill string and pushes the drill cuttings up the annulus to the surface, where the cuttings are removed from the drilling fluid (drilling mud) by the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Derrickhand or Derrickman {{position}} varies {{greatly from}} one drilling rig to another. He almost always reports {{directly to the}} driller. The name derrickman comes from the position that he normally occupies, {{which is at the}} top of the derrick. From this position he guides the stands of drill pipe, typically 90 feet (27 meters) long, into the fingers at the top of the derrick while tripping (removing the drill string) out of the hole. When tripping into the hole (or Running In) he will pull the pipe out of the fingers and guide it into the elevators suspended from the top drive. Traditionally, the derrickman also works closely with the mud engineer (see drilling fluid) when not tripping pipe since he is not needed in the derrick. In this capacity it is his responsibility for monitoring the pH level, level of Calcium, viscosity and the mud weight (density), adding sacks of chemicals (25-100 lb each) to the mud or oil to maintain the desired properties, and monitor the mud level in the mud pits to aid in the well control. He is also responsible for the <b>shale</b> <b>shakers</b> and the mud pumps (making sure they run well and fixing them when a fault occurs). The derrickman is also responsible for the transfer of additional fluids or chemicals (e.g.: Barite, Bentonite or oil-based fluids) from bulk silos or tanks (tank farm) to the mud system.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} the mud tanks that are needed on the {{drilling}} rig depends on {{the depth of the}} well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> and vacuum degasser and desander are mounted together on the same mud tank as the first tank at the oilfield, while desilter and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, emergency tank, etc.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{observations and}} measurements of viscous properties {{of different types}} of model drilling fluids when these fluids are imposed to vibrations of different frequencies and amplitudes. These vibrations simulate the motion on a <b>shale</b> <b>shaker.</b> Our experimental data shows clearly a reduction in shear stress and gel strength caused by vibrations in drilling fluids where particles build the structures in the fluids. For purely polymeric drilling fluids no effect was seen when imposing vibrations...|$|R

In consideration of affecting factors, sieving model equations including kinematic equations and continuity equation for drilling fluid <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> are established. This paper shows a novel solution to the sieving model equations by using average energy principle and finite differential method. The computer simulation program of flow capacity of the shaker is developed. The model will be of great significance in evaluating screening performance and screen selection...|$|R
40|$|Wellbore {{instability}} {{appears to}} be a serious problem during drilling process through shale. Shales instability cause basically comes out of its mineralogical composition (especially clay minerals content) and physico-chemical properties. Many research activities about shale instability causes and shale properties (affecting shale behavior during interaction with water phase of different drilling muds) definition have been carried out by now. In these laboratory tests were used original shales samples given by coring process or collecting shale cuttings from <b>shale</b> <b>shakers,</b> and different shale samples from outcrop. From this reason is very difficult compare laboratory tests results given by different authors. Possible solution is use artificial shale samples (pellets) with exact mineralogical composition, enabling extensive laboratory tests and tests results comparison. In this paper presented laboratory tests of pellets swelling in inhibitive muds (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|E
40|$|Maurer Technology Inc. (MTI) {{formed a}} joint-industry {{partnership}} {{to fund the}} development of a hollow sphere dual-gradient drilling (DGD) system. Phase I consisted of collecting, compiling, analyzing, and distributing information and data regarding a new DGD system for use by the oil and gas industry. Near the end of Phase I, DOE provided funding to the project that was used to conduct a series of critical follow-on tests investigating sphere separation in weighted waterbase and oilbase muds. Drilling costs in deep water are high because seawater pressure on the ocean floor creates a situation where many strings of casing are required due to the relatively close spacing between fracture and pore pressure curves. Approximately $ 100 million have been spent {{during the past five years}} on DGD systems that place pumps on the seafloor to reduce these drilling problems by reducing the annulus fluid pressure at the bottom of the riser. BP estimates that a DGD system can save $ 9 million per well in the Thunderhorse Field and Conoco estimates it can save $ 5 to $ 15 million per well in its deepwater operations. Unfortunately, previous DGD development projects have been unsuccessful due to the high costs ($ 20 to $ 50 million) and reliability problems with seafloor pump systems. MTI has been developing a simple DGD system concept that would pump hollow glass spheres into the bottom of the riser to reduce density of the mud in the riser. This eliminates the requirement for seafloor pumps and replaces them with low cost mud pumps, <b>shale</b> <b>shakers,</b> and other oilfield equipment that can be operated on the rig by conventional crews. A $ 1. 8 million Phase I joint-industry project funded by five service companies and three operators showed that hollow spheres could be pumped well, but difficulties were encountered in separating the spheres from a polymer mud supplied by Halliburton due to the high viscosity of this mud at the low shear rates encountered on oilfield shale shaker screens. As a result, an excessive amount of this polymer mud flowed across the screen with the beads instead of through the screen. At the completion of the Phase I project, it was concluded that the hollow sphere system would not work effectively with the polymer mud tested. ExxonMobil and Shell engineers proposed that additional sphere separation tests needed to be conducted with weighted oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds to determine if the DGD system would work with these muds. The DOE agreed to provide a $ 200, 000 grant for these tests. The DOE-funded tests, described in this report, showed that the spheres could be pumped with conventional oilfield centrifugal and triplex mud pumps and separated effectively from both oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds using conventional oilfield <b>shale</b> <b>shakers</b> and hydrocyclones. As a result of the success of these DOE tests, this DGD system is ready for full-scale field testing, first on land wells and later in the offshore environment. Maurer Technology Inc. is currently proposing a Phase II project to oil companies to further develop this DGD concept. This project would be funded by four to eight operators. If Phase II tests are successful, Noble plans to commercialize this system with a service company partner that will market and operate the DGD system on Noble's and other drilling contractors' rigs...|$|E
30|$|Particle size {{distribution}} is extensively used by geologists in geomorphological studies to evaluate sedimentation and alluvial processes and by civil engineers to evaluate materials used for foundations, road fill, and other construction purposes. In {{the oil and}} gas industry, analysis of particle {{size distribution}} is used to determine filtration loss properties, and the amount of solids retained in the DF after the fluid is pumped into the system. A DF containing particles of sizes ranging up to the requisite maximum should be able to effectively bridge the formation and form a filter cake (in the case of a water-based drilling fluid). Above 10 Darcys or in fractures, larger particles are required, and most likely the amounts needed to minimize spurt losses increase with the size of the openings. In general, with the increasing concentration of bridging particles, bridging occurs faster, and spurt loss declines (Barrett et al. 2005; Growcock and Harvey 2005). Filtrate invasion into the formation can substantially reduce the permeability of the near wellbore region either by particle plugging, clay swelling, or water blocking. Permeability of the filter cake is dependent on the particle size distribution as an increase in the particle size decreases the permeability {{due to the fact that}} colloidal particles get packed very tightly. For non-reservoir applications, enough particles of the required size range are usually present in most DFs after cutting just a few feet of rock. These particles impact the choice of various drilling equipment (i.e., <b>shale</b> <b>shakers,</b> desanders, desilters, etc.) at the surface and thus can be effectively designed by having a prior knowledge of the particle sizing in the drilling fluid (Wajheeuddin and Hossain 2014).|$|E
50|$|The {{returning}} mud {{can contain}} natural gases or other flammable materials which will collect {{in and around}} the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> / conveyor area or in other work areas. Because of the risk of a fire or an explosion if they ignite, special monitoring sensors and explosion-proof certified equipment is commonly installed, and workers are advised to take safety precautions. The mud is then pumped back down the hole and further re-circulated. After testing, the mud is treated periodically in the mud pits to ensure properties which optimize and improve drilling efficiency, borehole stability, and other requirements listed below.|$|R
50|$|Drilling fluids {{flow into}} the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> {{directly}} after it returns {{to the surface of}} the well, and the solids that are removed by the screen would be discharged out of the tank, and the drilling fluids with smaller solids would flow through the screen into mud tank for further purification. A centrifugal pump sucks the shaker-treated fluids up to the desilter or mud cleaner for further purification. And vertical slurry pump is used to pump the drilling fluids up to the centrifuge, and a mud pump would pump the drilling fluids from mud tank into the borehole after it is treated by centrifuge and the circulation system continues.|$|R
5000|$|... 3D Screen Technology- One of {{the more}} recent {{advances}} in oilfield screen technology has brought us the [...] "3D screen", this technology is an innovative method for increasing the screening area of a <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> without the need to build larger machines. When seen from the side these screens look like corrugated cardboard, having a flat bottom and wave like shapes on top. These waves are designed to increase the surface area of the screen panel by building up instead of out, thereby maximizing the surface area of the screen without the need to build larger shaker screens and in turn larger, heavier and more expensive shakers.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{drilling}} rig, mud is pumped from the mud pits through the drill string where it sprays out of nozzles on the drill bit, cleaning and cooling the drill {{bit in the}} process. The mud then carries the crushed or cut rock ("cuttings") up the annular space ("annulus") between the drill string and {{the sides of the}} hole being drilled, up through the surface casing, where it emerges back at the surface. Cuttings are then filtered out with either a <b>shale</b> <b>shaker,</b> or the newer shale conveyor technology, and the mud returns to the mud pits. The mud pits let the drilled [...] "fines" [...] settle; the pits are also where the fluid is treated by adding chemicals and other substances.|$|R
5000|$|Desanders have no moving parts. The {{larger the}} {{internal}} {{diameter of the}} desander is, the greater the amount of drilling fluids {{it is able to}} process and the larger the size of the solids removed. A desander with a (10 in cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 40-50 μm (micrometre) range at a flow rate of , whilea desilter (4 in Cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 15-20 μm range at a flow rate of [...] Micro-fine separators are able to remove 50% of solids within the 10-15 μm range at a flow rate of [...] A desander is typically positioned next-to-last in the arrangement of solids control equipment, with a desander centrifuge as the subsequent processing unit. Desanders are preceded by gas busters, gumbo removal equipment (if utilized), <b>shale</b> <b>shaker,</b> mud cleaner (if utilized) and a vacuum degasser. Desanders are widely used in oilfield drilling.Practice has proved that hydrocyclone desanders are economic and effective equipment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{conventional}} drilling fluids, barite is used {{to increase}} the density. Although other additives such as halite (salt) or calcium carbonate can also be used. Mud weight can be decreased by dilution or solids control equipment such as an industrial centrifuge, desilter, desander and <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> [...] Mud weight use to control the trapped fluids or gas in the formations by adding a hydro static pressure on them [...] increasing the mud weight = increasing the hydro static pressure. If the hydro static pressure increased over the formations pressure {{that will make a}} fracture in the formation leading to loss the mud to the formation, so adding loss circulation material like gel-flake or wood chips that can refill the gap and stop the mud loss. If the mud loss continues, then the hydro static pressure will decrease and flammable fluids and gas trapped under pressure will start leaking to the surface. This can lead to a potential blowout.|$|R
5000|$|Well {{cuttings}} examination is {{a learned}} skill. During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8 inch (6 mm) across, are {{cut from the}} bottom of the hole by the bit. Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole. During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction. They then are screened out of the mudstream by the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker</b> and fall on a pile at its base. Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or mudlogger as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material. Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a [...] "bit trip" [...] when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit. At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the <b>shale</b> <b>shaker,</b> the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly, •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of weighter, example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|R
