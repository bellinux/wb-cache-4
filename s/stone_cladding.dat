5|$|The {{pyramid of}} Userkaf was {{apparently}} {{the object of}} restoration work in antiquity under the impulse of Khaemweset (1280–1225 BC), fourth son of Ramses II. This is attested by inscriptions on <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> showing Khaemweset with offering bearers.|$|E
5|$|Geometric motifs are {{carved in}} the Price Building's <b>stone</b> <b>cladding,</b> {{especially}} over the first few levels. The building is topped by a more classical, specifically Châteauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 1920s, Holden {{designed}} {{a series of}} replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At Piccadilly Circus, {{one of the busiest}} stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.|$|E

The two-story structure is built of red brick, with terracotta architectural elements, over a <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> foundation. It is topped by a dome and cupola. It was designed by Chapman and Frederick Ausfeld.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, it {{was home}} to many {{prominent}} British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900-1979) lived at 2 Wilton Crescent {{for many years and}} Alfonso López Pumarejo, twice President of Colombia ((1934-1938) and (1942-1945)), lived and died at 33 Wilton Crescent (today, there is a blue plaque on the house marking it). Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on {{the southern part of the}} crescent. The houses to the north of the crescent are <b>stone</b> <b>clad,</b> and five stories high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as a sanctuary for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
25|$|In London, the neo-classical Georgian mansion Lancaster House {{was built}} from Bath Stone in 1825 for the Duke of York and Albany, the second son of King George III, as was St Luke's Church, Chelsea in 1824, {{and several other}} churches, {{including}} Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury, were built from the material. Apsley House, the town house of the Dukes of Wellington, was remodelled by the 1st Duke, using in Bath <b>Stone</b> <b>cladding</b> over the original red brick.|$|E
25|$|Saladin's son al-Zahir al-Ghazi ruled Aleppo between 1193 and 1215. During {{this time}} the citadel went through major reconstruction, {{fortification}} and addition of new structures that create the complex of the Citadel {{in its current form}} today. Sultan Ghazi strengthened the walls, smoothed the surface of the outcrop and covered sections of the slope at the entrance area with <b>stone</b> <b>cladding.</b> The depth of the moat was increased, connected with water canals and spanned by a tall bridge-cum-viaduct, which today still serves as the entrance into the Citadel. During {{the first decade of the}} thirteenth century the citadel evolved into a palatial city that included functions ranging from residential (palaces and baths), religious (mosque and shrines), military installations (arsenal, training ground, defence towers and the entrance block) and supporting elements (water cisterns and granaries). The most prominent renovation is the entrance block rebuilt in 1213. Sultan Ghazi also had the two mosques on the Citadel restored, and expanded the city walls to include the southern and eastern suburbs, making the citadel the centre of the fortifications, rather than alongside the wall.|$|E
50|$|Ocean Parkway Jewish Center is a {{historic}} synagogue at 550 Ocean Pkwy. in Kensington, Brooklyn, New York, New York. It was built between 1924 and 1926 and is a three story plus basement and attic, <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> Neoclassical style building. It has a two story addition. The front facade features three round-arched entrances and {{the second and third}} stories are organized as a temple front.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} constructed between 1895 and 1905 {{as a replacement}} for the original terminus of the Brussels-Mechelen-Antwerp Railway. The <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> terminus buildings, with a vast dome above the waiting room hall were designed by Louis Delacenserie. The viaduct into the station is also a notable structure designed by local architect Jan Van Asperen. A plaque on the north wall bears the name Middenstatie.|$|R
50|$|Greenridge-Arthur Williams House is a {{historic}} mansion located at Roslyn Harbor in Nassau County, New York. It is a large, -story, Jacobethan Revival-style house constructed of concrete and faced in red brick. It features a steeply pitched slate roof with projecting bays, gables, dormers, and deep eaves. A 2-story gable-roofed Great Hall wing has a <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> foundation and terminates in a five-sided bay to the north. Also on the property is a contributing former ice house.|$|R
500|$|The Cathedral {{is built}} in {{concrete}} with a Portland <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> and an aluminium covering to the roof. [...] Its plan is circular, having {{a diameter of}} , with 13chapels around its perimeter. [...] The shape of the Cathedral is conical, and it is surmounted by a tower {{in the shape of}} a truncated cone. [...] The building is supported by 16boomerang-shaped concrete trusses which are held together by two ring beams, one at the bends of the trusses and the other at their tops. Flying buttresses are attached to the trusses, giving the cathedral its tent-like appearance. [...] Rising from the upper ring beam is a lantern tower, containing windows of stained glass, and at its peak is a crown of pinnacles.|$|E
500|$|Edward Rice {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a Jacobean house on the site of an earlier medieval mansion in 1659, and it was completed the following year. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780. Though the property remains Jacobean, around 1856, there were significant changes made in the Venetian Gothic style, which today emanate the ambiance of the Victorian period. The tower was added, and alterations were made by R. K. Penson of Oswestry. [...] The National Trust writes of it: [...] "Most of what you see of the grand building today dates back to the 1850s, when it was given a fashionable Gothic facelift, with <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> and four impressive turrets". A limestone refacing occurred at the same time. Newton House is a Grade II* listed property, as are its summer house and the inner and outer courtyard ranges. The nearby dairy cottage, ha-ha, dovecote, fountain, deer abattoir, icehouse, home farmhouse, corn barn and byre/stable range are Grade II listed in their own right.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} required deep foundations: [...] "not solid but {{an elaborate}} series of arches and vaults," [...] being built {{close to the}} sea on shingle and {{just west of the}} culverted outflow of Plenty Brook, hence the total estimated cost of £5,000. The vaults were infilled with concrete after inspection in 1964. The Tower's core is brick, with Portland <b>stone</b> <b>cladding.</b> The following legend is inscribed on the building: The gift of Mrs Ann Thwaytes to this town 11 Oct A.D. MDCCCXXXVII. Originally the Tower contained a clock mechanism and 12 cwt bell. In 1837 there were iron railings at the base around the steps but these were removed in 1937.|$|E
50|$|The design {{they came}} up with was just a single storey, and circled a mature oak tree which had stood on the site for years. Constructed from natural <b>stone,</b> <b>clad</b> with European Oak and topped with a sedum green roof, the aim was to create an {{ecosystem}} around the one central oak. The aim for the building was to create a high quality modern building, without compromising the surrounding countryside. To ensure this the materials used were sustainable sourced and the building was designed with this in mind.|$|R
50|$|There are 60,000 one meter long {{sections}} of <b>stone</b> forming the <b>cladding</b> of the walls. Whilst these initially appear random, like an ashlar wall, {{there is a}} regular order. The <b>cladding</b> <b>stones</b> are of three different heights, but the total of the three is always 15 cm, so it allows for variety in arrangement, whilst facilitating construction.|$|R
50|$|The cupola, {{which is}} <b>stone</b> <b>clad</b> around a steel frame which was {{constructed}} in the United States and imported to Cuba, is set forward on the building to allow for some large rooms at the rear, including {{what is now the}} National Library of Science and Technology. In the original design the dome was to be decorated with stylised palm leaves but this addition was never executed. At almost 92 m high, the dome was the highest point in the city of Havana until the 1950s (this honour now belongs to the José Martí Memorial). It was the third highest cupola in the world {{at the time of its}} construction.|$|R
2500|$|The First Regiment Armory in Portland was {{completed}} in 1888, but was immediately deemed too small, and so an Annex was commissioned to give troops stationed there more space for maneuvers. Amenities included an underground firing range. Constructed in 1891, the annex {{was built in the}} Romanesque Revival style that was popular from 1880–1890 and is identified by massive <b>stone</b> <b>cladding</b> and semi-circular arcades. [...] McCaw and Martin featured many Northwest quarry materials in the design. The annex is also an example of Castellated architecture. [...] The fortress-like structure has a recessed arched entrance flanked by turrets above. The turrets have crenelated parapets and loophole vertical gun slots.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers' Collegiate Gothic {{designs for}} Yale lent {{an air of}} instant {{heritage}} and authenticity to the campus. [...] Rogers was criticized by other prominent Gothic-revival American architects, namely Ralph Adams Cram, for his use of steel frames underneath <b>stone</b> <b>cladding,</b> and tricks such as splashing acid on stone walls to simulate age. [...] Rogers was also criticized by the growing Modernist movement of the time. [...] The 1927 Sterling Memorial Library came under especially vocal attack from Yale students for its historicist spirit and its lavish use of ornament. [...] But current opinion generally regards the building as a triumph, being both beautiful and functional.|$|E

This gives rise to the claims that there have been five lighthouses on Eddystone Rock. Winstanley's tower lasted until the Great Storm of 1703 erased almost all trace on 27 November. Winstanley was on the lighthouse, completing additions to the structure. No trace was found of him, or of the other five men in the lighthouse.|$|R
