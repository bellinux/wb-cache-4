5|$|The wrought-iron fence {{along the}} church {{driveway}} {{was installed in}} April 1895, replacing a picket fence. In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> were installed, its interior and woodwork were painted, and new lamps were installed for better illumination. The <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and calcimine for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork. Anton Reymann of Wheeling, West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary's painting and decoration.|$|E
5|$|During the 60 {{years of}} {{occupancy}} by the Israeli army, the base was served by an army synagogue {{in one of}} the halls of the main building, including a Torah ark, bookcase, and a balcony door set with 12 <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E

5|$|The granite {{church was}} built in 1850 by local stonemasons and paid for {{primarily}} by Creighton and Meade, but also by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The first services there were held on September 21, 1851. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England {{and is the only}} church with a complete set of John Bolton (brother of William Jay Bolton) <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
5|$|The current church building, {{erected in}} 1868–1869, {{is the second}} {{structure}} built at the site, and {{is an example of}} the Broken Ashlar or Rustic mode of Gothic Revival architecture patterned after medieval English parish churches. The interior nave features several <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> depicting scenes from the life of Jesus of Nazareth fabricated by J Lamb Studios. On 24 September 1992, Christ Church, Newton was included on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places as part of the Newton Town Plot Historic District which was approved and entered on the National Register of Historic Places on 12 November 1992.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line.

5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E

25|$|A {{kindergarten}} {{was later}} {{established at the}} church until it was moved into the expanded school facilities in the 1960s, when the nursery school program was established. William Reisman, who began a 27-year tenure as rector that same year, modernized and redecorated many of the buildings, adding protective covers for the <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows.</b> He also began adult education classes at the church and updated Chorley's history to the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> {{were added}} to the church between 1904 and 1913. During that time, in 1906, the new school {{building}} was built. In 1930, the school became part of the new Greenville Central School District and was extensively renovated by the Presbyterian Society. The chapel was sold to the local American Legion post in 1938 and has since been used by them and a local Boy Scout troop.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, two <b>stained-glass</b> <b>windows</b> - one honoring Lee, {{the other}} Stonewall Jackson - were {{installed}} in the Washington National Cathedral.

In 2017, these windows were removed by a vote of the Cathedral's governing board. The cathedral plans to keep the windows and eventually display them in historical context.|$|E
