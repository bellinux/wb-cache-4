40|$|The {{problem of}} {{spectrum}} <b>sensing</b> in bandwidth-constrained cognitive sensor networks with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation is studied. In particular, the quantisation bit budget for achieving performance {{close to that}} of spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation is investigated. Both single-user spectrum <b>sensing</b> and collaborative spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes are proposed. In single-user spectrum <b>sensing,</b> a sensor quantises its <b>sensing</b> observation and sends the quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point. The processing point performs spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. In collaborative spectrum <b>sensing,</b> each sensor sends a quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point and each processing point performs local spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. Then, each processing point sends a binary decision bit to a fusion centre. The fusion centre combines the decision bits by using a counting rule to generate the final spectrum <b>sensing</b> result. The detection probability and the false alarm probability are derived and simulated. The results show that there exists an optimal quantisation bit budget for which the detection probability and the false alarm probability are almost {{the same as those}} in spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation. Compared to existing spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation, the proposed schemes are more suitable for implementation in cognitive sensor networks.

In cooperative spectrum <b>sensing,</b> SUs perform local <b>sensing</b> and send their <b>sensed</b> information to the fusion center, and a final cooperative decision is taken at the fusion center.

40|$|Residential {{satisfaction}} is important as {{it contributes to}} a person‟s psychological wellbeing and quality of life. Residential satisfaction develops due to physical {{factors such as the}} provision of parks and amenities within a community, social factors such as a feeling of belongingness to the community and social support within the community and personal factors such as homeownership and length of residence. <b>Sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place also influence residential satisfaction; however, the extent that these contribute is unclear. As a result, this study investigated the contribution of these constructs to the development of residential satisfaction in the planned community of Ellenbrook, designed to promote these concepts. Additionally, this study investigated the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place as well as the factors that comprise of these constructs. A quantitative approach was utilised in which 300 residents completed published questionnaires measuring residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of place and <b>sense</b> of belonging. to examine the extent that social, physical and personal predictors contributed to the development of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place, a Kruskal-Wallis analysis was undertaken. The findings indicated that the social and physical factors: feelings of belongingness, community attachment, community participation, minimal fear of crime, community layout and design and housing density contribute to the experience of high levels of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. Regarding personal factors: age, ethnicity, homeownership, length of residence and educational level did not {{contribute to the development of}} residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. However, marital status contributed to the development of <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place but not residential satisfaction. Household income and number of people known in the community contributed to the development of <b>sense</b> of community and <b>sense</b> of belonging, while gender contributed to the development of residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of community. These findings indicate that a community developed with sensitivity to people‟s social and personal needs as well as specific spatial planning elements, contribute to the development of residential satisfaction. The interrelation of <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place and their impact on residential satisfaction was explored through factor analysis. Results showed nine factors to emerge. One factor consisted of several residential satisfaction items along with the attraction to neighbourhood components of <b>sense</b> of community, and the place attachment components of <b>sense</b> of place, indicating the communality of these items. Despite efforts to use distinctive measures of these concepts, there is to a certain degree, an inseparable nature of the dimensions of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community and <b>sense</b> of place. The <b>sense</b> of belonging items emerged as a separate factor indicating it to have a unique identity from residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of place and <b>sense</b> of community. Additionally, three of the four place identity items emerged on one factor, as did the residential satisfaction items referring to feelings of dissatisfaction, suggesting the uniqueness of these items. To examine the relationship between residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place, regression analyses were performed. There was a significant positive relationship between residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of community χ 2 (1, 300) = 40. 127, p 3 ̆c. 05; residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of place χ 2 (1, 300) = 56. 805, p 3 ̆c. 05 and residential satisfaction and <b>sense</b> of belonging χ 2 (1, 300) = 25. 848, p 3 ̆c. 05. This indicates that <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place contribute to the development of residential satisfaction, supporting previous research. The examination of these concepts in conjunction is a new concept. As a result, this research provides a theoretical understanding of the interrelation, as well as the uniqueness, of residential satisfaction, <b>sense</b> of community, <b>sense</b> of belonging and <b>sense</b> of place. Practically, this research assists policy makers and planners to develop communities that encompass these concepts to avoid issues faced by unplanned communities...|$|R
