40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Achieving and {{maintaining}} sustainability in irrigated agriculture {{production in the}} era of rapidly increasing stress on our natural resources require, among other essential actions, optimum control and management of the applied water. Thus, a significant upgrade of the currently available soil water monitoring technologies is needed. The primary goal of this work was to reduce the uncertainties of spatially variable soil water in the field. Two approaches are suggested: 1) The Bayesian decision model that implicitly accounts for spatial variability at minimal cost based on limited field data, and 2) The Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO) method that explicitly accounts for spatial variability with high sampling density at relatively low cost per measurement point. The Bayesian decision model uses an algorithm to integrate information embodied in independent estimates of <b>soil</b> water <b>depletion</b> to derive a posterior estimation of soil water status that has the potential {{to reduce the risk of}} costly errors in irrigation scheduling decisions. The sources of information are obtained from an ET based water balance model, soil water measurements, and expert opinion.

Soil temperature {{has been shown to}} be important in influencing the early development of many plant species. Many agricultural regions have suboptimal soil temperature regimes for plant growth, and some cultural practices have been shown to reduce near-surface soil temperatures. The seasonal influence of soil temperature on soil water extraction and aboveground and belowground plant growth under variable irrigation was investigated at the USU Greenville Farm in Logan, UT. Soil surface mulches and buried heat cables were used to modify soil temperature. A line-source sprinkler system provided a gradient of water application. During 1987 yields were mainly influenced by irrigation. During 1988 greater soil temperature differences resulted in significant plant growth and yield responses. <b>Soil</b> water <b>depletion</b> corresponded to <b>soil</b> temperature treatments during the early part of the growing seasons. Depth of maximum <b>soil</b> water <b>depletion</b> was about 20 cm deeper for warm treatments. Water uptake rates of earlier-maturing plants in warm treatments were reduced later in the season, so that cumulative seasonal <b>soil</b> water <b>depletion</b> was similar for all temperature treatments. Although depth of rooting was somewhat greater under high than low irrigation during 1988, low irrigation treatments depleted soil water to greater depth.

ContextEvapotranspiration at forest stand scale {{is the sum of}} three components: overstorey and understorey transpiration, and evaporation from soil. During periods of soil water shortage, evapotranspiration of trees declines significantly, but the response of understorey vegetation is less well known. Some reports suggest that understorey vegetation can sometimes be the main source of water depletion in a forest stand during drought episodes. AimsWe assessed transpiration in response to decreased soil water content (SWC) and increased vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in the atmosphere for four understorey species with contrasting {{patterns of}} resource capture. MethodsPotted plants of Pteridium aquilinum, Molinia caerulea, Calluna vulgaris and Rubus sect. Fruticosi were grown under two radiation levels combined with three levels of SWC.
