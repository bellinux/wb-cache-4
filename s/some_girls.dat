5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. <b>Some</b> <b>girls</b> were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough to satisfy their commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including <b>Some</b> <b>Girls</b> (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E

The Bachmanns were licensed from 1992 to 2000 to handle up to three foster children at a time; the last child arrived in 1998. The Bachmanns began by providing short-term care for girls with eating disorders who were patients in a program at the University of Minnesota. The Bachmann home was legally defined as a treatment home, with a daily reimbursement rate per child from the state. <b>Some</b> <b>girls</b> stayed a few months, others more than a year.|$|E
25|$|The Associated Press reports, {{based on}} {{interviews}} in California and Egypt, that trafficking of children for domestic labor in the U.S. includes an extension of an illegal but common practice in Africa.

This custom has led to the spread of trafficking, as well-to-do Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate into the U.S.|$|E
25|$|For this episode, Shin Bora, Heo Young-ji and Block B's Park Kyung {{appeared}} as special panelists. In between announcements of each girl's ranking {{during the first}} elimination, {{events leading up to}} the elimination are shown. Just after arriving at the dorms, the girls are taken to get flu shot. Weeks after, they are weighed and do a series of exercises with the help of trainer Ray Yang. <b>Some</b> <b>girls</b> are put on a strict diet in order to lose weight. The trainees are also tricked into participating in a 'hidden camera'. The first is a consideration test to see who will help a staff struggling with two heavy packs of water bottles. The second is a puddle of coke which was spilled {{on the floor of a}} waiting room to see if they will clean it up. The third is a $30,000 camera which a staff pretends to break during a fake interview. The staff tells each trainee that she might get fired, and <b>some</b> <b>girls</b> take responsibility, pretending it was them who broke it. The 97 trainees choose the 'top visual'. Pledis Entertainment's Zhou Jieqiong takes first place while Jung Chae-yeon, Kim Do-yeon, Kim Se-jeong, Kim Ji-sung, Seo Hye-lin, Park Si-yeon, Kwon Eun-bean, Ki Heui-hyeon (Cathy), Lee Su-hyun, and Jeon So-mi takes 2nd to 11th place respectively. Jang Keun-suk then announces the top 20 trainees and finally the 61st and last trainee, Happy Face Entertainment's Hwang A-young, who was saved from elimination.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, <b>some</b> <b>girls</b> become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E

500|$|Schwimmer starred on the London {{stage in}} May 2005, with Catherine Tate, Lesley Manville, Sara Powell, and Saffron Burrows, in Neil LaBute's <b>Some</b> <b>Girl(s)</b> at the Gielgud Theatre. In the production, {{he plays a}} teacher who is ready {{to settle down and}} marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, Schwimmer {{received}} critical reviews. The Independent wrote that Schwimmer [...] "is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as one might have expected in <b>Some</b> <b>Girl(s).</b> [...] Schwimmer remains bland, competent, and boyish—though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on". However, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph praised Schwimmer, reporting he [...] "proves inspired casting. He takes to the stage with... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character's opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of <b>Some</b> <b>Girls,</b> the band {{released}} their next album Emotional Rescue (UK 1; US 1) in mid-1980.

Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined. Emotional Rescue hit {{the top of the}} charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached No.3 in the US.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} 1978, after the band released <b>Some</b> <b>Girls</b> (UK No.2; US No.1), {{which included the}} hit single [...] "Miss You", the country ballad [...] "Far Away Eyes", [...] "Beast of Burden", and [...] "Shattered". In part {{as a response to}} punk, many songs, particularly [...] "Respectable", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people. Following the US Tour 1978, the band guested on the first show of the fourth season of the TV series Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1908, Baden-Powell published Scouting for Boys in six fortnightly parts, setting out activities and programmes which existing youth organisations could use.

In 1909, the first Scout Rally was held at Crystal Palace in London, to which 11,000 Scouts came—and <b>some</b> <b>girls</b> dressed as Scouts and calling themselves [...] "Girl Scouts". Baden-Powell retired from the Army and, in 1910, he formed The Boy Scouts Association and, later, The Girl Guides.
