Brown, Stanley Cohen (who died of unknown causes {{early on in}} the Turnpike trial), Lennox Hinds, Florynce Kennedy, Louis Myers, Laurence <b>Stern,</b> <b>and</b> Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt. Of these attorneys, Kunstler, Ball, Cohen, Myers, <b>Stern</b> <b>and</b> Williams appeared in court for the turnpike trial. Kunstler became involved in Shakur's trials in 1975, when contacted by Williams, and commuted from New York City to New Brunswick every day with Stern.|$|E

5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both <b>Stern</b> <b>and</b> Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour was {{originally}} the merchant collier Earl of Pembroke, built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of Whitby in North Yorkshire, {{and of a}} type known locally as the Whitby Cat. She was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> a long box-like body with a deep hold.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-defence}} against enemy warships, Eagle {{had nine}} BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> six along {{both sides of}} the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} another fruitless {{sweep of}} the North Sea in late December and, while trying to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, Monarch was accidentally rammed by Conqueror on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of ten 28 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin gun turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament consisted of twelve 15cm SK L/45 guns in casemates in the central portion {{of the ship and}} twelve 8.8cm SK L/45 guns in the bow, in the <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four 50cm (20in) submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E

5|$|Yamashiro {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, {{becoming the first}} Japanese ship to launch aircraft. When she was modernized in the 1930s, a catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> both ships were equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M biplanes from 1942 on.|$|E
5|$|Alan <b>Stern</b> <b>and</b> Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|At 09:24 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the {{original}} tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week. While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.|$|E

5|$|Directly after commissioning, König {{conducted}} sea trials, {{which were}} completed by 23 November 1914. Her crew consisted of 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. Afterward, {{the ship was}} attached to the V Division of the IIIBattle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet, where she would later be joined by her sister ships. On 9 December, König ran aground in the Wilhelmshaven roadstead. Her sister ship Grosser Kurfürst, following right behind, rammed her <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> caused some minor damage. König was then freed from the bottom and taken back to Wilhelmshaven; repair work lasted until 2 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|Fusō {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1924. During {{the first phase}} of her first modernization, a catapult was fitted on the roof of Turret No. 3 and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. Fusōs ability to operate her aircraft was greatly improved during the second phase of her second modernization in 1940–41 when the aircraft handling equipment was moved to the <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> a new catapult was installed. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns from 1942 on.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David <b>Stern,</b> <b>and</b> the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the salary cap and luxury tax. Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher luxury tax, hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E
