5|$|This variety has open winter rosettes {{composed}} of leaves which are <b>spatulate</b> {{in shape and}} have an obtuse or rounded end. It tends to grow in limestone-based substrates.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} in {{relation}} {{to the size of the}} animal. The jaws are lined with <b>spatulate</b> (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet. The snout of Apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only Nigersaurus having a squarer skull. The braincase of Apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of Apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened <b>spatulate</b> appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
50|$|The general form of {{the body}} {{can be defined as}} rhombic, quite deep, and compressed. The dorsal fin is unique, the caudal fin is rather large and <b>spatulated</b> with a convex edge, the ventral fins are very large and have a thorny spine, and the {{pectoral}} fins are quite small.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe report 6 {{cases of}} {{critical}} limb ischemia in 4 patients due to symptomatic popliteal artery aneurysm and we present the AESA (asymmetric end-to-end <b>spatulated</b> anastomosis) technique {{for use in}} autologous vein bypasses in crural vessels. This is a modified technique of conventional end-to-end <b>spatulated</b> anastomosis, which results in an asymmetric configuration of the anastomotic lateral walls. Using this modified technique the anastomosis’ area is greater and the opposite lateral anastomotic sites are always at different inclined levels. Therefore, in cases of intimal hyperplasia formation this asymmetric configuration may avoid the marked stenosis of the anastomosis and consequently the procedure's failure. In all cases, the asymmetric end-to-end anastomosis was used for revascularization of a single patent crural vessel. All procedures were successful and all target vessels remain patent for a median follow up of 15 months so far...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{ureteral}} obstruction after kidney transplantation caused by localized bone metaplasia in the donor ureter. Surgical treatment consisted of removal of the involved ureteral segment, which was located 3 cm above the bladder and creation of a <b>spatulated</b> end-to-end anastomosis.

50|$|Tete veld rats are {{physically}} {{indistinguishable from the}} closely related red rock rats, and were thought to represent a subspecies of the latter until as recently as 1998. In that year, genetic analysis revealed that the two species were distinct, making the Tete veld rat {{an example of a}} cryptic species. Other than analysis of chromosomes or mitochondrial DNA, the two species can only be reliably distinguished by the shape of their spermatozoa, which have an unusual <b>spatulated</b> shape in Tete veld rats.|$|R

25|$|The arched {{skull of}} Camarasaurus was remarkably square and the blunt snout had many fenestrae, {{though it was}} sturdy and is {{frequently}} recovered in good condition by paleontologists. The 19centimeter long (7.5in) teeth were shaped like chisels (<b>spatulate)</b> and arranged evenly along the jaw. The strength of the teeth indicates that Camarasaurus probably ate coarser plant material than the slender-toothed diplodocids.|$|E

Martin-Roget, tall, broad-shouldered, bull-necked, the typical self-educated peasant, with square jaw and flat head, with wide bony hands and <b>spatulated</b> fingers: and Chauvelin--the aristocrat turned demagogue, thin and frail-looking, bland of manner and suave of speech, with delicate hands and pale, almost ascetic face.|$|R
50|$|The Anisopodidae {{are a small}} {{cosmopolitan}} {{family of}} gnat-like flies known as wood gnats or window-gnats, with 154 described extant species in 15 genera, and several described fossil taxa. Some species are saprophagous or fungivorous. They are mostly small to medium-sized flies, except the genera Olbiogaster and Lobogaster, which are large with bizarrely <b>spatulated</b> abdomens. Their phylogenetic placement is controversial. They have been proposed to be the sister group to the higher flies, the Brachycera. Some authors consider this group to be four distinct families - Anisopodidae, Mycetobiidae, Olbiogastridae, and Valeseguyidae.|$|R
50|$|The sword {{consists}} of a very thin, rounded blade with a large ricasso and a heavy hilt and pommel. Because of this, {{it has the same}} weight and center of balance as a real sword, and handles identically. This odd construction also has the effect of moving the sword's center of percussion to a theoretical point beyond its tip. The tip of a Federschwert is <b>spatulated</b> and may have been covered with a leather sleeve to make thrusting safer, though no direct historical evidence exists of such use.|$|R
25|$|In 1903, Elmer Samuel Riggs {{described}} and named Brachiosaurus. In 1904, {{he created a}} new sauropod family, the Brachiosauridae. He published a complete description of the phenotype after examining the humerus, femur, coracoid, and sacrum of the Brachiosaurus holotype that had been prepared at the Field Columbian Museum. Since then, the classification of these sauropods has been through many changes. Marsh's multifamily theory of sauropod classification prevailed until 1929, when Werner Janensch proposed a two-family theory based on differences in sauropod teeth. Macronarians with broad, <b>spatulate</b> teeth, {{were placed in the}} Brachiosauridae family, while sauropods with more slender and peg-shaped teeth were considered titanosaurids. This put diplodocids and titanosaurids together in one group based on their similar teeth, despite the many other differences between the taxa. Today, about four to five groups within the Macronaria are given names ending on ~idae.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} characteristics apply {{especially to}} llamas. Dentition of adults:-incisors 1/3 canines 1/1, premolars 2/2, molars 3/2; total 32. In the upper jaw, a compressed, sharp, pointed laniariform incisor near the hinder {{edge of the}} premaxilla is followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved true canine in the anterior part of the maxilla. The isolated canine-like premolar that follows in the camels is not present. The teeth of the molar series, which are in contact with each other, consist of two very small premolars (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad molars, constructed generally like those of Camelus. In the lower jaw, the three incisors are long, <b>spatulate,</b> and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest. Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which {{differ from those of}} Camelus in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.|$|E

30|$|Ureteral {{substitution}} {{is rarely}} needed in children (Martin 1981; Estevao-Costa 1999; Dagash et al. 2008). Noted indications {{for its use}} include traumatic ureteric avulsion, congenital ureteric stenosis and ureteric obstruction following previous pyeloplasty for pelviureteric junction obstruction (Estevao-Costa 1999; Dagash et al. 2008). The tip of the appendix is usually discarded, the lumen irrigated and the mesoappendix widely dissected. The ends of the ureter and appendix are then <b>spatulated</b> and a single layer, end-to-end anastomosis created using polyglycolic sutures of an appropriate size. The success rate associated with this procedure is generally high (Martin 1981; Estevao-Costa 1999; Dagash et al. 2008).|$|R

500|$|Porpoises {{are small}} {{cetaceans}} {{of the family}} Phocoenidae. They are distinct from dolphins, although the word [...] "porpoise" [...] {{has been used to}} refer to any small dolphin, especially by sailors and fishermen. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is porpoises have <b>spatulate</b> (flattened) teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. In addition, porpoises are relatively r-selected compared with dolphins: that is, they rear more young more quickly than dolphins. All seven species have small flippers, notched tail flukes, and no beaks. All carry at least 11 pairs of small teeth in their upper and lower jaws.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Witton {{pointed out}} that the teeth of Istiodactylus were unlike the {{enlarged}} and recurved teeth in pterosaurs such as rhamphorhynchines and ornithocheirids, which were ideal for obtaining slippery prey. Instead, the [...] "razor-edged" [...] teeth would be better suited for shearing food than for grabbing fish. Witton also discussed an unpublished Ph.D. thesis by Michael Fastnacht, wherein biomechanical calculations predicted that Istiodactylus filter-fed {{in a manner similar to}} ducks. Witton found that Fastnacht had reconstructed the skull incorrectly, for example by making the rostrum too broad and the jaws too long, resulting in a misleading similarity to the skull of a duck. Pointing out that the jaws were dissimilar to the broad, flattened, and <b>spatulate</b> bills of ducks, and that the teeth were not suited for filter-feeding, he dismissed the idea of a duck-like lifestyle for Istiodactylus.|$|E
500|$|Tooth {{count is}} {{variable}} between individuals and increases with skull size. The premaxilla shows the constant number of four teeth per side in all known skulls; however, in the maxilla, the tooth count ranges from 14 to 22. There are 26 teeth in {{each side of}} the lower jaw in the largest known skull. The height of the teeth crowns decreases from front to back in the upper jaw, but was more or less constant in the lower jaw. The lack of pronounced tooth wear and the variable height of the crowns suggests that the teeth were replaced by succeeding new ones in relatively short time intervals. Notably, there was variation in the tooth morphology based on the position of the teeth in the jaw. The heterodonty present in Massospondylus is greater than that present in Plateosaurus, although [...] not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in Heterodontosaurus. Teeth closer {{to the front of the}} snout had round cross-sections and tapered to points, unlike the back teeth, which were <b>spatulate</b> and had oval cross-sections.|$|E
50|$|The {{germination}} of the gametophyte {{corresponds to}} the Cyathea genus, giving rise to short strands of from two to six cells in both varieties. The prothallus development is of the Adiantum type. When raised in the laboratory, gametophytes of the quadripinnata variety are always chordates, however gametophytes of the contracta variety possess three morphs, depending on the density of spores that are developed (Dyer 1979). At low density, they are long <b>spatulates</b> with a central meristem and a slightly more developed wing than the other; at medium densities they are cordiforms and at high densities are band-like with {{a large amount of}} antheridia.|$|R

40|$|A {{surgical}} procedure for hypospadias correction using a proximally based turnover flap, glanuloplasty, and preputium plasty is described. The flap is vertically disposed and distally {{based on the}} external urethral meatus, and the shape is <b>spatulated.</b> It is dissected from proximal to distal, turned over, and sutured to the glans to reconstruct the missing portion of urethra. A glanuloplasty is performed and the preputium is restored by careful reconstruction of its inner and outer surface. The technique is useful in distal penile and glanular hypospadias without chordee or meatal stenosis. Very good functional and aesthetic results, and no complications, were obtained with this technique. Preliminary results and a 3 -year follow-up are presented and discussed in this report...|$|R
500|$|The {{only known}} skull, {{belonging}} to the largest specimen, measures [...] from the premaxilla at the front {{to the back of}} the occipital condyle. The widest part of the skull behind the eyes is only [...] wide in comparison. The skull was similar to those of other ornithomimosaurs in being low and narrow, but differed in that the snout was more elongated. The skull bone walls were rather thin, about [...] It had a rounded, flattened beak, which would have been covered by keratin in life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets. The outer diameter of the sclerotic rings in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the jugal bones, similar to Gallimimus. The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was <b>spatulate</b> (flared outwards to the sides) and [...] wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed hadrosaurids.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} Baryonyx is incompletely known, {{and much of}} the middle and hind {{portions}} are not preserved. The full length of the skull has been estimated to be 950mm (37.4in), based on comparison with that of the related genus Suchomimus (which is 20% larger). It was elongated, and the front 170mm (6.6in) of the premaxillae formed a long, low snout (rostrum) with a rounded upper surface. The nostrils, far back from the tip, passed horizontally {{from one side of the}} skull to the other. The front 130mm (5.1in) of the snout expanded into a <b>spatulate</b> (flared outwards to the sides), [...] "terminal rosette" [...] shape similar to the modern gharial, and the front 70mm (2.7in) of the lower margin was downturned (or hooked). The snout was very narrow just behind the rosette. The creature's maxilla and premaxilla fit together in a complex articulation, resulting in a strongly curved tooth row. The gap in the row is comparable to that of Dilophosaurus. The front 140mm (5.5in) of the dentary in the mandible curved upwards towards this area, and the gap between the upper and lower jaw is known as the subrostral notch. The snout had extensive pits (which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves), and the maxilla appears to have housed sinuses.|$|E
500|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus usually have smooth, glossy, brightly colored, {{elongate}} or conic, dextrally or sinistrally coiled shells. The shells are moderately large, ranging from [...] to [...] in maximum dimension, having from 6 to 8 convex whorls. Their color pattern is usually monochromatic yellowish or greenish, {{but can be}} variegated. The aperture is oblique or ovate in shape, without any teeth or folds, and with the aperture height ranging from two-fifths to one-third of total shell height. The peristome is expanded and/or reflected, and is sometimes thickened. The columella may be straight or recurved, and the parietal callus is weak to well-developed, and the umbilicus may be open or closed. The radula is <b>spatulate,</b> has cusped teeth arranged in rows, usually with a monocuspid central tooth and bicuspid or tricuspid lateral teeth. The jaw is thin and weak, with low flat ribs. The pallial region is sigmurethrous, with a very long, narrow kidney. The genitalia are that of typical camaenids, with a long seminal receptacle, a short penis with low insertion of the retractor muscle, and a short or long epiphallic caecum (flagellum and appendix). The spermatophores have a pentagonal outline in cross-section. Amphidromus are typically arboreal animals.|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} and ultrarapid technique for kidney transplan-tation in the rabbit is introduced. Vascular anastomosis was completed using a novel cuff technique in which mating cuffs {{were used to}} join the delicate renal vein. The ureter was reconstructed by <b>spatulated</b> end-to-end anastomosis, with {{special attention to the}} rabbit’s unique ureteral vascular anatomy. The total vascular anastomosis time was 3. 4 ± 1. 3 min, and there were no episodes of bleeding or thrombosis. The ureter complication rate was 7. 3 %. Kidneys transplanted after 5 h of cold storage using the new technique yielded better postoperative creatinine results than similar preserved kidneys transplanted using previously described methods.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the long term}} follow-up results of the direct nipple ureteroneocystostomy technique. Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 16 patients (19 renal units) who underwent direct nipple ureteroneocystostomy. The mean age was 43 years and 3 patients had bilateral disease. In five units the ureters had been ligated during gynecological surgery, 11 renal units were obstructive and three units were reflexive megaureters. The ureters were <b>spatulated</b> for about 2 cm and folded back. Nipples 2 to 2. 5 cm long were prepared. In two cases the ureters were thin-walled (2 mm or less) {{and they were not}} <b>spatulated</b> but folded back onto themselves. In one case the ureter could not be everted since it had a thick and fibrotic wall. The distal 2 to 2. 5 cm segment of this ureter was directly inserted in to the bladder. Postoperative follow-up was at 3 month intervals for the first year at 6 month intervals for 2 - 3 years and yearly thereafter. At the time of follow-up serum creatinine, urine culture, ultrasound, intravenous urography, voiding cystoureterography, nuclear renal scintigraphy and cystometric evaluations were performed. The functions of 11 and 15 renal units were evaluated scintigraphically and stereologically, respectively, in the both preoperative and postoperative first year follow-up. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used for statistical evaluation and p Results: Mean follow-up was 49 months. Three renal units had Grade III reflux (two of them during voiding) and one unit had Grade IV reflux. At follow-up this patient developed in the ureteral stricture. No patients had urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis or ureteral stricture follow-up period. Between the preoperative and postoperative first year, there was an increase in postoperative split renal function based on renal scintigraphy but this difference was not statistically significant. The stereologically calculated decrease in pelvicaliceal dilatation was statistically significant. Conclusion: Ease of application and no need to taper or plicate the ureter or prepare a sub mucosal tunnel may be the reasons to consider the direct nipple ureteroneocystostomy technique for megaureters of different etiologies. </p...|$|R
