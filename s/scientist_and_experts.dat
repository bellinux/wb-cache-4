40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{attention}} to the importance of indoor air quality on which <b>scientist</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts</b> have no doubts since in modern society we tend to spend most of the time in various types of indoor environments (office, private homes, etc.). Laser printers, in particular, release an aerosol into the environment including solid and liquid particles and gaseous compounds. The measurement of all these components is not practically feasible. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a marker which, when measured, shows accurately the frequency, duration and magnitude of the exposure. The measure with an optical particle counter (OPC) and a condensation particle counter (CPC) is an indicator with high sensitivity and representativeness. The major advantage of using these tools is the ability to detect the presence of ultrafine particles and also detect the particles in the liquid phase. The continuous recording of submicron particulate matter emitted during the printing activity allows to measure the exposure of personnel, while the ratio between the peak values and the values without printing activity can be used to classify the printers according to their emissivity. The particulate generated during the processes of printing has size less than 0. 3 micron and therefore extends in the size range of nanoparticles (ultrafine particles less than 100 nm). These activities lead to high concentrations of ultrafine particles with a variability related to factors such as type of printer, toner, paper type, frequency of maintenance and air exchange. The concentrations of ultrafine particles in office environments can be reduced by proper choice of the printers, with the use of appropriate filtration techniques and placing the equipment away from workstations...|$|E
40|$|Human {{interaction}} {{has become}} almost mandatory for an automated medical system wishing {{to be accepted by}} clinical regulatory agencies such as Food and Drug Administration. Since this interaction causes variability in the gathered data, the inter-observer and intra-observer variability must be analyzed in order to validate the accuracy of the system. This study focuses on the variability from different observers that interact with an automated lung delineation system that relies on human interaction in the form of delineation of the lung borders. The database consists of High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) : 15 normal and 81 diseased patients’ images taken retrospectively at five levels per patient. Three observers manually delineated the lungs borders independently and using software called ImgTracer™ (AtheroPoint™, Roseville, CA, USA) to delineate the lung boundaries in all five levels of 3 -D lung volume. The three observers consisted of Observer- 1 : lesser experienced novice tracer who is a resident in radiology under the guidance of radiologist, whereas Observer- 2 and Observer- 3 are lung image scientists trained by lung radiologist and biomedical imaging <b>scientist</b> <b>and</b> <b>experts.</b> The inter-observer variability can be shown by comparing each observer’s tracings to the automated delineation and also by comparing each manual tracing of the observers with one another. The normality of the tracings was tested using D’Agostino-Pearson test and all observers tracings showed a normal P-value higher than 0. 05. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test between three observers and automated showed a P-value higher than 0. 89 and 0. 81 for the right lung (RL) and left lung (LL), respectively. The performance of the automated system was evaluated using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI) and Hausdorff (HD) Distance measures. Although, Observer- 1 has lesser experience compared to Obsever- 2 and Obsever- 3, the Observer Deterioration Factor (ODF) shows that Observer- 1 has less than 10  % difference compared to the other two, which is under acceptable range as per our analysis. To compare between observers, this study used regression plots, Bland-Altman plots, two tailed T-test, Mann-Whiney, Chi-Squared tests which showed the following P-values for RL and LL: (i) Observer- 1 and Observer- 3 were: 0. 55, 0. 48, 0. 29 for RL and 0. 55, 0. 59, 0. 29 for LL; (ii) Observer- 1 and Observer- 2 were: 0. 57, 0. 50, 0. 29 for RL and 0. 54, 0. 59, 0. 29 for LL; (iii) Observer- 2 and Observer- 3 were: 0. 98, 0. 99, 0. 29 for RL and 0. 99, 0. 99, 0. 29 for LL. Further, CC and R-squared coefficients were computed between observers which came out to be 0. 9 for RL and LL. All three observers however manage to show the feature that diseased lungs are smaller than normal lungs in terms of area...|$|E
