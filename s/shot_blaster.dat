This testing involved running humans through a murderous obstacle course on the partly correct theory that the stress would active their 'meta-genes' and cause superpowers. The 'Blasters', which included former JLA mascot Snapper Carr, are the ones who did gain powers.|$|R

As in the films, lightsabers can be used to deflect <b>shots</b> from <b>blasters.</b> The game offers three lightsaber styles; fast, medium and strong, with each style differing from the others in terms of the speed of attacks and damage dealt. There are also a number of combos, many of which are unique to the selected saber style.|$|R

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} <b>shot</b> <b>blaster</b> is an electronically operated shot-blast {{machine that}} removes layer of concrete of varying depths. Hardened steel shot propelled {{at a high}} rate of speed abrades the surface of the concrete. The depth of material removed is determined by the rate of speed the machine is traveling and the volume of shot being fired into the blast chamber. The steel shot is reused until it is pulverized to dust, which is deposited in the waste container with the concrete being removed. Debris is continually vacuumed by a large dust collection system attached to the <b>shot</b> <b>blaster.</b> The safety and health evaluation during the human factors assessment focused on two main areas: noise and dust...|$|E
50|$|Gunlord {{features}} 9 non-linear stages boasting 16-bit hand drawn graphics, {{with constant}} 60 fps. The game features seven weapon types, including; Spread shot, Power <b>shot,</b> Bounce <b>Blaster,</b> Phoenix, Nuclear wheel bombs, Snake beam and super wave. The game also features an Internet Hiscore ranking system via a code {{that the game}} generates at the Game Over screen. The game has often been compared favorably to the Turrican game series.|$|R
50|$|All lightsaber {{users are}} able to deflect <b>blaster</b> <b>shots</b> aimed at them and each {{character}} has its own style. They are also the only ones {{able to use the}} force to interact with undeployed platforms and switches. However, unlike other versions of the game, <b>blaster</b> <b>shots</b> can only be deflected if they are headed straight towards the player at the front, not its back or sides. Blaster characters can charge a shot by holding the button making it stronger, and {{are able to}} pass through several enemies. However, {{they do not have the}} shot deflecting abilities of Jedi. The game has 15 playable characters that are unlocked through gameplay. These include: Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin, Jar Jar Binks, a clone trooper, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, a battle droid, R2-D2, R4, Padme, and a Tusken raider. The game also has multiple cheat characters.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} two boss stages {{that become}} available only once {{after completion of}} both conventional stages, although the player {{is not required to}} win either to finish the game. In the first boss battle, which is achieved by completing the first two stages, the player uses a lightsaber to reflect Boba Fett's <b>blaster</b> <b>shots</b> back at him, in order to knock Fett into the Sarlacc pit behind him. The second, which is after the third stage, involves the player dueling Darth Vader on the second Death Star.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{performed}} to understand the level of sound produced by ventilated racks, animal transfer stations, and construction equipment that mice in ventilated cages hear relative to what humans would hear in the same environment. Although the ventilated rack and animal transfer station both produced sound pressure levels above the ambient level within the human hearing range, the sound pressure levels within the mouse hearing range did not increase above ambient noise from either noise source. When various types of construction equipment were used 3 ft from the ventilated rack, the sound pressure level within the mouse hearing range was increased but {{to a lesser degree}} for each implement than were the sound pressure levels within the human hearing range. At more distant locations within the animal facility, sound pressure levels from the large jackhammer within the mouse hearing range decreased much more rapidly than did those in the human hearing range, indicating that less of the sound is perceived by mice than by humans. The relatively high proportion of low-frequency sound produced by the <b>shot</b> <b>blaster,</b> used without the metal shot that it normally uses to clean concrete, increased the sound pressure level above the ambient level for humans but did not increase sound pressure levels above ambient noise for mice at locations greater than 3 ft from inside of the cage, where sound was measured. This study demonstrates that sound clearly audible to humans in the animal facility may be perceived to a lesser degree or not at all by mice, because of the frequency content of the sound...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} damage {{mechanisms}} in dies used for aluminium casting revealed that erosion {{due to the}} molten/semi-solid aluminium droplets entering the die was {{a major cause of}} wear. It was also clear that no laboratory tests were available to simulate the die/aluminium interactions. Existing test methods use actual casting machines which is time consuming and expensive. The aim of this work was to develop a laboratory test and then to use it to evaluate current die materials as well as possible treatments/coatings {{that could be used to}} reduce the problem. A test was developed that used a <b>shot</b> <b>blaster</b> to propel aluminium balls at flat or cylindrical specimens (to cover possible die geometry variations). It was also possible to heat the specimens. A pulsed method was used for the ball application to simulate multiple castings. Ball motion was evaluated and specimen wear characterised across a range of ball impact velocities. Different impact angles were used for flat specimens and for cylindrical specimens central and eccentric ball flows were used. High speed video was used to investigate the actual impact velocities and also observe the behaviour of the aluminium balls impacting at different angles to see how the wear mechanisms actually occurred. Four regimes of particles behaviour: impact only, impact and sliding, sliding only and pressed only were seen. Wear testing showed that wear increased with impact velocity, but different effects were seen when varying the impact angle as seen previously in studies on erosive wear of spherical solid particles for ductile materials. At 30 o impacts, a higher erosion rate was seen than those at 60 o and 90 o impact angle. Zig zag indentations were seen at high impact angles indicating a higher displacement and removal of material by plastic flow keeps advancing downstream until the individual peaks and valleys meet. Wear rate results highlighted four periods with exposure time: incubation period, acceleration or accumulation period, deceleration period and steady-state period. Tests on cylindrical H 13 specimens showed that a high amount of wear occurred at an eccentric position due to increased cutting action. The effects of elevation the temperature in the system on the erosion behaviour were also studied. At high temperature materials soften and the erosion increased. Treated surfaces were also studied to evaluate selected candidate coatings and generate data on their wear resistance. The results showed that coating can have a large effect on erosion damage. The knowledge gained by experiment has contributed to the understanding of die failure and will increase die lives as well as reducing maintenance, machine downtime and labour costs. ...|$|E
50|$|With {{this new}} {{information}} in hand, Gibson shoots Blackhead with his blaster; refusing {{to sell out}} Gainsbourg. Thinking him dead, Gibson leaves the scene but Little John alerts him of high-voltage electricity right behind him. Blackhead is revealed {{to have been a}} bioroid the entire time and moves in to kill Gibson. Despite malfunctioning, Blackhead is still able to deflect all of his <b>blaster</b> <b>shots.</b> Little John's analysis soon reveals that the bioroids' weak point is the main organic CPU located in their metallic skull. Gibson gains the upper hand and is successfully able to defeat the machine via headshot. He returns to the restaurant and asks the now-awake Gainsbourg for more information.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} a blaster on a live target were portrayed {{more or less the}} same in every part of the Star Wars series. Since blaster bolts consist of light or {{particle}} based energy, the bolts would burn through the flesh of a target, with some even exploding against their target, exerting great force. The latter effect was usually from a blaster with greater size. Blasters have even been shown to have plasma energy as ammunition, which is portrayed as blue bolts. As of The Force Awakens, these blue bolts rupture and damage flesh with little to no burning, which causes bleeding injuries, as Poe shot a Stormtrooper with a blaster that caused him to bleed until death. Another instance of a blaster causing bleeding was when Chewbacca shot Kylo Ren with his Bowcaster, the small explosion against his body causing a bleeding injury coupled with burns. In many modern showings of blaster fights, someone hit by a blaster has cinders and soot outlining the area where they were <b>shot.</b> Also <b>blasters</b> hit with great amounts of friction and kinetic energy, enough to cause sparks to fly off the target, make the target burst into flames, or kill a target on impact, even if the target is not penetrated by the bolt, as it is when some targets are armored against blasters.|$|R
50|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a <b>blaster</b> <b>shot</b> fired by Han, and his spirit is captured by wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|R

[...] Abrams had previously told Entertainment Weekly that the character, [...] "came to the name Kylo Ren when he joined {{a group called the}} Knights of Ren." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Ren as [...] "a hot-headed, radicalised Dark Side jihadi, whose red lightsaber splutters and crackles as violently as his temper". Abrams noted, [...] "The lightsaber is something that he built himself, and is as dangerous and as fierce and as ragged as the character." [...] The Telegraph also explains that Ren's wild and erratic temper and [...] "angsty" [...] instability make him dangerous. Melissa Leon of The Daily Beast describes Ren's use of the Force [...] "formidable", citing his ability to stop a <b>blaster</b> <b>shot</b> mid-air, immobilize victims and probe their minds against their will.|$|R
50|$|Jedi Power Battles {{is a mix}} of a {{platform}} game and a beat 'em up. Emphasis is place both on completing jumping sequences and defeating enemies. Players can choose from one of five prequel-era Jedi and run, jump, slash, and use the Force through the game's ten levels, starting on the Trade Federation Battleship and ending with the battle against Darth Maul on Naboo. The player's primary weapon is a lightsaber used to fight through waves of enemies and deflect <b>blaster</b> <b>shots.</b> The lightsaber combat is rather simplified with a system that lets the player lock on to the nearest enemy using the R1 button. Items and the force can also be used for special attacks. On most levels jumping puzzles make up {{a large portion of the}} challenge. There are a few segments in which the player can pilot various craft. The single player campaign can also be played in cooperative mode with a second player, while the Dreamcast version has an additional training mode and a two player duel mode. As players progress additional lightsaber combos and force powers are unlocked.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric look, to give {{the feel of a}} unique 3-D view. There are numerous droids and aliens to fight, which makes for plenty of opportunities to use Anakin's lightsaber to attack or reflect incoming <b>blaster</b> <b>shots.</b> After passing each successive area, new force powers are earned that can aid Anakin later on. There are five such force powers in all, including the dash, jump, and push skills seen in the movies, as well as two others: the ability to heal faster and the ability to remain invisible for extended periods. Just as stamina decreases when Anakin is attacked, his force power also diminishes after every use. Since there are no health or force items to collect, the only ways to recover stamina and regain force power are to either stand still until both indicators are full again, or use the meditation power learned later in the game to recover faster. NPC's are mainly civilians, though there are some exceptions. Clone Troopers make an appearance (more specifically seven of them, in the underbelly of Coruscant) and fight alongside you to help defeat the droids and mercenaries. They don't move, and they can be killed. The only other instance of an NPC dying in this game is civilian workers on Metalorn falling into vats of molten metal.|$|R

50|$|The {{results on}} the dice are Success (explosion symbol)/Failure (caltrop symbol), Advantage (a pip in a wreath)/Threat (a pip on the central facet of a faceted sphere), or Critical Success ("Triumph", a starburst in a circle)/Critical Failure ("Despair", a {{triangle}} in a circle). Blank faces confer no benefit or penalty. The result depends on subtracting the lower result from the higher result on an axis. A result of 5 Successes and 3 Failures is a Success of 2. A result of 2 Advantages and 5 Threats is a Threat of 3. However, Triumph and Despair do not {{cancel each other out}} and double as a Success or Failure result; a result of no Triumphs and 1 Despair is 1 Critical Failure / +1 normal Failure. These results mean that the character made the Skill roll with a bonus of 1 Success, but suffered 3 Threats and 1 Despair as well. The Game Master would interpret the result to indicate what problems and difficulties would happen next.For example, a Rebel commando bumps into a squad of Stormtroopers turning around a corner and he shoots his blaster at them. The player rolls the 1 Success, 3 Threats, and 1 Despair from the above example. His <b>blaster</b> <b>shot</b> hits (1 Success) and does the blaster rifle's base damage +1 (from the number of Successes). The Game Master interprets the negative results to mean that the commando suffers 1 point of Strain (1 Threat), suffers 1 Black Die on the next skill roll (2 Threats), and the power cell in his blaster ran out and needs to be reloaded (1 Despair).|$|R

First, he kills over a million innocent natives of the planet Pydyr and then sets off a bomb in the New Republic Senate Hall. As Jedi Master Luke Skywalker searches for the one behind all of this, Leia Organa Solo has her own problems arising from conflicts with newly elected former imperials in the senate, and the framing of her husband Han Solo by the smuggler Jarril, who is suspected to be responsible for the senate bombing. As Han Solo travels with Chewbacca to the Smuggler's Run to investigate the actions of Jarril in hopes of getting {{to the bottom of the}} Senate bombing, Luke Skywalker visits Brakiss on Telti looking for information, and Lando Calrissian heads to The Run after Han Solo who he fears is in danger. Meanwhile, Cole Fardreamer, with the aid of R2-D2 and C-3PO, discovers a plot to install all New Republic X-wing's with remote detonators. Leia becomes aware of this and concedes her position as Chief of State to Mon Mothma in order to rescue Luke from Kueller who has taken him prisoner on Almania. After Han rescues Lando, rather than Lando rescuing Han, from the clutches of the crime lord Nandreeson, and the two of them aide hundreds of smugglers after an accidental bombing of the run, Han also heads to Almania to rescue Luke. Han arrives at Almaniain the midst of a vicious battle between New Republic forces led by Wedge Antilles and Kueller's fleet.
