5|$|Jackson {{sided with}} the Eatons. He and his late wife Rachel Donelson had {{undergone}} similar political attacks <b>stemming</b> from their marriage in 1791. The two had married in 1791 not knowing that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had failed to finalize the expected divorce. Once the divorce was finalized, they married legally in 1794, but the episode caused a major controversy, and was used against him in the 1828 campaign. Jackson saw attacks on Eaton <b>stemming</b> ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun, who had failed to silence his wife's criticisms.

40|$|<b>Stem</b> cell {{research}} and therapy are progressing these days dramatically. <b>Stem</b> cell therapy holds enormous treatment potential for many diseases which currently have no or limited therapeutic options. Unfortunately, this potential {{also comes with}} side-effects. In this review, {{the positive and negative}} effects of regulation of <b>stem</b> cells will be explained. <b>Stem</b> cells are undifferentiated cells which able to develop into many different cells of types in the body during early life and growth. There are five types of <b>stem</b> cells: embryonic <b>stem</b> cells, induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> cells, somatic <b>stem</b> cells, fetal <b>stem</b> cells and mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells. <b>Stem</b> cell transplantation is one form of <b>stem</b> cell therapy, it comes with different techniques sourced, and those are autologous and allogeneic transplantation <b>stem</b> cells. In an autologous transplant, a patient's blood-forming <b>stem</b> cells are collected, meanwhile, in an allogeneic transplant, target cells are replaced with new <b>stem</b> cells obtained from a donor or donated umbilical cord blood. Its abilities to maintain the phenotype, self-renewing and differentiate itself into specialized cells, give rise to <b>stem</b> cell as an innovation for the treatment of various diseases. In the clinical setting, <b>stem</b> cells are being explored for different conditions, such as in tissue repair and regeneration and autoimmune diseases therapy. But along with its benefit, <b>stem</b> cell therapy also holds some harm. It is known that the treatment using <b>stem</b> cell for curing and rehabilitation has the risk of tumor formation.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in <b>stem</b> cell research is opening a new hope for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. Two breakthroughs {{were made in}} the <b>stem</b> cell era, one, new discoveries in multipotentiality of adult <b>stem</b> cells beyond the traditionally appreciated extent, and the other, establishment of pluripotent <b>stem</b> cell from human embryo. In addition to the newly identified multipotentiality of adult <b>stem</b> cells, their ability to be trans-differentiated toward other tissue types (<b>stem</b> cell plasticity) as well as to migrate toward the site of tissue damage make adult <b>stem</b> cells particularly attractive choice for <b>stem</b> cell based therapy. <b>Stem</b> cell therapy for organ regeneration, therefore, could be approached from three distinct dimensions: first, direct differentiation of multi-potent <b>stem</b> cells toward desired tissue types; secondly, regeneration of specific tissues through in vivo <b>stem</b> cell plasticity, and lastly, by tissue-specific <b>stem</b> cells from many types of organs. While each approach in <b>stem</b> cell therapy poses distinctive limitations for their successful clinical applications, understanding regulatory mechanisms of <b>stem</b> cell selfrenewal and their in vivo engraftment will mostly extend their medical efficacy of <b>stem</b> cell based therapy...|$|R
