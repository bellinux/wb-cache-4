40|$|International audienceFlowCapt {{acoustic}} sensors, {{designed for}} measuring the aeolian transport of snow fluxes, are compared to the snow particle counter S 7 optical sensor, considered herein as the reference. They were compared in the French Alps at the Lac Blanc Pass, where a bench test for the aeolian transport of snow was set up. The two existing generations of FlowCapt are compared. Both seem to be good detectors for the aeolian transport of snow, especially for transport events with a flux above 1 g m 22 s 21. The second-generation FlowCapt is also compared in terms of quantification. The aeolian snow mass fluxes and snow quantity transported recorded by the second-generation FlowCapt {{are close to the}} integrative snow particle counter S 7 fluxes for an event without precipitation, but they are underestimated when an event with precipitation is considered. When the winter season is considered, for integrative snow particle counter S 7 fluxes above 20 g m 22 s 21, the second-generation FlowCapt fluxes are underestimated, regardless of precipitation. In conclusion, both generations of FlowCapt {{can be used as a}} drifting <b>snow</b> <b>detector</b> and the second generation can record an underestimation of the quantity of snow transported at one location: over the winter season, the quantity of snow transported recorded by the SPC is between 4 and 6 times greater than the quantity recorded by the second-generation FlowCapt...|$|E
40|$|Being able {{to detect}} and track human hands {{is one of the}} keys to {{understanding}} human goals, intentions, and actions. In this paper, we take the first steps towards real-time detection and tracking of human hands in dynamic crowded or cluttered scenes. We have built a prototype hand detection system based on Viola, Jones, and <b>Snow's</b> dynamic <b>detector,</b> which was originally constructed to detect and track pedestrians in outdoor surveillance imagery. The detector combines motion and appearance information to rapidly classify image sub-windows as either containing or not containing a hand. A preliminary evaluation of the system indicates that it has promise...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the design features and capabilities of a seven-channel cloud physics radiometer (CPR) for remote sensing of cloud properties. The CPR channel characteristics and functions are tabulated and diagrammed. Each {{of the first}} three channels utilizes a photo-multipler detector, with the high-voltage power supply integrated with the tube into a single unit. In operation a heater is used to keep the optics temperature at or above 273 K and this temperature is constantly monitored. The last four channel detectors and filters are all cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The inclined scanning mirror rotates at a rate of 3. 48 rps. Registration pulses are triggered and recorded as the mirror enters and leaves the + or - 45 deg earth observation region. The ice-cloud, water cloud, <b>snow</b> discriminator <b>detector</b> has worked quite well in general. Interesting radiometer data have been obtained and their analysis is under way. The combination of the CPR and the Cloud Lidar System will make possible sophisticated remote sensing cloud studies...|$|R
40|$|Institute for Neural Computation� A {{major goal}} in machine vision is {{recognizing}} human facial expressions. At {{some point in}} between locating a face and reading its expression {{it is necessary that}} we locate the eyes, nose and other facial features. This information can be used to determine the orientation of a face, help to normalize for differences between faces and locate facial regions used in expression recognition. While a wide number of systems have been applied to the detection of facial features most of these efforts were not systematic nor did they include an evaluation of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each system. In this paper we evaluate a feature recognition system based on the Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW) architecture[1]. This choice was motivated by the success reported by Yang et al. in the development of a <b>SNoW</b> based face <b>detector</b> [5]. Their system was reported to outperform a variety of other face detection methods such as naïve Bayes and support vector machines. Their measure for comparison was somewhat subjective and difficult to generalize as they only presented the data from each method which they felt were best. None the less, the results were very promising...|$|R
