5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through <b>stratigraphy,</b> as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. <b>Stratigraphy</b> and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E

Two geographical groupings of <b>stratigraphies</b> can be recognized. Continental clastic sedimen-tary and anorogenic volcanic successions are found around the Tanzanian craton, while orogenic volcanic-volcanoclastic successions typify areas surrounding the the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

40|$|Portable {{system of}} energy {{dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence {{was used to}} determine the elemental composition of 68 pottery fragments from Sambaqui do Bacanga, an archeological site in Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. This site was occupied from 6600 BP until 900 BP. By determining the element chemical composition of those fragments, it was possible to verify the existence of engobe in 43 pottery fragments. Obtained from two-dimensional graphs and hierarchical cluster analysis performed in fragments of <b>stratigraphies</b> from surface and 113 -cm level, and 10 to 20, 132 and 144 -cm level, it was possible to group these fragments in five distinct groups, according to their <b>stratigraphies.</b> The results of data grouping (two-dimensional graphics) are in agreement with hierarchical cluster analysis by Ward method.

40|$|This paper quantifies the {{potential}} influence of sediment compaction on {{the magnitude of}} nineteenth and twentieth century sea-level rise, as reconstructed from salt marsh sediments. We firstly develop a database of the physical and compression properties of low energy intertidal and salt marsh sediments. Key compression parameters are controlled by organic content (loss on ignition), though compressibility is modulated by local-scale processes, notably {{the potential}} for desiccation of sediments. Using this database and standard geotechnical theory, we use a numerical modelling approach to generate and subsequently ‘decompact’ a range of idealised intertidal <b>stratigraphies.</b> We find that compression can significantly contribute to reconstructed accelerations in recent sea level, notably in transgressive <b>stratigraphies.</b> The magnitude of this effect can be sufficient to add between 0. 1 and 0. 4 mm yr− 1 of local sea-level rise, depending on {{the thickness of the}} stratigraphic column. In contrast, records from shallow (< 0. 5 m) uniform-lithology <b>stratigraphies,</b> or shallow near-surface salt marsh deposits in regressive successions, experience negligible compaction. Spatial variations in compression could be interpreted as ‘sea-level fingerprints’ that might, in turn, be wrongly attributed to oceanic or cryospheric processes. However, consideration of existing sea-level records suggests {{that this is not the}} case and that compaction cannot be invoked as the sole cause of recent accelerations in sea level inferred from salt marsh sediments...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} North Atlantic paleoceanography {{study of}} Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 306 is to place late Neogene–Quaternary climate proxies in the North Atlantic into a {{chronology}} based {{on a combination of}} geomagnetic paleointensity, stable isotope, and detrital layer <b>stratigraphies,</b> and in so doing generate integrated North Atlantic millennial-scale <b>stratigraphies</b> for the last few million years.

In addition to the North Atlantic paleoceanography study, a borehole observatory was successfully installed in a new ~ 180 m deep hole close to Ocean Drilling Program Site 642, consisting of a circulation obviation retrofit kit to seal the borehole from the overlying ocean, a thermistor string, and a data logger to document and monitor bottom water temperature variations through time...|$|R

5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the <b>stratigraphy</b> of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the <b>stratigraphy</b> apparently undisturbed.|$|E

40|$|Four {{continental}} margin turbidite ± black shale terranes of the Lachlan Orogen {{in the southern}} Tasmanides of eastern Australia formed in two major systems along the east Gondwana margin and constrain the Ordovician assembly of this accretionary orogen. Key features are the dissimilar <b>stratigraphies</b> of the adjacent Bendigo and Melbourne terranes in the western system; the dissimilar <b>stratigraphies</b> of the adjacent Melbourne and Albury-Bega terranes that reflect juxtaposition of the two systems during the Middle Devonian, {{and the presence of}} the Albury-Bega Terrane both west and east of the Macquarie Arc in the eastern system that also includes the ocean floor Narooma Terrane and igneous ocean crust terrane(s). Repetition of the Albury-Bega Terrane either side of the arc requires either rifting or orogen-parallel, strike-slip duplication of a once contiguous package. Terrane interactions began in the earliest Gisbornian with early docking, uplift, deformation, and exchange of detritus. Amalgamation occurred in the earliest Silurian Benambran Orogeny with accretion in the Middle Devonian. Over 40 Myr, discrete turbidite terranes aligned along the Gondwana margin in two systems were converted into a very wide orogen characterized by the along-strike juxtaposition of superficially similar terranes. 17 page(s...|$|R
