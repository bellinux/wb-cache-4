5|$|Three {{months after}} the {{creation}} of the Primera Junta, Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes, Santa Fe, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. A few days later his goal was made more specific: he must aim for Paraguay. The Junta had been informed that the patriotic party was strong, and a small army would <b>suffice</b> <b>to</b> take control. Trusting this information, Belgrano went to Paraguay with two possible goals: get acknowledgment for the Junta in Paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires. Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in Paraguay discussed the Junta of Buenos Aires, and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can <b>suffice</b> <b>to</b> realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|The large upper incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} right angle to the upper molars, and heavily {{pigmented}} with orange. Those of T.hylophilus are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont upper incisors <b>suffice</b> <b>to</b> distinguish T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E

5|$|This road {{would serve}} as the initial mail road linking Kingston to Toronto, but was poorly {{maintained}} and soon allowed to fall into disrepair. By 1817, the Kingston Road replaced or bypass much of Danforth's Road, following a similar path to the Trent River (with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough, Port Hope, Cobourg and Grafton) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee. Like the Danforth Road before it, this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road; it would, however, <b>suffice</b> <b>to</b> establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two-day trip from Kingston to Toronto and permit enterprises (such as {{the branches of the}} newly established Bank of Montreal) safe and timely delivery of documents and valuables. By 1839, the Napanee-Kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would <b>suffice</b> <b>to</b> cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere melting and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E
