Motion Picture Exhibitor magazine nominated Robinson for its Best Supporting Actor Laurel Award.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{theatrical}} {{appearance was}} in two one-act plays by Edward Albee, Counting the Ways and Listening, performed {{side by side}} at the Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut. Reviews of the production were mixed, although Lansbury was again <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise. This was followed by another revival tour of Gypsy.|$|E
50|$|In {{his review}} in The Irish Times, Alan Titley praised the novel highly, <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> special mention the author's artistry and clarity of style.|$|R
50|$|He {{opposed the}} {{uncritical}} acceptance by Christians {{of the views}} of pagan classical writers. He was a critic of Macrobius, <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> attack in geography the spherical earth theory of four isolated continents of Crates of Mallus, on theological grounds.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{garnered}} {{a favorable}} critical reaction, holding a fresh rating of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics <b>single</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise {{the performances of}} Emilie Dequenne. Metacritic gave the film an average score of 68/100, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews".|$|R
5|$|In the 1930s, the Australian {{government}} was sufficiently {{concerned about the}} condition and lack of development of these leases that it held two inquiries between 1932 and 1938. Historian Ted Ling's accounts of those inquiries, however, make no mention of Muckaty, which was not <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> comment by either investigation.|$|E
5|$|The first issue, {{released}} on January 21, 2015, saw sales of over 8000 issues, though sales figures would subsequently drop. However, the series has been reviewed positively by critics, with Lorimer's artwork frequently <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise. The complete series was {{collected in a}} trade paperback after its run was finished.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Blatter {{said of the}} {{decision}} to <b>single</b> <b>out</b> Henry <b>for</b> investigation of a handball: ...|$|R
5000|$|Susan Tankersley of Television Without Pity gave [...] "The Hand of God" [...] an A-, {{calling the}} action {{sequences}} [...] "pretty awesome". Simon Brew of Den of Geek reviewed the episode favorably, <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise {{the use of}} the big board and [...] "the increasing complexity of Roslin".|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Degenerarea rasei jidănești" [...] (1928) (transl. Degeneration of the Jewish Race") Paulescu {{states that}} Jews are {{degenerate}} because their brains weigh {{much less than}} [...] "Arian" [...] brains. He <b>singles</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> their low brain weight the Nobel Prize laureates Anatole France (non-Jewish), Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson.|$|R
5|$|Aviation {{safety in}} Brazil {{had been under}} {{increased}} scrutiny following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the Amazon of Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 and an Embraer Legacy 600 (see Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis). Congonhas was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> having safety issues relating to operations in wet weather due to its location and runway characteristics for the traffic it serves.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead being <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, {{was released on}} November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|After the tryout, {{the team}} {{went back to}} work, adding a new musical number for Charlie and a second song in the drag club, {{removing}} another song, and revising the book. The Broadway debut started previews on March 3, 2013 at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, with the official opening on April 4, 2013. Both the Chicago and original Broadway casts starred Billy Porter as Lola, Stark Sands as Charlie and Annaleigh Ashford as Lauren. Porter, in particular, was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> critical praise.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} he assumed the crown, Hilderic was at least into his fifties, if not more than 60. For this reason, {{according}} to Procopius, he was uninterested in the military operations of the Vandals and left them to other family members, of whom Procopius <b>singles</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> mention his nephew Hoamer.|$|R
5000|$|Harris told radio KISS-FM that {{following}} {{the release of}} Motion, {{he wanted to do}} something else, something a bit different. He wanted a <b>single</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the summer because it had been so long since it had happened. [...] "I missed the feeling of having a new song out in the summer." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} one night {{being in the}} Fair myself, at an evening party. I observed old Miss Toady there also present, <b>single</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her special attentions and flattery little Mrs. Briefless, the barrister's wife, who is of a good family certainly, but, as we all know, is as poor as poor can be.|$|R
5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 1944, del Valle, as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery, III Marine Amphibious Corps, {{took part}} in the Battle of Guam and was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. The men under his command did such a good job with their heavy {{artillery}} that no one man could be <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> commendation. Instead each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle, which was carried in his record books.|$|E
5|$|Since 1984, when John Rutter's {{edition of}} the 1893 score was {{recorded}} for the Conifer label, {{there have been numerous}} sets of both the 1893 and 1900 versions issued on CD. Those <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> particular mention by critics are listed below. The Requiem is often combined in recordings and concert performances with Fauré's early Cantique de Jean Racine, an award-winning composition originally for choir and organ which the composer wrote aged 19 in his last year of ten years at the school of church music École Niedermeyer de Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing for the Independent, Sally Newall {{wrote the}} series [...] "left her wanting more", <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{particular}} praise Matt Lucas' [...] "scene-stealing" [...] guest turn, and {{the performances of}} leads Lindsay and Lipman, who were a [...] "treat to watch". She also praised the plotting as [...] "unpredictable and illogical", to her a sign of [...] "good surreal comedy". Writing for Beyond the Joke, Bruce Dessau acclaimed the series as [...] "endearingly, instantly classic", again <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> Lindsay <b>for</b> particular praise as [...] "his pedigree is second to none". He also praised an [...] "elaborate knockabout visual gag", which opened the first episode, as [...] "So brilliant, in fact that they shamelessly do it twice".|$|R

5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> criticism by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions {{when it would}} have been politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had {{ruled that the}} Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Jonathan Widran {{describes the}} songs on Page of Life as [...] "amazing showcases" [...] for Anderson's singing and Vangelis' instrumentation; the lyrics are described as [...] "clever social commentary". Widran <b>singles</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise the songs [...] "Garden of Senses", [...] "Anyone Can Light a Candle" [...] and [...] "Is It Love", which he describes as [...] "whimsical and elegant." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The goaltender trapezoids {{behind each}} goal, added by the NHL before the 2005-06 season, were {{widely viewed as}} <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> Brodeur <b>for</b> his puck-handling skills.|$|R
5000|$|In his October 16, 1981, {{review in}} The New York Times, the film critic Vincent Canby <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> Falk <b>for</b> [...] "one {{of his best}} performances".|$|R
5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including the ones that were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while others say they were his sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured {{that he still}} {{attended}} school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself {{with a range of}} jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> praise in many of the reviews.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{performance}} artist and sex educator Annie Sprinkle <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> HAI <b>for</b> offering workshops that integrate communications exercises into {{the exploration of}} relationships and sexuality.|$|R
5000|$|US envoy Susan Rice said in August 2009 [...] "The {{assembly}} {{continues to}} <b>single</b> <b>out</b> Israel <b>for</b> criticism and let political theater distract from real deliberation." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Anderson of Variety <b>singles</b> <b>out</b> Hodge <b>for</b> his menacing {{lighting}} and artful lensing. [...] Anderson also rates Hodge {{as one of}} his [...] "10 to watch".|$|R
