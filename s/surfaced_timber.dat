40|$|Due to the non-homogeneity {{of timber}} material, the {{roughness}} {{profile of a}} board {{is affected by the}} wood anatomy, thus making the analysis of <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> quality quite complicated. Currently, there is no reliable method to analyse <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> quality independent of the timber species or timber properties. The current standard filtering methods used to determine the surface roughness profile from a measured profile or a primary profile fail to produce reliable results in <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> analysis. This paper proposes a new approach to overcome this shortcoming and to provide more accurate and reliable timber roughness analysis methods. The proposed methods are compared with the current standard methods using data from 35 samples of Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) sanded with seven different grit sizes of abrasive (P 60, P 80, P 100, P 120, P 150, P 180 and P 240).

40|$|With the {{increasing}} emphasis on sustainable development, bamboo is receiving an increasing attention {{as a kind}} of forest resource. But bamboo is readily discoloured by mould fungi, which greatly limits the applications of bamboo. In this research, ZnO nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on the <b>surface</b> of bamboo <b>timber</b> by a simple low-temperature wet chemical method. The morphology, chemical structure, and crystalline structure of the samples were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). XRD studies confirmed that the as-prepared ZnO nanoparticles were wurtzite. The microstructure and hydroxyl groups in the bamboo <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> at the wet state provided cavities and affinity for the creation and the immobilization of ZnO nanoparticles on the bamboo <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, the mould-resistance of ZnO coated bamboo timber was also in focus on the present study.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to promote timber as the {{sustainable}} material of choice for outdoor use in the window construction industry through a unique combination of interlinked investigations: 1. A new product development process for timber window frames; 2. Scientific advancement of surface modification technology; 3. Replacement of non-sustainable materials. This research is an investigation utilising material and product development for the timber construction industry, promoting scientific advances in <b>surface</b> engineered <b>timber.</b> The scientific method of modifying the <b>surface</b> of <b>timber</b> consists of a spray application of water-based graft chemicals that remove natural extractives, chemically bonding molecular chains to increase the surface potential for an adhesion bond. This method of modification is done: &# 9642; to increase the tensile strength of an adhesion bond; &# 9642; to promote the durability of paint on a <b>timber</b> <b>surface.</b> Results of adhesion bonding tests demonstrate, on average, a four-fold increase in tensile strength compared to unmodified samples, with two species achieving an overall increase, 10 -fold that of an unmodified sample of the same species. The success of this practical testing is applied {{in the development of}} a timber window frame that will utilise this new technology to create an environmentally friendly product outcome. Surface-engineered sustainably produced regrowth timber is used and is comparable, and in some cases better, than unsustainable hardwoods which currently dominate the timber window frame market. The next step is engineering timber to advance past its current state, improving characteristics to compete with aluminium and unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (uPVC), which are popular materials in the manufacture of window frames and are toxic burdens for our environment. The importance of ensuring engineered plantation timber is at the same quality of unsustainable hardwoods, uPVC and aluminium, is paramount in guaranteeing an improved, sustainable future...|$|R

40|$|The most {{significant}} issue regarding timber use for outdoor products is the poor characteristics this material has {{with regard to}} weathering over a prolonged period of time. Ongoing product maintenance is something the majority of consumers want to avoid, hence the domination of aluminium and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) in the window frame industry. Timber has numerous benefits over its competition such as sustainability, aesthetics, low thermal conductivity and ease of manufacture, but unfortunately its major weakness [...] poor outdoor performance [...] {{is the main reason}} consumers are deterred away from this material. This paper will explain how an environmentally friendly water-based process for <b>surface</b> modification of <b>timber,</b> developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), was tested for its potential ability to enhance adhesion of timber products and then implemented into an innovative timber window frame. This timber window frame is used as an exemplar for outdoor timber products to highlight the benefits of integrating successful scientific research into an industrial design outcome. The surface modification process applied to the outermost <b>surface</b> of <b>timber</b> neutralises natural extractives and chemically bonds adhesive promoting molecular chains to the <b>timber's</b> <b>surface.</b> The process is carried out to significantly increase the quality of adhesion of an applied decorative or protective coating. The resultant testing confirmed a convincing increase in the bond strength for all timber species investigated in this doctoral project by an average factor of four-fold, with some species achieving a 10 -fold strength increase. The successful results obtained from the first phase of testing of glue-bonded timber samples led to an investigation of the surface modification technology for improved lamination of coatings on timber. Results for this second test phase also confirm the success of this modification science on coatings, as minimal delamination of surface coated samples was documented against non-modified timber samples.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to resolve the}} contradictory relationship between the ecological merits of wood construction and the significant material intensity of recent free form <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> structures. The building industry is now adept {{in the design and}} construction of freeform surface architecture, however new challenges have been introduced with the environmentally conscious desire to build these structures in wood. Lacking the formal versatility of steel and concrete, wood introduces a great deal of difficulty in the realization of complex form at an architectural scale. Powerful digital design and fabrication tools have recently made it possible to model, analyze and construct these buildings, but at the cost of heavy structural solutions that involve energy intensive fabrication processes and significant material waste. This approach contradicts the ecological benefits of wood, and {{raises the question of whether}} it is possible to achieve free and expressive form in <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> architecture while maintaining an economy of means and material. This question is addressed through the development of a generative design tool for the creation of material conscious free form <b>timber</b> <b>surface</b> architecture. The formation of the tool is informed by the field of computational morphogenesis, which draws from the natural growth processes of biological structures in the virtual synthesis of form. The tool is conceived as a morphogenetic material system, which consists of a generative algorithm that integrates material, structure and form in a single computational process. Specific material saving techniques deployed in the algorithm draw from existing research in timber shell design and material optimization. Established methods in the use of geodesic lines for the structural patterning of wood shells and stress driven material distribution make up the core concepts deployed in the algorithm. The material system is developed, refined and tested through the design and construction of an experimental free form timber lattice...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} {{research study}} {{referred to in}} this paper is the fusion of two disciplines that have both been instrumental in creating an environmentally conscious product. Inter-disciplinary studies {{in the field of}} materials science and industrial design converge with the aim to help push each discipline further in the pursuit for advanced knowledge in materials development and designed outcomes. The above approach facilitated significant breakthroughs in both disciplines: in materials science through drastic improvement of adhesion properties of timber through rigorous scientific research and in product design through utilising product performance requirements for advanced industrial design as a means for innovation. An environmentally friendly water-based process for <b>surface</b> modification of <b>timber,</b> developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was tested for its potential ability to enhance adhesion of timber products and then implemented into the product design process. The surface modification process applied to the outermost <b>surface</b> of <b>timber</b> neutralises natural extractives and chemically bonds adhesive promoting molecular chains to the <b>timber’s</b> <b>surface.</b> The process is carried out to significantly increase the quality of adhesion of an applied decorative or protective coating. The ensuing testing confirmed a drastic increase in the bond strength for all timber species investigated in this project by an average factor of four-fold, with some species achieving a 10 -fold strength increase. The successful outcome of this scientific research is subsequently applied {{in the development of a}} timber window frame that utilises this new surface modification technology to create an environmentally friendly product outcome. Surface-engineered, sustainably produced regrowth timber used in this work provides the performance comparable, and in some cases better, than unsustainable hardwoods which currently dominate the timber window frame market. The design segment of this research utilises a design process based on technology-led design strategies. Technology-led design requires that the existing and accepted design methodologies, based on user and producer design parameter paradigms, are reconfigured.

Next, site surveys should be carried out giving details of the soil profile, groundwater level, extent and depth of the permafrost and location and size of ice lenses.
