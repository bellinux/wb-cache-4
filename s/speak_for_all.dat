5|$|During {{the discussions}} between Gandhi and the British {{government}} over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation {{to the end}} of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned Congress party and Gandhi's authority to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|The second {{episode in}} Bismarck's {{unification}} efforts occurred in 1866. In {{concert with the}} newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist {{the other in a}} war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian Landtag (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these public}} {{reactions}} {{have been criticized}} for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face. Intersectional feminists often find that white feminists attempt to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> women when relaying their experiences of the gender pay gap, when in reality their problems are not relatable to women of color who face an additional barrier of racism.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{formerly}} quiet {{labor unions}} began asserting themselves rather forcefully. [...] The Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 turned ugly, {{with the union}} demanding the right to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> trucking employees. [...] As {{a result of this}} strike and many others across the nation, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. [...] Government programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration brought much-needed work projects to the state. [...] Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, giving Minnesota's Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.|$|E
500|$|David Van Reybrouck {{praised the}} speech as [...] "memorable", but {{argued that it}} damaged Lumumba's own legacy. Since Lumumba and his party {{represented}} {{only a third of}} Congolese popular opinion, Van Reybrouck accused Lumumba's claim to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> Congolese people [...] "divisive" [...] and questioned whether it was appropriate given the context: [...] "Lumumba's address contained more of a look back than a look forward, more rage and hope, more rancour than magnanimity, and therefore more rebellion than statesmanship". He also compared it to the Communist Julien Lahaut's republican heckling of Baudouin's corronation in 1950. Like Lumumba, Lahaut was subsequently murdered after he had [...] "claimed all the attention" [...] at the public event.|$|E

500|$|Naser Khader, a Muslim Danish MP, founded an {{organisation}} called Democratic Muslims in Denmark {{in response}} to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because [...] "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united {{and that there is a}} real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." [...] He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.|$|E
2500|$|Former Prime Minister Trudeau {{and similar}} critics {{argued that the}} further {{devolution}} of powers was unnecessary and {{did not result in}} any [...] "trade-off" [...] with the Federal government.

2500|$|Change {{came in the}} 1950s.

2500|$|The Independent Women's Forum (IWF) {{is another}} antifeminist, conservative, women-oriented group. It's younger and less {{established}} than the CWA, {{though the two}} organizations are often discussed in relation to each other. It was founded {{to take on the}} [...] "old feminist establishment". Both of these organizations pride themselves on rallying women who do not identify with feminist rhetoric together. These organizations frame themselves as being by women, for women, in order to fight the idea that feminism is the only women-oriented ideology. These organizations chastise feminists for presuming to universally <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> women. The IWF claims to be [...] "the voice of reasonable women with important ideas who embrace common sense over divisive ideology".|$|E

2500|$|The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma are {{the closest}} living {{descendants}} of the Illiniwek Confederacy, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years. In a television interview with WICD-TV in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, [...] "To {{say that we are}} anything but proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We're proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been there.

2500|$|In January 2015, Netanyahu {{was invited}} to address the US Congress. This speech marked Netanyahu's third speech to {{a joint session of}} Congress. The day before announcing he would address Congress, Time {{reported}} that he tried to derail a meeting between U.S. lawmakers and the head of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, who intended warning them against imposing further sanctions against Iran, a move that might derail nuclear talks. Leading up to the speech, on 3 March 2015, Israeli consuls general in the United States [...] "expect fierce negative reaction from U.S. Jewish communities and Israel's allies". Objections included the arrangement of the speech without the support and engagement of the Obama administration and the timing of the speech before Israel's 17 March 2015 election. Seven American Jewish lawmakers met with Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. and recommended that Netanyahu instead meet with lawmakers privately to discuss Iran. In making the speech, Netanyahu claimed to <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> Jews worldwide, a claim disputed by others in the Jewish community. Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, stated that [...] "American Jews are largely appalled by the notion that Netanyahu, or any other Israeli politician – one that we did not elect and do not choose to be represented by – claims to speak for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over Karzai's alleged {{consultant}} work with Unocal (Union Oil Company of California since acquired by Chevron in 2005). In 2002, when Karzai {{became the subject of}} heavy media coverage as one of the front runners to lead Afghanistan, it was reported that he was a former consultant for them. [...] Spokesmen for both Unocal and Karzai have denied any such relationship, although Unocal could not <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> companies involved in the consortium.

500|$|Critic Hilton Als {{believes}} that {{the title of this}} book may have an additional significance. [...] A prevailing theme in Gather Together is how one Black female was able to survive in the wider context of post-war America, but it also <b>speaks</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> Black women, and how they came to survive in a white-dominated society. Critic Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees: [...] "The incidents in the book appear merely gathered together in the name of Maya Angelou".|$|R
5000|$|Hagee {{has been}} criticized for his {{statements}} about Israel, the Roman Catholic Church, and Islam. One notable critic is journalist Bill Moyers, who claims that Hagee and other evangelicals are working toward supporting the religious right.
