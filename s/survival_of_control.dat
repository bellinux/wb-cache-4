40|$|The National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program (ITP) has {{developed}} a plan to evaluate agents that are considered plausible candidates for delaying rates of aging. Key features include: (i) use of genetically heterogeneous mice (a standardized four-way cross), (ii) replication at three test sites (the Jackson Laboratory, TJL; University of Michigan, UM; and University of Texas, UT), (iii) sufficient statistical power to detect 10 changes in lifespan, (iv) tests for age-dependent changes in T cell subsets and physical activity, and (v) an annual solicitation for collaborators who wish to suggest new interventions for evaluation. Mice in the first cohort were exposed to one of four agents: aspirin, nitroflurbiprofen (NFP), 4 -OH- -phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (4 -OH-PBN), or nordihydroguiaretic acid (NDGA). An interim analysis was conducted using survival data available on the date at which at least 50 of the male control mice had died at each test site. <b>Survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> males was significantly higher, at the interim time-point, at UM than at UT or TJL; all three sites had similar <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> females. Males in the NDGA group had significantly improved survival (P 0. 0004), with significant effects noted at TJL (P < 0. 01) and UT (P < 0. 04). None of the other agents altered survival, {{although there was a}} suggestion (P 0. 07) of a beneficial effect of aspirin in males. More data will be needed to determine if any of these compounds can extend maximal lifespan, but the current data show that NDGA reduces early life mortality risks in genetically heterogeneous mice at multiple test sites...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Gemcitabine {{has been}} shown to exert a {{radiosensitizing}} effect in various epithelial cancers. The aim of the present studies was to investigate whether the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using the (131) I-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (MAb) MN- 14 could be enhanced by coadministration of gemcitabine in nude mice with small (1 - 3 mm) peritoneal metastases of colonic origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine was determined, when administered intraperitoneally at two different dosing schedules (0. 11 - 3. 0 mg/mouse/administration on days 0, 3, 6, and 9, or 0. 022 - 0. 60 mg/mouse/administration on days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). In two separate therapy studies in which these two administration regimens were applied, the efficacy of gemcitabine monotherapy was compared to that of RIT alone (125 muCi (131) I-MN- 14 /mouse) or RIT combined with gemcitabine. RESULTS: When administered every 3 rd day for a total of 4 administrations, or daily for 5 consecutive days, the gemcitabine was considered safe at 0. 33 mg/mouse/administration and 0. 066 mg/mouse/administration, respectively. In the first therapy study, median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> mice was 39 days. Gemcitabine monotherapy at 0. 11 mg or 0. 33 mg/mouse/administration every 3 rd day (total, 4 administrations) resulted in a median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 52 and 57 days, respectively (p = 0. 0003, compared to controls). RIT alone resulted in a median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 66 days (p < 0. 0001, compared to <b>controls).</b> The combination <b>of</b> RIT and gemcitabine coadministration resulted in a median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 73 and 94 days, respectively (p = 0. 12, for trend). In the second therapy study, median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> mice was 48 days, which was similar to the median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the mice treated with daily administrations of gemcitabine monotherapy at 0. 022 mg/mouse/administration on 5 consecutive days (49 days; p = 0. 17). RIT alone resulted in a significantly improved median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 66 days (p= = 0. 0010, compared to controls). Combination therapy using RIT and gemcitabine resulted in a median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> 64 days, which did not differ significantly from the <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the mice treated with RIT alone (p = 0. 43).

40|$|Calcineurin (CaN) is a Ca 2 +- and calmodulin-dependent protein {{phosphatase}} (PP 2 B) that, in yeast, is {{an integral}} intermediate of a salt-stress signal transduction pathway that effects NaCl tolerance through the regulation of Na+ influx and efflux. A truncated form of the catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunit of yeast CaN were coexpressed in transgenic tobacco plants to reconstitute a constitutively activated phosphatase in vivo. Several different transgenic lines that expressed activated CaN also exhibited substantial NaCl tolerance, and this trait {{was linked to the}} genetic inheritance of the CaN transgenes. Enhanced capacity of plants expressing CaN to survive NaCl shock was similar when evaluation was conducted on seedlings in tissue culture raft vessels or plants in hydroponic culture that were transpiring actively. Root growth was less perturbed than shoot growth by NaCl in plants expressing CaN. Also, NaCl stress <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> shoots was enhanced substantially when grafted onto roots of plants expressing CaN, further implicating a significant function of the phosphatase in the preservation of root integrity during salt shock. Together, these results indicate that in plants, like in yeast, a Ca 2 +- and calmodulin-dependent CaN signal pathway regulates determinants of salt tolerance required for stress adaptation. Furthermore, modulation of this pathway by expression of an activated regulatory intermediate substantially enhanced salt tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Mitofusin 2 (MFN 2), {{an outer}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane protein expressed in virtually all human tissues, is a multi-faceted protein known to affect mitochondrial morphology, metabolism, tethering, and movement as well as overall cell cycle progression. Most intriguing among its characteristics {{is its ability to}} bind to Ras and Raf, upstream effectors in the MAPK/ERK pathway. Conditional knockout (cKO) of renal proximal tubule MFN 2 in vivo showed a post-ischemic protective effect. While the two day <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> mice was only 28 %, an unexpected 86 % of the MFN 2 cKO mice were alive at two days post-ischemia. This is likely explained by MFN 2 's ability to bind and sequester Ras at baseline. Because the MFN 2 deficient mice did not sequester as much Ras, renal proximal tubule cells were able to proliferate at a greater rate and restore organ function more quickly. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm a strong interaction between Ras and MFN 2 in resting cells but a weaker one immediately following ischemic insult, even in cells replete with MFN 2. These results suggest that blocking the MFN 2 -Ras interaction may be a novel method to treat acute kidney injury. A small peptide mimicking Ras to block MFN 2 could be feasible. This should grant ischemic tissue an increased propensity to regenerate healthy cells while leaving non-ischemic tissue completely unaffected. Such a therapeutic agent would be novel in the treatment of acute kidney injury and may have uses in other tissues as well due to MFN 2 's widespread expression profile...|$|E
40|$|With {{cryopreservation}} {{of biological}} material comes {{a series of}} harmful processes. One of these processes is called recrystallization, where small ice crystals go together to form large crystals. To prevent harmful processes like recrystallization, different additives called cryoprotectants {{are added to the}} solution. A group of cryoprotectants called antifreeze proteins (AFP) are found in organisms like fish and insects living in environments where the temperature regularly drops below the freezing point of water. This project has examined a specific AFPs ability to enhance bacterial survival during cryopreservation. The specific AFP is originally found in the insect Rhagium Mordax (RmAFP). Only the intracellular effect of the protein is examined in this project. To do this, solutions with genetically modified Escherichia Coli (E. coli) expressing RmAFP were cryopreserved at - 18 oC and - 5 oC. The survival rate was compared to the <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> group <b>of</b> bacteria expressing a histidine-tag instead of RmAFP. In 57 % of the experiments, the <b>survival</b> rates <b>of</b> bacteria expressing RmAFP were higher than the <b>survival</b> rates <b>of</b> the <b>control.</b> This does not show a clear link between the survivability and the presence of RmAFP in E. coli. However, in experiments where the bacteria expressing RmAFP had the highest survival rate, it was increased with 72 - 96 % compared to the control. In experiments where the <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> was the highest, the increase was only 14 - 29 % compared to the RmAFP expressing bacteria. This pattern indicates a positive effect of the RmAFP but because of inconsistency, more experiments are required to confirm whether or not RmAFP has any effect on the survival rate...|$|R

While tree species can potentially outgrow herbivores, understorey plants {{are unable to}} do so and may remain prone to herbivory in developing restored sites. We assessed the effectiveness of various mechanical and biological guards (Acacia companion plants) against grazing of the palatable dryland sedge Tetraria capillaris (hair sedge), in sites restored after bauxite mining in the jarrah forest of Western Australia. Six months after planting, grazing was severe and repetitive, and affected plant survival. Grazing intensity and severity reduced over time (from 95 % to 64 % of surviving plants grazed after six and a half years). No method of guarding entirely prevented grazing. Plants with plastic sleeves and Polynet mesh tubes showed significantly higher survival rates in short and longer term compared with unprotected controls (62 % survival for both treatments compared with 30 % <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> after six and a half years). Plastic sleeves were most effective at guarding T. capillaris against grazing although they were less cost-effective than Polynet tubes.

40|$|Purpose: Targeted {{delivery}} of alpha-particle emitting radionuclides is a promising novel option in cancer therapy. We generated stable conjugates of the vascular tumor-homing peptide F 3 both with 225 Ac and 213 Bi to specifically target tumor cells. The aim {{of our study}} was to determine therapeutic efficacy of 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 in comparison with 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3. Experimental Design: ID 50 values of 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 and 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 were detrmined via clonogenic assays. Therapeutic efficacy of both constructs was assayed after repeated treatment of mice with intraperitoneal MDA-MB- 435 xenograft tumors. Therapy monitoring was performed by bioluminescence imaging. Nephrotoxic effects were analyzed by histology. Results: ID 50 values of 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 and 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 were 53 kBq/ml and 67 Bq/ml, respectively. Median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> mice treated with PBS was 60 days after i. p. inoculation of 1 x 107 MDA-MB- 435 cells. Therapy with 6 x 1. 85 kBq 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 or 6 x 1. 85 MBq 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 prolonged median survival to 95 days and 97 days, respectively. While 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 reduced the tumor mass at early time points until 30 days after treatment, 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 showed a prolonged anti-tumour effect. No significant difference concerning the fraction of necrotic cells was found after treatment with 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 (43 %) or 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 (36 %). Though histological analysis of the kidney samples revealed acute tubule necrosis and tubular edema in some 10 - 30 % after treatment with 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 or 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3, protein casts were negligible (2 %), indicating only a minor damage of the kidney. Conclusions: Therapy with both 225 Ac-DOTA-F 3 and 213 Bi-DTPA-F 3 increased survival of mice with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Mild renal toxicity of both constructs favours future therapeutic application. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
40|$|The Wabash River, Indiana {{supports}} {{an important}} population of shovelnose sturgeon, the only sturgeon of the North American genus Scaphirhynchus not currently listed as endangered. Telemetry {{was used to}} identify habitat use, understand seasonal migrations, and recognize small-scale movement patterns of this unique population. During the spring of 2009, 30 shovelnose sturgeon, 15 males and 15 females, from the middle Wabash River were implanted with ultrasonic transmitters. Manual tracking was conducted near Lafayette, Indiana, and six passive receivers were deployed throughout the river to monitor large scale movement. In addition to shovelnose sturgeon implanted and tracked, 60 fish were used the following summer to establish if the surgery and implantation of the ultrasonic tags influenced survival. These 60 fish were assigned to control and experimental treatments, monitored for 30 days in culture ponds, and assessed for tag loss. Results from the tracking indicate site fidelity of sturgeon during the spring spawning period and a potential for long distance, post-spawn migrations of at least 320 kilometers by males. Most tagged shovelnose sturgeon were no longer observed in the spawning area {{by the end of}} June, suggesting the end of the spring spawning period. <b>Survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and experimental fish in the ponds yielded lower than anticipated numbers, but it was determined that mortality was driven by a pond effect and not by the surgery and implantation process. Also, five of 30 implanted shovelnose sturgeon exhibited tag loss. This work was able to identify important habitat use of shovelnose sturgeon during the spawning period, the species 2 ̆ 7 sedentary activity while in the spawning area, large post-spawn movements by males, and the suitable survival of shovelnose sturgeon implanted with dummy ultrasonic transmitters. However, further study of female shovelnose sturgeon post-spawn movements and mortality associated with internal tagging is needed. With increased commercial harvest possible in the Wabash due to recent legislation, these findings can be used to help protect the population and supplement future work. ...|$|E

Comparative fungal burdens in organs showed a decrease in liver (P < 0. 05) and spleen (P < 0. 05) burdens for ABCD with the 19. 2 -mg/kg therapy versus those with ABDS with the 0. 8 -mg/kg therapy and liver burdens for ABCD with the 12. 8 -mg/kg therapy versus ABDS with the 0. 8 -mg/kg therapy (P < 0. 05). There was no difference in organ burdens between therapy with ABCD at 0. 8 mg/kg and ABDS at 0. 8 mg/kg. These data show that the efficacy of ABCD is equal to that of ABDS on a milligram-per-kilogram basis for murine disseminated cryptococcosis. Because of its decreased toxicity, greater efficacy with ABCD could be achieved through doses fourfold higher than the 100 % lethal dose for ABDS. Thus, ABCD shows promise as an effective but less toxic alternative to ABDS for the treatment of disseminated cryptococcosis...|$|R

Trough CsA whole blood levels were > 400 ng/ml for the first 7 days and > 200 ng/ml thereafter. FK 506 levels were > 15 ng/ml. We excluded from further analysis 5 early deaths (< 3 days) due to anesthesiologic (n= 2) or technical reasons (n= 3). Median <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> pigs was 9. 5 days (range, 4 - 13). Cyclosporine did not extend survival: median, 9 days (range, 5 - 31) (P= 0. 6). FK 506 prolonged survival: median, 37 days (range, 21 - 49) (P< 0. 001 vs. control and CsA pigs). Of FK 506 pigs, 60 % gained weight (+ 75 g/day), whereas 100 % of controls and 75 % of CsA pigs lost weight (- 550 g/day and - 300 g/day, respectively). All control pigs died of rejection within 2 weeks versus none of the FK 506 pigs. However, 36 % of CsA pigs died of rejection. Groupwise comparison showed less rejection in FK 506 versus control pigs (P< 0. 001) and in FK 506 versus CsA pigs (P< 0. 03), but no difference between CsA and control pigs. None of the control pigs died of GVHD versus 18 % of CsA pigs (by day 31) and 37 % of FK 506 pigs (by day 49). Groupwise comparison showed increased GVHD in FK 506 versus control pigs (P< 0. 001) and a tendency toward increased GVHD in FK 506 versus CsA pigs (P= 0. 08). None of the control pigs died of infection alone versus 22 % of CsA pigs (by day 31) and 67 % of FK 506 pigs (by day 49). Groupwise comparison showed increased infection in FK 506 versus control pigs (P< 0. 001). We detected significant endotoxemia early and late postoperatively. But we saw no specific correlation between endotoxemia, rejection, GVHD, or infection. Based on this study, we have drawn several conclusions: (1) In untreated pigs, TBTx provokes a severe rejection response, but no lethal GVHD. (2) Cyclosporine and particularly FK 506 pigs have a high incidence of infection and lethal GVHD, a complication that we had not seen after solitary SBTx. (3) FK 506 {{is superior}} to CsA in controlling rejection and in prolonging graft and recipient survival; FK 506, however, does not reduce GVHD, but rather tends to augment it. (4) TBTx causes endotoxemia. As with solitary SBTx, FK 506 {{is superior to}} CsA after TBTx. However, longterm survival is difficult to achieve on FK 506 recipients because of the development of GVHD and infection. status: publishe...|$|E

3000|$|Before the {{parameterization}} of the TKTD module, {{the basic}} DEB parameters for rainbow trout {{and the control}} treatment data from Experiment 1 were used to estimate the food availability in that experiment by estimating the scaled functional response. Subsequently, we estimated the background hazard rate ḣ_ 0 using the mean <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> and <b>of</b> the concentrations that showed no significant effect on survival (0, 10 and 17.7 ng/L). As a next step, the remaining five parameters for the TKTD module (see Table 1) were estimated simultaneously. During the TKTD parameter estimation, the observed onset of effect patterns could only be matched by assuming that the uptake of the compound started after the fish had started to feed (swim-up), and not before. This is a simplified assumption that will be further discussed in [...] "Discussion".|$|R

The five independent variables were <b>survival,</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over the environment, growth, size of the organization and innovation. Performance was the dependent variable. It was discovered that entrepreneurial performance was significantly influenced by several factors such as political factor, relevant experiences, formal education, innovation, social relations, capital availability and level of delegation of authority. However, four of the hypotheses were tested in the predicted direction. The prediction that large-sized organizations would have more high performers than others was not supported. The study concluded that any programme designed {{for the benefit of}} indigenous entrepreneurs must have multiple rather than single approach to achieve the desired outcomes...|$|R

The purposes of this study were to identify the correlates and predictors of academic achievement of adolescents with behavior disorders. Eighty-six 11 - to 15 -year-old students identified as behaviorally disordered were individually administered a series of standardized assessment instruments. The assessment battery included the Quick-Score Achievement Test, School Survival Skills Scale, Intellectual-Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire, and the Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. The <b>survival</b> skills, locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and study skills measures were correlated with students' standardized achievement test scores and academic grade point average. Overall, student performance on the standardized achievement test was significantly correlated with organizational skills and an internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> orientation. Organizational and task completion skills were significantly correlated with special education and overall grade point averages. Generally, the significance of the relationship between school <b>survival</b> skills, locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and study skills and the academic achievement measures remained unchanged when IQ was controlled. IQ and organizational skills were identified as significant predictors of writing, arithmetic, reading, general facts and overall academic achievement. Organizational skills was the only significant predictor of students' special education grade point average. Two variables, organizational skills and age, were significant predictors of overall grade point average. No predictors were identified for mainstream grade point average.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityNew {{strategies}} for disease-modifying treatment of Alzheimer's Disease {{are being developed}} {{as a result of}} advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and underlying neurodegenerative processes. Identification of the heterogenous genetics of Alzheimer's Disease has demonstrated autosomal dominant and susceptibility genes which operate in different forms of the disease. Disease-modifying treatments involve neurotrophic factors, protein-processing modulators, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and estrogen. Nerve growth factor improves the <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> neurons. The <b>control</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress and destructive inflammation may decrease the rate of neurodegeneration. Modulation of protein processing has the goal of decreasing the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

40|$|Between 1972 and 1986, 134 {{patients}} with stage A {{carcinoma of the}} prostate (CAP) were diagnosed at a single Veterans Administration medical centre and followed annually by the hospital tumour registry. Seventy-four were classified as stage A 1, defined as non-palpable, well-differentiated CAP, regardless of amount, found unexpectedly on transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Twenty-eight were classified as stage A 2, defined as non-palpable, moderately or poorly differentiated CAP, regardless of amount, found unexpectedly on TURP. The remaining 32 were reclassified as atypical hyperplasia/adenosis (AH/A) rather than CAP. The <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> each group was compared with the <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> a <b>control</b> group from the same medical centre who had TURPs showing histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Survival and tumour progression were similar for {{patients with}} stage A 1 CAP, AH/A and BPH. Furthermore, patients with stage A 1 CAP, with or without therapy, had similar survivals as patients with BPH in each age group (under 65, 65 - 74 and over 74 years).

MRCC cases not treated by immunotherapy (n = 89) represent our historical controls. Adverse clinical side effects related to treatment were negligible. CR (n = 11) and PR (n = 13) were noticed in 24 / 122 patients. Of 24 responding patients, 17 resumed progression, whereas 7 remain in remission 11 - 69 months later.
