40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} observation of three dimensional self-deformation in an atmospheric micro discharge of the helium microjet through a tube into the ambient air upon a water electrode. The geometry of the discharge system is axial symmetric. While decreasing the discharge current, three dimensional collective motion of plasma filaments are directly observed. The three dimensional configuration of the discharge self changed from an axial <b>symmetrical</b> <b>horn</b> to a rectangular horn when the water acts as a cathode.

40|$|A {{non-autonomous}} {{version of}} the standard map with a periodic variation of the parameter is introduced and studied. Symmetry properties in the variables and parameters of the map are found and used to find relations between rotation numbers of invariant sets of the autonomous realization of the period-two case of the map. The role of the nonautonomous dynamics on period-one orbits, stability and bifurcation is studied. The critical boundaries for the global transport {{and the destruction of}} invariant circles with fixed rotation number are studied in detail using direct computation and a continuation method. In the case of global transport, the critical boundary has a particular <b>symmetrical</b> <b>horn</b> shape. The results are contrasted with similar calculations found in the literature.

60|$|The herd rushed on, {{leaving the}} white {{surface of the}} lake gray with a struggling, kicking, bellowing heap. When Jones reached the caribou he saw several trying to rise on {{crippled}} legs. With his knife he killed these, not without some hazard to himself. Most of the fallen ones were already dead, and the others soon lay still. Beautiful gray creatures they were, almost white, with wide-reaching, <b>symmetrical</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dean ML is {{a similar}} design to the star, but differs in having <b>symmetrical</b> tail <b>horns</b> (or wings as they are known in Flying V and similar designs). The Washburn Guitars Dime (or Dimebag, after Dimebag Darrell who popularised the Dean design) uses the Dean ML profile.|$|R
50|$|The puku {{antelope}} {{is limited}} to about 100 individuals along the Chobe River in Botswana and the Linyati marshes in Namibia. The black and white rhino have suffered the most from poaching and {{are on the verge}} of extinction. If there had been no effort to save them in the last 20 years they most likely would have disappeared altogether. While both species occur naturally in Namibia, in many of the reserves they have been reintroduced. The country also has the largest population in southern Africa of cheetah not contained within national parks. There are over twenty species of antelope ranging from the largest, the eland, to the smallest, the Damara dik-dik. The gemsbok, a striking antelope with long <b>symmetrical</b> <b>horns</b> and distinctive black and white markings is featured on the Namibian coat of arms. Namibia also harbours a wealth of small mammals including mongoose, jackal as well as the less common antbear and honey badger, both solitary and nocturnal.|$|R
40|$|Novel {{concept of}} feeding EBG horn antennas via {{evanescent}} fields is introduced. The principle of creating <b>symmetrical</b> all-dielectric pyramidal <b>horn</b> antennas based on woodpile structures is explained in detail. F band antennas {{based on the}} above mentioned concepts were designed, their Ku band scaled-up prototypes were fabricated and measured. 3 page(s...|$|R
30|$|A 28 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of one {{previous}} second trimester pregnancy loss at 17 Â weeks of gestation was referred for management. On physical examination, she had normal physical and secondary sexual characteristics. External genital organs were normal. An ultrasound examination revealed a bicornuate uterus with two <b>symmetrical</b> uterine <b>horns</b> and a single cervix. Both ovaries were normal. On inquiry, the patient gave a history of similar malformations in other members of her family. A renal ultrasound was done to rule out associated anomalies of the urinary system. Investigations for other probable causes of abortion like genetic, infective, hormonal, and immunological were negative.|$|R
40|$|We have {{researched}} the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the horn length of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra L.) on {{a sample of}} 718 animals of both sexes (425 males, 293 females) that were shot in chamois population in the eastern Karavanke mountain ridge in northwestern part of Slovenia in the period 1985 - 2003. Horn length reflects FA in male {{as well as in}} female population. Absolute FA in horn length increases with age in both sexes. Among young animals, twoyear olds stand out as the ones with higher FA. Within single age classes we have not detected any differences in absolute FA in-between sexes. We have, however, detected dependence between FA and the size of horns among females. Fluctuating asymmetry increases with an increase in horn length. No dependence has been found between absolute FA and carcass mass. We have not detected any differences in relative FA in females within single age classes. If we presume, that only individuals of good quality and individuals which arenot under stress conditions are able to develop more <b>symmetrical</b> <b>horns,</b> we can ascertain that our results do not confirm the presumption that FA in secondary sexual characteristics reflects the quality of the individual. Hornsof bigger individuals are not more symmetrical. We therefore assume that the asymmetry in horn length could be a characteristic feature of the age of an individual but could not be a characteristic feature {{of the quality of the}} individual. The symmetry in horn length in chamois probably does not have highsignificance in contacts between animals...|$|R
50|$|The {{birds are}} black. The rooster {{might have a}} few red or gold {{feathers}} on the wings. Over time, white spots can occur on its feathers, which {{is a sign of}} aging. On the head there is a characteristic crest of black feathers. There might be two <b>symmetrical</b> short <b>horns</b> on its nose, like the horns of a goat. In most cases their V-shaped comb (crest) leans forward. Its beak is yellow (or gold), or even white, whereas the feet are mainly olive-green, as well as gray. The types that have green feet always have a yellow-gold beak, and their song lasts, or even exceeds, 1 minute. The rooster's tail has some longer sword shaped feathers and it is held straight (horizontal with the body).|$|R
