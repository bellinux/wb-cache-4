40|$|Objectives:One-year {{clinical}} {{outcome of}} a new endovascular treatment for long segmental arterial occlusive disease using a ring <b>strip</b> <b>cutter</b> (RSC) to minimise surgical exposure. Design:Prospective, open study. Materials:Thirty-eight consecutive RSC procedures in 36 consecutive patients with lengthy occlusive (34) or multiple stenotic (4) femoropopliteal lesions were performed. Indications for operation were disabling claudication in 25 (66 %), rest pain in 3 (8 %), and gangrene in 10 (26 %) patients. Methods:A newly developed endovascular ring <b>strip</b> <b>cutter</b> device was used to perform a remote endarterectomy through a single groin incision. Clinical data were analysed based on intention-to-treat. Results:Initial angiographic, clinical and haemodynamic success was achieved in all 38 (100 %) limbs. Mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly from 0. 62 ± 0. 14 to 1. 02 ± 0. 14 postoperatively (p = 0. 01). Four failures have occurred during follow-up. After one-year experience the cumulative (assisted) primary and secondary patency rates are 80 % and 85 % respectively. Duplex surveillance has detected progressive recurrent stenoses in 10 cases. Conclusions:Remote endarterectomy of long segmental femoropopliteal occlusive disease through a single groin incision with the Ring <b>Strip</b> <b>Cutter</b> device is a safe and effective procedure. The early patency rates are good. Further long-term results are needed to evaluate this technique...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveRemote endarterectomy of {{external}} and common iliac artery occlusions through a single, groin incision under fluoroscopic guidance {{is a relative}} unknown surgical procedure. This prospective single center cohort study describes this less invasive endovascular technique with the ring <b>strip</b> <b>cutter</b> and its early complications. The results at midterm follow-up are presented. Patients and methodsFrom April 1994 to July 2001, 49 remote-endarterectomies of the external or common iliac artery were performed in a retrograde manner from a single, groin incision in 48 patients (30 men, 31 procedures). The median age was 66 years (39 to 82 years). Indications for operation were as follows: severe claudication in 28 (57 %), rest pain in 13 (27 %), and gangrene in 8 (16 %) procedures. Follow-up included clinical evaluation, ankle-brachial index, and duplex scanning at 6 weeks, 3 months, and yearly thereafter. ResultsIntraoperative technical success was achieved in 43 (88 %) procedures. A retroperitoneal incision was necessary in three patients for an additional arteriotomy in the iliac artery and in three others for a bypass procedure. The mean follow-up was 20 months (2 to 77 months). Three-year cumulative primary patency rate by means of life table analysis was 60. 2 % ± 12. 0 (SE). During follow-up, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty with and without stenting was performed in six and two patients, respectively, resulting in a 3 -year primary-assisted patency rate of 85. 7 % ± 9. 56. Three-year secondary patency was 94. 2 % ± 5. 50. ConclusionsRemote endarterectomy in external and common iliac arterial occlusive disease is a feasible endovascular procedure with a low complication rate. The midterm primary-assisted patency rate is good...|$|E
5000|$|Cozy Fillerup, {{single mother}} and love {{interest}} to Cutter John. She {{was introduced in}} the 2015 revival of the <b>strip</b> when <b>Cutter</b> John and crew ran over her with his wheelchair, the [...] "Aluminium Falcon".|$|R
5000|$|Cutter John {{is one of}} Breathed's oldest characters, first {{appearing}} in The Academia Waltz. (In those days his name was given as [...] "Saigon John" [...] and his war injury is described as taking a shot (presumably friendly fire) while smoking a bong (improvised from his M16) with a North Vietnamese soldier, making his tunnel rat story presumably a retcon.) His more familiar name is most likely a reference to Trapper John McIntyre from M*A*S*H. While a major character {{in the first half}} of Bloom County 's nine-year run, his role was reduced to only occasional cameos for the remainder of that strip and its immediate spin-off, Outland. In the commentary in one of the Bloom County collections, Breathed observed that he dropped Cutter John from the strip because it was too artistically challenging and [...] "frustrating" [...] to draw someone sitting down in every panel of the comic. According to Breathed, a wheelchair-using fan of the strip, upon hearing this observation, said Breathed [...] "ought to try sitting in a wheelchair himself for real frustration". In the revival Bloom County <b>strips,</b> <b>Cutter</b> John has been seen standing with the aid of forearm crutches.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was past}} midnight on February 19, 1962, a misty and cloudy night, when the five friends {{approached}} {{the border to}} West Berlin's Reinickendorf district from the east side at Rosenthal, in Pankow. After observing {{the movement of the}} border guards, they sneaked through a cemetery known today as [...] "Friedhof Pankow VII" [...] to its back fence, which also comprised the inner, or hinterland, fence of the border security <b>strip.</b> Using wire <b>cutters,</b> they cut a hole in the first fence, and one after another, they crawled through the hole, and through the snow, towards the outer border fences. They had almost reached them when border guards noticed them, and began shooting at them. A bullet hit Dorit Schmiel in the abdomen, causing her to cry out; only then did the guards stop firing and approached the group. The remaining four surrendered, and obeyed the order to stand up. But Schmiel remained on the groud, bleeding profusely, and crying in pain. She was transported to the Krankenhaus der Volkspolizei (People's Police Hospital) in Mitte, where she died later that same night.|$|R
50|$|When engaged, an {{automatic}} wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic wire stripper's cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All wire strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic wire stripper's short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably <b>stripped.</b> If the <b>cutter</b> opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|R
