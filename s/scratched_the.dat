5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or <b>scratched,</b> <b>the</b> resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E

5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of the probe tip based nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> According to <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth, <b>the</b> probe tip is modeled as a spherical capped conical tip or a spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip {{to calculate the}} normal force needed for <b>the</b> nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> In order to further investigate <b>the</b> impact of <b>scratching</b> speed, scratching depth and <b>scratching</b> direction on <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> simulation is implemented in LS-DYNA software, and a mesh-less method called smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{is used for the}} sample construction. Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>scratching</b> depth and <b>the</b> face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At <b>the</b> same <b>scratching</b> depth, <b>the</b> normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different scratching directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions.

500|$|Opened on April 1, 1936, the U-Drop Inn {{was built}} by J.M.

Berry draw up the blueprints for the art deco structure, and construction began at the busy intersection of Route 66 and U.S. Route 83. Nunn, whose family owned and ran the business, sponsored a contest to decide the name of the new building. An eight-year-old boy won a week's worth of waitressing pay (approximately $50.00 at the time) with his entry of [...] "U-Drop Inn". In addition to a café, the building housed a gas station that sold Conoco brand fuel and a store. [...] The store was never actually opened as a store, and became a ballroom and overflow dining area for the café.|$|E
500|$|In 1887, a {{front page}} article of the San Diego Union {{declared}} the Estudillo {{home to be}} [...] "Ramona's Marriage Place", saying, [...] "To sleepy Old Town (the house) {{is known as the}} Estudillos, but the outside world knows it as the marriage place of 'Ramona.'" [...] This was despite Jackson never having visited the house, but in the novel, Ramona was married in a [...] "long, low adobe building which had served no mean purpose in the old Presidio days, but was now fallen in decay; and all its rooms, except those occupied by the Father, had been long uninhabited". Despite the novel being a work of fiction, visitors flocked to the building thinking it was the actual location of Ramona's marriage. To be clear, the Union did not simply invent this story; a tourist had already <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> name [...] "Alessandro" [...] (Ramona's husband in the novel) in one of the walls. The caretaker decided to capitalize on the attendant publicity and began selling off pieces of the house as souvenirs. Naturally, the building's condition began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
500|$|Battery {{is defined}} as [...] "the {{intentional}} and direct application of force to another person", and has three elements; force, direct application and intent. The courts have also added a requirement of [...] "hostility" [...] or lack of consent in many cases. As with assault, {{there is no need}} to show that damage was caused. Any application of physical contact, regardless of harm caused, can constitute force. In Collins v Wilcock, a female police officer took hold of a woman's arm, intending to talk to her on suspicion of soliciting contrary to the Street Offences Act 1959. The woman <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> female police officer's arm. As the female police officer had gone beyond her duties in grabbing the woman (since she did not intend to charge her with an offence, but was still using force) it was held that this constituted [...] "force".

At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book, he was told that it should be a [...] "classic Greg Bear giant – in the vein of Eon, Anvil of the Stars and so on", but inspired by Halo and its extended universe. The book and author were announced on April 6, 2009. 343 Industries' General Manager, Bonnie Ross, stated that the back and forth with Bear made [...] "the whole experience better", and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback.

500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E
