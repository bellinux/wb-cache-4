On 7 June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s, escorted by F-15s, executed Operation Opera, their first employment in a significant air-to-ground operation. This raid severely damaged Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad, to prevent the regime of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>from</b> using the reactor {{for the creation of}} nuclear weapons.|$|E

After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>from</b> power in Iraq.|$|E

After the failure of the uprising, citizens were killed in large numbers. Parts of the city were nearly leveled.|$|E

25|$|Scott Ritter, a disaffected former arms inspector, {{asserted}} in his October 19, 2005 {{interview with}} Seymour Hersh that the US policy to remove Iraqi president <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>from</b> power started with US president George H.

The justification for sanctions was disarmament. The CIA offered the opinion that containing Hussein for six months {{would result in the}} collapse of his regime. According to Hersh, this policy resulted in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Americanism is {{felt very}} {{strongly}} in Jordan and {{has been on the}} rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is {{among the highest in the}} world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>from</b> power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although negative attitudes have gone down to 85%, anti-Americanism is still amongst the most widespread in Jordan than any other country in the world.|$|E

Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6. There was subsequent debate about whether UN Coalition forces should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>from</b> power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces. Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and Coalition forces had left Iraq too soon. In an April 15, 1994 interview with C-SPAN, Cheney was asked if the U.S. and UN forces should have moved into Baghdad. Cheney replied that occupying and attempting to take over the country would have been a [...] "bad idea" [...] and would have led to a [...] "quagmire", explaining that: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{third part}} focuses on how Bamford {{feels that the}} Bush {{administration}} and its pro-Israeli neo-conservatives deceived the American public, and the United Nations {{in order to justify}} the invasion of Iraq. Removing the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime <b>from</b> power in Iraq, and replacing it with a pro-American puppet, would change the map of the Middle East. The events of 9/11, Weapons of Mass Destruction, the accusation of Iraq having near-nuclear capabilities, the ties of Saddam and Al-Qaeda were all based on bogus, or very weak intelligence reports, and exaggeration. The Rendon Group, paid handsomely by the Bush Administration, was also allegedly involved in liberally spreading propaganda to the American public to persuade people into believing that Iraq was an imminent threat. This part of the book can be summarized as the abuse of America's intelligence agencies in order to fabricate a pretext for the war in Iraq, and achieve political goals on behalf of America and the Israeli government in the process.|$|R

In a powerful offensive lasting only 100 hours, the Allied forces - with the 82nd on the far western flank - crossed into Iraqi territory, devastated the Iraqi Army and captured thousands of enemy soldiers.

25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition.

Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is removed <b>from</b> power.|$|R
