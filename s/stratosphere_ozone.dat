Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the <b>stratosphere.</b> <b>Ozone</b> depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E

40|$|Emissions from {{aviation}} {{have become}} a focus of increasing interest in recent years. The growth of civil aviation is faster than nearly all other economic sectors. Increased demand {{has led to a}} higher growth rate in fossil fuels consumption by the aviation sector. Despite more fuel-effcient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the growth of air travel contributes to increase pollution attributable to aviation. Aircraft are currently the only human-made in situ generators of emissions in the upper troposphere and in the stratosphere. The depletion of the <b>stratosphere's</b> <b>ozone</b> layer by CFCs and related chemicals has underscored the importance of anticipating other potential insults to the ozone layer. Different possible solutions have been advanced to reduce the environmental impact of aviation, such as electrication of ground operations, optimization of airline timetables and airspace usage, limitation of cruise altitude and increased use of turboprop aircrafts. Those improvements seem very limited answers, which allow only marginal reduction of the environmental footprint of air transport. Breakthrough concepts such as the all-electric aircrafts must be considered. Today state of electric-propulsion is demonstrating a lack of performance and operative range if compared to traditional propulsion concepts.

Nitric oxide is a known mechanism to destroy ozone and was once present or created from combustion of liquid rocket fuels; however this has mostly been eliminated. The nitric oxide mechanism is not as ozone depleting as solid-fueled rockets. Destruction of ozone by nitric oxide is short and immediate after launch, minimizing the time window for destruction. This seems to not allow enough time for the rocket to reach the <b>stratosphere,</b> where <b>ozone</b> is most abundant.

40|$|A chemistry-climate model {{coupled to}} an ocean model {{is used to}} compare the climate impact of past (1960 - 2010) changes in {{concentrations}} of halocarbons with those of CO 2 in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The halocarbon contribution to both upper troposphere warming and the associated increase in lower stratospheric upwelling is about 40 % as large as that due to CO 2. Trends in cold-point temperature and lower stratosphere water vapor are positive for both halocarbons and CO 2, and are of about the same magnitude. Trends in lower <b>stratosphere</b> <b>ozone</b> are negative, due to the increased upwelling. These increases in water vapor and decreases in lower <b>stratosphere</b> <b>ozone</b> feed back on lower stratosphere temperature through radiative cooling. The radiative cooling from ozone is about a factor of two larger than that from water vapor {{in the vicinity of the}} cold-point tropopause, while water vapor dominates at heights above 50 hPa. For halocarbons this indirect radiative cooling more than offsets the direct radiative warming, and together with the adiabatic cooling accounts for the lack of a halocarbon-induced warming of the lower stratosphere. For CO 2 the indirect cooling from increased water vapor and decreased ozone is of comparable magnitude to the direct warming from CO 2 in the vicinity of the cold-point tropopause, and (together with the increased upwelling) lowers the height at which CO 2 increases induce stratospheric cooling, thus explaining the relatively weak increase in cold-point temperature due to the CO 2 increases...|$|E
40|$|The GSFC 2 D {{interactive}} chemistry-radiation-dynamics {{model has}} been used to study the effects on stratospheric trace gases of past and future CO 2 increases coupled with changes in CFC'S, methane, and nitrous oxide. Previous simulations with the GSFC model showed that the stratospheric cooling calculated to result from doubling atmospheric CO 2 would lead, {{in the absence of a}} growth of other anthropogenic gases, to a decrease in upper stratospheric NO(y) of roughly 15 %. This work has been extended to simulate changes in stratospheric chemistry and dynamics occurring between the years 1960 and 2050. The simulations have been carried out with and without changes in CO 2. In the low latitude upper <b>stratosphere</b> <b>ozone</b> is predicted to be 10 % greater in 2050 than in 1990 when increased CO 2 is included, compared with an increase of only 2 % without the inclusion of CO 2.

Between 1990 and 2050 low latitude water vapor is predicted to increase by 4 % and 2 % in the upper and lower stratosphere, respectively, without the inclusion of CO 2 increases. with the inclusion of CO 2 changes, the water vapor increases are predicted to be roughly 12 % and 8 %, for the upper and lower stratosphere, respectively...|$|E
