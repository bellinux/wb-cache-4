5000|$|In fact, while {{conducting}} a weapons certification inspection {{prior to a}} scheduled westpac, the Officer of the Deck (OOD), directed the Chief of the Watch (COW) to silence the induction <b>sump</b> <b>tank</b> alarm due to constant cycling. The OOD then directed the COW to pin open the diesel head valve {{in order to stop}} the constant cycling of the pneumatic actuator (due to state 3 seas). Upon securing the antennas (the boat was ventilating while near the surface to pick up routing radio traffic), the OOD directed the boat to return to its regular patrol depth. However, because no Fan Room watch was set when the alarm was cut-out, nobody immediately noticed that water was dumping into the Fan Room when the boat started to dive. It wasn't until there was an announcement of flooding in the Torpedo Room over the 4MC that the crew went to General Quarters. At this time, the Throttleman answered ahead-full and the OOD ordered a five second emergency blow of the forward ballast tanks. Of course, when the boat went to a positive bubble, all the water in the ventilation system dumped into the engine room. After broaching the surface, the boat went nose down again (still at ahead full), and began a second downward descent. The CO finally ordered a full emergency blow to get the Houston back to the surface.|$|E

5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing <b>sump</b> <b>tanks</b> contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|R
40|$|A remote {{surveillance}} system was designed, tested {{and will be}} deployed at INEEL that will monitor the TAN- 616 facility for water in <b>sumps,</b> <b>tanks,</b> and on the floor.

This system replaces the need to send inspectors into the facility with radiation control personnel to check for water. Some of the areas that would be checked by the inspectors have a high radiation field and little space for maneuvering. Therefore, this system also decreases the radiation exposure and increases the safety of these personnel. A {{remote surveillance}} system has a higher initial capital cost for the equipment than the baseline method, which is to send inspectors into the building to obtain samples and perform measurements. However, the cost of operating and maintaining the system is negligible compared to the continuing cost of sending inspectors and radiation control technicians into the facility.

On arrival, about 5000 eggs were placed into two 200 -L, conical-shaped, fiberglass incubator tanks filled with freshwater, with a flow-through system that had a flow rate of 500  mL/min. With this system, egg shells were retained in the incubation tank while larvae from the two incubation tanks were moved into the <b>sump</b> <b>tank.</b> Larvae from the <b>sump</b> <b>tank</b> were then transferred to the holding tank (200 L volume) at a stocking density of 50 larvae/L. The holding tank was filled with 6 ppt saline water and gently aerated. The water temperature in the holding tank was preserved at 20  ±  0.5  °C by a thermostatically controlled heater (Sonpar, Model-Ha 200). The newly hatched larvae were then haphazardly taken to perform morphometric measurements, age at first feeding, and mortality experiments. The rest of the larvae were kept unfed in this tank {{until the end of the}} experiment. The swimming behaviour of the larvae was observed simultaneously to identify the initial time of starvation characterized by a slow-moving swimming, hanging the head down into the water column, or almost no reaction to gentle probing.|$|E
40|$|An Unreviewed Safety Question (Wagoner, 1997) was {{declared}} based on {{lack of adequate}} authorization basis for Tank 241 -Z- 361 in the 200 W Area at Hanford. This document is {{a summary of the}} history of Tank 241 -Z- 361 through December 1997. Documents reviewed include engineering files, laboratory notebooks from characterization efforts, waste facility process procedures, supporting documents and interviews of people`s recollections of over twenty years ago. Records of transfers into the tank, past characterization efforts, and speculation were used to estimate the current condition of Tank 241 -Z- 361 and its contents. Information about the overall waste system as related to the settling tank was included to help in understanding the numbering system and process relationships. The Plutonium Finishing Plant was built in 1948 and began processing plutonium in mid- 1949. The Incinerator (232 -Z) operated from December 1961 until May 1973. The Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF, 236 -Z) began operation in May 1964. The Waste Treatment Facility (242 -Z) operated from August 1964 until August 1976. Waste from some processes went through transfer lines to 241 -Z sump tanks. High salt and organic waste under normal operation were sent to Z- 9 or Z- 18 cribs. Water from the retention basin may have also passed through this tank. The transfer lines to 241 -Z were numbered D- 4 to D- 6. The 241 -Z sump tanks were numbered D- 4 through D- 8. The D- 4, 5, and 8 drains went to the D- 6 <b>sump</b> <b>tank.</b> When D- 6 tank was full it was transferred to D- 7 tank. Prior to transfer to cribs, the D- 7 tank contents was sampled. If the plutonium content was analyzed to be more than 10 g per batch, the material was (generally) reprocessed. Below the discard limit, caustic was added and the material was sent to the cribs via the 241 -Z- 361 settling tank where solids settled out and the liquid overflowed by gravity to the cribs. Waste liquids that passed through the 241 -Z- 361 settling tank flowed from PFP to ground in the following sequence: Processes to D- 4, D- 5, D- 6 Drains to D- 6 <b>Sump</b> <b>Tank</b> to D- 7 or D- 8 <b>Sump</b> <b>Tank</b> to 241 -Z- 361 Settling Tank to Cribs.

40|$|Tokamak Cooling Water System (TCWS) drain tanks (DTs) serve two functions: normal {{operation}} and safety operation. Normal DTs {{are used for}} regular maintenance operations when draining is necessary. Safety DTs are used to receive the water leaked into the Vacuum Vessel (VV) after an in-vessel {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) event. The preliminary design of the DTs shall be based on the information provided by this document. The capacity of the normal DTs is estimated based on the internal volume of in-vessel components [e. g., First Wall/Blanket (FW/BLK) and Divertor (DIV) ]; Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) components; and TCWS piping, heat exchangers, electric heaters, pump casing, pressurizers, and valves. Water volumes have been updated based on 2004 -design information, changes adopted because of approved Project Change Requests (PCRs), and data verification by US ITER and AREVA Federal Services, the US ITER A and E Company. Two tanks will store water from normal draining operations of the FW/BLK and DIV Primary Heat Transfer Systems (PHTSs). One tank will store water from normal draining operations of the NBI PHTS. The capacity of the safety DTs is based on analysis of a design basis accident: a large leak from in-vessel components. There are two safety DTs that will receive water from a VV LOCA event and drainage from the VV, as needed. In addition, there is one <b>sump</b> <b>tank</b> for the DIV that will be used for collecting drain water from the draining and drying processes and specifically for draining the DIV system as the DIV cassette lines are at a lower elevation than the DT connection point. Information documented in this report must be refined and verified during the preliminary design of the DTs, and there are several aspects to be considered to complete the preliminary design. Input to these design considerations is discussed in this report and includes, but is not limited to, water inventory; operating procedures/maintenance; Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA); tank layout and dimensions, including design margin; classification under French Nuclear Pressure Directives, Equipements Sous Pression Nucleaires (ESPN); and adaptations for construction...|$|E

2500|$|Some marine aquariums {{include a}} sump, {{which is an}} {{external}} container connected to the main aquarium with a water pump. In most setups, the sump is located below the aquarium and is fed water from the main tank via an overflow. An overflow at its simplest is a round hole drilled towards {{the top of the}} tank, connected via tubing to an output below it. As the water level increases past the height of the overflow, the water [...] "overflows" [...] the tank and falls through to the sump below. The water circulation is powered by a water pump in the sump, which pushes the water back into the tank, thus causing more water to flow over and perpetuating the cycle. There are many advantages to using a sump, both for the appearance and the health of the <b>tank.</b> The <b>sump</b> helps the appearance of the tank, because it allows filtration and maintenance equipment (protein skimmer, heater, activated carbon) to be kept {{out of sight of the}} main tank.

40|$|The sealing {{capability}} of the Ares-I Upper Stage liquid oxygen tank-to-sump joint is assessed by analyzing the deflections of the joint components. Analyses are performed using three-dimensional symmetric wedge finite element models and the ABAQUS commercial finite element software. For the pressure loads and feedline interface loads, the analyses employ a mixed factor of safety approach {{to comply with the}} Constellation Program factor of safety requirements. Naflex pressure-assisted seals are considered first because they have been used successfully in similar seal joints in the Space Shuttle External Tank. For the baseline sump seal joint configuration with a Naflex seal, the predicted joint opening greatly exceeds the seal design specification. Three redesign options of the joint that maintain the use of a Naflex seal are studied. The joint openings for the redesigned seal joints show improvement over the baseline configuration; however, these joint openings still exceed the seal design specification. RACO pressure-assisted seals are considered next because they are known to also be used on the Space Shuttle External Tank, and the joint opening allowable is much larger than the specification for the Naflex seals. The finite element models for the RACO seal analyses are created by modifying the models that were used for the Naflex seal analyses.

When such booster pumps are directly connected to the water utility's supply pipe, without an underground isolation <b>tank</b> (<b>sump),</b> they often induce negative pressure in the supply pipe which increases the flow rate. Unfortunately, where leakage rates are high, this negative pressure also {{increases the risk of}} contaminant intrusion. This thesis presents the iterative design and field testing of a patent-pending, full-bore, back-pressure regulating valve. The valve's simple mechanism relies on a stabilized collapsing tube, or 'Starling Resistor,'which when installed at a customer's connection, controls the flow rate and prevents booster pumps from creating negative pressure in the supply pipe. In collaboration with the Delhi Jal Board and several private partners, the valve's performance was verified in two rounds of field trials in neighborhoods of New Delhi, India including Pitampura, Azad Market, Vivek Vihar, Malvia Nagar, and Vasant Vihar. Using a crossover study, the valve was found to reduce the total contamination risk across all 19 tested houses during supply times by a median of 80 %. The valve prevented 96 % of pressure below - 1 meter and an average of 53 minutes per day, per connection of total negative pressure. In an estimated worst-case scenario for contaminant intrusion, the presence of the valve reduced the contamination risk by two orders of magnitude at six customer connections - enough to correspond to significant reductions in health risks. by David Donald James Taylor.

Controlling motor speed with load change has proven very successful in many applications such as water pumping. It is therefore important to optimize the efficiency of motor drive and pump systems if significant energy savings are to be obtained. The system gives best performance when system operates at the rated operating condition with the constant pressure head. But in actual operation the system is operating different operating point due to present system condition. (Actual system head may vary with the sump level, and the designed pump characteristics may not match with the present condition, so on). This causes to inefficient system operation. // This thesis proposes a new control scheme based on Neuro-Fuzzy concepts. The fuzzy logic concept used computes the required motor speed to meet the optimum overall efficiency of the pumping system {{in the presence of}} the variation of the output pressure, <b>sump</b> level and <b>tank</b> level. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used to predict the required Voltage and Frequency as the speed changes. // The network was trained on a set of data patterns generated by calculation based on the induction motor with pump equivalent circuit, using Matlab/Simulink computer piograme. A simulation result of overall efficiency and specific energy consumption has shown a very good concordance between the two methods, (with or without Neuro-Fuzzy controller). // The detail of overall energy saving while proposed Neuro-Fuzzy control shows below table. Energy savings 433, 555 kWh per annum Benefit Rs. 3, 077, 850. 00 perannuam The proposed methods can be easily implemented on pumping system equipped with pressure sensors. However, like many pumping system control techniques, the developed model is sensitive to motor and pump parameter variation due to temperature changes. // Finally, the advantages that can be gained by Neuro-Fuzzy controller with the proposed efficiency optimization algorithm are tremendous, and energy saving can be achieved with a very high percentage, specially in the field of water pumping systems...|$|R
