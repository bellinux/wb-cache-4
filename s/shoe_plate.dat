50|$|The Arai {{drum brake}} is used during long {{downhill}} descents where a rim brake might overheat the tire and possibly {{cause it to}} fail. The drum of the brake screws onto {{the left side of}} the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> slips over the axle and a small reaction arm from the <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.|$|E

50|$|An older {{system is}} the {{toe-clip}} and toestrap. A toeclip is a metal cage attached {{to the front of}} the pedal into which the rider inserts the shoe. There are two methods for using pedals with toeclips. The first is a cycling shoe with a slotted shoeplate. Before the introduction of the clipless pedal, most racing shoes had a hard leather or plastic sole to which a metal or plastic <b>shoe</b> <b>plate</b> or cleat was attached. The shoeplate had a slot that fitted into the pedal. The shoeplate along with toe clip and strap keep the rider's feet firmly attached to the pedals. The drawback is that a rider had to reach down and loosen the toestrap by hand to take his foot out of the pedal and for this reason toeclips have been made largely obsolete by clipless pedals. The second is to use a cycling shoe with a smooth sole or a non-cycling shoe. This had the disadvantage of the rider's feet not being firmly attached to the pedals but had the advantage of being able to release from the pedals without having to loosen the strap by hand, and also any shoe can be used.|$|E
5000|$|On September 22, 2016, the Ministry of Transportation {{released}} several {{reports on}} the technical causes of the January 10, 2016 bearing failure. Two reports, from Surface Science Western and National Research Council Canada, were released pertaining solely {{to the analysis of}} the failed bolts connecting the bearing to the bridge girders. They both found that the bolts met all required standards and they failed progressively due to severe overloading beyond their capacities. The second component of the analysis involved an engineering evaluation, undertaken by ministry bridge engineers and an independent engineering consultant. They both found that there were 3 main causes for the failure; 1) The <b>shoe</b> <b>plate,</b> which connects the bearing to the girder, was too flexible - creating [...] "prying action" [...] which amplified the forces on some bolts, 2) The bearings could not properly rotate, increasing the load on some bolts, 3) Bolt tightening was not performed, subjecting the bolts to fatigue. The ministry also revealed that the permanent repair to the bridge would involve a [...] "linkage" [...] system that would hold down the bridge and allow horizontal movements due to thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge superstructure.|$|E

40|$|Properties of equestrian {{surfaces}} such as hardness, traction {{and resistance}} to penetration may change during competition. A surface itself has a direct impact upon an athlete {{since it is the}} primary point of contact, therefore any changes which occur could affect performance or the possibility of injury. At present management regimes which are aimed at reducing such risks are based upon anecdotal evidence from site managers and surface construction companies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to validate a suite of mechanical tests on sand, fibre, rubber and wax equestrian surface, which were then used to quantify the effects of a preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competition on the hardness, traction {{and resistance to}} penetration of the surface. In addition laboratory analysis was used to determine surface components and the effects of temperature on the surface. The mechanical properties that were measured were hardness, using a Clegg Impact tester, traction, using a torque wrench and penetrability, using a penetrometer. Each piece of equipment was tested on a prepared, synthetic equestrian surface at Myerscough International Arena, in order to determine the method of use which produced results with least variability. The results of this work suggested that the 2. 25 kg Clegg hammer, the torque wrench using a horse <b>shoe</b> <b>plate,</b> under a weight of 30 kg, and the Longchamp penetrometer, should be used. It was also found that five repetitions should be made in a single position with each piece of equipment. The equipment was used to test a 20 m x 40 m dressage arena, before and after six preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competitions, held between January and June 2009. Thirty two positions were tested within the arena, which were split into two sets of 16. The first set of 16 were positioned 7. 5 m apart around the outside (track) area, and the second set of 16 were randomly positioned in the central area using a stratified random sampling method. In addition, temperature data was recorded at each of the competitions. The results showed that the hardness of the surface increased significantly (P< 0. 05) after a preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competition. The changes in the traction of the surface varied with each competition, all changes were found to be significant (P< 0. 05). The results regarding the penetrability of the surface were affected by the presence of the fibres in the surface, and therefore were deemed unreliable in this instance. There were significant changes to the surface over the period of six months, hardness decreased from 80 Â± 0. 9 G to 62 Â± 0. 8 G (P< 0. 001), traction decreased from 21. 5 Â± 0. 1 Nm to 16. 9 Â± 0. 1 Nm (P< 0. 001) and total penetration depth increased from 1. 9 Â± 0. 03 cm to 3. 6 Â± 0. 06 cm (P< 0. 001). There were significant differences found between the mechanical properties of the track and the central areas (P< 0. 05). The findings show that the mechanical properties of the surface changed significantly over a dressage competition. Short term changes could leave late competitors working on a different surface to early competitors, thus the running order of an event could affect the results. This highlights a need for further examination of the interrelationship between performance and surface variability. Significant long term changes were evident in hardness, traction and penetration, highlighting the need for a management protocol informed by surface testing in order to provide a surface with consistent properties...|$|E

50|$|Where skin staples {{are used}} to seal a skin wound it will be {{necessary}} to remove the staples after an appropriate healing period, usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the location of the wound and other factors. The skin staple remover is a small manual device which consists of a <b>shoe</b> or <b>plate</b> that is sufficiently narrow and thin to insert under the skin staple. The active part is a small blade that when hand-pressure is exerted it pushes down on the staple and pushes it through a slot in the shoe and deforms the staple into an 'M' shape to facilitate its removal, although in an emergency it is possible to remove them with a pair of artery forceps.Skin staple removers are manufactured in many shapes and forms, some disposable and some reusable.|$|R

He was tall and majestic in stature, and carried to advantage the powdered wig and three-cornered hat, the broad-skirted coat, knee-breeches, high <b>shoes,</b> and <b>plated</b> buckles of the ancient costume. There was just a sufficient degree of the formality of olden times to give a certain quaintness to all he said and did. He was a man of a considerable degree of talent, force, and originality, and in fact had been held in his day to be one of the most promising graduates of Harvard University. But, being a good man, he had proposed to himself no higher ambition than to succeed to the pulpit of his father in Harpswell.|$|R

Whether the apostle here means stout, well-tanned leather, leather well prepared, by his [...] "preparation of the gospel of peace" [...] or shoes which had spikes in them, which, running into the ground, gave a steadfastness to the soldier who wore them, may come under remark hereafter. We shall only add, that Moses seems, at least according to our rendering, to have some allusion to <b>shoes,</b> either <b>plated,</b> or spiked, on the sole, when he says, (Deut. xxxiii. 25.) [...] "Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days shall thy strength be." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this study was to}} investigate the biomechanical influence of the walking <b>shoe</b> with a <b>plate</b> spring in the heel and interchangeable heel cushioning elements. Eighteen subjects walked in three conditions: 1) the walking shoes Type A- 1 with a soft heel insert, 2) the Type A- 2 shoe with a stiff heel insert, 3) a general walking shoe(Type B). Ground reaction forces, leg movements, leg muscle activity and ankle, knee and hip joint loading were measured and calculated during overground walking. During walking, the ankle is a few degrees more dorsiflexed during landing and the knee is slightly more flexed during takeoff with the Type A shoes. As a result of the changes in the walking movement, the ground reaction forces are applied more quickly and the peak magnitudes are higher. Muscle activity of the quadricep, hamstring and calf muscles decrease during the first 25 % of the stance phase when walking in the Type A shoes. The resultant joint moments at the ankle, knee and hip joints decrease from 30 - 40 % with the largest reductions occurring during landing...|$|R

Compliant clutch is made from polypropylene material and there is no anyone connecting parts. it has rigid body design since revolute joints are replaced by flexible segment. The potential energy store in flexible segment can replace springs and reduction in revolute joints reduces problem with backlash and wear. The compliant clutch includes rigid body mechanism through dimensional synthesis by graphical method. A mechanism is evaluated and synthesized specific force-deflection relationship. In many applications, compliant mechanism can maintain or even improve performance relative to conventional rigid body designs. It is cost benefitted. Also conventional clutch is expensive rather than compliant clutch...|$|R

6000|$|Upon {{this scene}} of desolation {{the sun shone}} with almost {{intolerable}} splendour, and all living nature seemed to have hidden itself from the rays, excepting the solitary figure which moved through the flitting sand at a foot's pace, and appeared the sole breathing thing on the wide surface of the plain. The dress of the rider and the accoutrements of his horse were peculiarly unfit for the traveller in such a country. A coat of linked mail, with long sleeves, plated gauntlets, and a steel breastplate, had not been esteemed a sufficient weight of armour; there were also his triangular shield suspended round his neck, and his barred helmet of steel, over which he had a hood and collar of mail, which was drawn around the warrior's shoulders and throat, and filled up the vacancy between the hauberk and the headpiece. His lower limbs were sheathed, like his body, in flexible mail, securing the legs and thighs, while the feet rested in <b>plated</b> <b>shoes,</b> which corresponded with the gauntlets. A long, broad, straight-shaped, double-edged falchion, with a handle formed like a cross, corresponded with a stout poniard on the other side. The knight also bore, secured to his saddle, with one end resting on his stirrup, the long steel-headed lance, his own proper weapon, which, as he rode, projected backwards, and displayed its little pennoncelle, to dally with the faint breeze, or drop in the dead calm. To this cumbrous equipment must be added a surcoat of embroidered cloth, much frayed and worn, which was thus far useful that it excluded the burning {{rays of the sun}} from the armour, which they would otherwise have rendered intolerable to the wearer. The surcoat bore, in several places, the arms of the owner, although much defaced. These seemed to be a couchant leopard, with the motto, [...] "I sleep; wake me not." [...] An outline of the same device might be traced on his shield, though many a blow had almost effaced the painting. The flat top of his cumbrous cylindrical helmet was unadorned with any crest. In retaining their own unwieldy defensive armour, the Northern Crusaders seemed to set at defiance the nature of the climate and country to which they had come to war.|$|R
