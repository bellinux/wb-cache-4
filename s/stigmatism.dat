Self-induced (through autosuggestion) itching and subsequent scratching of which the individual is unaware is likely to occur in suggestible persons if the stimulus is a mental or actual picture of the Crucifixion used during meditation and if the main motive is to receive the stigmata. The motive behind that may be unconscious conflict and a desire to escape from an intolerable situation into invalidism where one's needs are taken care of. It then becomes a case of hysterical conversion reaction. Many cases of <b>stigmatism</b> can be explained as fraud or unconsciously self-inflicted wounds.|$|E

50|$|Sex {{can also}} be a {{determinant}} of other aspects of mental health as well. The time of onset of symptoms can be different dependent on one’s sex. Women are more likely to show signs of mental illnesses, such as depression, earlier and at a younger age than men. Many believe this to be a correlation with the onset time of puberty. As a result of social <b>stigmatisms</b> and stereotypes within society, women {{are also more likely to}} be prescribed mood-altering medications, whereas men are more likely to be prescribed medications for addictions. Further research on the mental health disparities among sex and gender is needed in order to gain a deeper knowledge of the predictors of mental health and the possible differences in treatments.|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{addresses}} the many issues that today’s youth face and aims {{to rethink the}} youth centre as a place that combines youth culture and architecture to create a space that not only provides adequate recreational and vocational opportunities but which is also representative of youth. Theoretically, I focus on notions around finding identity within the city, whilst questioning the <b>stigmatisms</b> around various youth subcultures. I look in more depth at how certain youth appropriate space within the city and by analyzing their process of appropriation, whilst noting the significance the stages of appropriation have in the pursuit for one’s identity, parallels are drawn from various theorists. Particular reference to theories by Iain Borden, Jeffrey Hou, Andy Bennett, Dick Hebdige and others, explore the notions around the insurgent use of public space, youth culture, street culture, {{and the meaning of}} style and expression among youth. Through research into various subcultures of youth and activities that youth are actively involved in in and around the city, it aims to explore the youth centre as a programmatic model for reaching young people in South Africa. By appropriating the language and influences of youth as key design ingredients, it aims to create an architectural intervention, called The 3 rd Place Youth Centre, in Newtown North, through which youth can reconnect to their surroundings thus giving youngsters a much-needed sense of place and identity within their ever-changing city...|$|R
40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{number of}} women who are graduating in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields continues to be a major concern. Despite national support in the form of grants provided by National Science Foundation, National Center for Information and Technology and legislation passed such as the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that encourages women to enter the STEM fields, the {{number of women}} actually graduating in these fields is surprisingly low. This research study focuses on a robotics competition and its ability to engage female adolescents in STEM curricula. ^ Data have been collected to help explain why young women are reticent to take technology or engineering type courses in high school and college. Factors that have been described include attitudes, parental support, social aspects, peer pressure, and lack of role models. Often these courses were thought to have masculine and “nerdy” overtones. The courses were usually majority male enrollments and appeared to be very competitive. With more female adolescents engaging in this type of competitive atmosphere, this study gathered information to discover what about the competition appealed to these young women. ^ Focus groups were used to gather information from adolescent females who were participating in the First Lego League (FLL) and CEENBoT competitions. What enticed them to participate in a curriculum that data demonstrated many of their peers avoided? FLL and CEENBoT are robotics programs based on curricula that are taught in afterschool programs in non-formal environments. These programs culminate in a very large robotics competition. My research questions included: What are the factors that encouraged participants to participate in the robotics competition? What was the original enticement to the FLL and CEENBoT programs? What will make participants want to come back and what are the participants’ plans for the future?^ My research mirrored data of previous findings such as lack of role models, the need for parental support, social <b>stigmatisms</b> and peer pressure are still major factors that determine whether adolescent females seek out STEM activities. An interesting finding, which was an exception to previous findings, was these female adolescents enjoyed the challenge of the competition. The informal learning environments encouraged an atmosphere of social engagement and cooperative learning. Many volunteers that led the afterschool programs were women (role models) and a majority of parents showed support by accommodating an afterschool situation. The young women that were engaged in the competition noted it was a friendly competition, but they were all there to win. ^ All who participated in the competition had a similar learning environment: competitive but cooperative. Further {{research is needed to determine}} if it is the learning environment that lures adolescent females to the program and entices them to continue in the STEM fields or if it is the competitive aspect of the culminating activity. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of criminal choice {{in which an}} offender's probability of arrest depends on his level of criminal activity {{as well as the}} actions of the criminal justice system. In addition, current choices affect future outcomes through a stock accumulation process. We introduce social capital stock into the preference structure to represent the flow of services associated with a good reputation and social acceptance. Social capital is used to account for the influence of social norms on the crime decision by assuming that the <b>stigmatism</b> associated with arrest depreciates an individual's social capital stock. Euler equations exclusive of the value function cannot be obtained from the first-order conditions of our dynamic model since the probability of arrest depends on the individual's own actions. This becomes an issue for estimation because the value function is not specified completely by parameterizing the utility function. We overcome this issue using a nested fixed-point algorithm within the estimation procedure to numerically approximate the value function. social capital, dynamic model, panel data, value function approximation, simulated method of moments...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} dynamic model {{of crime in}} which agents anticipate future consequences of their actions. Current period decisions affect future outcomes by a process of capital accumulation. While investigating the role of human capital, {{the focus of our}} study is on a form of capital that has received somewhat less attention in the literature, social capital. Our model assumes that social capital provides a flow of services associated with a good reputation and social acceptance, and that <b>stigmatism</b> associated with arrest reduces an individual social capital stock. In this way we account for the influence of social norms on the decision to participate in crime. Our model is estimated using panel data from the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study. In estimation, we take account of unobserved choices, which potentially depend on individual specific heterogeneity, by using simulation techniques. Our results provide evidence of state dependence in the decision to participate in crime. Specifically, we find that the initial level of social capital stock is important in determining the pattern of criminal involvement in adulthood...|$|E

40|$|NoThis essay explores {{some of the}} social, political, and {{cultural}} meanings of 'eccentricity' in nineteenth-century England. It does this through examining the treatment of 'local characters' extensively recorded in North-East histories, newspapers, and ballads, and depicted in visual material in the period c. 1800 ¿ 1901. The first part examines the typology emerging from these media; and demonstrates how mental and physical abnormality, transgression of social mores, and odd beliefs, were classed as 'eccentric'. A study of representations of eccentricity, {{many of which were}} commercially available, forms the second part, supported by illustrations relating to popular figures such as William Purvis, or Blind Willy, of Newcastle. Eccentricities were identified across the region, in rural areas {{as well as in the}} 'public spaces' of Durham, Sunderland, and Newcastle. The final part relates this chronicling of odd characters to Victorian culture; the region's social history; and local patriotism across the period, but especially the late Victorian period, when the popularity of local history ensured a prominent place for eccentrics as emblematic of the quaint past in the North-East (and, it is indicated, elsewhere). Finally, the uses of eccentric characters are briefly discussed more broadly in terms of moralism and <b>stigmatism...</b>|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract There {{is a large}} body of preclinical research dem-onstrating the efficacy of gene and cellular therapy for the potential treatment of severe (limb-threatening) peripheral arterial disease (PAD), including evidence for growth and transcription factors, monocytes, and mesenchymal stem cells. While preclinical research has advanced into early phase clinical trials in patients, few late-phase clinical trials have been conducted. The reasons for the slow progression of these therapies from bench to bedside are as complicated as the fields of gene and cellular therapies. The variety of tissue sources of stem cells (embryonic, adult bone marrow, umbil-ical cord, placenta, adipose tissue, etc.); autologous versus allogeneic donation; types of cells (hematopoietic, mesenchy-mal stromal, progenitor, and mixed populations); confusion and <b>stigmatism</b> by the public and patients regarding gene, protein, and stem cell therapy; scaling of manufacturing; and the changing regulatory environment all contribute to the small number of late phase (Phase 3) clinical trials and the lack of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals.

Furthermore how the risks of being accused of child abuse and how it affects male employees and their work related decorums. The main focus of this assignment is to analyze the outcome of interviews through an introduction of the narrative method to interpret and deduct, whether or not the fear of phedophilia leads to <b>stigmatism</b> of male employees in Danish daycare institutions. Our theoretical approach is based on the results of the narrative analysis. This is conducted by our empirical research and interpretation of what we believe to be a culture of fear which is based on late modern society sociologist Frank Furedi’s theoretical material. To support our excogitation of this project we have also used late modern sociologist Giddens, Bauman and Goffman. This leads to a discussion about the disquisition for the fear of phedophilia. We conclude that the fear of phedophila in the late modern society is currently present and affects male employees in a negative way. However the terms of this fear’s correlation to negativity is somewhat doubtful, since we suggest a change in the late modern human conduct, which deviates from our original assumption of the culture of fear’s pespective on phedophilia...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Health {{effects and}} human rights {{dimensions}} of sexual violence against women, a public health {{and human rights}} problem, evaluated by the case of Bosnia War. METHODS: Bosnia War, United Nations resolutions, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) cases, activities of NGOs, approaches of WHO, Dayton Peace Agreement, current health programs were evaluated with the health effects and human rights dimensions of sexual violence against women. RESULTS: Sexual violence against women and systematic rapes were used as an &# 8220;ethnic cleaning&# 8221; tool and war weapon during Bosnia War, estimated 20. 000 - 60. 000 women and girls were raped systematically, captivated in rape camps, exposed to sexual violence. Medical care following the sexual violence against women and rape should include; Determination and teatment of injuries, forensic notice and documentation, preventive and curative services for Sexually Transmitted Diseases including HIV/AIDS, emergency contraceptive services, safe medical abortus, follow up of pregnancies, psychosocial support and services and training of health care professionals. Mental Health Reform became a priority health topic for Bosnia Herzegovina aftermath of the Bosnia War. Taking measures to prevent social <b>stigmatism</b> of the victims, economic support and implementation of rehabilitation programs, punishment of the perpetrators to repair social and community bonds are important.

40|$|Negative {{interpersonal}} behaviour at {{work has}} been researched as ‘bullying’ in Europe, and explored under wider headings in the USA (e. g. ‘counter-productive’, ‘antisocial’ or ‘deviant’). The first aim {{of this paper is}} progress the concept of bullying by identifying and validating the latent variables that constitute bullying. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling of two large UK data sets were used to test different construct models (from the literature) against each another. Four behaviour groupings were found to provide best fit i. e. personal attack, task attack, verbal attack as well as stigmatization (isolation). Testing disconfirmed the crude stereotype of bullying at work as being characterized by verbal abuse; instead, verbal attack was the least reported of the constructs. The literatures’ model suggesting the sequence of bullying attacks was also tested and support was found for the earlier stages of task attack being followed by personal attack. However, it was found that this was typically followed by <b>stigmatism</b> (isolation) which is in contrast to the verbal abuse stage suggested in the literature. The second aim was to interpret the constructs found in terms of actionable knowledge for the practitioner. For the practitioner, it revealed the need to stress the subtle forms of bullying rather than the stereotypical yelling and shouting in identifying bullying in the workplace. In addition, a case is made that anyone reporting bullying behaviours should be considered at risk whether or not they have self labelled themselves as bullied as this provides a window of opportunity for intervention before an individual is damaged by their experience of being bullied. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To explore {{barriers}} to early presentation and diagnosis {{with breast cancer}} among black women. Design: Systematic review. Methods: We searched multiple bibliographic databases (January 1991 –February 2013) for primary research, published in English, conducted in developed countries and investigating {{barriers to}} early presentation and diagnosis with symptomatic breast cancer among black women (≥ 18 years). Studies were excluded {{if they did not}} report separate findings by ethnic group or gender, only reported differences in time to presentation/diagnosis, or reported on interventions and barriers to cancer screening. We followed Cochrane and PRISMA guidance to identify relevant research. Findings were integrated through thematic synthesis. Designs of quantitative studies made meta-analysis impossible. Results: We identified 18 studies (6183 participants). Delay was multifactorial, individual and complex. Factors contributing to delay included: poor symptom and risk factor knowledge; fear of detecting breast abnormality; fear of cancer treatments; fear of partner abandonment; embarrassment disclosing symptoms to healthcare professionals; taboo and <b>stigmatism.</b> Presentation appears quicker following disclosure. Influence of fatalism and religiosity on delay is unclear from evidence in these studies. We compared older studies (≥ 10 years) with newer ones (< 10 years) to determine changes over time. In older studies, delaying factors included: inaccessibility of healthcare services; competing priorities and concerns about partner abandonment. Partner abandonment was studied in older studies but not in newer ones. Comparisons of healthy women and cancer populations revealed differences between how people perceive they would behave, and actually behave, on finding breast abnormality. Conclusions: Strategies to improve early presentation and diagnosis with breast cancer among black women need to address symptom recognition and interpretation of risk, as well as fears of the consequences of cancer. The review is limited by the paucity of studies conducted outside the USA and limited detail reported by published studies preventing comparison between ethnic groups...|$|E
40|$|Infrastructure such as {{transportation}} networks {{improves the}} condition of everyday lives by facilitating public services and systems necessary for economic activity and growth. However, constructing and maintaining transportation infrastructure poses safety hazards and risks to those working at the sharp end, leading to serious injuries and fatalities. Therefore, the identification of hazards and managing the risks they create is integral towards continually improving safety levels in Infrastructure Management. This work seeks to fully understand this problem and highlight past, present and future issues concerning safety in a comprehensive literature review. A decision support tool is proposed to improve the safety of transportation workers by facilitating hazard identification and management of associated control measures. This Tool facilitates the extraction of safety knowledge from real paper-based safety documents, capturing existing worker’s knowledge and experiences from industrial ‘corporate memory’. The Tool suggests the most appropriate control measures for new scenarios based on existing knowledge from previous work tasks. This is achieved by classifying work tasks using a new method based on unilateral UK legislation (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences (1995) Regulations) and the innovative use of Artificial Intelligence method Case Based Reasoning. Case Based Reasoning (CBR) allows transparency in the Tool processes and has many benefits over other safety tools which may suffer from ‘black box’ <b>stigmatism.</b> The Tool is populated with knowledge extracted from a real transportation project and is hosted via the internet (www. Total-Safety. com). The end product of the Tool is the generation of bespoke method statements detailing appropriate control measures.

40|$|Aims: Resource {{allocation}} amongst competing {{health care}} interventions {{is informed by}} evidence of both clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Cost-utility analysis is increasingly used to assess cost effectiveness {{through the use of}} Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). This requires health state values. Generic measures of health related quality of life (HRQL) are usually used to produce these values, but there are concerns about their relevance and sensitivity in epilepsy. This study develops a health state classification system for epilepsy from the NEWQOL battery, a validated questionnaire measuring QoL in epilepsy. The classification system will be amenable to valuation for calculating QALYs. Methods: Factor and other psychometric analyses were undertaken to investigate the factor structure of the battery, and assess the validity and responsiveness of the items. These analyses were used alongside Rasch analysis to select the dimensions included in the classification system, and the items used to represent each domain. Analysis was carried out on a trial dataset of patients with epilepsy (n= 1611). Rasch and factor analysis were performed on one half of the sample and validated on the remaining half. Dimensions and items were selected that performed well across all analyses. Results: The battery was found to demonstrate reliability and validity but responsiveness across time periods for many of the items was low. A six dimension classification system was developed: worry about seizures, depression, memory, cognition, <b>stigmatism</b> and control, each with four response levels. Conclusions: It is feasible to develop a health state classification system from a battery of instruments using a combination of classical psychometric, factor and Rasch analysis. This is the first condition-specific health state classification developed for epilepsy and the next stage will produce preference weights to enable the measure to be used in cost-utility analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|This design {{research}} project proposes {{a new and}} improved touch screen graphical user interface (GUI) for Gallagher’s on farm animal management product - the “TSi”. The re-design concept aims to develop appropriate design aesthetic treatments, {{as a foundation for}} a more attractive, intuitive, easy to use graphical user interface. The intention is to encourage farmers and farm workers to readily engage and exploit the full performance capability of the TSi and to reduce the perceived <b>stigmatism</b> of learning specialist software that requires adopting to new technologies. The design research propose that a GUI enhances the end user experience to create a more desirable and usable product by introducing User Interface (UI) elements and utilising common user scenarios. The research has incorporated end user feedback and co-creative development process with the Gallagher product development and marketing team. The TSi is a revolutionary weigh scale device that allows users to instantly record and access data on individual animals and groups of animals. This allows farmer’s to critically assess livestock performance and enable strategic farm management decisions - in the office, in the yard or elsewhere on the farm. The redesign begins with a thorough critical analysis of the TSi’s existing GUI, identifying issues involved with information and visual hierarchy of elements such as navigation, buttons, text and graphical icons. The methods and processes used include user observation, rapid prototyping and mind-mapping user journeys through a series of workshops done at Gallagher headquarters (Hamilton) and Massey University (Wellington).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 48). The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the association between marital status and self-rated health (SRH) of adults in the United States using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007 - 2008. The relationship can be understood through the marital resource model, which states that those who are married gain benefits that never-married, widowed and divorced do not, such as social, economic, and psychological resources that promote health and extend longevity, leading to greater SRH ratings. Since social norms have shifted over the years, where alternatives to marriage have increased and <b>stigmatism</b> towards divorced and never-married have decreased, it was of interest to assess whether marital status still has a dominant influence on SRH. Moreover, this study found it of value to explore other variables that are known to affect SRH (such as gender, age, race, education, employment status, insurance status, BMI, smoker status, and household food insecurity) to determine which factors impact SRH the most. It was hypothesized that marital status will influence SRH, that those who are married would have higher SRH than those who are divorced, widowed and separated, and that the never-married would have similar SRH as married persons. Through multinomial logistic regression, the hypotheses were supported, however, marital status was found to have a minimal effect on SRH compared to other variables in the model. Age, employment status, educational achievements, smoking status, and body mass index had the greatest influences on SRH. In particular, those who were in their forties, fifties, and sixties years of age, who were retired or unemployed, who have less than a college graduate degree, and who were overweight, obese, current smokers and past smokers are found to have the worst SRH ratings compared to their counterparts. It is imperative for public health professionals to focus their attention on these sub-populations to improve the SRH in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} complex {{inflammatory}} disorder of the skin. It affects on average 2 % of the UK population, but can vary in other populations. The disease is characterised by hyperproliteration and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, and infiltration of immune cells into the skin, including activated CD 4 + T-cells in the epidermis and activated CD 8 + T-cells in the dermis. This disorder is seen clinically as well-demarcated thickened, erythematous, areas of skin covered by a silvery scale predominantly on extensor surfaces. The disease can have serious implications on the social and mental wellbeing of a patient and recent studies have demonstrated serious social <b>stigmatism</b> attached with the disease. Previous studies have implied complex genetic factors {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of psoriasis along with environment triggers. In attempt to identify novel psoriasis loci and confirm previously reported loci a genome wide scan was performed in a cohort of 158 psoriasis families. Genome wide levels of significance were observed for microsatellite markers on chromosome 6 p, spanning the MHC, and a novel locus on chromosome lp. Three further regions provided evidence of linkage on chromosomes 7 p, 18 p and 19 p. All of which had been observed in previous studies of psoriasis or immune related diseases. In parallel to the genome wide scan, a collaboration of a larger collection of families was used to assess fourteen previously reported loci. Only microsatellites within the MHC on chromosome 6 provided highly significant evidence for linkage to psoriasis, confirming that this locus is the major psoriasis susceptibility locus. Support was seen for two other loci on chromosome 16 q and 17 q. As the PSORS 1 locus within the MHC is the major susceptibility locus identified for psoriasis it was subject to in depth investigation. Candidate genes HCR and CDSN were assessed for association with psoriasis and compared to the HLA-Cw 6 allele. Significant association was observed at both genes, however their relationship could not be distinguished from the association observed at HLA-Cw 6. Further dissection of PSORS 1 was attempted through the genotyping of 59 SNPs across the interval. Analysis revealed the entire interval to demonstrate significant association with psoriasis, though a distinct peak of association centromeric of HLA-C was observed. Haplotype analysis revealed a single set of similar haplotypes {{to be associated with the}} disease. This also identified a putative recombinant psoriasis associated haplotype raising the possibility of further refinement of the PSORS 1 interval...|$|E
40|$|The 1. 2 million refugees, the poverty, the {{degradation}} {{in the refugee}} dwellings of Athens and Piraeus, the unemployment and the oppressive working hours, the use of psychotropic substances, the forced prostitution, the corruption and the black economy in a state which - even then - was seeking to modernise itself, the violence in interpersonal relations and relations {{between the state and}} its citizens: all these show that the interwar period in Greece is not a story of a bygone age for the criminology researcher but an opportunity {{to understand the nature of}} crime today through tracing its roots in the recent past. An important aid to gaining this understanding is the ‘living’ musical culture of the poor working classes: the so-called ‘rebetiko’ song. The study of the interaction between popular culture and social control constitutes a contemporary trend in criminological thought, one which seeks to gain an understanding of the criminal phenomenon through the cultural creations of a (sub) culture. The aims of this thesis are therefore: a) to decode, through ‘crime analysis’, the messages conveyed by the ‘crime songs’ of the ‘manges’ circle’; b) to note the official and unofficial social reactions to ‘rebetiko’ song, as recorded in written sources from the interwar period, in order to show the <b>stigmatism</b> as well as the popularity of popular song; c) to ascertain whether ‘rebetiko’ song ‘authentically’ portrays the criminal reality of the interwar period; d) to investigate the relationship between the ‘rebetiko’ musicians, their public and the criminal ‘underworld’ and to determine the factors that engendered crime in interwar Greece. The study of the factual material confirmed the working hypothesis that the integration of poor working classes, particularly refugees, into a nascent urban environment characterised by poverty, severe economic and political problems, lawlessness and a readiness to turn to crime, is also undermined by the deontological model of a violent machismo. This model lies at the heart of the system of communal values - a system for facilitating coexistence and the settlement of differences - which at this time characterised the working classes, who resisted the transition to the institutionalised expression of sovereign violence displayed by the modern bourgeois rule-of-law state. The cultural conflict was exacerbated by the social control of victimless crimes: a) vagrancy (a peculiar kind of lifestyle owing to its unique conditions); b) the use of psychotropic drugs, a means of alleviating the mental pain and personal alienation caused by a distressing and hostile social environment; c) prostitution, a means of survival for poor and socially excluded women...|$|E
40|$|Criminal {{behavior}} of young people, or asocial, antisocioal, i. e. socially unacceptable behavior, represents disorder {{of the behavior}} that directly violates certain moral and legal norms qof society, and as such implies the commission of the criminal acts (against property, life, body, etc.), violations (of traffic, public order and peace, etc.) and immoral actions and procedures (aggressive behaviours, fleeing from school, running away from home, etc.). Experts of various scientific fields {{try to find the}} answer why some children and young people, exposed to risky behaviour, do not adopt risky behaviour alike others who are in the same or similar circumstances. Offensive behaviour of young people and adults is necessary to considered starting of different aspects of personal features of personality, cultural context, social – economic system, education, <b>stigmatism</b> and other factors. During the adolescence, young people often experiment with different behaviours, and perceptions of young people by others may aggravate their successful integration into society. The work will help us visualize the most important theoretical implications concerning the offending behaviour of young people, as part of the empirical research in the town of Prizren on the basic characteristics and the degree of representation of youth offending behaviour. This paper presents an analysis of reported crimes in the Police Station in Prizren, committed by young people in the period 2003. - 2012., as well as observations of teachers in primary and secondary school, educators of the facilities for re-education of minors, on risky behaviour of children and young people, problematic areas and activites in the field of primary prevention and cooperation with parents. Also, in the research is used interrogation techniques structured interview and questionnaire, which was used in 591 respondents, pupils of primary and secondary schools, students of the University of Prizren and minors who are placed in a Center for social work. In this research is used stigmatization questionnaire, Offer and Coopersmith self-esteern questionnaire, social-demography questionnaire as well as constructed questionnaire fot the opinion of students on delinquent behaviour of youth in Prizren. The data were processed by SPSS. The research results point to a multitude of problems in the field of education that is necessary to research and undertake wider social action to address them. Also,criminal behaviour of young people is quite pronounced in the structure of reported crimes in Prizren, even respondents suggested some forms of criminal offenses that are not represented in the larger scale structure of reported and registered crimes. Therefore, it implies representation of dark figures of the minor delinquency. Society does not undertake all necessary measures in order to prevent offending behaviour of young people, regardless that parents, students, teachers and others are aware of the growing problem of youth delinquency...|$|E
40|$|Aims This {{research}} project aims {{to explore a}} variety of qualified early years’ practitioner’s from a selection of state and privately run early years’ establishments. It will critically investigate early years’ practitioner’s experiences and expectations when caring for and supporting children experiencing the adoption process. The practitioner’s role is specified in early years’ settings, and critically analyses whether practitioners receive substantial training in supporting children experiencing insecure attachments (Nutbrown, 2012). The research focuses on the experiences of adopted/looked-after children and identifies various psychological and behavioural outcomes that became evident through the literature review. The theoretical foundations for this research sit in the attachment theory (Bowlby, 1977), which {{is used as a}} basis for understanding children who have experienced broken relationships and are expressing concerning behaviour attributes. Attachment theory is used here to show an awareness through the review of literature; of the connection between broken relationships, the adoption process and the child’s behaviour and development (Smith et al, 2000). One of the predominant aims of this research was to investigate the training that practitioners have partaken, concentrating on whether the participants became educated in the attachment theory before they became child care practitioners or whether an additional on-site attachment theory training was endured. It explores whether state or privately run early years’ establishments held the higher level of support for children experiencing insecure attachments. The aim of this part of the research is to display an absence of knowledge and understanding of the attachment theory in early years’ settings (Nutrown, 2012). Methodology This qualitative research was carried out using the semi-structured interviewing method. This method was specifically chosen to gain more understanding of the experiences the participants share during the interview. By observing body languages (Thomas, 2013), sensing emotion and possessing eye contact allowed a rapport to build between the researcher and participant. Choosing this method has allowed reflexivity to materialise throughout the {{research project}} (Thomas, 2013), this gives a meaning and assists a ‘story telling’ style to present the motivation towards why this research is being carried out (Webb-Mitchell, 1995). Discussionssurrounding ethical issues and problems that could influence the reliability of the research become evident. It is ensured objectivity is maintained throughout this project as the topic is a personal matter. Conclusions It is hoped that the findings of this research project will inform early years’ practitioners in the importance of the attachment theory in connection with the adoption process. This research has drawn attention and focus to a gap in child care qualifications level two and three (Nutbrown, 2012). The research project concludes that an unexpected and ‘unprofessional’ level of <b>stigmatism</b> is evident in early years’ settings. Perhaps further uses for the findings in this research may show awareness and inform future collaborative personnel for future improvements when taking the care and support for children experiencing the adoption process into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Henry Buchwald {{was born}} in Vienna, Austria. His family, fleeing from the Holocaust, came to the United States in 1938. He {{grew up in the}} boroughs of Long Island, Brooklyn and later in Manhattan in New York City. He {{graduated}} from the Bronx High School of Science in 1950 and attended Columbia College. After three years as an undergraduate, he pursued the professional option, moving on to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the medical school of Columbia University. He completed medical school in 1957 and took an internship at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital from 1957 - 1958. After completing his internship, Dr. Buchwald completed his military obligations as part of the Berry Plan in the Air Force as a flight surgeon from 1958 to 1960. Because of its reputation for a strong academic surgical program, Dr. Buchwald began his residency at the University of Minnesota on September 11, 1960. He concurrently completed his Master’s in Biochemistry under Dr. Ivan Frantz and became a professor in 1966. Dr. Buchwald’s career has included research into the partial illeal bypass for the alleviation of chronically high cholesterol as part of the widely praised POSCH trials; the creation of the first implantable infusion pump, Infusaid, for the treatment of diabetes; and most recently the jejunoileal bypass for the treatment of obesity. He continues to be a professor of surgery and bioengineering at the University and is an Emeritus Professor of the Owen H. and Sarah Davidson Wangensteen Chair in Experimental Surgery. Dr. Henry Buchwald begins his interview talking about his early life: fleeing Austria {{in the midst of the}} Holocaust, growing up in New York, and his baccalaureate and medical education at Columbia. He discusses how he arrived at an interest in medicine, his time in the Air Force, and his reasons for choosing to pursue a residency at the University of Minnesota. As part of his time at Minnesota, Dr. Buchwald compares the University’s research program with those of other medical schools, relates the profound influence of Owen Wangensteen on the Surgery Department, and discusses his early lab work and his studies of biochemistry, particularly lipids, with Ivan Frantz. In reviewing his changing research interests, Dr. Buchwald cites major diseases afflicting society at various times during his career: the increasing association of cholesterol with heart disease prompted his early interest in lipid uptake and spurred his work on the Program on Surgical Control of Hyperlipidemias (POSCH); the need for treatments for diabetes prompted his research into Infusaid, the first implantable infusion pump, a collaborative effort that led to the development of several other devices and eventually the establishment of a bioengineering program at the University; and finally, the ongoing obesity epidemic spurred Dr. Buchwald’s current research into the jejunoileal bypass for the treatment of obesity. In his reflections on obesity research, Dr. Buchwald discusses the high level of <b>stigmatism</b> associated with the disease and the difficulty of funding research into its treatment...|$|E
40|$|Magister Psychologiae - MPsychThis qualitative, {{exploratory}} study comprises a discourse {{analysis of the}} emotional experiences of {{the parent of a}} transgendered child. The primary aim {{of the study was to}} detail the emotional experiences encountered by the parents of a transgendered child within the South African context, with a focus on how discourse is used to make sense of experiences. The research employed a single case-study, and data was collected via three semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed within a social constructionist framework, using discourse analysis (as per ten stages suggested by Potter and Wetherell, 1987). The literature review highlights various issues regarding the plight of transgendered children and their loved ones in trans-phobic societies, most of which are reflected in the findings. The pertinent themes were divided into four sections: “Discourse of Shaping”, “Discourse of Incongruous Loss”, “Discourse of Motherhood” and “The Transformer and Transformation”. In “Discourse of ‘Shaping’”, the focus is on the parent’s ‘compelled’ reconceptualization of issues and previously accepted ‘truths’ that lie at the core of identity, namely, gender and religion. “Discourse of Incongruous Loss” shows the trauma, challenges, complexity and many ambiguities in mourning someone who is simultaneously absent and present, the same yet different. It also explores additional aspects of the loss that distinguishes it from conventional loss, such as <b>stigmatism</b> and discrimination, lack of support, and ensuing losses. Data reveal that the discourse of motherhood, whilst placing immense pressure on the parent, also has an empowering effect. Although the discourse of motherhood gives rise to feelings of intense self-blame and hate regarding the trans-identity of the child, and ‘dictates’ unwavering compassion, selflessness, acceptance and nurturance, it also enables a basis for resisting oppression. The final section documents how a personal, painful, private experience is linked to broader social systems. It shows how an initially harrowing experience can become empowering, as the participant not only embraces previously unaccepted ‘truths’, but is also an advocate of transgenderism and contributes to social change. It is important to note though, that although ‘victorious’, the experience is a complex one and meaning-making is on-going. Throughout, the interplay of dominant discourses and alternate discourses and their role in the personal meaning-making experience of the participant, is documented. Various creative strategies are employed in order to enable acceptance of the trans-identity and the continuous meaning-making, such as, for example, vacillating between seemingly contradictory discourses. Based on the findings that emphasises the trauma caused by a dual-definition if gender, it is suggested that a more inclusive definition of gender be adopted, such as defining gender as a spectrum or on a continuum. A redefinition of gender should also include de-pathologising gender variance, but before it is removed as diagnosis from the DSM, resources and assistance enabled by its diagnosis should be readily available so as not to create further obstacles for an already marginalised group. Awareness is vital if stigmatising and discrimination are to be reduced. It is important that awareness be generated and resources be made available, with a special focus to include disadvantaged communities. There is an urgent need for literature within a South African context so that interventions can be designed to assist parents (and loved ones) of transgendered children. This is particularly important since support from parents have consistently been found to reduce both depression and suicide rates of transgendered children. Within a diverse South African context, it is also essential to determine how gender discrimination intersects with various other forms of discrimination pertaining aspects of identity such as religion, spirituality, ethnicity, race and culture. There is a need for the South African government to address the lack with regards to implementation of gender policy with some urgency...|$|E
40|$|Die Dissertation „Spielend lernen?“ beschäftigt sich mit einer methodisch-didaktischen Vergleichsstudie zu den Unterrichtsmethoden Lernspiel und fragend-entwickelndem Unterricht im Hinblick auf die Parameter Lernerfolg, Motivation und veränderte Spieleinstellungen durch die Schullaufbahn. Ziel der Studie war es, die Einsatzmöglichkeiten und die Effizienz des Unterrichtskonzepts Lernspiel, stellvertretend für eine Vielzahl alternativer Unterrichtsmethoden, mit dem altbewährten fragend-entwickelnden Unterricht zu vergleichen. An der Studie nahmen 382 Gymnasialschüler/innen der Jahrgangsstufen sechs, acht, elf und dreizehn in den Unterrichtsfächern Biologie, Pädagogik und Deutsch teil. Beide Methodenkonzepte wurden aufbereitet und in Unterrichtseinheiten der Sekundarstufen auf ihre jeweiligen Effekte hin verglichen. Mittels Kontrollgruppendesign, Leistungstests und eines Schülerfragebogens wurden die Ergebnisse zum Einfluss von Lernspielen auf die Konstrukte gewonnen. Ausgehend vom aktuellen Forschungsstand vereint das Lernspiel überdurchschnittlich viele lern-, sozial- und motivationsfördernde Elemente, was sich in einer Effektsteigerung in den Konstruktbereichen auswirken könnte. Entgegen der Erwartungen schnitten Lernspiel und fragend-entwickelnder Unterricht im Hinblick auf den Lernerfolg gleich stark ab. Auf motivationaler Ebene setzte sich das Lernspiel hingegen deutlich ab. Sozialisationsbedingte Zuschreibungsprozesse beeinflussten die Einschätzungen der Schüler/innen im Hinblick auf einem effektiven Lernspieleinsatz durch die Schullaufbahn. Zusätzlich zeigte sich ein hoher Grad an Lernpassivität auf Seiten der Schüler/innen, eine Stigmatisierung des Lernens und des Spielens, erlernte Hilflosigkeit gegenüber unbekannten Unterrichtsmethoden und der deutliche Wunsch nach einer Lehrerpersönlichkeit mit methodischem Rückgrat. Diese Aspekte wurden in der vorliegenden Arbeit vertiefend diskutiert. Motivated by {{the current}} debate on {{education}} as well as {{against the background of}} requirements for a reformation of the German educational system a methodical comparative study was realised at a secondary school in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). The study included 382 pupils at the age of ten to twenty. The aim was to compare the effect on learning archievement and motivation and to explore general opportunities of a modern educational concept, the educational game, as a representative for a multiplicity of alternative teaching concepts with traditional ex-cathedra teaching concepts. Both educational concepts were developed for and tested in a sixth, eighth, eleventh and thirteenth form at a grammar school. Empirical results concerning the influence of educational design on learning achievement and motivation as well as gaming attitude through school career were based on control-group design, performance tests, student-questionnaires and teachers monitoring. Based on the current research status, the modern educational game combines superior elements of (social) learning and motivational advancement. These aspects are supposed to {{have a positive effect on}} the constructs of the present empirical study. Despite all expectations, the pupils learning through educational games showed no significantly better school performance in any categories than the pupils of the control-group, taught by ex-cathedra teaching concept. There was only one exception: The pupils using the educational games were more motivated to learn intensively than the control-group. Another aspect was also interesting to recognize: Over the years the general attitude towards gaming changed as expected, whereas educational games were rated to be advantageous rather for younger children than for older ones. Through their school career, pupils are accustomed to remain passive in most lessons, because the teachers take the active part. Pupils often show obedience related to teaching methods their teachers prefer - which is in most cases the traditional ex-cathedra way. During thirteen years of school, pupils reveal a sort of acquired helplessness towards modern teaching methods. New teaching methods such as educational games are connected with fun which does not fit with the pupils` experiences with learning. Pupils tend to stigmatize the learning process during school days based on plenty of negative experiences. This <b>stigmatism</b> is not the only critical aspect the empirical study revealed: Pupils show a clear wish for teacher personalities who stand behind the methodical teaching concepts they use. Teachers with methodical willingness are required to have courage to break new grounds through trying out new didactical teaching methods with no regrets but the capability of critical reflection...|$|E
