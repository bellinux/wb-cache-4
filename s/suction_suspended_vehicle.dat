40|$|Rationale: For {{patients}} who cannot {{or will not}} take medications in tablet form, a liquid formulation of clozapine is required; however, no commercial oral liquid or suspension exists. Objective: To evaluate the stability of a 20 mg/mL clozapine suspension in 6 different suspending vehicles: Ora-Sweet, Ora-Plus, a 1 : 1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus, the <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicle</b> used by the Hospital for Sick Children, simple syrup, and a noncommercial vehicle known as Guy’s pediatric mixture. Methods: A reverse-phase, stability-indicating liquid chromato-graphic method with ultraviolet detection at 230 nm was validated before the study. Validation demonstrated that clozapine could be quantified accurately and reproducibly. On study day 0, 100 mL of a 20 mg/mL clozapine suspension was prepared {{in each of the}} 6 <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Each suspension was separated into 3 equal aliquots, which were stored in 60 -mL amber plastic containers. All suspensions were stored at room temperature (23 °C) without protection from light. On study days 0, 3, 6, 14, 28, and 63, the concentration of clozapine was determined by liquid chromatography, and physical inspection was performed. Results: During the study period, all study samples retained more than 95. 0 % of their initial concentration. Inspection of chromatograms obtained during the stability study failed to reveal any of the degradation products that had been generated during the assay validation. Conclusion: Suspensions of clozapine (20 mg/mL) prepared in the 6 <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicles</b> used in this study and stored in amber plastic containers at 23 °C retained more than 95 % of their initial concentration during 63 days of storage, regardless of the <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Key words: drug stability, clozapine, suspensions, commercial suspending agent...|$|R

A forestry vehicle was fitted with the prototype suspension at its rear axle to assess its ride performance benefits. Field measurements of ride vibration along the vertical, lateral, fore-aft, roll and pitch axes were performed for the suspended and an unsuspended vehicle, while traversing a forestry terrain. The measured vibration responses of both vehicles were evaluated {{in terms of}} unweighted and frequency-weighted rms accelerations and the acceleration spectra, and compared to assess the potential performance benefits of the proposed suspension. The results revealed that the proposed suspension could yield significant reductions in the vibration magnitudes transmitted to the operator's station.

40|$|Compared to the {{vehicles}} with conventional steering, the articulated frame steer vehicles (ASV) {{are known to}} exhibit lower directional and roll stability limits. Furthermore, the tire interactions with relatively rough terrains could adversely affect the directional and roll stability limits of an ASV due to terrain-induced variations in the vertical and lateral tire forces. It may thus be desirable to assess the dynamic safety of ASVs {{in terms of their}} directional control and stability limits while operating on different terrains. The effects of terrain roughness on the directional stability limits of an ASV are investigated through simulations of a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the vehicle with and without a rear axle suspension. The model incorporates a torsio-elastic rear axle suspension, a kineto-dynamic model of the frame steering struts and equivalent random profiles of different undeformable terrains together with coherence between the two tracks profiles. The simulations are performed to determine the stability limits of the ASV models while operating on different terrains, namely: a perfectly smooth surface, plowed field, pasture, gravel road, and the MVEE random course. The directional stability limits are defined in terms of the static and dynamic rollover thresholds, rearward amplification ratio, and critical speed corresponding to snaking instability under steady and transient steering inputs. The results suggest that the tire interactions with the rough terrains affect the stability limits of both the unsuspended and <b>suspended</b> <b>vehicles</b> in a highly adverse manner.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{medicines}} {{are available}} only as solid, adult-strength dosage forms from which oral extemporaneous liquids are often prepared for children. There are few comprehensive reference lists for {{the preparation of}} pediatric extemporaneous formulations. Some pediatric reformulations are made by diluting the <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and a shelf life of up to 3 months can be used without documented microbial stability. Although most commercially available ready-to-use vehicles are supplied as preserved formulations, it is still common practice in many European dispensaries to prepare and dilute these vehicles as required for specific prescriptions. OBJECTIVE: To determine what influence dilution of vehicles has on the preservation efficiency of extenporaneous formulations. METHODS: <b>Suspending</b> <b>vehicles</b> were made by diluting methylcellulose 1 % and simple syrup, BP (British Pharmacopoeia) in ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 4. The efficacy of antimicrobial preservation was tested according to the 2007 standards required by the BP. RESULTS: Dilution in ratios greater than 1 : 1 failed the BP 2007 criteria. Such dilution represents a potential biohazard, especially to premature, newborn, or immunocompromised children, exposing them not only to possible organoleptic changes of the preparation, but also to ingestion of either dangerous numbers of microorganisms or medicines that may have undergone biotransformation, rendering them inactive or toxic. CONCLUSIONS: Significant concerns have been raised regarding the quality of extemporaneous preparations. We call for further research in this neglected area to address issues of antimicrobial preservation, including revision of existing quality assurance monographs. Moreover, these monographs should take into account testing that simulates multiple dosing from a single storage container during the intended in-use shelf life of multidose extemporaneous preparations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Three vehicles and three storage temperatures were evaluated to define a suitable cryoprotective medium for the preservation of Mycobacterium bovis strains. Colonies of sixteen M. bovis isolates were used to prepare the suspensions, which were then added to three vehicles: sterile 0. 85 % saline solution (SS), Middlebrook 7 H 9 broth (7 H 9), and Middlebrook 7 H 9 broth with sodium pyruvate (7 H 9 p) replacing glycerol. Aliquots of these suspensions were frozen by three different methods, directly in the - 20 °C freezer, directly in the - 80 °C freezer, and at - 196 °C by immersion in liquid nitrogen (LN). The frozen aliquots were thawed at room temperature after 45, 90 and 120 days. Mycobacterial viability was assessed by counting the living cells on plates of Stonebrink medium before and after the freezing procedure. Storage at - 20 °C exhibited a lower recovery of M. bovis compared to storage at - 80 °C (Dunn’s test, p= 0. 0018) and LN (Dunn’s test, p= 0. 0352).

The formulation parameters that contributed to this rheological behavior were systematically evaluated {{with the aim of}} removing this flow limitation while maintaining the concentration of 60 % levodopa to retain the clinical applicability. The three suspension parameters examined were: levodopa volume fraction, concentration of the HPMC <b>suspending</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and particle size distribution. Shear thickening increased with the drug concentration and the critical shear rate was inversely dependent on the drug concentration. Increasing the vehicle concentration retarded the shear thickening but increased the overall suspension viscosity. There was an increase in shear thickening with increased average particle diameter. Combinations of micronised and non-micronised particles were used to prepare bimodal particle size distributions. The rheology of these bimodal distributions resulted in removal of shear thickening. This allowed the preparation of 60 % levodopa formulations that showed a range of flow characteristics spanning near Newtonian flow or shear thinning at initial injectable viscosities of about 0. 6 Pa. s and final viscosities in the range of 0. 1 Pa. s, alleviating the shear thickening limitation of these levodopa formulations...|$|R

At present, tyre-road contact force measurement systems are very expensive and modify the non <b>suspended</b> <b>vehicle</b> inertia due to their high mass and rotational inertia moment. Thus, vehicle dynamics is significantly affected.

Validation tests were carried out with a vehicle having all four wheels equipped with the low-cost tyre-road contact force measurement system.

Pareto optimality alone is not always adequate for selecting a final solution because the Pareto optimal set can be very large. The k-optimality approach and the more general k-ε-optimality method, can be used to rank the Pareto-optimal solutions. The two methods have been included into a genetic algorithm selection procedure. The k-optimality method searches for points which remain Pareto-optimal when all of the subsets of n-k objectives (n is the number of objective functions) are optimised. The k-ε approach considers not only if an objective is worse than the others but also the entity of this variation through the introduction of a vector of indifference thresholds. The KEMOGA has been applied for the solution of two engineering problems.

The thesis consists of twelve papers which present work on two distinct but related topics concerning high performance control systems: firstly the design of controllers for electromagnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and secondly methods for efficient design of digital controllers for this and other applications. The first topic is covered by seven papers which range from consideration of the underlying theory through to the specific design of the suspension control system for British Rail's experimental vehicle, also applied to the world's first commercial Maglev system at Birmingham Airport. Not only are the control engineering considerations described, but also the dynamic requirements of providing an adequate ride quality using the electro-magnets alone are addressed in some detail. The remaining five papers consider the problems of translating compensator transfer functions such as phase advances, lagleads, "notch"filters etc. for implementation on microprocessor systems.

A prototype suspension was realised and integrated within the rear axle of a forestry skidder for field evaluations. Field measurements were performed on forestry terrains at a constant forward speed of 5 km/h under the loaded and unloaded conditions, and the ride responses were acquired in terms of accelerations along the vertical, lateral, roll, longitudinal and pitch axes. The measurements were also performed on a conventional skidder to investigate the relative ride performance potentials of the proposed suspension.
