50|$|From {{the end of}} the Middle Ages {{until the}} 20th century, Europe's farmers practised three-field rotation, {{dividing}} available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow. The three fields were rotated in this manner so that every three years, a field would rest and be fallow. Under the two-field system, if one has a total of 600 acre of fertile land, one would only plant 300 acres. Under the new three-field rotation system, one would plant (and therefore harvest) 400 acres. But the additional crops had a more significant effect than mere quantitative productivity. Since the spring crops were mostly legumes, they increased the overall nutrition of the people of Northern Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Barley showed significant separability from spring wheat, both multitemporally {{and on a}} single date chosen near the turning time for barley. Oats showed occasional multitemporal separability from barley and spring wheat; however, {{the cause of this}} separability was not well understood. Oats showed no significant separability from spring wheat on any single date during the growing season. By pooling data from segments having an acquisition near the turning time for barley, a fixed unitemporal projection for aiding in the labeling of barley versus <b>spring</b> wheat and <b>oats</b> was constructed. This projection has about the same separability of barley from <b>spring</b> wheat and <b>oats</b> as the unitemporal greeness versus brightness plot. The new fixed projection has the advantage that barley occurs consistently in the same general location on the plot with respect to <b>spring</b> wheat and <b>oats.</b> Attempts to construct a fixed multitemporal or a segment-dependent multitemporal projection for aiding in the labeling of spring wheat versus other small grains were unsuccessful due to segment availability and the fact that each segment has a unique acquisition history...|$|R

Frequent mowing or unmanaged aisles are not a practical option. To explore vineyard floor management options for vine vigor and weed management while maintaining soil cover, vine balance, and fruit quality in the eastern USA, seven cover crop treatments: 1) grower control mown tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.), 2) chemically mown tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), 3) little barley (Hordeum pusillum Nutt.), 4) downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), 5) oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), 6) <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena sativa L.), 7) chemically mown sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench sp.) were established for the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in a commercial Cabernet franc vineyard, planted in 2000, in southern Illinois, on an Menfro silt loam soil. In fall 2011, oilseed radish reduced the fresh weight of grapevine shoots removed with summer hedging 46 % compared to the grower control. In 2012, <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> increased the weight of grapevine shoots removed with summer hedging 160 % compared to the grower control.

Cover crop did not affect Ravaz index in 2011 or 2012. Chemically mown sorghum-sudangrass reduced total soluble solids in grape must 7 % compared to the grower control in 2012. Downy brome produced the most ground cover and greatest weed control at bloom time in 2011 and 2012, and harvest time in 2011. In 2012, oilseed radish at veraison and harvest time produced 97 % and 177 %, respectively, more ground cover than grower control. The persistent mulch produced by little barley and downy brome followed by burndown herbicide, Rely ® (glufosinate 1 lb ai/gal) 76 fl oz/acre in August reduced their average weed cover by a range of 99 % to 89 % compared to all other treatments except grower control at harvest 2012. Downy brome established in vineyard aisles had the greatest potential for maintaining weed control at bloom and harvest time, while increasing yield without decreasing vine size.

Responses may vary between species and varieties. Climate change {{will affect the}} timing of cereal crop development, but exact changes will also depend on changes in varieties as affected by plant breeding and variety choices. This study aimed to assess changes in timing of major phenological stages of cereal crops in Northern and Central Europe under climate change. Records on dates of sowing, flowering, and maturity of wheat, oats and maize were collected from field experiments conducted during the period 1985 – 2009. Data for spring wheat and <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> covered latitudes from 46 to 64 °N, winter wheat from 46 to 61 °N, and maize from 47 to 58 °N. The number of observations (site–year–variety combinations) varied with phenological phase, but exceeded 2190, 227, 2076 and 1506 for winter wheat, spring wheat, <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> and maize, respectively. The data were used to fit simple crop development models, assuming that {{the duration of the}} period until flowering depends on temperature and day length for wheat and oats, and on temperature for maize, and that the duration of the period from flowering to maturity in all species depends on temperature only. Species-specific base temperatures were used. Sowing date of spring cereals was estimated using a threshold temperature for the mean air temperature during 10 days prior to sowing. The mean estimated temperature thresholds for sowing were 6. 1, 7. 1 and 10. 1 °C for oats, wheat and maize, respectively. For <b>spring</b> <b>oats</b> and wheat the temperature threshold increased with latitude. The effective temperature sums required for both flowering and maturity increased with increasing mean annual temperature of the location, indicating that varieties are well adapted to given conditions. The responses of wheat and oats were largest for the period from flowering to maturity. Changes in timing of cereal phenology by 2040 were assessed for two climate model projections according to the observed dependencies on temperature and day length. The results showed advancements of sowing date of spring cereals by 1 – 3 weeks depending on climate model and region within Europe. The changes were largest in Northern Europe. Timing of flowering and maturity were projected to advance by 1 – 3 weeks.

Then soybeans or another row crop is no-till planted into the first crop to minimize damage to the small grain by wheel and planter traffic. The relay intercrop will be well established when the small grain is ready for harvest. This may result in higher grain yield than with conventional doublecropping. However, relay intercropping requires more careful management than most crop production systems. Any grower trying relay intercropping for the first time should do so on a limited scale...|$|R
25|$|Agriculture {{has been}} and {{continues}} as Willow Bunch’s largest industry, with <b>spring</b> wheat, durum, <b>oats,</b> barley, and flax seeing the most consistent production over the last 30 years, since 1982. Among these top five crops, the most productive year over the past 70 was in 1993 when 71.5 bushels per acre of oats were produced. These numbers are gathered from the rural municipality of Willow Bunch, RM 42, an area spanning 1,047.8 square kilometres. As of the 2011 Canadian census, there were 102 farms in the Willow Bunch area, operated {{by a total of}} 125 farmers. The average age of farm operators in the area is 53.4, while the average farmer's age overall in Saskatchewan is 54.2. In the area, there are 16 animal production farms and 86 crop production farms.|$|R
40|$|Quantification of {{variations}} in machine-vision-computed features of cereal grains. Canadian Biosystems Engineering/Le génie des biosystèmes au Canada 47 : 7. 1 - 7. 6. For machine-vision based identification and classification of cereal grains, {{the variability in}} features of grain kernels can occur due to the kernel orientation, different growing regions, and images acquired from different types of cameras. In an effort to quantify these variations in features, six morphological, nine color, and seven textural features were extracted from high-resolution images of five different cereal grains (barley, Canada Western Amber Durum (CWAD) wheat, Canada Western Red <b>Spring</b> (CWRS) wheat, <b>oats,</b> and rye). Except for the width related morphological features of barley, there was little variation in extracted features of all the grain types when a kernel was randomly dropped {{several times in the}} field of view of the camera and imaged. Within the different kernels of a grain type, morphological features showed mor...|$|R
