40|$|The {{long and}} short term {{behavior}} of light water reactor stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> has been investigated {{in order to establish}} more adequate or applicable operation/design criteria. The performance record of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> used in both the Connecticut Yankee and San Onofre 1 power stations has remained essentially unmarred until the recent past. While the San Onofre 1 plant has maintained this record, the Connecticut Yankee station has experienced a number of fuel element failures since 1977. Consequently, emphasis has been placed on cladding behavior for anomalous operation experienced by the Connecticut Yankee reactor prior to its first observed coolant activity increase. In order to predict cladding behavior, a fuel performance code (STRESS) has been developed with the capabilities of analyzing long term cladding creepdown behavior, cladding conditioning, and behavior during up-power ramping and power maneuvers. The effects of varied fill gas pressure and cladding creep rate on the stress/deformation behavior of stainless steel cladding for these performance areas have been investigated. Similar calculations are also performed for Zircaloy clad fuel so that a comparison can be made between these materials. Code limitations are discussed and some methods which compensate for insufficient modeling are reviewed. Fuel element design and reactor operation recommendations are made for Connecticut Yankee (and San Onofre 1) stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel.</b> These include fill gas pressurization level, up-power ramp rate limitations, and possible cladding material preference. These recommendations are {{based on the results of}} the STRESS code and the trends which may be inferred from them...|$|E
40|$|Horizonte) {{reached its}} first {{criticality}} on November 1960, with a core configuration containing 56 aluminum clad standard TRIGA fuel elements {{and a maximum}} thermal power of 30 kW. Since the middles of the 60 ’s decade the General Atomics, supplier of the TRIGA reactor, discontinued the fabrication of such aluminum clad fuel elements. In order to upgrade the IPR-R 1 reactor power, nine stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were purchased in 1971. One of these fuel elements was instrumented in the centerline with three type K thermocouples. On December 2000, four of these stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were placed into the core allowing to uprate the nominal power to 250 kW steady state. In 2004 the instrumented fuel element (IF) was inserted into the core hottest position, predicted by neutronic calculations. The IF stayed in this position up to 2007, allowing heat transfer investigations in several operating powers, including the maximum power of 250 kW. During this time it also monitored the core temperature in all operations. The fuel temperature and other operational parameters were stored in a computer hard disk, with an accessible historical database, {{in order to make}} the chronological information on reactor performance and its behavior available to users. After almost 3 years of monitoring the core temperature, it was noticed that one of the three thermocouples didn't send anymore the correct value of the measures. Later on, the other two thermocouples also failed in its measures. It was observed the rupture of the thermocouples in the connector placed between the thermoelements wire and its extension cables.

A single material of construction {{which could be used}} for a processing complex which would handle all of the low-enrichment fuels concerned was searched for. In the Zirflex Process (NH/sub 4 /F-NH/sub 4 /NO/sub 3 /) the 300 series stainless steels, vacuum-melted Hastelloy-F, Carpenter 20, Nio- nel, Haynes 25, and Incoloy 804 have satisfactory corrosion resistance to solutions involved in the dissolution of Zr or Zircaloy claddings. Satisfactory dissolution rates for 304 -L stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> are obtained in the Niflex Process (1 MHNC/sub 3 /- 2 MHF) solutions. The minimum practical fluoride to stainless steel ratio is about five. Among many materials studied, vacuum-melted HastelloyF offers the best corrosion resistance to HNO/sub 3 /-HF solutions encountered during decladding. In the Sulfex Process (H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 /) dissolution rates for both annealed 304 -L and 347 stainless steel in 3 to 3 M H/ sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / are from 5 to 10 mils per hour. Vacuum-melted Hastelloy-F and Ni- o-nel show adequate corrosion resistance to the H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 /-stainless steel solutions concerned in H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / decladding. Ouring U or UO/sub 2 / core dissolution in HNO/sub 3 / following decladding, some sulfate (sulfex decladding) or (fluoride zirflex decladding) will be present due to incomplete rinsing or to the presence of solids (UF/sub 4 /). Residual sulfate in the concentration range has no significant effect on the corrosion of 304 -L stainless steel or vacuum- melted Hastelloy-F by HNC/sub 3 /. Fluoride present will increase the corrosion potential but can be effectively complexed by Al.

40|$|A {{corrosion}} cycle for uranium is postulated {{which can}} be used to assess whether a given storage situation might produce fire hazards and/or continual uranium corrosion. A significant reaction rate of uranium and moisture occurs at room temperature which produces uranium oxide and hydrogen. If the hydrogen cannot escape, it will react slowly with uranium to form uranium hydride. The hydride is pyrophoric at room temperature when exposed to air. Either the hydrogen or the hydride can produce a dangerous situation as demonstrated by two different incidents described here.

Whilst the cladding may therefore be considered to be passive short time periods, the very long timescales involved in a GDF project mean that these currents are sufficient to cause corrosion of the full thickness of the clad in a matter of decades. Furthermore, an increase in electrochemical potential from that expected of less than 50 mV is sufficient to initiate severe pitting corrosion in a matter of hours. It can therefore be assumed that there is a risk of cladding corrosion in a repository environment, and the corrosion products created may have implications for the chemistry of the spent fuel ceramic...|$|R

The thinness of the clad is responsible for a thermal unbalance, leading to a higher temperature reached. Its deformation is important and may lead to a lack of joining between the faying surfaces located on the outer part of the join which can be avoided by increasing the dissipated energy or by limiting the clad stick-out. The deformation and the temperature reached trigger a recrystallization phenomenon in the welded area, usually combined with a modification of the yttrium dispersion, i. e., oxide dispersion, which can damage the long-life resistance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding.</b> The process parameters are optimized to limit the deformation of the clad, preventing the compactness defect and the modification of the nanoscale oxide dispersion...|$|R

40|$|The common {{profiled}} <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> systems used in Australia and its {{neighboring countries}} {{are made of}} very thin (0. 42 mm) high strength steel (G 550 with a minimum yield stress of 550 MPa) and are crest-fixed. However, these claddings often suffer from local pull-through failures at their screw connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones. Past experience and researches {{have shown that the}} loss of steel roofs has often occurred due to local pull-through failures of their screw connections under uplift or suction loading. Loss of claddings always led to a progressive collapse of the entire building. This situation is continuing because of the lower priority given to the design of roof and wall cladding systems. At present, steel design codes do not provide guidelines for the design of crest-fixed steel roof or wall claddings. Past research has shown that European and American recommendations for steel claddings cannot be used for Australian crest-fixed cladding systems as they were developed mainly for valley-fixed claddings subjected to gravity loading instead of crest-fixed claddings subjected to wind uplift/suction loading. Therefore at present the design of thin <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> systems is based on laboratory tests and is expensive. These situations inhibit the innovative design and advances in the <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> industry. Since the local pull-through failures in the less ductile G 550 steel claddings are initiated by transverse splitting at the fastener hole, analytical studies {{have not been able to}} determine the pull-through failure loads accurately. Therefore in the first stage of this research an appropriate fracture/splitting criterion was developed using a series of large scale and small scale experiments of crest-fixed steel claddings. A shell finite element model of crest-fixed <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> was then developed that included the new fracture/splitting criterion and advanced features such as hyperelastic material modelling, contact simulations, residual stresses and geometric imperfections. The improved finite element analyses were able to model the pull-through failures associated with splitting as evident from the comparison of their results with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. An extensive series of parametric studies considering the effects of material properties and geometric parameters of the two commonly used trapezoidal cladding profiles was undertaken using finite element analysis. Appropriate design formulae for the pull-through and dimpling failure load of trapezoidal profiles were then derived for optimization purposes and to simplify the current design method. This will then lead to modification and optimisation of cladding profiles to satisfy the requirements of both strength (safety during cyclones and storms) and economy. This thesis presents the details of large scale experimental studies undertaken and the results including the criterion for the splitting/fracture failure of high strength <b>steel</b> <b>cladding</b> systems.
