The traditional concept of precedence constraints fails to model such restrictions. Therefore, the concept has been generalized to so-called and/or precedence constraints which can cope {{with this kind of}} requirement. In the context of traditional precedence constraints, feasibility, transitivity, and the computation of earliest start times for jobs are fundamental, well-studied problems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide efficient algorithms for these tasks for the more general model of and/or precedence constraints. We show that feasibility as well as many questions related to transitivity can be solved by applying essentially the same linear-time algorithm. In order to compute earliest start times we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to cope with different classes of time distances between jobs...|$|E

40|$|Background. The term "internal auditor " is {{commonly}} used {{in a variety of}} ways in the public sector. For example, some individuals with the title "internal auditor " are actually elected officials who, for all practical purposes, function as external auditors. Conversely, many individuals in the public sector perform one or more of the duties of an internal auditor, although they may use <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>job</b> title. For purposes of this recommended practice, an "internal auditor " will be considered to be any audit professional who works directly for management, at some level, and whose primary responsibility is helping management to fulfill its duties as effectively and efficiently as possible. Internal auditors can be of great value to state and local governments {{in a variety of ways}}. In particular, they commonly assist management in monitoring the design and proper functioning of internal control policies and procedures. In this capacity, internal auditors themselves function as an additional level of control and so help to improve the government’s overall control environment. Internal auditors also can play a valuable role conducting performance audits, as well as special investigations and studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{a system of}} parallel servers, where arriving jobs are routed {{to one of the}} servers upon arrival. The standard objective of minimizing the mean sojourn time (delay) does not enforce any kind of fairness in the system and it is acceptable, e. g., to delay one job a lot if it reduces the sojourn time of <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>jobs.</b> We take fairness into account by defining a linearly increasing instantaneous holding cost rate by two job-specific non-negative random variables, (αi,βi), that can depend on the service time. We focus on first-come-first-served (FCFS) and preemptive last-come-first-served (LCFS) scheduling, and derive the so-called value functions for the corresponding M/G/ 1 queues. Then we apply these results and obtain cost-aware dispatching policies by means of policy improvement and lookahead. The policies are finally evaluated numerically. I...|$|R
40|$|In many {{real-time}} systems, {{the workload}} {{can be characterized}} as a set of jobs with linear precedence constraints among them.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have shown interest {{to solve the}} job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) applying evolutionary algorithms (EAs). In a previous work we reported an enhanced evolutionary algorithm, which uses a multiplicity feature to solve JSSP. The evolutionary approach was enhanced by means of multiple crossovers on multiple parents (MCMP) and {{the selection of a}} stud among the intervening parent. Partially mapped crossover (PMX) was used on each multiple crossover operation and job based representation (permutation of jobs) was adopted as a coding technique. The traditional MCMP approach is based on scanning crossover.

This application note presents the hardware design and the software necessary to run a simple Ethernet-enabled speaker.

40|$|Abstract: Clusters of {{commodity}} servers are increasingly the platform {{of choice for}} running computationally and IO intensive jobs {{in a variety of}} industries. It is expected that using clusters will reduce the average job response time. But improper submission of jobs to clusters may lead to two problems, first it leads to blocking of jobs (waiting for results from <b>other</b> <b>jobs)</b> second it leads to disturbing <b>other</b> <b>jobs</b> (i. e. <b>other</b> <b>jobs</b> may be blocked due to submission). Effective utilization of the resources in clusters can help to balance the load and avoid situations like slow run of systems. This paper addresses the principle of effective utilization of cluster resources by Machine Learning based profile driven scheduling. It avoids the above problems by allocating jobs to resources of cluster based on the SVM prediction profiling results. Some of the machines in the cluster run the IO bound jobs effectively with minimum waiting time and with the minimum execution time, while in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> machines run the CPU bound jobs effectively with minimum waiting time and with the minimum execution time. The system statistics like CPU utilization time, Memory space utilized, User and System time utilization are used as the parameters for Profiling.
