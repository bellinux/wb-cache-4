40|$|The {{utilization}} of biodegradable polymers for various applications has been restricted mainly by its high cost. This report aims {{to study the}} water absorption and mechanical properties of kenaf dust-filled polycaprolactone/thermoplastic sago starch biodegradable composites {{as a function of}} filler loading and treatment with maleic anhydride. While water absorption in untreated biocomposites increased as a function of filler loading, treated biocomposites resulted in weight loss, whereby low molecular weight substances were dissolved into the aging medium. The kenaf dust imparts reinforcing effects on the biocomposites, resulting in improved mechanical properties. This is further attested by morphological studies in which kenaf dust was well dispersed in the polycaprolactone/ thermoplastic sago <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> matrix. The addition of maleic anhydride into the polycaprolactone/thermoplastic sago <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> resulted in a homogeneous mixture. At low filler loading, strain at break of the maleated polycaprolactone/thermoplastic sago <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> increased at the expense of tensile strength and modulus. This is most likely due to the excessive dicumyl peroxide content, which caused chain scission of the polycaprolactone backbone. Tensile strength and modulus improved only when high filler loading was employed...|$|E

The viscosity of pure SS, pure CS and SS/CS blends was measured over the temperature range 30 - 130 °C. Results on the SS/CS blends indicate that the viscosity decreases with temperature and SS content for a fixed speed. At lower SS content, the decrease of viscosity with temperature is more pronounced. This indicates that blends with higher CS content are more affected by temperature changes. Blend containing 50 %CS was superior compared to other blends and {{this finding is consistent}} with earlier works on compatibility studies of polypropylene/sago <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> using Dynamical Mechanical Thermal Analyzer (DMTA) ...|$|E

Maleic anhydrides- graft-polyethylene {{was used as a}} compatibilizers. The effect of corn starch content on the blends was evaluated by mechanical property measurements and water uptake tests. Results indicated that the tensile strength of the blends decreased with increase in corn starch contents. While the elongation at break of {{low density polyethylene}}-corn <b>starch</b> <b>blends</b> decreased with increase in starch content,the elongation at break of high density polyethylene/corn <b>starch</b> <b>blends</b> first decreased with increase in starch content, up to 7. 25 wt %, and there-after, decreased with further increase in corn starch contents. The addition of maleic anhydride-graft-polyethylene was found to improve the tensile strength and elongation at break of the blends. Both the compatibilized and uncompatibilized blend absorbed water, the amount of which increased with increase in corn starch content, and immersion period; and tended to level off after the fourth day of immersion in water. The amount of water absorbed by the blends was appreciably decreased on incorporation of maleic anhydride-graft-polyethylene into the blends...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong Cheng ShiOctenyl succinic {{anhydride}} (OSA) modified starch {{is widely used}} in emulsion and encapsulation applications. The functionality of OS starch depends on its molecular structure. A systematic study was performed to investigate the reaction of OSA with granular waxy maize (WM) starch, microporous WM starch and soluble maltodextrin. OS starches were prepared in an aqueous slurry system, {{and the degree of}} substitution (DS) of OS starches was determined by titration and [superscript] 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. For both 3 % and 50 % OSA treatment, OS maltodextrin had higher DS and reaction efficiency (RE) than OSA modified WM starch and microporous WM starch. The maximum DS of OSA modified granular WM starch was 0. 14 and the highest DS of OS maltodextrin was 0. 27. For the 3 % OSA treatment, the RE for WM starch and maltodextrin was ~ 80 % and ~ 100 %, respectively. The structure of OSA modified WM starch and the locations of OS groups on anhydroglucose units (AGUs) were studied by [superscript] 1 H-NMR and [superscript] 13 C-NMR. As increasing OS substitution, [superscript] 13 C - signal at C- 1 shifted to upper field. In addition, the [superscript] 13 C - signal at C- 6 shifted to downfield when DS reached 0. 073. The results suggested that OS groups were predominantly substituted at the O- 2 position and started being substituted at O- 6 position when DS was 0. 073. FT-IR microspectroscopy was used to detect the heterogeneity OS starch products. Native WM starch, OSA modified WM starches (DS= 0. 019 and 0. 073) and a <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> with native starch to OSA modified WM starch (DS= 0. 073) ratio of 7 : 3 were examined.

For the OS starch (DS= 0. 073), 99 % starch granules showed carbonyl absorption but the intensity varied, indicating that OSA reacted with most starch granules when DS was 0. 073. However, the OS contents of individual granules varied. For the <b>starch</b> <b>blend,</b> only 30 % starch granules had carbonyl absorption.

Two soil types were used: a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox with a clayey texture and an Arenic Hapludult with a sandy texture. The two different plastic specimens were incorporated in the form of plastic films with three increasing particle sizes and six doses, from 0 to 2. 5 mg C g(- 1) soil. Each plastic dose was incorporated into 200 g of soil placed in a hermetically closed jar at 28 degrees C, and incubated for a 120 -day period to determine CO(2) evolution. Once again it was confirmed that polyethylene is almost non-biodegradable, in contrast to PCL/S, which can be defined as a biodegradable material. Soil texture affected the mineralization kinetics of the plastic specimens, with higher values for the clayey soil. No changes in soil microbial biomass-C or -N were observed by adding polyethylene and PCL/S to the soil. Also, no significant differences were observed on seed emergence and development of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) in plastic modified soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of starch-based polymers {{was investigated}} using different methodologies. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) {{was used as}} a control for comparison purposes. Extracts of four different starch-based blends (corn starch and ethylene vinyl alcohol (SEVA-C), corn starch and cellulose acetate (SCA), corn starch and polycaprolactone (SPCL) and starch and poly-lactic acid (SPLA 70) were prepared in culture medium and their toxicity was analysed. Osteoblast-like cells (SaOs- 2) were incubated with the extracts and cell viability was assessed using the MTT test and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. In addition DNA and total protein were quantified in order to evaluate cell proliferation. Cells were also cultured in direct contact with the polymers for 3 and 7 days and observed in light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

This present study is aimed on increasing and improving the physical and mechanical performances of MDF by application of bio-based adhesives which comprises NRL and rice starch solution. The effects of bio-adhesives used on the physical and mechanical properties of boards produced were investigated accordingly and compared with the MDF prepared using urea-formaldehyde according to the specific ASTM standards.

This research focused on the characteristics (moisture, ash, protein content, particle size distribution, water holding capacity (WHC) and solubility, oil binding capacity, gel forming and mulsifying capacity) of four alternative, non-allergen roteins (corn, pea, potato, rice) and their functionality (WHC, starch gelatinisation, frequency sweep, creep recovery, texture profile analysis) in three gluten free dough and bread systems (rice flour, wheat starch or corn/potato starch (1 : 3) with 14 % protein substitution). Incorporation of proteins led to an increase in dough consistency, depending on the matrix {{and the nature of the}} protein. Pea protein increased the consistency of the dough based on the corn/potato <b>starch</b> <b>blend</b> or wheat starch. Corn or rice protein only increased dough consistency in the corn/potato starch system. The selected proteins had no elasticity promoting effect on gluten-free doughs. All proteins had a hardening effect on the corn/potato starch breads, while they had no effect on the hardness of rice flour system breads. In the wheat starch bread, pea and rice protein led to an increase in crumb hardness, while potato and corn starch significantly increased hardness.

The evaluation of immobilized enzyme kinetics on both pure and the <b>starch</b> <b>blended</b> PAAm nanofibers was performed using Michaelis–Menten kinetic curves. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results along with differential scanning and X-ray diffraction confirmed that blending was successfully accomplished. TGA analysis also demonstrated that the presence of starch enhances the thermal degradability of PAAm nanofibers. Finally, it was shown that addition of starch to PAAm increases the efficacies of enzyme loading and, therefore, significantly enhances the activity as well as kinetics of the immobilized enzyme on electrospun blend mats.|$|R
40|$|The biaxial {{stretchability}} {{and film}} properties of polylactide/ thermoplastic <b>starch</b> <b>blends</b> were investigated. Polylactide (PLA) and thermoplastic <b>starch</b> (TPS) were <b>blended</b> in various proportions. Blends containing 27, 42 and 60 wt. % TPS were prepared via a twin-screw extrusion process. Interfacial modification {{was performed by}} grafting the PLA with maleic anhydride. These blends were subsequently cast into sheets and biaxially drawn using a laboratory biaxial stretcher. The morphology of extruded strands and cast sheets was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The compatibilized blends exhibited a much finer morphology as well as preferential minor phase size orientation along the machine direction. The addition of starch did not affect significantly the biaxial stretchability of the pure PLA. Even at high starch content (60 wt. %), the biaxial draw ratio at which the sample breaks {{is very similar to}} that of the pure PLA. At higher temperatures, all blends could be stretched at significantly much higher biaxial draw ratio and very thin films could be obtained. The starch content and processing variables affected the tensile properties. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Polylactide (PLA) and thermoplastic <b>starch</b> (TPS) were <b>blended</b> in various proportions. Blends containing 33 and 67 wt. % TPS were prepared via a twin-screw extrusion process. Water, glycerol and sorbitol {{were used as}} plasticizers. Interfacial modification was performed by grafting the PLA with maleic anhydride. A chain extender was also used. These blends were subsequently cast into sheets and biaxially drawn using a laboratory biaxial stretcher. The structural properties and mechanical performance were evaluated. The addition of the grafted PLA and chain extender yielded a much finer TPS dispersed phase, which was preferentially oriented {{in the direction of}} flow. The addition of TPS, grafted PLA and chain extender affected the biaxial stretchability of the neat PLA. The tensile properties for both cast sheets and biaxial films were evaluated as a function of process parameters and composition of the blends. Adding TPS to PLA resulted in a decrease of the tensile modulus and strength but increased the elongation at break in some cases. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
