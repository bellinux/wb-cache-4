25|$|Telephone {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} prefixed with special services, such as vertical <b>service</b> <b>codes,</b> that contain signaling events other than numbers, {{most notably the}} star (*) and the number sign (#). Vertical <b>service</b> <b>codes</b> enable or disable special telephony services either on a per-call basis, or for the station or telephone line until changed. The use of the number sign is most frequently used as a marker signal to indicate the end of digit sequences {{or the end of}} other procedures; as a terminator it avoids operational delays when waiting for expiration of automatic time-out periods.|$|E
25|$|The GSM phones may regard {{some phone}} numbers {{with one or}} two digits as special <b>service</b> <b>codes.</b> It might be {{impossible}} to make an emergency call to numbers like 03 or 92 with a mobile phone. In those cases the emergency number has to be called by using a landline telephone or with an additional first/last digit (for example 922 or 992 instead of 92 and 003 or 033 instead of 03).|$|E

The <b>service</b> <b>code</b> comprises six decimal digits.The link code comprises decimal digits and its length is defined for each service. The check digit contains one decimal digit calculated from the <b>service</b> <b>code</b> and the link code. It is used for error detection.|$|R
3000|$|The main {{realization}} of the SRC is the <b>service</b> <b>code,</b> which contains executable specifications (code) for the four phases of the cycle. In other words, the <b>service</b> <b>code</b> is {{the outcome of a}} service developed according to the SRC. If the content of the <b>service</b> <b>code</b> is packed into a standard file (similar to a [...].jar file), any compatible engine should be able to execute it.|$|R

50|$|Vertical <b>service</b> <b>codes,</b> carrier-specific: Most {{vertical}} <b>service</b> <b>codes</b> are activated with #, * or {{a leading}} 11- and are internal {{to an individual}} landline or wireless carrier. This block mostly contains codes to activate or deactivate features such as call forwarding, but rarely a test number may appear in this set.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} speed up the {{generation}} of such description files, this approach leverages the use of patterns and templates to guide the first steps of development. Design patterns guide the creation of a formal requirements document (the service guideline) which, in turn, can be translated into a technology-free consistent description (abstract <b>service</b> <b>code)</b> assisted by implementation patterns. The abstract <b>service</b> <b>code</b> is finally compiled into the executable <b>service</b> <b>code,</b> with the help of technology templates. In the pattern-based approach, we added a third phase in the service creation process, which is aimed at the compilation of the service to generate the final <b>service</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
30|$|The pattern-based {{approach}} involves {{describing the}} service and its components {{in a way that}} fosters reutilization of previously developed services. Three levels of information representation provide the maximum balance of simplicity and flexibility, and each of them is assisted by a pattern/template used by a corresponding tool. Service guidelines are similar to the quasi-manual approach presented in Table  1. Abstract <b>service</b> <b>code</b> is all an ontology-based and technology-independent version of the <b>service</b> <b>code</b> presented in the ‘Outcomes: service guideline and service code’ subsection. Finally, the executable <b>service</b> <b>code</b> is the concrete description of the service ready to be deployed, i.e., the very <b>service</b> <b>code</b> presented in the ‘Outcomes: service guideline and service code’ subsection.|$|R

30|$|The {{existence}} of a well-defined service specification format, the <b>service</b> <b>code,</b> plays a paramount role {{in the design of}} service creation approaches and tools.

30|$|The {{outcomes}} (intermediate and final) of the pattern-based approach are {{the service}} guideline, the abstract <b>service</b> <b>code,</b> and the executable <b>service</b> <b>code.</b> The <b>service</b> guideline for the pattern-based approach {{is similar to}} that of the quasi-manual approach, as presented in the ‘Outcomes: service guideline and service code’ subsection.|$|R

These codes are used to convey instructions to merchant terminals on how a card should be processed. The first digit indicates if a card can be used internationally or is valid for domestic use only. It {{is also used to}} signal if the card is chip-enabled. The second digit indicates if the transaction must be sent online for authorization always or if transactions that are below floor limit can take place without authorization. The third digit is used to indicate the preferred card verification method (e.g. PIN) and the environment where the card can be used (e.g. at point of sale only). Merchant terminals are required to recognize and act on <b>service</b> <b>codes</b> or send all transactions for online authorization.|$|E
