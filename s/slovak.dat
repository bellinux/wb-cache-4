5|$|In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed {{neighbouring}} Austria in the Anschluss; {{later that}} year it also annexed the still-separate from Bratislava Petržalka and Devín boroughs on ethnic grounds, as these had many ethnic Germans. Bratislava was declared {{the capital of the}} first independent <b>Slovak</b> Republic on March 14, 1939, but the new state quickly fell under Nazi influence. In 1941–1942 and 1944–1945, the new <b>Slovak</b> government cooperated in deporting most of Bratislava's approximately 15,000 Jews; they were transported to concentration camps, where most were killed or died {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{edition of}} his memoirs, Vrba responded that he is certain the {{reference}} to the imminent Hungarian deportations was in the original <b>Slovak</b> version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, but which did not survive. He wrote that he recalled Oscar Krasniansky of the <b>Slovak</b> Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which was the version that was copied around the world.|$|E

5|$|The city {{started to}} lose its {{importance}} under the reign of Maria Theresa's son Joseph II, especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 {{in an attempt to}} strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary. Many central offices subsequently moved to Buda, followed by {{a large segment of the}} nobility. The first newspapers in Hungarian and <b>Slovak</b> were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783. In the course of the 18th century, the city became a centre for the <b>Slovak</b> national movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} centre is characterised by many baroque palaces. The Grassalkovich Palace, built around 1760, {{is now the}} residence of the <b>Slovak</b> president, and the <b>Slovak</b> government now has its seat in the former Archiepiscopal Palace. In 1805, diplomats of emperors Napoleon and Francis II signed the fourth Peace of Pressburg in the Primate's Palace, after Napoleon's victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. Some smaller houses are historically significant; composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel was born in an 18th-century house in the Old Town.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} written and re-written several times. Wetzler {{wrote the first}} part, Vrba the third, and the two wrote the second part together. They then worked on the whole thing together, re-writing it six times. Neumann's aide, Oscar Krasniansky, an {{engineer}} and stenographer who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel, translated it from <b>Slovak</b> into German {{with the help of}} Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian. The original <b>Slovak</b> version was not preserved.|$|E
50|$|Őrszentmiklós resettled by Calvinist and Roman Catholic Hungarians, while Vácbottyán was rebuilt by Lutheran <b>Slovaks</b> and Roman Catholic Hungarians in the 18th century. Later <b>Slovaks</b> adopted Hungarian {{language}} and they assimilated into the Hungarian majority.|$|R
50|$|Czechoslovakia {{was created}} through {{the merging of}} the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, {{previously}} under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state.The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), <b>Slovaks</b> (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%). Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some <b>Slovaks,</b> felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.The state proclaimed the official ideology {{that there are no}} Czechs and <b>Slovaks,</b> but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of <b>Slovaks</b> and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the <b>Slovaks</b> surfaced again.|$|R
50|$|The ethnic <b>Slovaks</b> form a {{majority}} of the population in the municipality. There are 9,751 ethnic <b>Slovaks</b> in the municipality or 66% of population. Other ethnic groups are: Serbs (3,779 or 25.74%), Yugoslavs (293 or 1.99%), and others.|$|R
