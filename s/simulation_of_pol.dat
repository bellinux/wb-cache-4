40|$|The young SMC cluster NGC 330 {{contains}} {{a number of}} blue stars that lie above the main-sequence turnoff found from our isochrone fitting and below {{the position of the}} blue supergiants. We used our own, new spectroscopy and published data on these stars to investigate their possible nature. Problems in interpreting the evolutionary status of the blue giants have been found in several preceding studies. In theoretical H-R diagrams, these stars lie in the rapidly traversed post main-sequence gap, similar to the unexpected concentration found by Fitzpatrick & Garmany (1990) in the H-R diagram of the LMC. We argue that these stars probably are core H burning main-sequence stars that appear as blue stragglers resulting from binary evolution as described in the <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pols</b> & Marinus (1994) and effects of rapid rotation. Many of the blue stragglers are Be stars and likely rapid rotators. We suggest that there is evidence for the presence of blue stragglers also in NGC 1818, NGC 2004, and NGC 2100. We point out that blue stragglers may be a general phenomenon in the CMDs of young clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and discuss the implications for IMF and age determinations.

40|$|Structural [1], kinetic [2], and {{computational}} data [3] {{have suggested}} that the large subdomain movement per se in the polymerase cycle is relatively rapid, while Arg 258 side-chain rotation could be slow enough to be kinetically significant in the conformational change <b>of</b> <b>pol</b> β. Such slow rearrangements involving the Arg 258 rotation might limit pol β's closing before chemistry. Transition path sampling <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pol</b> β’s correct incorporation also revealed that the transition state corresponding to Arg 258 rotation is the rate-limiting step in the conformational change process [4]. Would these slow, local rearrangements surrounding Arg 258 discourage incorrect nucleotide insertion? Would conformational barriers to closing be lower with Arg 258 replaced by alanine? To address these questions, we study the R 258 A mutant enzyme using molecular dynamics and transition path sampling. Methods We construct the complex <b>of</b> <b>pol</b> β/DNA mutant R 258 A by replacing Arg 258 with alanine in the wildtype intermediate model before chemistry [5], leaving other protein residues and DNA base sequences unchanged. The generated steric clashes in the mutant were removed by subsequent energy minimization and equilibration. The thumb subdomain in the initial R 258 A model was partially closed and the incoming nucleotide (dCTP) along with catalytic and nucleotide-binding magnesium ions were placed in the active site as in ternary crystal closed complex. The intermediate R 258 A mutant model was solvated, minimized, and equilibrated as in our initial work [3, 5]. The mutant model contained about 40, 000 atoms and was simulated over 15 ns with CHARMM. In addition to this dynamics simulation, we employ the transition path sampling [6 - 8] approach as we developed for biomolecules [4, 9, 10]. As described in Ref.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modified}} base 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (oxoG) is {{a common}} DNA adduct produced by the oxidation of DNA by reactive oxygen species. Kinetic data reveal that DNA polymerase X (pol X) from the African swine fever virus incorporates adenine (dATP) opposite to oxoG with higher efficiency than the non-damaged G:C basepair. To help interpret the kinetic data, we perform molecular dynamics <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>pol</b> X/DNA complexes, in which the template base opposite to the incoming dNTP (dCTP, dATP, dGTP) is oxoG. Our results suggest that pol X accommodates the oxoGsyn:A mispair by sampling closed active conformations that mirror those observed in traditional Watson-Crick complexes. Moreover, for both the oxoGsyn:A and oxoG:C ternary complexes, conformational sampling of the polymerase follows previously described large subdomain movements, local residue motions, and active site reorganization. Interestingly, the oxoGsyn:A system exhibits superior active site geometry {{in comparison to the}} oxoG:C system. Simulations for the other mismatch basepair complexes reveal large protein subdomain movement for all systems, except for oxoG:G, which samples conformations close to the open state. In addition, active site geometry and basepairing of the template base with the incoming nucleotide, reveal distortions and misalignments that range from moderate (i. e., oxoG:Asyn) to extreme (i. e., oxoGanti/syn:G). These results agree with the available kinetic data for pol X and provide structural insights regarding the mechanism by which this polymerase can accommodate incoming nucleotides opposite oxoG. Our simulations also support the notion that α-helix E is involved both in DNA binding and active site stabilization. Our proposed mechanism by which pol X can preferentially accommodate dATP opposite template oxoG further underscores the role that enzyme dynamics and conformational sampling operate in polymerase fidelity and function...|$|R

Despite the availability of its crystal structures, the molecular mechanism of DNA replication, the switch between polymerase and exonuclease activities, the site of replisomal interactions, and functional effects of patient mutations that do not affect direct catalysis have remained elusive. Here we report the first atomistic classical molecular dynamics <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> the human <b>Pol</b> gamma replicative complex. Our simulation data show that DNA binding triggers remarkable changes in the enzyme structure, including (1) completion of the DNA-binding channel via a dynamic subdomain, which in the apo form blocks the catalytic site, (2) stabilization of the structure through the distal accessory beta-subunit, and (3) formation of a putative transient replisome-binding platform in the "intrinsic processivity" subdomain of the enzyme.

40|$|A {{structurally}} conserved element, {{the trigger}} loop, {{has been suggested}} to {{play a key role}} in substrate selection and catalysis of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription elongation. Recently resolved X-ray structures showed that the trigger loop forms direct interactions with the beta-phosphate and base of the matched nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) through residues His 1085 and Leu 1081, respectively. In order to understand the role of these two critical residues in stabilizing active site conformation in the dynamic complex, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> the wildtype <b>pol</b> II elongation complex and its mutants in explicit solvent. In the wild-type complex, we found that the trigger loop is stabilized in the "closed" conformation, and His 1085 forms a stable interaction with the NTP. <b>Simulations</b> <b>of</b> point mutations of His 1085 are shown to affect this interaction; <b>simulations</b> <b>of</b> alternative protonation states, which are inaccessible through experiment, indicate that only the protonated form is able to stabilize the His 1085 -NTP interaction.

Repression <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III recruitment and transcription are tightly linked to MAF 1, which selectively localizes at Pol III loci, even under serum-replete conditions, and increasingly targets transcribing Pol III in response to serum starvation. Combining Pol III binding profiles with EU-labeling and high-throughput sequencing of newly synthesized small RNAs, we show that Pol III occupancy closely reflects ongoing transcription. Our results exclude the long-term, unproductive arrest <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III on the DNA as a major regulatory mechanism and identify previously uncharacterized, differential coordination in Pol III binding and transcription under different growth conditions...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{actively}} transcribed DNA is preferentially repaired by the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) system. TCR requires RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but the {{mechanism by which}} repair enzymes preferentially recognize and repair DNA lesions on Pol II-transcribed genes is incompletely understood. Herein we demonstrate that {{a fraction of the}} large subunit <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> II (Pol II LS) is ubiquitinated after exposing cells to UV-radiation or cisplatin but not several other DNA damaging agents. This novel covalent modification <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> II LS occurs within 15 min of exposing cells to UV-radiation and persists for about 8 - 12 hr. Ubiquitinated Pol II LS is also phosphorylated on the C-terminal domain. UV-induced ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> II LS is deficient in fibroblasts from individuals with two forms of Cockayne syndrome (CS-A and CS-B), a rare disorder in which TCR is disrupted. UV-induced ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> II LS can be restored by introducing cDNA constructs encoding the CSA or CSB genes, respectively, into CS-A or CS-B fibroblasts. These results suggest that ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> II LS plays a role in the recognition and/or repair of damage {{to actively}} transcribed genes. Alternatively, these findings may reflect a role played by the CSA and CSB gene products in transcription...|$|R
40|$|Polycomb {{repression}} complex 2 (PRC 2) component EZH 2 tri-methylates H 3 K 27 and exerts epigenetic re-pression {{on target}} gene expression. EZH 2 -mediated epigenetic control of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) tran-scribed coding gene transcription {{has been well}} established. However, {{little is known about}} EZH 2 -mediated epigenetic regulation of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription. Here we present a paradigm that EZH 2 is involved in the repression <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III transcription via interaction with transcriptional fac-tor complex IIIC (TFIIIC). EZH 2 and H 3 K 27 me 3 co-occupy the promoter of tRNATyr, 5 S rRNA and 7 SL RNA genes. Depletion of EZH 2 or inhibition of EZH 2 methyltransferase activity led to upregulation <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III target gene transcription. EZH 2 -mediated repres-sion <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III transcribed gene expression requires presence of SUZ 12. SUZ 12 was able to interact with TFIIIC complex and knockdown of SUZ 12 decreased occupancy of EZH 2 and H 3 K 27 me 3 at the promoter <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III target genes. Our findings pointed out a previ-ously unidentified role of PRC 2 complex in suppress-ing transcription <b>of</b> <b>Pol</b> III transcribed non-translated RNA genes, putting Pol III on a new layer of epige-netic regulation...|$|R
