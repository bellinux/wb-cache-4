5|$|Thoughts {{of a new}} way {{to improve}} the {{nighttime}} environment began in summer 2011 when the new Cedar Fair CEO, Matt Ouimet was in the park one night and thought they <b>should</b> <b>add</b> more lights and excitement. The goal was to create a new show that would energize the main midway with bright lights and music. Matt Ouimet first mentioned the show at a conference in January 2012. Details of Luminosity were first announced at the PointBuzz winter tour of Cedar Point on February 25, 2012. The 3,600 square foot screen used for American Portrait and Hot Summer Lights was taken down on February 28 because it was not needed for the new show. On April 13, Cedar Point officially announced Luminosity. The show debuted on June 1 for previews and its grand opening was held on June 8.|$|E

25|$|Decisions about {{distribution}} need to {{be taken}} in line with a company's overall strategic vision and mission. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of strategic planning. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel <b>should</b> <b>add</b> value to the consumer.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, Heathrow Airport Limited {{submitted}} {{an application}} to the Secretary of State for Transport seeking to gain authorisation {{to develop a new}} rail link to Heathrow Terminal 5 to be known as Heathrow Airtrack. The rail link would address the current lack of public transport available to the South West of the Airport by connecting to Guildford, Reading and London Waterloo. BAA stated that the scheme <b>should</b> <b>add</b> significantly to its aim of increasing the proportion of people using public transport to travel to the airport. In April 2011, BAA announced that it was abandoning the project, citing the unavailability of government subsidy and other priorities for Heathrow, such as linking to Crossrail and HS2.|$|E
500|$|Heated discussions {{during the}} writing of Lions were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. [...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] I thought we <b>should</b> <b>add</b> something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one.

Lewis Corner of British music website Digital Spy rated it four stars {{out of five}}, particularly praising the saxophone hook. Corner commented, [...] " [...] purrs in her sensual and sultry tones, accompanied by that saxophone hook spicier than an extra-hot peri peri chicken from Nandos – and, we <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> just as lip-lickingly addictive." [...] Garyn Ganz of Rolling Stone graded the song three stars out of five and briefly commented: [...] "Dev speak-sings about her sex drive over a Nineties Latin house beat like a top-shelf version of Kesha – seductive, not sleazy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Next Generation saw significant {{promise in}} Red Alarm, {{and believed that}} its elements <b>should</b> <b>add</b> up to [...] "a fantastic game"; but the writer panned the final product as a wasted opportunity. Similarly, Danny Wallace of Total! wrote, [...] "On the one hand, it's a pretty impressive 3D spacey shoot-em-up, with a real grip on the Virtual world and all those fancy techniques, {{and on the other}} it's an often visually confusing, headache-inducing attempt at being something it's quite obviously not." [...] However, Dave Halverson of DieHard GameFan called Red Alarm [...] "a great shooter" [...] with excellent graphics. Co-reviewer Nicholas Barres hailed it as a [...] "masterpiece", and he considered it to be [...] "the one and only reason to buy a Virtual Boy".|$|E
500|$|Blur resumed work {{on their}} second album due to a chance meeting with {{producer}} Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the band on their 1991 single [...] "There's No Other Way". With Street now producing the album, Blur recorded a mix of material spanning both the period immediately {{after the release of}} Leisure and their 1992 tour. While the band members were pleased with the recording session results, Balfe, after hearing the songs, told the band they were committing artistic suicide. Although dejected by his response, Blur gave Food the completed album in December 1992. However, the label told the group that the album was unfit for release and at the very least they <b>should</b> <b>add</b> a few more potential singles. Albarn complied, and on Christmas Day wrote the song [...] "For Tomorrow". Although [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] sated Food's concerns, Blur's American label SBK voiced discontent upon hearing the finished tapes of the album. To appease SBK the band recorded [...] "Chemical World", which Blur thought would increase Rubbishs American appeal. However, Blur flatly refused SBK's demand of re-recording the album with American producer Butch Vig, who was popular at the time for his work with Nirvana.|$|E

2500|$|A 2012 {{systematic}} review concluded that no accurate assessment of risk-benefit exists for cervical manipulation. A 2010 {{systematic review}} stated {{that there is}} no good evidence to assume that neck manipulation is an effective treatment for any medical condition and suggested a precautionary principle in healthcare for chiropractic intervention even if a causality with vertebral artery dissection after neck manipulation were merely a remote possibility. The same review concluded that the risk of death from manipulations to the neck outweighs the benefits. Chiropractors have criticized this conclusion, claiming that the author did not evaluate the potential benefits of spinal manipulation. Edzard Ernst stated [...] "This detail was not the subject of my review. I do, however, refer to such evaluations and <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that a report recently commissioned by the General Chiropractic Council did not support many of the outlandish claims made by many chiropractors across the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first series of Life on Mars was extremely positive. Steve O'Brien, writing for SFX, declared, [...] "It looks like BBC One has... a monster hit on its hands... It's funny... and dramatic and exciting, and we're really not getting paid for saying this". Alison Graham, television editor for the Radio Times, described the series as [...] "a genuinely innovative and imaginative take on an old genre". James Walton of The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Theoretically, this <b>should</b> <b>add</b> up to a right old mess. In practice, {{it makes for a}} thumpingly enjoyable piece of television — not least because everybody involved was obviously having such a great time". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote: [...] "Life on Mars {{was more than just a}} jolly, tongue-in-cheek romp into the past... Once there, in 1973, we find ourselves immersed in a reasonably gripping police drama — yes, The Sweeney, perhaps, with better production values... Or put another — undeniably laboured — way, as poor Sam Tyler walks through his sunken dream, I'm hooked to the silver screen". Although Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail reflected the views of many other commentators on the first episode when he wondered, [...] "Can its intriguing conceit be sustained over eight one-hour episodes?", Critical reaction remained generally positive throughout the programme's run. Of the second series, Alison Graham believed that [...] "Sam Tyler and Gene Hunt are shaping up nicely as one of the great TV detective partnerships... It's vastly enjoyable and manages to stay just about believable thanks to some strong writing and, of course, the two marvellous central performances".|$|E
