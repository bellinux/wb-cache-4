5|$|Bismuth {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has according to <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> been common in relatively recent times.

5|$|Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}}, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island in Alabama. The rainfall caused <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> of flooding, while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion.

5|$|Numismatic author Dean Albanese {{considers}} the legend that Washington provided the gold {{for the first}} 400 eagles to be improbable; holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in unproductive cash. Albanese suggests that as many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear, Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to give to dignitaries. By <b>some</b> <b>reports,</b> one eagle was presented to Washington, though whether it was from this first coinage is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1907 Tiku {{and two of}} his {{men were}} caught by the Dutch forces; he was the last guerrilla leader to be caught.

5|$|The {{fatality}} rate highly {{depends on the}} severity of the bites and some other factors. Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15% of all untreated cases (usually in 2–4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), although <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> show that severe envenomations have a 52% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Beryl produced locally heavy precipitation peaking at about 12inches (300mm) in east-central Texas, resulting in <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> of flash flooding.

Remnant moisture dropped about 5inches (125mm) {{of rain in}} southeast Oklahoma and 3inches (75mm) in southwestern Arkansas.

5|$|Following the 1900 hurricane, Galveston {{adopted a}} {{commission}} government (in 1960 {{the city would}} switch to council-manager system). At the beginning of Prohibition the city council originally opposed gambling and vice; though the council members were tolerant of small-scale activities which {{had always been a}} part of the city, they were more concerned about organized crime. As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable, the council became far more accepting of the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy. According to <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> this was because the Maceos bought the cooperation of the council members, taking advantage of easily corruptible structure of the commission.|$|E
5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London.

In <b>some</b> <b>reports</b> she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E

Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations. Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs. Bo placed Wang under surveillance, and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody. <b>Some</b> <b>reports</b> allege that Bo may have been plotting to have Wang assassinated.|$|E
