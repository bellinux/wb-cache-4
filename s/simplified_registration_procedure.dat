40|$|The herbal {{medicinal}} {{market is}} growing worldwide. This {{is due to}} the fact that in recent years there has been growing interest in therapeutic use of natural products, especially those derived from plants. Regulations and rules concerning herbal medicines vary greatly from country to country due to differences in traditional use, in historical and cultural backgrounds generally. Even between member states of European Union there are major differences in legal classification of herbal medicines as well as in their place in national healthcare systems which, apart from the above mentioned reasons, are caused by differences in enforcement of current legislation. These disparities in regulation of herbal medicines between countries have serious implications for the public health protection as well as for international access to and distribution of such products. In 2004 the European Union adopted the Directive 2004 / 24 /EC with the objective of harmonizing the conditions for marketing authorization for herbal medicinal products and facilitating free circulation trade. According to this Directive the European Union member states set up a specified <b>simplified</b> <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> for Traditional Herbal Medicines Products which could not fulfill medicines licensing criteria. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the ongoing efforts concerning the establishment of international harmonized framework for the regulation of herbal medicinal products with primary objective the public health protection. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} {{mobile node}} has several wireless inter-faces (e. g., IEEE 802. 11, Bluetooth, GPRS, and satellite). When {{applied to a}} heterogeneous mobile node, Mobile IP re-quires a lot of signaling, and it uses a slow handoff process. In this paper, we first describe these problems and then propose methods to mitigate them through the coordination of the mo-bile agents from the different wireless networks. We introduce a scheme that <b>simplifies</b> the <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> at the Home Agents and reduces the amount of signaling. Next, we assess quantitatively the savings that our scheme introduces {{in terms of the}} number of messages transmitted over the air in compari-son with the traditional Mobile IP <b>registration</b> <b>procedure.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|While voters {{traditionally}} had {{to register}} at government offices {{by a certain}} period before an election, in the mid-1990s, the federal government made efforts to <b>simplify</b> <b>registration</b> <b>procedures</b> to improve access and increase turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the [...] "Motor Voter" [...] law) required state governments to either provide uniform opt-in registration services through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration, or to allow voter registration on Election Day, where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting. From January 1, 2016, Oregon was {{the first state to}} adopt a fully automatic (opt-out) voter registration system as {{part of the process of}} issuing driver licenses and ID cards. By April 2016 three more states - California, West Virginia, and Vermont - followed suit, and in May 2016 Connecticut implemented it administratively rather than by legislation, bringing the number of states with automatic voter registration to five. [...] Alaskan voters approved Measure 1 during the November 8, 2016 general election, allowing residents the ability to register to vote when applying annually for the state's Permanent Dividend Fund. [...] Voter approval of Measure 1 made Alaska the first state to implement automatic (opt-in) voter registration via ballot initiative and the sixth state to implement automatic registration by any means including passing legislation. Several more states have drafted legislation proposing automatic registration.|$|R
40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} brings host countries capital, productive facilities, and technology transfers {{as well as}} employment, new job skills, and management expertise. It {{is important to the}} Russian Federation, where incentives for competition are limited and incentives to becoming efficient are blunted by interregional barriers to trade, weak creditor rights, and administrative barriers to new entrants. The authors ague that the old policy paradigm of foreign {{direct investment}} (established before World War II and prevalent in the 1950 s and 1960 s) still governs Russia. In this paradigm there are only two reasons for foreign direct investment: access to inputs for production and access to markets for outputs. Such kinds of foreign direct investment, although beneficial, are often based on generating exports that exploit cheap labor or natural resources, or are aimed at penetrating protected local markets, not necessarily at world standards for price and quality. They contend that Russia should phase out high tariffs and non-tariff protection for the domestic market, most tax preferences for foreign investors (which don't increase foreign direct investment but do reduce fiscal revenues), and many restrictions on foreign investment. They recommend that Russia switch to a modern approach to foreign direct investment by: 1) Amending the newly enacted foreign direct investment law so that it will grant non-discriminatory"national treatment"to foreign investors for both right of establishment, and post-establishment operations, abolish conditions (such as local content restrictions) inconsistent with the World Trade Organization agreement on trade-related investment measures (TRIMs), and make investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms more efficient (giving foreign investors the chance to seek neutral binding international arbitration, for example). 2) Strengthening enforcement of property rights. 3) <b>Simplifying</b> <b>registration</b> <b>procedures</b> for foreign investors, to make them transparent and rules-based. 4) Extending guarantee schemes covering basic non-commercial risks.
