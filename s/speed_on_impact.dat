40|$|The {{experimental}} {{observations of}} dynamic {{failure in the}} form of propagating shear bands and of the transition in failure mode presented in Part I of this investigation is analyzed. Finite element simulations are carried out for the initiation and propagation of shear-dominated failure in prenotched plates subjected to asymmetric impact loading. Coupled thermomechanical simulations are carried out under the assump-tion of plane strain. The simulations take into account finite deformations, inertia, heat conduction, thermal softening, strain hardening and strain-rate hardening. The propagation of shear bands is assumed to be governed by a critical plastic strain criterion. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of band propagation <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> <b>impact</b> velocity, in accordance with experimental observations. The calculations reveal an active plastic zone in front of the tip of the propagating shear bands. The size of this zone and the level of the shear stresses inside it do not change significantly with the impact velocity or the speed of shear band propagation. Shear stresses are uniform inside this zone except near the band tip where higher rates of strain prevail. The shear band behind the propagating tip exhibits highly localized deformations and intense heating. Temperature rises are relatively small in the active plastic zone compared with those inside the well-developed shear band behind the propagating tip. The calculations also show shear ban...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} modelling the load on a bridge pillar when hit by a vehicle. This load depends {{on a number of}} uncertain variables, such as the mass of the vehicle and its <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> <b>impact.</b> The objective of our study is to analyse their effect on the load. More specifically, we are interested in finding the minimum distance of the pillar {{to the side of the}} road passing under the bridge such that a given constraint on the load is satisfied in 99 % of impact cases, i. e., such that the probability of satisfying the constraint is 0. 99. In addition, we look for solutions to the following optimisation problem: find the distance that minimises a given cost function while still satisfying a given constraint on the load. This optimisation problem under uncertain constraints is not a well-posed problem, so we turn it into a decision problem under uncertainty. For both problems, we consider two typical cases. In the first, so-called precise-probability case, all uncertain variables involved are modelled using probability distributions, and in the second, so-called imprecise-probability case, the uncertainty for at least some of the variables (in casu the mass) is modelled by an interval of possible values, which is a special imprecise-probabilistic model. In the first case, we compute the joint distribution using simple Monte Carlo simulation, and in the second case, we combine Monte Carlo simulation with newly developed techniques in the field of imprecise probabilities. For the optimisation problem with uncertain constraints, this leads to two distinct approaches with different optimality criteria, namely maximality and maximinity, which we discuss and compare...|$|E

The aim of this investigation was to establish if the ITF degradation test can assess ball longevity and rate of degradation and determine if {{there is a need for}} a new degradation test that is more representative of in-play conditions. Ball tracking data from four different professional events, spanning the three major court surfaces, including both men’s and women’s matches were analysed. The frequency of first serves, second serves, racket impacts and surface impacts were assessed and the corresponding distribution of ball speed and (for surface impacts) impact angle was determined. Comparison of ball impact frequency and conditions between in-play data and the ITF degradation test indicated the development of a new test, more representative of in-play data, would be advantageous in determining ball longevity and rate of degradation with use. Assessment of data from different surfaces highlighted that grass court subjected the ball to fewer racket and surface impacts than hard court or clay. In turn, this appears to influence the distribution of ball <b>speed</b> <b>on</b> <b>impact</b> with the surface or racket, suggesting a surface-specific degradation test may be beneficial.

Strongly compressed granular media are, in many respects, simple solids in which elastic perturbations travel as ordinary phonons. However, the speed of sound in granular aggregates continuously decreases as the confining pressure decreases, completely vanishing at the jamming-unjamming transition. This anomalous behavior suggests that the transport of energy at low pressures should not be dominated by phonons. In this work we use simulations and theory to show how the response of granular systems becomes increasingly nonlinear as pressure decreases. In the low-pressure regime the elastic energy is found to be mainly transported through nonlinear waves and shocks.

This paper examines the determinants and growth implications of venture creation speed from a social constructionist perspective, which sees that time both shapes and is shaped by individuals, social contexts and spatial structures. We, therefore, investigate the influence of entrepreneurial characteristics, external support, institutional influences and the regional context in which venture creation speed occurs and subsequently <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> growth in new ventures. Results from structured interviews with 381 active de novo entrepreneurs in Catalonia (Spain) show a positive relationship between prior entrepreneurial experience and speed. Interestingly, support from potential suppliers and customers is useful not only for speed but also for the subsequent growth of the venture. In contrast, business planning retards venture creation and fails to lead to an improvement in growth. Results also indicate a positive, but weak, relationship between speed and growth, once entrepreneurial, environmental and venture characteristics are held constant.

30|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop {{non-contact}} fiber optic based displacement sensors {{to operate in the}} harsh environment of a “light gas gun” (LGG), which can “fire” small particles at velocities ranging from 1 km/s- 8.4 km/s. The LGG is used extensively for research in aerospace to analyze the effects of high <b>speed</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> materials. Ideally the measurement should be made close {{to the center of the}} impact to minimize corruption of the data from edge effects and survive the impact. We chose to develop a non-contact “pseudo” confocal intensity sensor, which demonstrated resolution comparable with conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors combined with high survivability and low cost. A second sensor was developed based on “fiber Bragg gratings” (FBG) to enable a more detailed analysis of the effects of the impact, although requiring contact with the target the low weight and very small contact area of the FBG had minimal effect on the dynamics of the target. The FBG was mounted either on the surface of the target or tangentially between a fixed location. The output signals from the FBG were interrogated in time by a new method. Measurements were made on carbon fiber composite plates in the LGG and <b>on</b> low velocity <b>impact</b> tests. The particle momentum for the low velocity impact tests was chosen to be similar to that of the particles used in the LGG.|$|R
