5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} want to appear <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E

Mannix characterised Kulongoski as a strong tax and spender after he endorsed a proposed 313 million dollar income tax rise to avoid cuts in education and other areas. He also attacked Kulongoski for being <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> crime. A poll in October showed Kulongoski on 45%, only 4 percent ahead of Mannix on 41%.|$|E

However many, including the King Christian X, considered Munch to be too <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> defence to hold this position during a time of crisis. But Munch stayed put, and loyally - indeed ironically, given his own bleak assessment of the feasibility of any territorial defence—oversaw the largest peacetime mobilisation in Danish history, as it had been envisaged in the Defence Bill of 1909.|$|E
25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E

Khánh was in a quandary, as he could be perceived as being too <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> Diệm supporters, or being vindictive towards Roman Catholics. To placate Trí Quang, Khánh agreed to remove all Roman Catholic chaplains from the military. Khánh sentenced Major Đặng Sỹ, the Roman Catholic officer who had overseen the Huế Vesak shootings of Buddhist protesting Diệm's ban on the Buddhist flag on 8 May 1963 to a life sentence of hard labour, and sentenced Diệm's younger brother, Ngô Đình Cẩn, the de facto warlord of central Vietnam, to death. This occurred over the private objections of U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who {{thought that it was}} best for Khánh to take a mild line to dampen religious tensions. Cẩn was executed by firing squad on 9 May. Thích Trí Quang remained critical of what he saw as a lack of vigour on the part of Khánh in removing Diệmists from positions of authority.|$|E

In 1989, she attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, where Pakistan was re-admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations. Bhutto attempted to improve relations with neighbouring India, harking back to the Simla Accords. Bhutto claimed that she terminated support for Sikh separatists active in India, something which Zia had encouraged to destabilise Indian control in the Punjab. After being accused of being <b>soft</b> <b>on</b> India, she took a harder line against Pakistan's neighbour, particularly on the Kashmir conflict. In 1990, she made a speech in which she incited Kashmiri Muslims to rise up against their administration, and in interviews expressed support for the Kashmiri Muslim community. In 1990, Major General Pervez Musharraf proposed a military invasion of Kargil as part of an attempt to annex Kashmir; Bhutto refused to back the plan, believing that the international condemnation would be severe.|$|E
