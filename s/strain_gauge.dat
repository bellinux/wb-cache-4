25|$|A <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the strain of an object. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its {{electrical}} resistance to change. The <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> was invented in 1936 by Edward E. Simmons, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and re-invented in 1938 by Arthur C. Ruge, an earthquake specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E
25|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>gauge,</b> {{invented by}} Edward E. Simmons and Arthur C. Ruge in 1938, {{is a type}} of {{resistor}} that changes value with applied strain. A single resistor may be used, or a pair (half bridge), or four resistors connected in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The strain resistor is bonded with adhesive to an object that is subjected to mechanical strain. With the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> and a filter, amplifier, and analog/digital converter, the strain on an object can be measured.|$|E
25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can {{serve as the basis}} for defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a <b>strain</b> <b>gauge,</b> or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E

Work describes problems connected with using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> as temperature compensation and requirements for accurate voltage reference and summarize function and wiring of chaep digital scales using four <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Result of work is design of an electrical circuit for weigh measurement using four <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> from analyzed scale...|$|R
30|$|Strains of the {{longitudinal}} and shear reinforcing bars {{was measured by}} using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> during the tests. The location of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> is presented in Fig.  1. Strain distribution of concrete was obtained at top, mid-height, {{and bottom of the}} beam using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{printing}} strain sensors directly on tensile test specimens using inkjet printing technology. This type of <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{has the advantage}} over conventional <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> that no glue or carrying platelet is present between the sensor and the surface that should be measured. Therefore, strains in thin foils can possibly be measured with printed <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b> First, proof of principle is given in this paper by successfully printing <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> on FR 4. The printed <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> prove to behave linearly up to strains of 0. 2 % and can measure the strains within 3. 5 % accuracy...|$|R
500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{load cells}} {{are the most}} common in industry. These load cells are {{particularly}} stiff, have very good resonance values, and tend to have long life cycles in application. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauge</b> load cells work on the principle that the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> (a planar resistor) deforms/stretches/contracts when the material of the load cells deforms appropriately. These values are extremely small and are relational to the stress and/or strain that the material load cell is undergoing at the time. The change in resistance of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> provides an electrical value change that is calibrated to the load placed on the load cell.|$|E

30|$|To {{actively}} {{regulate the}} ankle impedance, torque and angle feedbacks are required. The prototype {{is equipped with}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> mounted to the foot, which can be correlated to the external torques and {{will be used in}} our future work for impedance modulation of the prototype. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are commonly used in load cells to measure the strains in structures due to external forces. The <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> change the resistance as they stretch or contract, and their change in resistance is correlated to the strain of the object they are attached to and consequentially the force or torque applied to the object. <b>Strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are typically wired in a Wheatstone bridge configuration using four <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (some of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> can be replaced by resistors). The increase or decrease in resistance of two of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (placed in opposite sides of the bridge) causes the output voltage of the bridge to increase or decrease, respectively. The opposite is also true for the other two <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> where the increase or decrease in resistance decreases or increases the output voltage of the bridge, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{method is}} the least {{accurate}} method of measuring chamber pressure using equipment, but {{has the advantage of}} being the least expensive and requires no permanent modifications to the firearm. [...] A <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is attached to the barrel just forward of the chamber. Upon firing, the barrel stretches briefly, and this stretch is measured by the gauge. [...] This method is generally reserved as a way of relatively comparing different cartridge loads as the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> reading is not as accurate as a copper crusher or Piezo test.|$|E

40|$|Vibration-based damage {{detection}} (VBDD) methods {{are used to}} detect damage in structural members non-evasively. This investigation began with two objectives: to prove a VBDD method could detect damage using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> both analytically and experimentally, and to then use that method to determine the distance from a damaged area that <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> could be effective. Work began simultaneously using finite element software and physical experiments. It was determined that a VBDD method could detect damage with <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> in both settings.

50|$|When MIT {{released}} {{the right to}} Ruge's invention, saying that, while “interesting,” the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> didn’t show much potential, he immediately went about commercializing it. Only then did he discover that his <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> had already been invented the year before by Edward E. Simmons, an electrical engineer at Caltech. Though the Simmons {{was the first to}} invent the resistance wire <b>strain</b> <b>gauge,</b> both men are credited with the discovery and share the original patent. The trade name of the device, SR-4, which stands for “Simmons Ruge - 4 people,” acknowledges both men and indicates that four people (Simmons, Ruge and their respective assistants) were responsible for its realization5.|$|E
50|$|In {{any case}} {{it is a good}} {{engineering}} practice to keep the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive low enough to avoid the self heating of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge.</b> The self heating of the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> depends on its mechanical characteristic (large strain gauges are less prone to self heating). Low voltage drive levels of the bridge reduce the sensitivity of the overall system.|$|E
50|$|The {{piezoresistive effect}} of {{semiconductor}} materials can be several orders of magnitudes {{larger than the}} geometrical effect and is present in materials like germanium, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon carbide, and single crystal silicon. Hence, semiconductor <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> with a very high coefficient of sensitivity can be built. For precision measurements they {{are more difficult to}} handle than metal <b>strain</b> <b>gauges,</b> because semiconductor <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are generally more sensitive to environmental conditions (esp. temperature).|$|R
50|$|Most cycling power meters use <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{to measure}} torque applied, and when {{combined}} with angular velocity, calculate power. Power meters using <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> are mounted in the bottom bracket, rear freehub, or crankset. Certain newer devices do not use <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> and instead measure power through handlebar-mounted units that utilize the principles of Newton's Third Law by measuring a cyclist's opposing forces (gravity, wind resistance, inertia, rolling resistance) and combining these with velocity to determine the rider's power output.|$|R
5000|$|However, most {{commercial}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> utilise resistors {{made from}} materials that demonstrate a strong piezoresistive effect. The resistivity {{of these materials}} changes with strain, accounting for the first term of the defining equation above. In constantan <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> (the most commercially popular), the effect accounts for 20% of the gauge factor, but in silicon gauges, {{the contribution of the}} piezoresistive term is much larger than the geometric terms.

50|$|In {{biological}} measurements, especially {{blood flow}} and tissue swelling, a variant called mercury-in-rubber <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is used. This kind of <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> {{consists of a}} small amount of liquid mercury enclosed in a small rubber tube, which is applied around e.g., a toe or leg. Swelling of the body part results in stretching of the tube, making it both longer and thinner, which increases electrical resistance.|$|E
50|$|The acoustoelastic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is an ultrasound-based tissue {{evaluation}} {{technique that}} relates echo intensity {{changes that are}} observed during the stretching or relaxation tendons to the mechanical properties of the tissue. The method deduces stiffness gradient (the rate of change of normalized stiffness {{as a function of}} tissue strain) by evaluating the ultrasound dynamic images that are captured from tissue as it gradually deforms. Acoustoelastic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> has been shown to accurately model stiffness and strain within tendons in vitro. To determine the repeatability and feasibility of in vivo ASG measurements of canine tendon function, stiffness gradients for the gastrocnemius tendons of dogs were recorded. Findings indicate that acoustoelastic <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is a repeatable and feasible technique for measuring stiffness gradients in canine tendons.|$|E
5000|$|Humidity - If {{the wires}} {{connecting}} the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance. This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate {{to which the}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the <b>strain</b> <b>gauge.</b> For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone {{to this type of}} error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain gauges wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain gauges with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.|$|E
30|$|The {{places on}} the {{experimental}} models where the <b>strain</b> <b>gauges</b> were applied were represented as coordinate points on the FEA models, and the strain in the FEA models was calculated by dividing the change in length between before and after loading by {{the length of the}} <b>strain</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the forces that were measured by different instrumentation systems during a number of ship collisions with bergy bits is presented. Three types of instruments were used to measure ship impact forces: an inertial measurement system called MOTAN, a 5. 4 m 2 <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area and a 3. 5 m 2 external Impact Panel. Forces on the Impact Panel were consistently lower than forces on the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area, for different impacts. The maximum force on the Impact Panel was 1. 2 MN, and the highest force on the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area was 5. 1 MN. Forces from MOTAN are calculated using two different approaches; one requires information about where the impact occurred, and the other does not. The agreement in forces from MOTAN and the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area or Impact Panel depended upon how completely the hull instrumentation captured the loaded area. When the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area provided good coverage of the loaded area (7 impacts), forces from MOTAN were from 17 % lower to 33 % higher than forces on the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area, if the impact location was {{used to calculate the}} forces. When the impact location was not used in the calculation, forces from MOTAN were up to 120 % higher than forces on the <b>strain</b> <b>gauged</b> area. The four most significant impacts to the Impact Panel, all of which extended beyond the Panel's sensing area, indicated that forces from MOTAN were from 11 % lower to 233 % higher than forces on the Impact Panel.
