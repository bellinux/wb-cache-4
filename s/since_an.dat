5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. <b>Since</b> <b>an</b> effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel undoubtedly descended from a distinguished family, <b>since</b> <b>an</b> unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, he must have been born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E

5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. <b>Since</b> <b>an</b> electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E

5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used meter reading and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin.

5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags <b>since</b> <b>an</b> earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active <b>since</b> <b>an</b> earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor.

5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, <b>since</b> <b>an</b> observation station was {{located on the}} island.

In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired.
