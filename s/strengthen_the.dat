5|$|A purely non-socialist, conservative-led {{cabinet of}} Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was {{appointed}} on 27 November. The nomination {{was both a}} long-term aim of the conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main goals were to separate Finland from Russia, <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> military power of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least {{a part of the}} Parliament's new power to the Senate.|$|E

Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E

5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of the few remaining Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted raids on Parliamentary forces in the region, representing a continuing challenge. No action had been taken, however, to <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{undertook}} {{a number of}} educational agendas, such as increasing the funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health in his first years of office, and creating education programs to <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students.

The change of ’ä > ě and ä > a {{took place at the}} end of the 12th century.|$|R
5|$|However, the U.S. did {{not have}} enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air.

The Navy ordered several ironclad warships from shipyards in Britain and France, though {{the program was}} limited by the Ottoman Empire's restricted finances.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} royal charter of 28 April 1472, King James III ordered the {{demolition}} of houses built on or outside the King's Wall, which were hampering efforts to <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> defences.

5|$|Ivan Alexander's {{rule was}} also marked by efforts to <b>strengthen</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church by pursuing heretics and Jews.
