25|$|In {{the normal}} mode {{descriptions}} of Schumann resonances, the fundamental mode is a standing wave in the Earth–ionosphere cavity with a wavelength {{equal to the}} circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 7.83Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly {{from a variety of}} factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which compresses the upper wall of the closed cavity. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5Hz intervals, a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity. The 8th partial lies at approximately 60Hz.|$|E

30|$|However, radar scatter may {{not always}} be isotropic, and could even be {{anisotropic}} (possibly due to wind-shear effects and production of quasi-specular reflectors), thus leading to narrower spectra. For this reason we also carefully determined the <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> associated with the echoes, and used wide <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> as a proxy for enhanced turbulence. In general, <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> were quite wide for category I echo layers, so that in the main the association of these echoes with turbulence seems justifiable.|$|R

In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope {{represents the}} location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the Doppler effect resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical carrier has a frequency expressed as ...|$|E
50|$|Using this equation, {{the minimum}} pulse {{duration}} {{can be calculated}} consistent with the measured laser <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> For the HeNe laser with a 1.5-GHz <b>spectral</b> <b>width,</b> the shortest Gaussian pulse consistent with this <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> would be around 300 picoseconds; for the 128-THz bandwidth Ti:sapphire laser, this <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> would be only 3.4 femtoseconds. These values represent the shortest possible Gaussian pulses consistent with the laser's linewidth; in a real mode-locked laser, the actual pulse duration depends on many other factors, such as the actual pulse shape, and the overall dispersion of the cavity.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{moment is}} called the Doppler width [...] It {{corresponds}} to the variance of the Doppler spectrum. The Doppler width basically {{is a measure of}} the width of the spectrum of the detected velocities. It can also be a measure of the number of modes the targets size distribution has. A mono-modal distribution gives a small <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> A distribution that has several modes yields a lager <b>spectral</b> <b>width,</b> as illustrated in Figure 5. The <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> is also influenced by turbulent motion of the targets in the sample volume: the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> increases with increasing turbulence.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{temporal}} phasor the Fourier {{transformation of}} spectra {{can be used}} to make phasor. Considering a Gaussian spectrum with zero <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> and changing the emission maximum from channel zero to K the phasor rotates on a circle from small angles to larger angles. This corresponds to shift theorem of Fourier transformation. Changing the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> from zero to infinity moves the phasor toward center.

40|$|We {{show that}} at low {{pressures}} the <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> {{of the power}} spectra of laser-trapped particles are nearly independent from pressures and, due to the nonlinearities of the trap, reflect the thermal distribution of particles. In the experiments with nanoparticles trapped in an optical lattice, we identify two distinct features of the widths. First, the widths along an optical lattice are much broader {{than those in the}} other directions. Second, the <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> are narrower for larger nanoparticles. We develop a theory of thermal broadening and show that the <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> normalized by the frequencies of the center-of-mass motion directly reveal the ratio of the thermal energy to the trap depth. The presented model provides a good understanding of the observed features. Our model holds also for smaller particles such as atoms and molecules and can be readily extended to the general case with a single-beam optical trap. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
