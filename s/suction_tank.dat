Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high <b>suction,</b> <b>tank</b> treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mineral}} industry, {{or in the}} {{extraction}} of oilsand, froth is generated to separate the rich minerals or bitumen from the sand and clays. Froth contains air that tends to block conventional pumps and cause loss of prime. Over history, industry has developed different {{ways to deal with}} this problem. In the pulp and paper industry holes are drilled in the impeller. Air escapes {{to the back of the}} impeller and a special expeller discharges the air back to the <b>suction</b> <b>tank.</b> The impeller may also feature special small vanes between the primary vanes called split vanes or secondary vanes. Some pumps may feature a large eye, an inducer or recirculation of pressurized froth from the pump discharge back to the suction to break the bubbles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuel for}} the engine is usually held in a metal or plastic fuel tank, shaped so that fuel is drawn from the outside edge of the tank, as the fuel tends to be thrown to the side by {{centrifugal}} force as the airplane travels in a circle. A [...] "clunk tank" [...] as used in R/C is satisfactory, but dedicated tanks with wedge-shaped cross-sections are frequently used and tend to have better characteristics as the fuel runs out. A tank with a vent on the inner edge, or multiple vents, is usually called a 'suction' tank. The pressure of fuel delivery with a <b>suction</b> <b>tank</b> changes as the fuel runs out, causing the engine mixture ratio to become leaner as the flight proceeds. Tanks vented to only permit air to enter at the outside edge ("uniflow" [...] tanks) provide constant fuel pressure over {{the duration of the}} flight and a constant mixture ratio.|$|E
500|$|The [...] lake still {{provides}} [...] {{of drinking}} water each year, but also acts as a fishing lake. It provides a habitat {{for a range of}} flora and fauna and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The original <b>suction</b> <b>tanks,</b> which formed the water supply for the steam boilers powering the pumping engines, are now used for trout rearing.|$|R
5|$|The lake is {{well known}} for trout fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 rowing boats for hire. The <b>suction</b> <b>tanks</b> which {{originally}} supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred into the lake. On average 50,000 trout are reared at Blagdon each year by Bristol Water to stock this and surrounding lakes such as Chew Valley Lake and the Barrow Tanks.|$|R
30|$|If the {{pressures}} in tanks A and B are P A =  0.053  atm and P B =  0.046  atm, respectively, {{for increasing the}} pressure and ammonia concentration in tank B, the compressor suction valve in this tank is opened. However, the compressor does not start working. Vaporized ammonia from tank A flows into tank B because of the concentration difference, and thus, the ammonia gas pressure in tank B increases. When the ammonia gas pressure in tank A increases, the compressor begins to work; hence, the gas pressure in tank A is ensured to decrease. During this period, the compressor is running, and the compressor <b>suction</b> on <b>tank</b> B side is closed {{in order to prevent}} the flow of ammonia gas from tank B to the compressor suction line. When the pressure in tank A decreases to 0.043  atm, the compressor is stopped, and the opening compressor <b>suction</b> on <b>tank</b> B side is opened to ensure that ammonia gas flows to tank B.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{test of a}} flow {{deflector}} gate used for controlling the flow deviation toward the primary tank in a flow-meter calibration facility is presented. The deflector gate is pneumatically controlled and permits the flow conduction to either the <b>suction</b> <b>tank</b> or to the primary tank. The deflector is designed to approximately compensate the flow deficit towards the primary tank during the opening, with the flow excess while in the shutting process. Numerical simulations are performed to study the flow hydrodynamics during the deflector operation. Results are compared to experimental data, and used to improve the gate design. The enhanced design proved to guarantee the uniformity of the flow through the calibration section and the dramatic reduction of the error in volume measurement during calibration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} the Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) for the {{centrifugal}} pump in a simple pipeline system has been carried out eliminating water hammer. Both the experimental tests and numerical calculations were performed in this study to investigate the transient flow effects when the discharges change abruptly in the system. The phenomenon of transient flow is generally occurred when the sudden opening of the downstream valves are used in the pumping station or due to introducing additional parallel branches of pipelines that contain pumps. Experimentally, two operational tests with different NPSH were conducted to show the relations between the head (H) and discharge (Q). The results of these tests showed two different types of H-Q curves. The first test produced a flat H-Q curve when the water surface level in the <b>suction</b> <b>tank</b> was 4 m above the center line of the pump. While in the second test the operational case created a steep H-Q curve when the pump was used to lift 6 m from the <b>suction</b> <b>tank.</b> That is likely happened due to the decrease in a cut-off discharge point. The numerical calculations on hypothec simple pipeline system have been done for the transient flow after determining the shape of the characteristics H-Q curves produced from the experimental tests. The Darcy-Waysbach equation was used to calculate the friction losses and obtain the system resistance curve. The classical method of characteristics, which is based on the methodological analysis of the finite difference method, was executed to propagate the wave pressure in each cases examined. The numerical results were clearly showed that the wave pressure produced in the pipeline system with the flat H-Q curve is smaller than that produced in the pipeline with the steep H-Q curve. This means that the first case is significantly reduced the possibility of occurrence the water hammer phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} study investigates {{the performance of}} an updraft gasifier for a water pump powered by a small engine. The main components of the system are a 0. 0793 m 3 updraft gasifier, a cooling coil tube, a 0. 050 m 3 gas tank and a gas mixer. The proposed gasifier system is modified to prevent corrosion by covering {{the inside of the}} steel gasifier cover with fireproof cement. A HONDA GX 120 gasoline engine and a water pump (MOKRO MK 39 model) are used. Dried wood (5 kg), charcoal (5 kg) and gasoline are fuels in the experiments. The experiments are to identify a suitable fuel used with and without the gasifier in terms of the shortest time required to pump 5 -liter water from a <b>suction</b> <b>tank</b> to a discharge tank with a water head of 13 m. The engine speed to drive the water pump is maintained at approximately 2500 rpm. The engine speeds, the lengths of time to pump out 5 -liter water and the fuel consumption are observed and documented. The flow rates of the dried wood, charcoal and gasoline under study are respectively 0. 000134 ± 2. 4 x 10 - 6, 0. 000130 ± 4. 21 x 10 - 7 and 0. 00017 ± 4. 22 x 10 - 7 m 3 /s, while their respective power of fluid flow are 17. 1 ± 0. 35, 16. 7 ± 0. 54 and 22. 01 ± 0. 05 W. Their specific energy consumption levels are 0. 45 ± 0. 0081, 0. 46 ± 0. 0151 and 0. 0180 ± 0. 000045 MJ/liter, respectively...|$|E

50|$|A tank bag is {{a storage}} {{compartment}} {{attached to the}} top of the gas tank. Many mounting options exist, with straps and/or magnets being the most common. Other options include rigid collars that bolt to the tank around the fuel filler cap, a large pad fastened to the gas tank which serves as a mounting point for the bag using zippers or straps, and <b>suction</b> cups. Most <b>tank</b> bags are designed to be quickly removed to facilitate refueling.|$|R
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the ammonia gas pressure in tank B increases when ammonia flows into the tank after the compressor <b>suction</b> valve on <b>tank</b> B side is opened. During the ammonia gas transfer from tank A to tank B, nitrogen gas is discharged from the ammonia discharge point {{at the bottom of}} tank B. This nitrogen gas results from the purging using nitrogen in tank B. In this manner, a large pressure increase in tank B is prevented by discharging nitrogen gas.|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{increase}} in the pressure of ammonia gas in tank A, the compressor <b>suction</b> valve of <b>tank</b> B opens, and thus, the entire amount of ammonia gas enters tank B from tank A. When the compressor suction valve is open, the compressor does not run, because the ammonia gas, which is vaporized in tank A and passed to tank B, can decrease the ammonia gas concentration in tank B. The main principle in this process is {{the increase}} in the ammonia concentration in tank B.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of {{computational fluid dynamics}} methods {{to the analysis of}} mixing in the high level waste tanks at the Savannah River Site requires a demonstration that the computer codes can properly represent the behavior of fluids in the tanks. The motive force for mixing the tanks is a set of jet pumps taking <b>suction</b> from the <b>tank</b> fluid and discharging turbulent jets {{near the bottom of the}} tank. The work described here focuses on the free turbulent jet in water as the simplest case of jet behavior for which data could be found in the open literature. Calculations performed with both CFDS-FLOW 3 D and FLUENT were compared with data as well as classical jet theory. Results showed both codes agreed reasonably well with each other and with the data, but that results were sensitive to the computational mesh and, to a lesser degree, the selection of turbulence models...|$|R
