By 1974 production of raw steel reach 958,000 tons and net sales reached $283.4 million. Huston Jr. retired that year ending the family dynasty since 1810. The following year the mill equipped four enormous electric furnaces that phased out the open-hearth furnaces. Economic problems hit the company hard in the late 70’s. High energy costs, interest rates, and employment costs as well as competition from other metals and cheap imported material put a decrease on net income from 4.2% to 1.3% and plates sales dropped from 11% to 8%.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous casting, {{also called}} <b>strand</b> <b>casting,</b> {{is the process}} whereby molten metal is {{solidified}} into a [...] "semifinished" [...] billet, bloom, or slab for subsequent rolling in the finishing mills. Prior {{to the introduction of}} continuous casting in the 1950s, steel was poured into stationary molds to form ingots. Since then, [...] "continuous casting" [...] has evolved to achieve improved yield, quality, productivity and cost efficiency. It allows lower-cost production of metal sections with better quality, due to the inherently lower costs of continuous, standardised production of a product, as well as providing increased control over the process through automation. This process is used most frequently to cast steel (in terms of tonnage cast). Aluminium and copper are also continuously cast.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{induced flow}} {{as a means}} to control {{solidification}} structures in strand cast steel is investigated. The quality problems in strand cast steel stemming from columnar growth can be partially controlled, by Electro Magnetic Stirring (EMS). Induced flow changes the normal morphology of dendrites. Solids grown under intense stirring conditions show both negative and positive segregation which is considered unacceptable by some steel producers. The inclusion size and population is strongly affected by induced flow (EMS). Laboratory and industrial data show substantial reduction in inclusion size and content, but the overall effect of flow on inclusions is affected by the particular type of flow patterns utilized in each case. Productivity and quality are raised substantially in steel <b>strand</b> <b>casting</b> by utilizing EMS...|$|E
40|$|Transverse cracks {{present on}} the surface of continuously-cast semis prior to rolling often cause {{undesirable}} imperfections on rolled product. Such cracks can occur on all types of <b>strand</b> <b>cast</b> product; billets, blooms, slabs, rounds, and beam blanks. Transverse cracks range in severity from those that are short, thin and hard to find on a scaled surface to those that are long, gross and readily apparent. A typical fine transverse crack found on the broadface of a slab after cold machine-scarfing, is shown in Figure 1. Although not a rule, transverse cracks often occur at or near as-cast corners...|$|R

40|$|Lightweight self-consolidating {{concrete}} (LWSCC) is {{a relatively}} recent advancement in concrete technology. The reduced dead load from lightweight concrete is beneficial for precast elements and for elements where dead load is {{a significant portion of}} the total load, such as prestressed bridge girders. Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a specially proportioned concrete mixture that consolidates under its own weight without the need for vibration. The combination of lightweight concrete and self-consolidating behavior provides the benefits of both. Bond of prestressing steel has been a much debated topic since the 1950 s. Limited data are available on the transfer and development length of <b>strands</b> <b>cast</b> in SCC and even less for <b>strands</b> <b>cast</b> in LWSCC. The differences in material properties resulting from the lightweight coarse aggregate and mix proportioning used for LWSCC have potential to lead to longer transfer and development lengths than those for conventional concrete, which can be detrimental to shear and flexural performance. The transfer and development length equations provided in the ACI Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and AASHTO Bridge Design specifications are based on studies performed using conventional concrete. This research project examined the transfer and development length of LWSCC specimens using 0. 6 in. (15. 2 mm) Grade 270 prestressing strand. Four specimens were cast from each mixture consisting of a combination of expanded clay, expanded shale, or limestone aggregate and a compressive strength of 4000 psi or 6000 psi (28 MPa or 41 MPa) at prestress release. Results were compared between the mixtures, to the code equations, and to previous research. The bond performance of LWSCC with a release strength of 6000 psi (41 MPa) was very similar to normal weight SCC, the transfer lengths for both strength levels were accurately predicted by the code equations, and the measured development lengths were significantly less than those predicted...|$|R

50|$|Three of the {{familiar}} favourites in the Aldwych team took roles in the new production alongside Lynn: Robertson Hare, a figure of harassed respectability, Mary Brough, famous for her eccentric old ladies, and Winifred Shotter, the leading lady. The public had grown used to farces written specially for the company by Ben Travers, and critics noted that the parts in the new piece were not tailor-made for Hare and Brough as Travers's characters always were. The play had already been seen in London in Maltby's translation, in a production at the Strand Theatre in 1929. On that occasion it was given under the title Azaïs and was less anglicised than the version presented at the Aldwych. One member of the <b>Strand</b> <b>cast</b> was recruited for the Aldwych production, Clive Morton, who reprised his character, the Viscount de Langeais, though renamed La Coste.|$|R

The <b>Strand</b> <b>cast</b> was put together from former members of an early Berkeley group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio, who, in 1979, attracted many of the older performers from Berkeley.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the cast strands’ primary structure {{is a very complex}} process in terms of the thermodynamics and physicochemical. It occurs during solidification and crystallization of the liquid steel in the crystallizer and in the secondary cooling zone of the CC device. On the basis of the experience gained in the industry and knowledge arising from theory of metals and alloys solidification it can be concluded, that substantial influence on the shape of <b>cast</b> <b>strands</b> primary structure have the temperature of overheating of the liquid steel above liquidus temperature and solidification velocity. A proper control of those casting parameters allows to obtain the <b>cast</b> <b>strands</b> with desired primary structure. In the one and two-way symmetric devices regulation like this is not problematic, in the multi-way devices - specially in the asymmetric - causes a series of problems. In those devices can occur a major temperature difference in each outlet zone of the tundish working space caused by i. e. the distance length diversity of liquid steel stream from the inlet to each outlet and by disadvantageous layout of liquid steel flow zones (turbulent flow zone, plug flow and dead zones) in working area of tundish.

40|$|The overall {{service life}} of {{concrete}} structures {{can be divided}} into corrosion initiation and corrosion propagation phases. The durations of these two phases depend on the chloride threshold (Clth) and corrosion rate (icorr), respectively, of the embedded steel reinforcement. Quantitative information on Clth and icorr of conventional steel reinforcement are available in literature. Now‑a‑days, the use of prestressed concrete elements are rapidly increasing and there is a dire need for estimating their service life. Quantitative information on the Clth and icorr of prestressing steel are required for this estimation. However, very limited quantitative information is available on these parameters. As such, the current practice is to assume that both conventional and prestressing steels have similar Clth and icorr – which might result in unrealistic estimations. This paper provides data on icorr obtained from a 9 -month long experimental program. The icorr data was obtained using linear polarization resistance (LPR) tests on prestressing wire embedded in mortar. 10 specimens (made using the center king-wires obtained from 7 -wire <b>strands)</b> were <b>cast,</b> cured, and subjected to a cyclic wet-dry exposure using 3. 5 % sodium chloride solution.

40|$|By {{a special}} {{plastometric}} method, the straightening {{operation of a}} vertically <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> of two carbon steels was simulated. The temperature dependence of the low strain rate plasticity of both the steels examined is analogous although caused by very different reasons.

To avoid transverse cracking, it seems to be suitable to keep the strand at a rather high temperature (above 900 degrees C). Temperature cycling seems to be fundamental as to the structural changes taking place in the strand (grain size refining, ferrite fraction if any), whereas analogous influences of straining are more or less inexpressive.
