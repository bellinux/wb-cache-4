5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms <b>such</b> as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified {{to make them more}} useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs <b>such</b> as antibiotics or industrial chemicals <b>such</b> as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species <b>such</b> as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites <b>such</b> as glutathione and enzymes <b>such</b> as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|A user resists contact {{beyond the}} Internet, <b>such</b> as by {{telephone}} or personal visit, often claiming bizarre {{reasons for not}} being able to accept <b>such</b> contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists <b>such</b> as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands <b>such</b> as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists <b>such</b> as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists <b>such</b> as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E
5|$|According to beliefs {{derived from}} fusui (feng shui), the fox's power over evil is <b>such</b> that a mere {{statue of a}} fox can dispel the evil kimon, or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, <b>such</b> as the famous Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, feature <b>such</b> statues, {{sometimes}} large numbers of them.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by mammals <b>such</b> as the feral cat (Felis catus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes), {{as well as}} rodent species, and native predatory birds, <b>such</b> as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), and {{reptiles}} <b>such</b> as goannas (Varanus spp.).|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera leaves contain phytochemicals {{under study}} for {{possible}} bioactivity, <b>such</b> as acetylated mannans, polymannans, anthraquinone C-glycosides, anthrones, other anthraquinones, <b>such</b> as emodin and various lectins.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds <b>such</b> as the Arctic tern, insects <b>such</b> as the monarch butterfly and fish <b>such</b> as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E

5|$|As <b>such,</b> language, as {{a social}} product, {{literally}} structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, <b>such</b> as Michel Foucault.|$|E
5|$|Assessments of Sorabji's music vary widely. While some, <b>such</b> as {{the pianist}} John Ogdon and the organist Kevin Bowyer, speak {{of him as}} {{comparable}} to <b>such</b> composers as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and Messiaen, others dismiss him altogether. Reviews of concerts featuring Sorabji's music tend to be similarly mixed, some reviewers elevating him to the ranks of figures <b>such</b> as Debussy, and others describing his music as vacuous.|$|E
5|$|Because of the breeds {{that make}} up the Azteca, they are known for their athleticism. They have been seen in {{competition}} in western riding events <b>such</b> as reining, cutting, team penning and roping, as well as English riding events <b>such</b> as dressage and other events <b>such</b> as polo and bullfighting. They are also used for pleasure riding.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the short}} {{distances}} of sprinting events, factors <b>such</b> as an athlete's reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities <b>such</b> as pace, race tactics and endurance become more so.|$|E
5|$|Birds <b>such</b> as partridges, {{pheasants}} and ducks, {{and mammals}} <b>such</b> as deer and wild boar, {{are among the}} terrestrial game animals most often hunted for sport and for food.|$|E

5|$|Both {{intraspecific}} competition, {{with features}} <b>such</b> as sexual conflict and sexual selection, and interspecific competition, <b>such</b> as between predators, {{may be able}} to drive coevolution.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) <b>such</b> as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) <b>such</b> as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) <b>such</b> as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular brachytherapy) {{for the treatment of}} coronary in-stent restenosis.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{preparations}} of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and {{can include}} additional ingredients <b>such</b> as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses <b>such</b> as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans <b>such</b> as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms <b>such</b> as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens <b>such</b> as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from {{a few hours to}} a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} {{is an alternative}} explanation for why organisms <b>such</b> as coral reef fish and benthic marine invertebrates <b>such</b> as sponges and nudibranchs have come to resemble each other.|$|E
5|$|Critics of Eragon often {{point out}} its {{similarities}} to other works <b>such</b> as Earthsea, Dragonlance, and Star Wars. Reviewers have also called the book a notable achievement for <b>such</b> a young author as Paolini.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic or {{therapeutic}} {{manipulation of}} the airway (<b>such</b> as bronchoscopy, laser therapy or stenting of the bronchi) may intermittently interfere {{with the ability to}} breathe; intubation may be necessary in <b>such</b> situations.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with groups <b>such</b> as Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} {{an array of}} more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands <b>such</b> as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal <b>such</b> as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands <b>such</b> as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands <b>such</b> as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, <b>such</b> as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages <b>such</b> as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, <b>such</b> as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E

5|$|Even where metal objects <b>such</b> as {{bowls and}} dishes {{do not seem}} to have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, <b>such</b> as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns <b>such</b> as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, <b>such</b> as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. <b>Such</b> probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes <b>such</b> as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, <b>such</b> as specific heat and measuring transport via thermal and heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, <b>such</b> as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, <b>such</b> as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement <b>such</b> as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories <b>such</b> as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|Films {{produced}} under <b>such</b> censorship {{could only}} introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, <b>such</b> {{as in the}} cult horror film White Zombie.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{appear in}} human culture in <b>such</b> diverse forms as flea circuses, poems like John Donne's erotic The Flea, works of music <b>such</b> as by Modest Mussorgsky, and a film by Charlie Chaplin.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, <b>such</b> as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes <b>such</b> as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, <b>such</b> as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, <b>such</b> as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects <b>such</b> as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. <b>Such</b> impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes <b>such</b> as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, Dark Forces provides physical obstacles for the character, <b>such</b> as jumping from ledges or traversing across flowing rivers, and includes multi-step puzzles <b>such</b> as mazes controlled by switches.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the Baths of Zeuxippus were also close (most probably adjacent) to the Great Palace grounds. This evidences their popularity, as <b>such</b> a location would have attracted many people, being in <b>such</b> great proximity to <b>such</b> significant places. The {{square of the}} Augustaeum and the basilica of Hagia Sophia were also close to the Baths.|$|E
