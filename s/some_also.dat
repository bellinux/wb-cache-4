5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, <b>some</b> <b>also</b> show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would be deployed on an enduring basis in Eastern Europe, mainly in Estonia with <b>some</b> <b>also</b> being deployed to Poland.

5|$|Lactarius {{is mainly}} {{known from the}} north {{temperate}} zone, but some species also occur in tropical Asia and Africa. Lactifluus has a more tropical distribution than Lactarius, with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but <b>some</b> <b>also</b> occurring in the north temperate zone. Multifurca is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects {{distinguish}} three tenses: present, past, and future, and two aspects: perfective and imperfective. Some varieties add progressive or habitual aspects.

5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; <b>some</b> <b>also</b> worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
5|$|Settlements were a type {{of rural}} {{locality}} that first appeared in Adygea during the Soviet times. Most were established by migrant peasants from outside of Adygea, although <b>some</b> <b>also</b> resulted from internal migration. Today, they are most common in the Belaya River valley near {{the foothills of the}} Caucasus Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 {{is rated}} well by car critics, who {{appreciate}} the car's {{interior and exterior}} design. In spite of comments regarding the DB9's weaker engine and handling, reviewers liked the car's ride and driving experience. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> held issue with the DB9's small rear seats, cargo space and poor satnav.|$|E

5|$|Achaea {{was now in}} turmoil, {{and some}} cities were close to revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E

5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1987, {{the militant}} youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan {{security}} forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. <b>Some</b> <b>also</b> function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.|$|E
5|$|Hassium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), three of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, have known metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but <b>some</b> <b>also</b> undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|In Leiden, the {{congregation}} gained {{the freedom to}} worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the Dutch language and customs, and <b>some</b> <b>also</b> entered the Dutch Army. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest William Brewster in 1618, after he published comments {{highly critical of the}} King of England and the Anglican Church. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred {{the congregation}} to move farther from England.|$|E
