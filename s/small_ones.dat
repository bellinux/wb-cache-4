In the city, there are 240 shops and stores, 70 service institutions andone big ready mix concrete factory 30 <b>small</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are no large {{settlements}} in the Kettle Creek watershed, although {{there are a number}} of <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> like Westport. There are also numerous seasonal camps in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5000|$|Auctioneer: He auctions {{horses in}} the market. At first he is angered that the boy brings <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> onto the stage and {{slightly}} embarrasses him. However, when the boy tells him what <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can do, the man changes his mind and is intrigued, especially when the boy tells him that <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is [...] "good enough {{to be in a}} King's stable". With that, he decides to have some fun. He mocks and almost injures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with his weight. But when <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> sees his best friend pushed aside, he regains his strength and throws the man off of his back. The auctioneer then chases them away.|$|R

50|$|The boy and {{his father}} take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with <b>small</b> sticks, since <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can't carry heavy loads any more. <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> even has trouble {{carrying}} stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him.|$|R
5|$|The {{average number}} of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in <b>small</b> <b>ones.</b> Lice have an {{aggregated}} distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.|$|E
5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E

50|$|Boy: He {{is about}} ten years old. Although he takes {{care of all the}} donkeys, <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is his favorite. When his father tells him to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> the boy is devastated. Soon he accepts it. Though he loves the donkey, he accepts what his father tells him. He assures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> will have a gentle and loving master and he does.|$|R

25|$|ESL in {{industrial}} capacitors is {{mainly caused by}} the leads and internal connections used to connect the plates to the outside world. Larger capacitors tend to higher ESL than <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> because the distances to the plate are longer and every millimeter increases inductance.|$|E
50|$|Independent and congregational churches {{exist in}} all larger towns and many <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> but most such churches are <b>small.</b> <b>One</b> {{of these is}} the confessional Lutheran Church called Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Germany.|$|R
50|$|Father: The boy's {{father is}} not seen much at all. He {{is the one who}} sends the boy to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One.</b> He loves his son and deep down, he loves <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> too, but he knows they cannot afford to keep a donkey that cannot carry a large load. He owes money to the Three Merchants, which may impact his {{decision}} to profit from <b>Small</b> <b>One's</b> gradual enfeeblement.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, the boy takes <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to {{the market}} in Nazareth. Unfortunately, nobody wants an old weak donkey but the tanner, and he only wants to kill <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to make leather out of his hide. After failing to find another buyer, {{the boy and his}} donkey return to the tanner's shop. The boy weeps, and <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> {{accepting}} his fate under the tanner's knife, tenderly consoles the boy.|$|R
25|$|A 'massive' {{formalization}} {{of property}} titles for small and medium rural properties. It {{is estimated that}} a fifth of all rural properties, and nearly half of <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> have title problems, a problem which prevents {{the existence of a}} real market for land and investments and which has facilitated land dispossession during the conflict.|$|E
25|$|A bass line {{typically}} {{consists of}} four or five musicians, each carrying one tuned bass drum, although variations do occur. Smaller lines are not uncommon in smaller groups, such as some high school marching bands, and several groups have had one musician playing more than one bass drum, usually <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> with one mounted on top of the other.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{population}} density levels exceeded those in Europe. China had more large cities but far fewer <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> than in contemporary Europe. The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750, before the Industrial Revolution. Revisionist scholarship, however, estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

Its role is to refer to a set of human individuals defined by the next word, in a similar way to English 'one' in the <b>small</b> <b>one(s).</b> mada can be described as a personal nominalizer. It does not involve definiteness or number.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no major}} mines {{operate in the}} {{southern}} ranges today, there are several large disused ones, and a myriad of <b>small</b> <b>ones.</b> An iron sulfide mine at Brukunga, northeast of Mount Barker, operated from 1955 to 1972, proving a valuable source {{for the production of}} superphosphate fertilisers vital for the postwar development of the State's outlying agricultural areas. The runoff from the mine unfortunately proved quite toxic for the local environment, and efforts have been underway since to alleviate the damage.|$|E
25|$|The area is Alberta’s {{refining}} and petrochemical centre – {{notably the}} “Industrial Heartland” northeast of Edmonton. That industrial region has grown organically {{since the late}} 1940s, when Imperial Oil brought a tin-pot World War II refinery down from Whitehorse to process crude from Leduc and the other new fields. Now the beneficiary of more than $25 billion in investment, this 582-square-kilometre region hosts 40 large companies and many <b>small</b> <b>ones.</b> Together they operate refineries and petrochemical plants, an upgrader, pipelines, service companies and numerous other interdependent businesses.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} excavation, two large hearths were found and many <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> as well. The remains of local animals were found, in {{addition}} to wooden posts from approximately twelve huts. Scraps of clothing made of hide were also found. This led archaeologists to estimate the population was around 20-30 inhabitants. A human footprint was {{also found in the}} clay, probably from a child. Inside the camp, archaeologists found a chunk of meat that still had preserved DNA. After a DNA analysis, it matched that of a gomphothere, indicating the type of food the inhabitants ate.|$|E
25|$|Stone tools, {{particularly}} projectile points (arrowheads) and scrapers, are {{the primary}} evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. Paleoindian bands probably moved their camps many times a year. Their camps were typically <b>small</b> <b>ones,</b> consisting of 20–50 people. Band organization was egalitarian, so there were no formal leaders and no social ranking or classes. Scientific evidence links indigenous Americans to Asian peoples, specifically eastern Siberian populations. Indigenous peoples of the Americas {{have been linked to}} Siberian populations by linguistic factors, the distribution of blood types, and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data, such as DNA.|$|E
