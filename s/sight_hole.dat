50|$|A {{coupling}} nut, {{also known}} as extension nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; <b>sight</b> <b>hole</b> coupling nuts, which have a <b>sight</b> <b>hole</b> for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|E
50|$|The {{relascope}} has a <b>sight</b> <b>hole</b> on {{the back}} and a clear window at the front to allow the user to sight through the tool. There are three light inlet holes which are used to light the scale. This {{is one of the major}} problems with the relascope, the way this instrument is designed it cannot be used when light is at a minimum. This is not a problem in a similar piece of equipment called the tele-relascope. This instrument differs from the relascope in that the tele-relascope is an electronic laser based version.|$|E

Pappus of Alexandria described it (in his commentary on the Almagest of that chapter), as did Proclus (Hypotyposis IV). It was a 4-foot rod with a scale, a <b>sighting</b> <b>hole</b> at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon.|$|R
50|$|B): Towers 3 and 4 {{were built}} in 1947, Towers 5 and 6 (northern-most), in 1947. They have the same brick inner shell and welded-steel outer shell {{construction}} as Towers 1 and 2, but are smaller. All four towers have an outer diameter of 22 ft and are 50 ft tall. The brick liner has an inside diameter of 20 ft and is 33+1/2 ft high. The outer shells are equipped with nozzles for pipe and instrument connections, access doors, air blast doors, gas outlets, and <b>sight</b> <b>holes.</b> The towers rest on concrete pedestals. (Blueprints, 1945-46).|$|R
50|$|There are {{an inordinate}} number of retired architects here. The {{original}} {{architects of the}} village created interesting, well sited houses, which have been well preserved. Some still have <b>sighting</b> <b>holes</b> so residents can shoot at anyone at his front door! Currently there are 180 full time residents, but that number swells at school holidays, when children flood into their grandparent’s homes. There is also an almost unique day of return in the village, where every home has a family re-union {{at the same time}} and the whole village throws a party. Every home is full, couches and spare rooms are all booked, as all the children return and strike up old friendships.|$|R

5000|$|The {{system is}} {{composed}} of a topographic map of the area oriented and centered on a horizontal table with a circular rim graduated in degrees (and fractions). Two sighting apertures are mounted above the map {{on opposite sides of}} the ring and slide around the arc.The device is used by moving the sights until the observer can peek through the nearer <b>sighting</b> <b>hole</b> and view the cross hairs in the further sight aligned with the fire. The fire lookout notes the degrees on the graduated ring beneath the sight. Early Fire Finders were capable of a crude estimate of elevation based upon the level and elevation of the table, calculating distance and rough position of the fire by reference to any distinctive terrain features and by use of the scale shown on the map. However, in actual practice, fire distance and location were normally established using two or more Fire Finder-equipped towers, using the intersection method to fix the precise location of the fire. [...] Dispatchers at a central facility used a compass rose to mark lines of position from each reporting tower onto a large map to quickly find where the reported bearings intersect.|$|R

The astrolabe is based on a large plate ("The moder" [...] or [...] "mother") which is arranged to hang vertically from a thumb ring. It has [...] "a large hool, that resceiveth in hir wombe the thin plates". The back of the astrolabe is engraved with various scales (see Skeat's sketch below). Mounted on the back is a sighting rule (Skeat's fig 3, below) [...] "a brod rule, that hath on either end a square plate perced with certein holes". To hold it all together there is a [...] "pyn" [...] with a [...] "littel wegge" [...] (wedge) as shown below at Skeat's fig 7.

50|$|Panzerfaust 100: {{this was}} the final version {{produced}} in quantity, and was completed in September 1944. However, it did not reach full production until November 1944. It had a nominal maximum range of 100 m. 190 g of propellant launched the warhead at 60 m per second from a 6 cm diameter tube. The <b>sight</b> had <b>holes</b> for 30, 60, 80 and 150 m, and had luminous paint in them to make counting up to the correct one easier in the dark. This version weighed 6 kg and could penetrate 220 mm of armour.|$|R

60|$|As if in {{this second}} Figure you suppose A to {{represent}} a small <b>sight</b> or <b>hole,</b> through which the eye looks upon an object, as C, through the Glass-bubble B, and the second sight L; all which remain exactly fixt in their several places, the object C being so cized and placed, that it may just seem to touch the upper and under edge of the hole L: and so all of it be seen through the small Glass-ball of rarified Air; then by breaking off the small seal'd neck of the Bubble (without at all stirring the sights, object, or glass) and admitting the external Air, you will find your self unable to see the utmost ends of the object; but the terminating rayes AE and AD (which were before refracted to G and F by the rarified Air) will proceed almost directly to I and H; which alteration of the rayes (seeing {{there is no other}} alteration made in the Organ by which the Experiment is tryed, save only the admission, or exclusion of the condens'd Air) must necessarily be caused by the variation of the medium contain'd in the Glass B; the greatest difficulty in the making of which Experiment, is from the uneven surfaces of the bubble, which will represent an uneven image of the object.|$|R
5000|$|The Weimar Republic, the {{successor}} {{state to the}} German Empire, implemented {{a program designed to}} update their remaining supplies of Gewehr 98 rifles for the Reichswehr in the years following World War I. Rifles allowed into service with the early Weimar security forces were stamped with a [...] "1920" [...] marking on their receiver ring. Further updates to Weimar-era Gewehr 98's often included the replacement of the Lange Visier rear sight with a standard Karabiner 98k-style rear <b>sight,</b> a <b>hole</b> cut through the side of the stock to accommodate a Karabiner 98k-style side mounted sling system and sometimes a shortening of the barrel to Karabiner 98k length. Many were also given a turned-down bolt handle, replacing the original straight bolt handle style. Rifles that received these later modifications will often have both Weimar-era and Nazi markings, and [...] "S/42" [...] stamped on the rear sight base. Some of these rifles saw use in World War II but mostly in second line units because the shortened and improved Karabiner 98k was the standard issue rifle by that time. Gewehr 98s were also sometimes stripped for their receivers and Karabiner 98k rifles were built on those receivers. Some German police officers were seen using Gewehr 98s as the Allies entered Germany in the final months of the war.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} M1 and M1A1 rocket launchers were {{equipped with}} simple fixed sights {{and used a}} launch tube without reinforcements. During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used a rear iron sight and a front rectangular [...] "ladder" [...] sight positioned at the muzzle. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected [...] "rung" [...] on the front sight. On the M9, the ladder sight {{was replaced by the}} General Electric T43 aperture sight. Ranging was accomplished by looking through the rear <b>sight's</b> peep <b>hole</b> while rotating the assembly (which had graduations of 100, 200, and 300 yards) so it lined up with the blade positioned at the muzzle. In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming. The T43 and T90 sights were interchangeable. Various types of blast deflectors were tried, and an additional strap iron shoulder brace was fitted to the M9 launcher.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{compatibility}} between theoretical models and {{observations of the}} temperatures and anisotropic velocity distributions of hydrogen and minor ions in the solar corona. The UVCS instrument on board SOHO has measured hydrogen kinetic temperatures along lines of <b>sight</b> in coronal <b>holes</b> in excess of 3 Θ 10 6 K, and O + 5 ion kinetic temperatures of at least 2 Θ 10 8 K. In addition, the velocity distributions in the radial direction (mainly perpendicular {{to the line of}} sight) are smaller, possibly implying temperature anisotropies of order T?=T k 100 for the oxygen ions. These properties can only be understood in terms of a mechanism which heats and accelerates heavier ions more than lighter ones (possibly proportionally to the ion mass to a power higher than unity), and preferentially in directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. We examine various features of plasma heating by the dissipation of high-frequency ion-cyclotron resonance Alfv'en waves, which m [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} collaborative research between Shell International Exploration and Production (IE&P) scientists and ISAG personnel {{to investigate the}} feasibility of ultrasonic-based characterization of spacecraft tile damage for in-space inspection applications. The approach was proposed by Shell personnel in a Shell-NASA "speed-matching" session in early 2011 after ISAG personnel described challenges inherent in the inspection of MMOD damage deep within spacecraft thermal protection system (TPS) tiles. The approach leveraged Shell's relevant sensor and analytical expertise. The research addressed the difficulties associated with producing 3 D models of MMOD damage cavities {{under the surface of}} a TPS tile, given that simple image-based sensing is constrained by line of <b>sight</b> through entry <b>holes</b> that have diameters considerably smaller than the underlying damage cavities. Damage cavity characterization is needed as part of a vehicle inspection and risk reduction capability for long-duration, human-flown space missions. It was hoped that cavity characterization could be accomplished through the use of ultrasonic techniques that allow for signal penetration through solid material...|$|R
40|$|The {{compatibility}} between {{theoretical models}} and {{observations of the}} temperatures and anisotropic distributions of hydrogen and minor ions in the solar corona is examined. The ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer (UVCS) instrument onboard SOHO measured hydrogen kinetic temperatures along lines of <b>sight</b> in coronal <b>holes</b> in excess of 3 x 10 (exp 6) K and O(+ 5) ion kinetic temperatures of at least 2 x 10 (exp 8) K. Various features of plasma heating by the dissipation of high-frequency ion-cyclotron resonance Alfven waves, {{which may be the}} most natural physical mechanism to produce certain plasma conditions, are examined. Preliminary quantitative models of the ion motion in polar coronal holes are presented, and it is shown that such models can be used to predict the spectrum of waves required to reproduce the observations. Indeed, the more ionic species that are observed spectroscopically, the greater the extent in frequency space the wave spectrum can be inferred...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fast {{streams of}} the solar wind with speeds of up to ≈ 800 km s − 1 at a {{distance}} of 1 AU (astronomical unit) from the Sun are known to originate in solar coronal holes. With the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detailed studies {{of the solar}} wind source regions have been made possible for the first time. We show images of solar polar coronal holes in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), which were obtained by the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) spectrograph on the SOHO spacecraft. The light is emitted in spectral lines of helium atoms and Ne 7 + ions formed at temperatures of about 20 000 K and 630 000 K, respectively, in ionization equilibrium. The sources of the fast solar wind in polar coronal holes can clearly be seen in the chromospheric He i line and in the Ne viii line of the low corona, either as dark polar caps in radiance diagrams or as regions of predominant blue shift. The average blue shifts along the line of <b>sight</b> in coronal <b>holes</b> amount to speeds of ≈ 3 kms − 1 for both He and Ne 7 +, if the Doppler shift can be interpreted as an indication of bulk motions. Bright points and polar plumes seen in Ne viii (λ 770) do, however, not show signatures of outflow...|$|R

After changing her position several times to view me from other points and find out what I was there for, she {{came to the conclusion that}} I was not to be got rid of, and making a sudden dash to a tree standing just before me, disappeared in a small hole or cleft in the trunk about forty-five feet above the ground, and in a few seconds came out again and flew swiftly away. In four or five minutes she returned, and after eyeing me suspiciously a short time flew again to the tree and, vanishing from <b>sight</b> in the <b>hole,</b> remained there. I was intently watching that small black spot in the bark to see her emerge, when a little boy came slowly sauntering past my bench, and glancing at him I found that his shrewd brown eyes were watching my face and that he had a knowing half-smile on his lips.|$|R
