50|$|The {{next stage}} is {{performing}} geometry and image processing. The Geometry Engine {{is used for}} the purpose, with each Geometry board containing up to four working in a multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) fashion. The Geometry Engine is a semi-custom ASIC with a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) pipeline containing three floating-point cores, each containing an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a multiplier and a 32-bit by 32-entry register file with two read and two write ports. These cores are provided with a 32-bit by 2,560-entry memory that holds elements of OpenGL state and provides <b>scratchpad</b> <b>storage.</b> Each core also has a float-to-fix converter to convert floating-point values into integer form. The Geometry Engine is capable of completing three instructions per cycle, and each Geometry board, with four such devices, can complete 12 instructions per cycle. The Geometry Engine uses a 195-bit microinstruction, which is compressed in order to reduce size and bandwidth usage in return for slightly less performance.|$|E
25|$|Channel {{architecture}} avoids {{this problem}} by using a separate, independent, low-cost processor. Channel processors are simple, but self-contained, with minimal logic and sufficient on-board <b>scratchpad</b> memory (working <b>storage)</b> to handle I/O tasks. They are typically not powerful or flexible enough {{to be used as}} a computer on their own and can be construed as a form of coprocessor.|$|R

A discussion of two basic computer memory technologies and three applications are presented in order to acquaint the reader with memory functions and utility. The two memory technologies discussed are: magnetic memories and semiconductor memories. The three applications discussed are: <b>Scratchpad,</b> permanent/semi-permanent <b>storage,</b> and mass storage. Selection {{of the type of}} memory is based on the established requirements and weighted design criteria. The memory that meets all the design requirements and has a minimum weighting factor is the memory selected. The selected memory is a 4 K x 20 bit CMOS RAM (Read and Write Memory) and a 8 k x 20 bit PROM (Programmable read only memory). Following the selection, memory design proceeds to the conceptual design stage ??? component selection, memory element configuration and control logic design. In this design, as in most memory designs, the memory is treated as a self-contained unit: that is, a system that generates all its required control signals. Some basic control signals such as memory cycle initiate, address data, input data and mode control (read/write) select are the only input requirements. Memory output requirements consist of output data, data ready and memory busy signals. A thorough analysis is performed on the conceptual design. The analysis demonstrates that the design meets the required specifications. The design analysis is divided into four categories: Timing analysis, Input/Out Loading Analysis, Power Analysis, and Data Retention Switch Analysis. A summary table provides a quick comparison of the analysis results to the original requirements. It also demonstrates at a glance that the memory design meets the established design requirements...|$|R
40|$|The Near Memory Processor (NMP) is a multithreaded vector {{processor}} {{integrated with the}} memory controller. The NMP works subordinately upon requests from the main processors. The NMP is complementary to the conventional superscalar processors and it is optimized for the bandwidth bounded applications and bit manipulation workloads. A program addressable memory in the NMP, Scratchpad provides an effectively large register set to hold vectors, streams and frequently accessed values. Avoiding saving and restoring the vector registers during context switch, the scratchpad reduces the overhead of the multithreading and enables a simple NMP architectural design. We design an instruction set that includes vector, streaming and bit manipulation instructions. We present the instruction set architecture of the NMP in this report, including register sets, addressing mode and instruction formats. A {{brief description of the}} benchmarks is also included. 1 The Near-Memory Processor This doucument briefly describes the ISA of the Near-Memory Processor[3]. Figure 1 presents the NMP in the base line environment of a shared memory multiprocessor. Each memory controller is integrated with one NMP. All address space, including the NMP <b>storage</b> (<b>scratchpad)</b> is shared and can be accessed both by the main (commodity) processors and by the NMPs. The threads that the NMPs execute are called Memory Threads (MT). An MT context includes a set of registers that are described below. Not all these registers need to be saved and restored on context switching. âˆ— This work is supported by DARPA Contract NBCHC- 02 - 0056 and NBCH 30390004. 1...|$|R
