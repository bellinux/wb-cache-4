60|$|As we {{mounted the}} glacis of the island, the horses {{clattering}} on the lava, we saw far above us {{the curtain of}} the rain exclude the view. The sky was clear, the sun strong overhead; around us, a thin growth of bushes and creepers glittered green in their black setting, like plants upon a ruinous pavement; all else was lava--wastes of lava, some of them enclosed (it seemed in wantonness) with dry-stone walls. But the bushes, when the rain descends often enough from its residential altitudes, flourish extremely; and cattle and asses, walking on these resonant slabs, collect a livelihood. Here and there, a prickly-pear came to the bigness of a <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> and made a space of shade; under one I saw a donkey--under another no less than three cows huddled from the sun.

5000|$|The popular United States cable {{television}} program [...] "Pinks" [...] (Speed Channel) uses the TV shows host as a flagman with an arm drop technique {{at the start}} line (plus finish line human spotters, and camera [...] "photo finishes" [...] {{similar to those used}} in horse racing and dog racing). This simulates drag racing's historic roots of post WWII street racing of the 1940s, and non-electronic drag strip racing of the 1950s and 1960s. The delay box is useless in Pinks, since the first pass is run with the Pro tree (.400 three ambers) instead of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Tree</b> (.500 per light), and the second pass and all eliminations are run with an arm drop, which forces the driver to launch at the host's order, and not by a delay box.|$|E
5000|$|After this point, the {{lighting}} sequence {{will be different}} based {{on the type of}} tree and start that a race is using. The [...] "Standard" [...] tree will light up each large amber light consecutively with a [...]500 second delay in between them, then followed by the green light after another [...]500 second delay. A [...] "Professional" [...] tree will light up all of the large amber lights simultaneously, and then after a [...]400 second delay, light up the green light. Some classes will use a hybrid tree, known as a [...]500 Professional tree, where the delay is [...]500 seconds instead of the [...]400 seconds used in a standard Professional tree. On the activation of the green light from either style of tree, the drivers are supposed to start the race. Leaving the [...] "Staged" [...] line before the green light activates will instantly stop the count down and result in a lighting of the red light and a provisional disqualification of the offending driver in heads-up starts only. In a Professional Tree or a <b>Standard</b> <b>Tree</b> with a heads-up start, if both drivers leave before the green light activates, only the first to leave will be charged with a provisional disqualification. In a <b>Standard</b> <b>Tree</b> with staggered start times, a green light will be shown to the first driver, regardless if he jumped or not, and once the second driver takes the start, if one driver jumped the start, then that driver's lane will display the red light. If both drivers jump, only the driver whose infraction was worse will be shown the red light, {{as if it was a}} heads-up start. If the driver that did not active a red light in his lane commits a further foul during the run (crossing a lane boundary or hitting the barrier), and the driver who commits a red-light foul does not cross a boundary line, the red light violation is overturned and the driver who crosses the boundary line is disqualified, with the driver who committed the red-light foul winning the round.|$|E
5000|$|MM.106: Semi-dwarfing — Sometimes {{referred}} to as semi-vigorous, {{this is the most}} widely used of rootstocks. It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant {{of a wide range of}} soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of 12 to 18 ft. Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield 90 to 110 lb after some seven or eight years. MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a half <b>standard</b> <b>tree,</b> but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life. Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to collar rot especially when planted in soils that remain wet(poor percolation).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{dependency}} parsing method that uses bilingual constraints {{to improve the}} accuracy of parsing bilingual texts (bitexts). In our method, a targetside tree fragment that corresponds to a source-side tree fragment is identified via word alignment and mapping rules that are automatically learned. Then it is verified by checking the subtree list that is collected from large scale automatically parsed data on the target side. Our method, thus, requires gold <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> only on the source side of a bilingual corpus in the training phase, unlike the joint parsing model, which requires gold <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> on the both sides. Compared to the reordering constraint model, which requires the same training data as ours, our method achieved higher accuracy because of richer bilingual constraints. Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank show that our system outperforms monolingual parsers by 2. 93 points for Chinese and 1. 64 points for English. ...|$|R
40|$|In coppice-with-standards, once {{a common}} type of {{management}} in Central European lowland forests, selected <b>trees</b> (<b>standards)</b> were left to grow mature among the regularly harvested coppice stools to obtain construction wood. After the underwood was harvested, the forest canopy opened rapidly, giving <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> an opportunity to benefit from reduced competition. Although this silvicultural system virtually disappeared after WWII, historical management cycles can still be traced in the tree-rings of remaining standards. Our research aims at answering the question whether tree-ring series of <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> {{can be used to}} reconstruct past management practices. The study was carried out on 117 oak <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> from five sites situated in formerly coppiced calcareous oak-hornbeam and acidophilous oak forests in the Bohemian Karst Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic. The evaluation was based on the analysis of growth releases representing the response of the standards to coppicing events, and comparison to the archival records of coppice events. Our results showed that coppicing events can be successfully detected by tree-ring analysis, although there are some limitations. Altogether 241 releases were identified (49 % of major releases). Large number of releases could be related to historical records, with the major ones giving better results. The overall probability of correct detection (positive predictive power) was 58 %, ranging from 50 to 67 %, probability for major releases was 78 %, ranging from 63 to 100 % for different sites. The ability of individual trees to mirror past coppice events was significantly affected by competition from neighboring trees (their number and the sum of distance-weighted basal areas). A dendro-ecological approach to the study of forest management history can serve as an input for current attempts of coppice reintroduction and for conservation purposes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{design of}} Gilman in general {{followed}} the standard plan {{used by the}} Peoria and Oquawka Railroad. This {{was based on a}} Depot Ground, a wider area of railroad owned land where the tracks pass through a town. In the original town of Gilman, east-west streets were given numbers, 6th to 2nd with Front Street where 1st Street would have been expected. The east-west streets, often given <b>standard</b> <b>tree</b> names in other Peoria and Oquawka towns, were here assigned distinctive local names including Chamberlain, Thomas and Douglas. Except for a slight bend in Central and Chamberlain Streets, the plan is generally similar to that of Chatsworth, Fairbury, Gridley and Watseka (platted as South Middleport). The Gilman plat was exceptionally large with 73 blocks, most having sixteen lots. Unlike most towns of the era, Gilman never developed a single commercial focus. This was evident early in its history when Beckwith remarked, [...] "The town is the most diffusely settled, probably, of any of like population in the state. It {{would be very difficult to}} tell which is the center of the town." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} sizes of trees {{commonly found in}} saddles. Trees differ in the width of gullet and bars of the saddle, pitch of the bars (steep to flat, usually between an angle of 86 to 94 degrees with 90 being common), and length of the bars. The tree also influences {{the shape of the}} pommel and cantle on the seat on the saddle, though the seat can be altered to fit a rider by adding padding and other materials to a far greater degree than the fit of the saddle tree's bars on a horse. A wider gullet sits lower on the horse, while a narrow gullet sits higher and is designed to fit horses with higher withers. The bars form the primary loading surface of the saddle as it site on the horse's back. A horse with a flat back and widely sprung ribs will require bars with a flatter pitch than a saddle made for a narrow horse, where a steeper pitch to the bars will keep the saddle placed properly. Most saddles are made with pre-manufactured trees which come in a limited range of sizes. Custom-made saddles may be able to have further alterations made to a <b>standard</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} Beeley Wood is in a deed dated from 1161 {{in which the}} monks of Ecclesfield Priory were given permission to graze their flock every year from January to Easter in a large wood stretching from Birley Edge down to the River Don. Beeley Wood is a surviving part of this large wood {{and part of it}} is still called Priory Wood. In this 12th century document the wood was referred to as [...] "BYLLHAUWODE" [...] which is derived from the two Old English words Billa and haga and means Billa's enclosure and suggests that the woodland was originally attached to an Anglo-Saxon farm belonging to Billa. Further mention was made in a document released upon the death of Thomas de Furnival in 1332 when Beeley Wood was named as one of eleven locations under the heading of Woods, Moors and Commons. Under this agreement people were allowed to graze their animals in the wood. However, by the 16th century Beeley Wood had become a coppice wood in which the pasturing of animals was discouraged. At the end of the 16th century Beeley Wood was one of eleven coppice woods in Sheffield which were mentioned in a document drawn up for Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. By the 1890s the coppicing of Beeley Wood along with the other coppice woods in Sheffield {{was coming to an end}} because of reduced profits and woodland management problems. The wood was allowed to become a [...] "high forest" [...] with the strongest growth of a coppiced tree allowed to grow into a fully grown <b>standard</b> <b>tree.</b> Many of the older and sickly trees were cleared away at this time and replaced by saplings of trees that were not native to the Sheffield area, such as beech, sweet chestnut, common lime and sycamore. In late 1898 the Duke of Norfolk's forester planted Beeley Wood with 60 acre of timber trees such as ash, elm, sycamore, birch, lime, sweet chestnut and beech. The young trees were ordered from a nursery in Cheshire and were delivered to Wadsley Bridge railway station. In 2011 the Forestry Commission approved funding for a five-year plan to improve the unmanaged habitat of the wood, under the scheme an area of 9.6 acre will be coppiced and a further 2.7 acre will be thinned to allow more light and warmth into the wood and therefore improve conditions for wild flowers, insects and birds. In February 2016 the Environment Agency removed the middle two-thirds of Beeley Wood Lower Weir on the River Don as part of a scheme to allow the free migration of fish and let the river return to a more natural form.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} of fuzzy {{decision}} trees called soft decision trees (SDT) is presented. This method combines tree growing and pruning, {{to determine the}} structure of the soft decision tree, with refitting and backfitting, to improve its generalization capabilities. The method is explained and motivated and its behavior is first analyzed empirically on 3 large databases in terms of classification error rate, model complexity and CPU time. A comparative study on 11 standard UCI Repository databases then shows that the soft decision trees produced by this method are significantly more accurate than <b>standard</b> decision <b>trees.</b> Moreover, a global model variance study shows a much lower variance for soft decision <b>trees</b> than for <b>standard</b> <b>trees</b> as a direct cause of the improved accuracy.
