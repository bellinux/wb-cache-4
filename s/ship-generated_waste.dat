50|$|Naval vessels, cruise liners, and {{off-shore}} installations such as gas-drilling rigs and oil platforms {{are another}} logical application of converter technology. Due to the extended isolation periods of sea-going vessels and off-shore platforms {{there is an}} issue of how to store and dispose of refuse in an efficient and sanitary way. Worldwide legislation on sea dumping is strict and does not allow, under stringent penalties, any ships or sea vessels to dump waste, gray water, or even ballast water that has been collected in a remote geographic location due to the danger of biological contamination. <b>Ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> is either held and disposed of in port waste disposal facilities or can be converted directly on the vessel for easier storage and at times (depending on waste composition) for additional fuel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Waste {{management}} plans usually address {{all types of}} <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> and cargo residues originating from ships calling at ports. Well developed waste management plan is a serious step towards reduction of {{the environmental impact of}} <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste.</b> Such important {{and at the same time}} complex considerations can be supported by application of modern mathematical theories. Evaluation of waste {{management plans}} based on application of grey theory is presented in this work. Keywords—Waste management, grey theory, assessments I...|$|E
40|$|Cruise {{tourism is}} the fastest growing sector of the tourism industry. In recent years, an {{increasing}} number of larger ships have been constructed to accommodate more passengers and provide increasingly diversified onboard activities and amenities. As the number of ships and passengers embarking on cruises continues to grow each year, cruise ships are generating larger volumes of gray and black water, solid and hazardous wastes, and harmful air emissions. If improperly managed, <b>ship-generated</b> <b>wastes</b> pose as a serious threat to coastal ecosystems. The cruise industry has demonstrated a poor track record littered with fines and violations as a result improper waste management practices. This study describes many of the environmental impacts caused by the modern cruise industry, identifies possible solutions, and discusses the economic, cultural, and political aspects of the evolving cruise market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} uncertainty in <b>ship-generated</b> hydrocarbon <b>waste</b> collection data {{from the time of}} the Directive 2000 / 59 /EC publication to, the year 2005. The starting point was an in-deep analysis of the Directive when the EU Environmental law was published and continued with the monitoring of the decision making process of the Royal Decree in Spain as Member State. Then, the aim was to find data about the amount of oil waste generated by ships. Firstly, amount of oil waste generation as EU official data was searched. Secondly, after having found little significant data, a general research of oil waste quantities on port reception facilities and at sea spillages was done. Finally, a way of performing a calculation to theoretically estimate the oil waste amounts is suggested. All this process allows to: first realize the long and slow way a new international law creation carries along. And second how far Spain still is from the European levels of vessel oil waste management, specifically the oil waste described in Attached document I to MARPOL international agreement.

40|$|This {{brochure}} is for harbourmasters and/or harbour {{authorities who}} are responsible for the collection of waste and require adequate waste reception facilities in their harbour. This brochure gives you simple and clear guidance on the procedures for the reception and handling of <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> in your harbour. The brochure also focuses on the planning, establishment and ongoing management of harbour waste reception and handling facilities...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the charging systems for the use of port reception facilities for waste oil, and to examine the potential impact of the charging elements of the new (late 2000) EU Directive on port reception facilities for <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> and cargo residues. Experience to date with alternative models for charging is considered. Conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the EU Directive as a means of controlling pollution in the North Sea and producing a `level playing field' between ports...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the new (summer 2000) EU Directive on port reception facilities for <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> and cargo residues. Five key elements of this Directive are considered with respect both to their potential effectiveness relative to existing practices, and to suggested weaknesses. The elements are: the mandatory provision of reception facilities in all ports; the mandatory use of such facilities by all ships; notification requirements on all ships; a mandatory common charging system; and compliance provisions. On the basis of this analysis, conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the new EU Directive as an instrument for preventing marine pollution. Additional recommendations are made in light of weaknesses that are identified...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the results of a survey of the availability and uptake of port reception facilities within the North Sea area. The evaluation is based primarily on original survey data from the autumn of 2002 which followed on from a similar survey conducted in the summer of 2000. The EU Directive on port reception facilities for <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> etc. (Directive 2000 / 59 /EC) was due to enter into force in December 2002, and required all EU ports to provide reception facilities to meet the needs of the vessels normally calling in at them. This paper examines the readiness of North Sea ports to meet that requirement and also considers the actual uptake levels of facilities, where ports were able to provide such information...|$|E
40|$|Cruise ships {{represent}} {{less than}} 1 % {{of the global}} merchant fleet yet {{it has been estimated}} that they are responsible for 25 % of all waste generated by merchant vessels. This volume of waste produces pressures on the environment, particularly with respect to <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> disposal at home ports and ports of call. Southampton, home port for both Cunard and P&O, and a port of call for Royal Caribbean Cruises, is the focus of this study. This paper investigates current waste management and disposal options for cruise ship generated waste and the associated impacts of this waste for ports. It is concluded that all cruise vessels should vigorously pursue a waste reduction strategy and for ports to provide adequate recycling, reduction and re-use facilities for cruise ship generated waste, optimising use of local facilities whenever possible. Waste Cruise ships Ports of call Home port...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the current availability of port reception facilities within the North Sea area. The evaluation is based primarily on original survey data from the summer of 2001, supplemented by existing information from surveys conducted by the International Maritime Organization. The EU Directive on port reception facilities for <b>ship-generated</b> <b>waste</b> etc. (Directive 2000 / 59 /EC) requires that all ports provide facilities to meet the needs of those vessels normally calling in at them. In order for the Directive to be implemented effectively, the physical availability of such facilities is vital. This paper audits the wide range of port types within the region and also outlines the wide range of vessel types using these ports, and their requirements for a range of facilities. On the basis of this analysis, conclusions are drawn about the extent to which the provision requirement of the Directive is already being met...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the need for the new (summer 2000) EU Directive on Port Reception Facilities for <b>Ship-Generated</b> <b>Waste</b> and Cargo Residues. A core issue is the extent to which the new Directive duplicates provisions already in place (the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the Bonn Agreement) through which all EU member states make available port reception facilities for the disposal of all types of waste from ships in ports, and undertake inspection and monitoring. This includes provision of facilities for timely reception of residues and oily wastes at oil loading terminals, repair ports and other ports in which there is demand; a system of port inspections; and a system of wider monitoring and surveillance. The paper accordingly presents an analysis and critical evaluation of the provisions of the new Directive in comparison with what is already in place under existing agreements. Conclusions are drawn about the extent to which the new Directive duplicates existing provisions, and the extent to which it represents a progressive departure from what is currently there...|$|E
