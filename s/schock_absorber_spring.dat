40|$|Some of {{the common}} faults {{associated}} with suspension components are damaged or leaking shock <b>absorbers,</b> <b>spring</b> weakness, wearing down of the pivot and bushing and damage to the main support member assembly. To investigate these problems, a seven degree-of-freedom (7 - DOF) model has been developed, for a full vehicle, using MATLAB. In the simulation, the suspension faults have been considered via the damage caused to the shock absorbers (dampers) and the faults were seeded by reducing the damper coefficient by 25...|$|R
5000|$|Spring-based shock {{absorbers}} commonly use coil springs or leaf springs, though torsion bars {{are used in}} torsional shocks as well. Ideal springs alone, however, are not shock <b>absorbers,</b> as <b>springs</b> only store and do not dissipate or absorb energy. Vehicles typically employ both hydraulic shock <b>absorbers</b> and <b>springs</b> or torsion bars. In this combination, [...] "shock absorber" [...] refers specifically to the hydraulic piston that absorbs and dissipates vibration. Now, composite suspension system are used mainly in 2 wheelers and also leaf spring {{are made up of}} composite material in 4 wheelers.|$|R

5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock <b>absorbers,</b> <b>springs</b> and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design of vibration <b>absorber</b> using <b>spring</b> and rubber for 5. 56 mm caliber rifle armored vehicle. Such a rifle {{is used in}} a Remote-Controlled Weapon System (RCWS) or a turret where it is fixed using a two degree of freedom pan-tilt mechanism. A half car lumped mass dynamic model of armored vehicles was derived. Numerical simulation was conducted using fourth order Runge Kutta method. Various types of vibration <b>absorbers</b> using <b>spring</b> and rubber with different configurations are installed in the elevation element. Vibration effects on horizontal direction, vertical direction and angular deviation of the elevation element was investigated. Three modes of fire were applied i. e. single fire, semi-automatic fire and automatic fire.

5000|$|An anti-sway or {{anti-roll}} bar {{is intended to}} force {{each side of the}} vehicle to lower, or rise, to similar heights, to reduce the sideways tilting (roll) of the vehicle on curves, sharp corners, or large bumps. With the bar removed, a vehicle's wheels can tilt away by much larger distances (as shown by the SUV image at right). Although there are many variations in design, a common function is to force the opposite wheel's shock <b>absorber,</b> <b>spring</b> or suspension rod to lower, or rise, to a similar level as the other wheel. In a fast turn, a vehicle tends to drop closer onto the outer wheels, and the sway bar soon forces the opposite wheel to also get closer to the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle tends to [...] "hug" [...] the road closer in a fast turn, where all wheels are closer to the body. After the fast turn, then the downward pressure is reduced, and the paired wheels can return to their normal height against the vehicle, kept at similar levels by the connecting sway bar.|$|R
50|$|The first GT-HO variant {{produced}} 300 bhp (225 KW) due to {{a larger}} carburetor, and changes to the camshaft and intake. Changes also {{were made to the}} suspension, including stiffer shock <b>absorbers</b> and <b>springs</b> and larger-diameter roll bars. Despite the changes made, at the 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 poor tyre performance meant that drivers had to pit regularly over the opposition. However, a privately entered XW GT-HO of Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland claimed second outright.|$|R

The extensive modifications include a lowered ride height, a reinforcement of the rear axle and a tighter co-ordination of shock <b>absorbers</b> and <b>springs.</b> Special front and rear spoilers and side skirts provide the appropriate visual appearance.|$|R
