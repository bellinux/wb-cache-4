50|$|The stalked <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> (Styela clava), {{also known}} as the club <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> club tunicate, Asian tunicate, {{leathery}} <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> or rough <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> is a solitary, hermaphroditic, ascidian tunicate that is native to the Pacific coast of Asia, ranging from the Sea of Okhotsk to Japan, Korea and northeast China. It has been introduced widely around the world such as off Australia, New Zealand, both coasts of North America, and Europe. It is considered invasive outside the native range, as adults lack natural predators, can outcompete native animals, feed on their planktonic larvae, and foul fishing gear and boats. In the most extreme cases, it can reach densities of up to 1,500 per square meter (140 per square foot).|$|E

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>squirts</b> {{are also}} {{valuable}} {{because of their}} unique evolutionary position: as an approximation of ancestral chordates, they can {{provide insight into the}} link between chordates and ancestral non-chordate deuterostomes, as well as the evolution of vertebrates from simple chordates. The sequenced genomes of the related <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi are small and easily manipulated; comparisons with the genomes of other organisms such as flies, nematodes, pufferfish and mammals provides valuable information regarding chordate evolution. A collection of over 480,000 cDNAs have been sequenced and are available to support further analysis of gene expression, which is expected to provide information about complex developmental processes and regulation of genes in vertebrates. Gene expression in embryos of <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> can be conveniently inhibited using Morpholino oligos.|$|R
