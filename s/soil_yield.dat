60|$|When we {{consider}} the evils in the lives we know of, we find {{that they may be}} roughly divided into three classes. There are, first, those due to physical nature: among these are death, pain and the difficulty of making the <b>soil</b> <b>yield</b> a subsistence. These we will call ``physical evils.'' Second, we may put those that spring from defects in the character or aptitudes of the sufferer: among these are ignorance, lack of will, and violent passions. These we will call ``evils of character.'' Third come those that depend upon the power of one individual or group over another: these comprise not only obvious tyranny, but all interference with free development, whether by force or by excessive mental influence such as may occur in education. These we will call ``evils of power.'' A social system may be judged by its bearing upon these three kinds of evils.|$|E

[...] T More, Utopia (1516) More landlords were enclosing pastures that had been open for commoners to use, and destroying people's houses, especially for sheep farming. The crown, and Lord Chancellors like Sir Thomas More, had opposed this to some extent, with a series of Anti-Enclosure Acts from 1489. These required that any houses destroyed be rebuilt, but if not half the additional profits would go to the Crown. The Crown itself claimed an inherent right to any valuable metals found on land in 1568, and people who had less than four acres of land were prohibited from building homes by the Erection of Cottages Act 1588. The final, formal end of feudal land tenure in England came only after the English Civil War. When the monarchy was restored Parliament ensured with the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 that landlords' obligations of service and military provision were replaced by monetary payments and an annual payment financed by taxation.|$|E

The use of the domestic wastewater has shown improvement in the physicochemical properties of the <b>soil,</b> <b>yield</b> along with the nutrient status as compared to the application of groundwater.

40|$|Various {{concepts}} {{have been}} proposed or used {{in the development of}} rheological models for debris flow.

Although the generality of Bagnold’s model is still at issue, debris-flow modelers in Japan have generally accepted Takahashi’s formulas derived from Bagnold’s model. Some efforts have recently been made by theoreticians in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics to modify or improve Bagnold’s concept or model.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a novel nonlinear numerical method to perform shakedown analysis of structures subjected to variable loads {{by means of}} nonlinear programming techniques and the displacement-based finite element method. The analysis {{is based on a}} general yield function which can take the form of most <b>soil</b> <b>yield</b> criteria (e. g. the Mohr–Coulomb or Drucker–Prager criterion). Using an associated flow rule, a general yield criterion can be directly introduced into the kinematic theorem of shakedown analysis without linearization. The plastic dissipation power can then be expressed in terms of the kinematically admissible velocity and a nonlinear formulation is obtained. By means of nonlinear mathematical programming techniques and the finite element method, a numerical model for kinematic shakedown analysis is developed as a nonlinear mathematical programming problem subject to {{only a small number of}} equality constraints. The objective function corresponds to the plastic dissipation power which is to be minimized and an upper bound to the shakedown load can be calculated. An effective, direct iterative algorithm is then proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear programming problem. The calculation is based on the kinematically admissible velocity with one-step calculation of the elastic stress field. Only a small number of equality constraints are introduced and the computational effort is very modest. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed numerical method have been validated by several numerical examples...|$|E
