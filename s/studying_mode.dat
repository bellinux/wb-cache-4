Using {{the representation of}} O(3) in terms of spherical harmonics, we study the interactions of the modes of dimension 1, 3 and 5. When <b>studying</b> <b>mode</b> interactions involving the 3 - and the 5 -dimensional modes, we come across a very natural representation, {{which turns out to}} be that of SO(3) instead of O(3). Given that the study of problems with this latter symmetry has already been done, we then study problems with SO(3) symmetry. For all these problems, we stress the existence of secondary bifurcations giving rise to the existence of limit cycles and the occurrence of heteroclinic connections between equilibria...|$|E

The type {{of this research is}} class action research. Research subject is 20 students of Teknik Busana who is <b>studying</b> <b>Mode</b> Lecturing. Research instrument applied is observation sheet. Instrument validity applied is construct validity and its reliability with test between observers. Research implementation refers to steps of Kemmis and Mac Taggart model with planning, action, and reflection cycles. This action research had done in four cycles. Data analytical technique applied is descriptive statistical analysis. Result of research shows the study implementation of Mode Learning by applying study model of Teams Games Tournaments which has been done is able to increase the lecturing quality, which can be seen from students learning enthusiasm and motivation, especially when discuss the information resulted by browsing the internet and exercises making. Applying of study model of Teams Games Tournaments can increase creativity and grow willingness of students to be creative in making works. It is proven by the increasing of average yielded and Pre test of 25 means not good becomes 28 at cycle I means good enough but at lower bound, average at cycle II is 32 means good enough, close to the highest bound at division of assessment category. Cycle III shows the improvement of average 40 is good and cycle IV with average of 45 that is proven with 80 % of respondent designs at good category. Based on the result, one of efforts which can be done to increase quality of lecturing practically can apply the study model.

40|$|Online panels – surveys {{administered}} {{over the}} Internet in which persons {{are asked to}} complete surveys regularly – offer cost reductions compared to surveys that use more traditional modes of data collection (face-to-face, telephone, and mail). However, some characteristics of online panels may cause errors, threatening the data quality. For example, excluding non-Internet users may result in coverage error; if persons selected for the study cannot be reached or {{do not want to}} participate, it may result in nonresponse error; study participants may choose to stop participating in later waves (attrition). Furthermore, respondents may learn to answer dishonestly or answer filter questions negatively to reduce the burden of participation. The main question of this dissertation is that of how good is the data collected in probability-based online panels (i. e., panels in which respondents are selected by researchers as a result of application of statistical procedures of random sampling). The five studies in this dissertation address the questions of data quality, using data from a probability-based telephone-recruited online panel of Internet users in Germany. To answer the question about goodness of the final estimates collected in the online panel, we compared data from the online panel to data from two high-quality face-to-face reference surveys. We found several differences among the surveys, however, most of these differences averaged to a few percentage points. We took the analysis further <b>studying</b> <b>mode</b> system effects (i. e., differences in the estimates as the results of the whole process by which they were collected). We found that the online panel and further two reference surveys differed in attitudinal measures. However, for factual questions the reference surveys differed from the online panel and not from each other. Our overall conclusion is that the data from the online panel is fairly comparable to the data from high-quality face-to-face surveys. This dissertation concentrated on the processes that can cause errors in data collected in the online panel. We found that participation in the panel is selective: previous experience with the Internet and online surveys predicted willingness to participate and actual participation in the panel. Incentives and fieldwork agencies that performed the recruitment also influenced the decision to participate. To study why panel members chose to discontinue participation, we contrasted the role of incentives and non-reward motivation. We found that respondents who viewed surveys as long, difficult, too personal were more likely to attrite and that incentives (although negatively related to attrition) did not compensate for this burdensome experience. To find out if the group of respondents who are longer in the panel would answer differently than the group of respondents with a shorter duration, we conducted two experiments. We found limited evidence of advantageous learning and no evidence of disadvantageous learning. The results of this dissertation provide additional insight into the processes that contribute to the quality of data produced by probability-based online panels. These results can guide researchers who plan to build online panels and might prove useful for existing panels that consider switching to the online mode...|$|E
