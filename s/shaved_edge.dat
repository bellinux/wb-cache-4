50|$|Because {{the event}} was not NCAA-sanctioned, {{sponsors}} could display their advertising at the competition venues. In 2008, they included <b>Edge</b> <b>shave</b> gel and Jack in the Box.|$|R
60|$|When {{this was}} well done, Oliver took the hoe, {{and with the}} sharp <b>edge</b> <b>shaved</b> down all around on both sides, making the walls look even and true.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} fairly amongst the mountains, the roads became horrible, and {{it was a matter of}} wonder that the springs of the carts were not broken. Toiling up hills, and dashing down on the other side,--crashing over fallen rocks, and <b>shaving</b> the <b>edge</b> of yawning gulfs and precipices,--thus they {{advanced}} till evening, through a country which was the picture of barrenness and desolation.|$|R
25|$|The ship channel {{provides}} a seaway {{for the few}} annual re-supply vessels and research ships which call upon the extraordinarily remote seaport at McMurdo Station. Preparation for the supply ships’ arrival includes icebreakers maintaining a uniform edge on the seaward side of the pier. The ship’s skipper maneuvers the icebreaker to use its bow as a giant battering ram to scarf or <b>shave</b> jagged <b>edges</b> from the pier to facilitate ships tying up at the dock.|$|R
40|$|Combination of {{template}} and routing tool cuts {{ceramic tiles}} to final dimensions. Template guides router along precisely defined planes to accurately and uniformly <b>shave</b> chamfers on <b>edge</b> of tiles. Legs of template temporarily bonded to workpiece by double-backed adhesive tape. Adaptable to in-situ final machining of other nominally flat, narrow surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|Male Rastafarians wear beards in {{conformity}} with injunctions given in the Bible, such as Leviticus 21:5: [...] "They shall not make any baldness on their heads, nor <b>shave</b> off the <b>edges</b> of their beards, nor make any cuts in their flesh." [...] The beard {{is a symbol of}} the covenant between God (Jah or Jehovah in Rastafari usage) and his people.|$|R
50|$|Brand {{promotion}} from Underground 2 still continues strongly, with Old Spice and {{the presence}} of Burger King restaurants, Castrol oil, Axe Unlimited and <b>Edge</b> <b>shaving</b> gel. The Cingular logo is still visible in the game's wireless communication system. Performance, body and visual parts that can be bought in the game are also from real life companies. However, Best Buy stores did not return from Underground 2.|$|R
50|$|Karger {{moved to}} Los Angeles from Chicago and began acting. He {{appeared}} in a John Hughes-directed <b>Edge</b> <b>Shave</b> Cream commercial, as well as featured roles in Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law; Rich Man, Poor Man; Horshack! (a pilot for a spinoff from Welcome Back Kotter); and Airport - 1975. However, Karger continued to follow his passion for politics, and eventually landed with the Dolphin Group in 1977.|$|R
50|$|As {{stores are}} larger {{it is easier}} for shoppers to find what they are looking for. Browsing is encouraged, shown with a typical scene of high-school {{students}} who read through entire series of manga standing quietly in the aisles. Another innovation cited for its success is the practice of <b>shaving</b> the <b>edges</b> off the pages of books using a special machine in order to make them appear newer. By offering a wide selection of books that appear like new at reduced prices, Book Off has aggressively targeted conventional bookstore chains, which since 1953 have been unable to discount new and near-new books and other media due to government regulations which enable a publisher's cartel.|$|R
5000|$|A mill worker places each split onto an {{automatic}} lathe that <b>shaves</b> the rough <b>edges</b> off {{as it turns}} the wood. The billets, {{as they are now}} called, are inspected again for straightness of grain. The billets are stacked and strapped together into six-sided bundles. Workers paint the ends with a protective preservative to keep the wood from fraying or rotting. The bundled billets are then trucked to the lumberyard of the bat manufacturer.|$|R
60|$|I was surprised, {{considering}} the fierce {{struggle in the}} forecastle, at the superficiality of his hurts, and I pride myself that I dressed them dexterously. With the exception of several bad wounds, the rest were merely severe bruises and lacerations. The blow which he had received before going overboard had laid his scalp open several inches. This, under his direction, I cleansed and sewed together, having first <b>shaved</b> the <b>edges</b> of the wound. Then the calf of his leg was badly lacerated and {{looked as though it}} had been mangled by a bulldog. Some sailor, he told me, had laid hold of it by his teeth, at the beginning of the fight, and hung on and been dragged to the top of the forecastle ladder, when he was kicked loose.|$|R
50|$|Until 1550, coinage {{techniques}} used in European mints had not progressed from the hammered coinage of Ancient Greece. This was problematic because {{an increase in}} the supply of bullion from central Europe and America was overworking mints. That led to low quality coins which were easily forged or clipped, i.e. precious metal was <b>shaved</b> from the <b>edges</b> of the coins. In accordance with Gresham's law, the clipped and forged coins drove good coins out of circulation, depreciating the currency.|$|R
50|$|When struck against steel, a flint edge {{will produce}} sparks. The hard flint <b>edge</b> <b>shaves</b> off a {{particle}} {{of the steel}} that exposes iron which reacts with oxygen from the atmosphere and can ignite the proper tinder. Prior to the wide availability of steel, rocks of pyrite would be used along with the flint, in a similar (but more time-consuming) way. These methods are popular in woodcraft, bushcraft, and among {{those who wish to}} use traditional skills.|$|R

50|$|In September, Simpson won {{his second}} tournament of the 2011 PGA Tour season {{and of his}} career, at the second FedEx Cup playoff event, the Deutsche Bank Championship. He beat Chez Reavie in a sudden death playoff. Simpson made a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th to cut Reavie's lead to one and when Reavie bogeyed the 18th, they went into a playoff replaying the 18th hole. Simpson made another 12-foot birdie putt to stay alive while Reavie made birdie. On the 17th hole Simpson hit his second shot on the par-4 to 8 feet and Reavie replied by hitting his to within 20 feet. Reavie <b>shaved</b> the <b>edge</b> with his attempt, {{allowing}} Simpson to capitalize by knocking his 8 footer in for the victory. Simpson moved to first in the FedEx Cup standings {{for the first time}} in his career.|$|R
5000|$|The ice {{around the}} edges of a rink has a {{tendency}} to build up because the conditioner blade does not extend {{all the way to the}} outer edges of the conditioner and it is unwise to [...] "ride" [...] (drive with the conditioner touching) the dasher boards. An ice edger is a small device similar to a rotary lawn mower that is used to <b>shave</b> down the <b>edges</b> of the ice surface that the ice resurfacer cannot cut. An ice edger cannot shave ice that has an overall bowl or mushroom shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{toothbrush}} moustache is a moustache style, <b>shaved</b> at the <b>edges,</b> {{except for}} three to five centimeters above {{the centre of the}} lip. The sides of the moustache are vertical rather than tapered. The style first became popular in the United States in the late 19th century, from where it spread to Germany and elsewhere, reaching a height of popularity in the inter-war years before becoming unfashionable after World War II due to its association with Adolf Hitler. Other names for the moustache include the Hitler, Charlie Chaplin, 1/3, philtrum moustache, postage stamp, and soul stache.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{match was}} a hair vs. hair match between Kurt Angle and Edge. Edge {{attempted}} a spear on Angle, but Angle avoided the move, resulting in Edge performing a spear on the referee. Angle performed a German suplex on Edge {{and attempted to}} hit Edge with a chair, but Edge ducked and performed two spears on Angle for a near-fall. Angle performed an Angle Slam on Edge for a near-fall. Angle applied an ankle lock on Edge, but Edge countered the hold. Edge pinned Angle with a small package to win the match, after which <b>Edge</b> <b>shaved</b> Angle's hair.|$|R
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been <b>shaved</b> from the <b>edge.</b> This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|R
5000|$|... "Debasement" [...] is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the tendency of silver or gold coins to be [...] "shaved", that is, to have small amounts <b>shaved</b> off the <b>edges</b> of the coins by unscrupulous users, thereby reducing the actual silver content of the coin. In order to prevent this, silver and gold coins began to be produced with milled edges, as many coins still do by tradition, although they no longer contain valuable metals. For example, the U.S. quarter and dime have milled edges. Coins that have traditionally been made purely of base metals, such as the U.S. nickel or the penny, {{are more likely to have}} unmilled edges.|$|R
50|$|Shaving soap {{in a cup}} is {{traditionally}} lathered and applied using a rotating in-and-out motion of a shaving brush, usually made of boar or badger bristles. The shave is completed using as few strokes as possible, stropping sparingly if at all. A second shave with another razor in an alternate direction against the beard yields an extremely close shave. Rinsing with cold water constricts minor abrasions or cuts, followed by patting dry (not rubbing) and an astringent or aftershave lotion. More serious nicks can be attended with direct pressure for perhaps a minute with a styptic pencil, or with an application of a household astringent such as witch hazel. A light steady touch is most effective at providing a close <b>shave,</b> preserving the <b>edge</b> and avoiding cuts.|$|R
5000|$|A beaded bordure on {{both sides}} of the coin {{prevented}} silver from being <b>shaved</b> from the <b>edge</b> of the coin, a practice called clipping. [...] As an additional security measure, Doge Jacopo Tiepolo added distinctive marks, initially variations in the punctuation in the obverse legend and later small marks near Christ’s feet on the reverse, which identified the mint master responsible for the issues. But, except for updating the name of the doge and the addition of the reverse legend, TIBI LAVS 3 GLORIA, by Doge Michele Steno, there were no significant changes in the grosso for one hundred fifty years. Indeed, around 1237 the doge’s coronation oath included a promise that he would not change the coinage without authorization from the council.|$|R
5000|$|Applications of DLC {{typically}} {{utilize the}} ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as endmills, drill bits, dies and molds often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, NASCAR vehicles, and as a coating on hard-disk platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against head crashes. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet <b>shaving</b> have the <b>edges</b> coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [...] "chips" [...] and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the high-speed, dry shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and aluminium, for example on automobile dashboards.|$|R
5000|$|This {{still did}} not give France a coin which could compete with the thalers which were popular in Germany. Moreover, French coins were still made by hand so {{precious}} metal could be illegally <b>shaved</b> from the <b>edges</b> of the coins before passing them on. Finally, the écu d’or was made of 23 carat gold, which was not the international standard. Louis XIII fixed all this. He installed coinage making machinery in the Paris mint and replaced the écu d’or by the Louis d'or in 1640. In 1641 he introduced a thaler sized silver coin originally called a Louis d’argent and valued at 3 livres tournois. This value {{was associated with the}} stabilization of the écu d’or at that value in 1577 and the new silver coin came to be called an écu. This is a bit curious since the just discontinued écu d’or was now valued at more than 5 livres and the old hammered silver quarter écu was struck until 1646 and valued at 1 livre. [...] From 1690 to 1725 rates were unstable and new écus were issued, and existing écus revalued. After 1726 the final écu remained stable at six livres tournois. The silver écu was further broken down into a 1/8 value coin (huitième d'écu), 1/4 value coin (the quart d'écu) and a 1/2 value coin (the demi-écu). All had the king’s bust on the obverse and the royal coat of arms on the reverse. For more on the 17-18th century currency system, see Louis d'or, livre tournois and Italian scudo.|$|R
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} there, {{he began}} a feud with Kurt Angle. At Backlash, Edge defeated Angle and later culminated in <b>Edge</b> <b>shaving</b> Angle's head following a hair vs. hair match at Judgment Day in May. On the May 30 episode of SmackDown!, Edge defeated Angle in a Steel Cage match to end the feud but during the match Edge speared Angle from the top rope. In the process, Edge injured his arm and would be forced out of action for a month. [...] Two months later, he would end up winning the World Tag Team Championship alongside Hollywood Hulk Hogan on July 4, 2002. Edge and Hogan lost the titles at Vengeance to Lance Storm and Christian, and at SummerSlam, Edge defeated Eddie Guerrero then lost to Guerrero at Unforgiven. They met one final time days later on SmackDown! in a No Disqualification match where Edge won, ending the feud. He then formed a tag team with Rey Mysterio, and the two participated in a tournament for the newly created and SmackDown!-exclusive WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost to Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit in the finals of the tournament at No Mercy; the match was voted Match of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. After they failed in winning the title, Mysterio and Edge defeated Los Guerreros in a number one contender's match on the October 24 episode of SmackDown! to earn a title shot. At the Rebellion pay-per-view, Edge faced Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman in a Handicap match for the WWE Championship where Lesnar retained the title after Lesnar pinned Edge. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown!, they defeated Angle and Benoit in a {{two out of three}} falls match to win their first Tag Team Championship. They soon lost the tag titles to Los Guerreros in a Triple Threat Elimination match that also involved former champions Angle and Benoit at Survivor Series.|$|R
