The grand duchess also had a lifelong friendship with Clara Barton, whom she met during the Franco-Prussian War.

2500|$|Both Zu and Lady Lu then {{reported}} the song to Gao Wei to further foster his suspicion of Hulü. [...] Gao Wei consulted another favorite, Han Zhangluan, {{who believed that}} he should not suspect Hulü, so Gao Wei initially took no action. [...] Zu, however, would not relent, and he had Hulü's subordinate Feng Shirang (封士讓) make a secret submission indicating that when Hulü had brought the army close to Yecheng in 571, he was plotting a coup. [...] Gao Wei believed it this time, and under Zu's <b>suggestion,</b> he <b>awarded</b> Hulü a horse, and then, as Hulü arrived at the palace to thank the emperor, he had his guard commander Liu Taozhi (劉桃枝) seize Hulü and strangle him to death. [...] Hulü's clan was slaughtered except for his youngest son Hulü Zhong (斛律鍾), and Empress Hulü was deposed. [...] Subsequently, Lady Lu tried to have her adoptive daughter Consort Mu Sheli made empress, but was forced to compromise with Empress Dowager Hu to have Empress Dowager Hu's niece Consort Hu made empress, a proposal that she had to formally make jointly with Zu.|$|R

While there, he met and married Louise Montgomery Williams. He also enrolled at George Washington University following Thom's <b>suggestion,</b> and was <b>awarded</b> a master's degree in 1931. Thom also suggested Raper complete his studies at Harvard University, promising that his position would still be available when he finished. Working under William H. Weston at Harvard, Raper studied an organism he had collected in the Great Craggy Mountains of North Carolina during the summer vacation, and which he formally described as Dictyostelium discoideum in 1935. He was awarded a second master's degree in 1931, and a Ph.D. in 1936.|$|R

After learning about the 1885 expulsion of Tacoma’s Chinese citizens and worried {{by the lack of}} recognition of the event, Murdoch submitted a Citizen <b>Suggestion</b> <b>Award</b> Application to the city of Tacoma on August 27, 1991. The statement suggested that “since the eviction the Chinese populace was from the Old Town waterfront, it would be appropriate to set aside an area of reconciliation (small park with a Chinese motif) and a monument acknowledging the incident, noting Tacoma’s regret and desire to move ahead in unity and respect.” ...|$|E

40|$|While {{restaurant}} wine menus {{are found}} to be sorted by different principles, such as by price, region or grape variety, no previous research has analysed what effect item order has on clients’ wine selection. A discrete choice experiment is utilised to compare the effect of menu order by price and sensory characteristics on wine choice. We find wine menu order to {{have a significant impact on}} wine choice such that consumers more frequently choose lower priced wines if wine menus are sorted by ascending price. If a wine menu is sorted by sensory characteristics consumers choose different grape varieties and more frequently use information such as sensory descriptions, food matching <b>suggestions</b> and wine <b>awards.</b> We conclude with managerial implications and outline further research avenues. ...|$|R

The Monster ended up on many websites top horror list for 2016, and Ballentine gained a few <b>suggestions</b> for <b>award</b> considerations {{and a couple of}} award nominations, such us Fangoria Magazine's 2017 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards nomination for Best Supporting Actress. [...] "If horror movie performances were given Oscars, Kazan would be a shoo-in. Same with Ballentine. These two are so believable” wrote Staci Layne Wilson in Dread Central Bloody Disgusting, an American horror genre website with millions of visitors/month, called Ballentine [...] "The Most Baddas Horror Hero of 2016" [...] in article devoted to her and her character.|$|R
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal {{was meant to be}} a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of Prince Albert, vetoed the <b>suggestion</b> that the <b>award</b> be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{responded to}} <b>suggestions</b> that the <b>award</b> was political: [...] "Quentin Tarantino whispered in my ear, 'We {{want you to}} know that it was not the {{politics}} of your film that won you this award. We are not here to give a political award. Some of us have no politics. We awarded the art of cinema, that is what won you this award and we wanted you to know that as a fellow filmmaker.'" [...] In comments to the prize-winning jury in 2005, Cannes director Gilles Jacob said that panels should make their decision based on filmmaking rather than politics. He expressed his opinion that though Moore's talent was not in doubt, [...] "it was a question of a satirical tract that was awarded a prize more for political than cinematographic reasons, no matter what the jury said". Interviewed about the decision four years later, Tarantino responded: [...] "As time has gone on, I have put that decision under a microscope and I still think we were right. That was a movie of the moment - Fahrenheit 9/11 may not play the same way now as it did then, but back then it deserved everything it got." ...|$|R

On {{the eve of the}} award ceremony, China continued the rhetoric against the Nobel Committee and the West. A spokesman said: [...] "We hope that those countries who have received invitations can tell right from wrong and uphold justice. It's not an issue of human rights. It's an issue of interfering in other countries' internal affairs"; the Nobel committee continued to be criticised for [...] "encouraging crime"; the Global Times repeated earlier <b>suggestions</b> that the <b>award</b> was a Western conspiracy against Beijing, a [...] "charge against China's ideology, aiming to undermine the benign surroundings for China's future development." ...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{becomes a}} hot topic in the commercial industry. Energy performance of a building can be rated through green building rating tools. The available tools like Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), and Green Building Index (GBI) can guide the government, building designers, pemaju, and users on the energy performance {{of the building and}} green building awareness. This paper will investigate the energy performance of an office building with GBI and LEED schemes and comparison of both schemes in term of their assessment methods, scopes, performance criteria and energy rating scales. The differences and similarities of both schemes will be discussed further. The office building will be qualified as green building for certain levels based on the credit <b>awarded.</b> <b>Suggestions</b> and improvements will be given after evaluation from both schemes. The Quick Energy Simulation Tool (eQUEST) is simulated with four different models; T 8 to T 5, VSD Chiller, Fan Power, and Temperature Control to identify the potential improvement project for this building. A number of energy conservation projects are determined and can generate near to 700 MWh energy saved with RM 150 k investmen...|$|R
