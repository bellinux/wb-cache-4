500|$|Virtue's Last Reward {{received}} [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] on both platforms, {{according to}} the review aggregator Metacritic. Several reviewers found the game's narrative to be complex and engaging: GameSpot's Heidi Kemps enjoyed its mix of horror, drama, and science fiction, and Edge called it a [...] "page-turner with flashes of real intelligence"; Edge later noted that it lacked the shock value of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Game Informer Kimberly Wallace and Tony Ponce of Destructoid liked the use of plot twists, but Ponce felt that the ending featured too many of them, and that the revelations were more confusing than surprising. Writing for RPGFan, John McCarroll liked how the dialogue ranged from humorous to <b>saddening</b> and harrowing. Only Austin Boosinger of Adventure Gamers was critical of the dialogue, calling it [...] "one of the slowest and most overwritten adventure games" [...] ever made.|$|E
500|$|Appointed in 1828 as {{minister}} plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia, Harrison resigned from Congress {{and served in}} his new post until March 8, 1829. He arrived in Bogotá on December 22, 1828 and found the condition of Colombia <b>saddening.</b> Harrison reported to the Secretary of State {{that the country was}} on the edge of anarchy, including his opinion that Simón Bolívar was about to become a military dictator. While minister in Colombia, Harrison wrote a rebuke to Bolívar, stating [...] "the strongest of all governments is that which is most free". He called on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, [...] "The United States... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom", a sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America. When the new administration of President Andrew Jackson took office in March 1829, Harrison was recalled so the new president could make his own appointment to the position; he returned to the United States in June.|$|E
500|$|After {{the report}} was {{published}} on 3 September 2002, it was condemned by {{a wide variety of}} Bosnian and international figures. A spokesman for the ICTY told Radio Free Europe that [...] "any claim that the number of victims {{after the fall of the}} Srebrenica enclave was around the 2,000 mark, and most of those killed in battle, is an absolutely outrageous claim. It's utterly false, and it flies in the face of all of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy." [...] He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as [...] "frankly, disgusting." [...] Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as [...] "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice." [...] Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as [...] "a <b>saddening</b> example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region." [...] The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of Miroslav Deronjić; in their verdict, the judges called it [...] "one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Golder {{identified}} [...] "Esther’s scarily casual death" [...] {{as one of}} the gripping {{points of}} what he felt to be an underwhelming finale. The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and <b>saddening</b> shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first glimpse of her funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was sad because the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something to go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E

In 2011, Raquel's wedding to Curly was placed eighteenth in Channel 5's [...] "Greatest TV Weddings" [...] programme. Producer Spencer Campbell thought the wedding was <b>saddening,</b> whilst critic Tina Baker felt she and everyone watching knew it was doomed for the pair.

2500|$|Several {{civilian}} {{inhabitants of}} Khanasor, meanwhile, expressed frustration and {{anger at the}} clashes, saying that both groups should focus on expelling ISIL from southern Sinjar rather than fighting each other. Some locals even said both groups should simply retreat from the Sinjar Mountains, and leave the Yezidi civilians alone. Both Mir Tahsin Beg, leader of the Yezidi community, as well as Nadia Murad, female Yezidi activist and UN Goodwill ambassador, called on both sides to stop the fighting. Murad said that [...] "it is deeply <b>saddening</b> {{for me to see}} once again victims of Genocide become victims of an internal conflict, it is painful to see the Yezidi women again are suffering from fear after all that happened to them". An expert also warned that both the Sinjar Resistance Units as well as the Rojava Peshmerga had been very effective at [...] "keeping IS at bay" [...] and that the fighting among these anti-ISIL forces [...] "would slow the process to liberate the remaining territory from IS".|$|E

2500|$|Episode eight {{ended the}} series with a {{generally}} positive critical reception, with many praising {{the performances of}} Tennant and Colman. Radio Times praised Tennant's performance, saying that [...] "the episode belonged to [...] ". They also heavily praised the ending to the Joe Miller case, labeling the resolution [...] "brilliant" [...] and claiming [...] "Yes, he got off, but writer Chris Chibnall and his fabulous cast fashioned a quite brilliant climax where justice of a sort was done". Digital Spy responded positively, labeling the finale [...] "satisfying and unsatisfying - complete closure has not been achieved. Reflecting the inequality and injustices of everyday life, Chibnall's choices for the finale were thoughtful, <b>saddening</b> and even worrying. A brave move, just as the entire two series have been". They also praised Tennant's performance, they said [...] "It's a cracking performance from the actor who delves deep to deliver some fiery moments but also, having solved the Sandbrook case, his own breakdown at the station - as he sits alone and cries - is touching and deserved". The Independent, in a mixed review, praised many of the cast by saying [...] "Whenever the plot dragged, we could rely on Ellie (Olivia Colman), Beth (Jodie Whittaker) or Mark (Andrew Buchan) for a performance which delivered that missing emotional connection".|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, <b>saddening</b> Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
