5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no wings to enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack.|$|E
5|$|The first {{banknotes}} to {{be issued}} with his signature was the two last runs of the original designs, dated 1994. The first run, which consisted of denominations from $2 to $20, had the original watermark of the Zimbabwe Bird (profile angle, <b>short</b> <b>neck),</b> whilst the second run consisted only of the $2 and $5 denominations, bearing the watermark of the bird with a longer neck and at ¾ profile angle.|$|E
5|$|In most media appearances, pterosaurs {{are most}} often {{depicted}} as piscivores, a behaviour only a few groups actually had in reality. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with their taloned feet. No pterosaur species known so far possesses prehensile feet; all known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, often poorly muscled and, {{in the case of}} pteranodontians, generally proportionally small. However, some pterosaurs might have had raptorial tendencies; Thalassodromeus possesses powerful jaws akin to those of phorusrhacids, and Hatzegopteryxs <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> and more powerful jaws have been interpreted as a speciation on larger prey.|$|E

5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, {{the rear of the}} thighs, between the legs, on the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). <b>Short</b> <b>neck.</b> Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. Hindquarters thick, deep and rounded. Horns and hooves lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|These were large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, {{and tails}} held {{high in the}} air. Due to their {{distinctive}} combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with spikes, Stegosaurus {{is one of the}} most recognizable kinds of dinosaur. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spikes were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions. Stegosaurus had a relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio. It had a <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, Stegosaurus ungulatus, is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus).|$|E

25|$|The {{group was}} first {{described}} by German paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914 {{with the discovery}} of Dicraeosaurus in Tanzania. Dicraeosauridae are distinct from other sauropods because of their relatively <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> size and small body size.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{braiding}} {{is performed}} {{to show off}} the neck, accentuating the top line when the horse is moving or jumping. Braiding may be used to hide conformation faults of the neck (for example, a relatively <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> can be braided with a greater number of smaller braids, making it look longer). Braiding can be used to train the mane to lie {{on one side of the}} neck, if half falls on one side and half falls on the other.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the Jurassic, very large Pliosauridae evolved. These were {{characterized}} by a large head and a <b>short</b> <b>neck,</b> such as Liopleurodon and Simolestes. These forms had skulls up to three metres (ten feet) long and reached a length of up to seventeen metres (55 feet) and a weight of ten tonnes. The pliosaurids had large, conical teeth and were the dominant marine carnivores of their time. During the same time, approximately 160 million years ago, the Cryptoclididae were present, shorter species with a long neck and a small head.|$|E
25|$|Ornitholestes had a {{relatively}} <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> {{with a slight}} sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve. The tail was long and whiplike, comprising {{over half of the}} body's length. Not all of the vertebrae were preserved, but Osborn (1917) estimated that Ornitholestes had nine or ten cervical (neck) vertebrae, thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, four sacral (hip) vertebrae, and 39 to 44 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Carpenter et al. (2005a) recorded that the specimen contained five sacral vertebrae. Ornitholestes was a short-bodied theropod, and this was reflected in the short front-to-back dimensions of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the modern-day}} giraffe, Honanotherium may have grazed on low-lying {{trees in the}} savannah environment, {{although}} its <b>shorter</b> <b>neck</b> shows that it probably fed on different plants than the extant giraffe.|$|R
50|$|Aristonectidae were {{characterized}} by a relatively larger head and <b>shorter</b> <b>neck</b> than the Plesiosauridae and Elasmosauridae. Teeth resemble those of the Plesiosauridae. The group is known only from scanty and fragmentary remains.|$|R

25|$|During the Renaissance, the {{hurdy-gurdy}} was a {{very popular}} instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that buzzing bridges first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the dog) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge {{is thought to have}} been borrowed from the tromba marina (monochord), a bowed string instrument.|$|E
25|$|MPS I S, Scheie syndrome, is the mildest form of MPS I. Symptoms {{generally}} {{begin to}} appear after age 5, with diagnosis most commonly made after age 10. Children with Scheie syndrome have normal intelligence or may have mild learning disabilities; some may have psychiatric problems. Glaucoma, retinal degeneration, and clouded corneas may significantly impair vision. Other problems include {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} or other nerve compression, stiff joints, claw hands and deformed feet, a <b>short</b> <b>neck,</b> and aortic valve disease. Some affected individuals also have obstructive airway disease and sleep apnea. Persons with Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The neck is short, and derived species show a {{reduction}} in the number of cervical vertebrae. The <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> positions the skull close to the trunk, usually in a slight oblique elevation to it. Derived species usually also have a reduced number of dorsals, the total of presacral vertebrae totalling about forty to fifty. The vertebral column is little differentiated. Basal Ichthyopterygia still have two sacral vertebrae, but these are not fused. Early Triassic forms have a transversely flattened tail base with high spines for an undulating tail movement. Derived forms have a shorter tail with the characteristic kink at the end; a section of wedge-shaped vertebrae, itself supporting the fleshy upper tail fin lobe, forced the tail end into the lower fin lobe.|$|E
50|$|Beer vessels with <b>short</b> <b>necks</b> and {{elongated}} trunks, clay censers, cheese-making vats, and jugs {{of various}} shapes {{have also been}} found. The jugs have been decorated with house fronts, geometric patterns, or leaf-shaped folds.|$|R
5|$|Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied {{birds with}} <b>short</b> <b>necks</b> and <b>short</b> slender bills with a fleshy cere. Seven {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in Tasmania, two {{of which have been}} introduced and another three are vagrants.|$|R
50|$|The New World barbets are plump birds, with <b>short</b> <b>necks</b> {{and large}} heads. They get their {{name from the}} {{bristles}} which fringe their heavy bills. Most species are brightly coloured and live in tropical forest.|$|R
25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main export goods. On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a <b>short</b> <b>neck</b> and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase shoulders were considerably reduced in width and the curve of the vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E
