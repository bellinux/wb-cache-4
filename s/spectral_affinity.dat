40|$|Nonlocal Hamiltonian-type operators, like e. g. {{fractional}} and quasirelativistic, {{seem to be}} instrumental for {{a conceptual}} broadening of current quantum paradigms. However physically relevant properties of related quantum systems have not yet received due (and scientifically undisputable) coverage in the literature. In the present paper we address Schrödinger-type eigenvalue problems for H=T+V, where a kinetic term T=T_m is a quasirelativistic energy operator T_m = √(-ħ ^ 2 c^ 2 Δ + m^ 2 c^ 4) - mc^ 2 of mass m∈ (0,∞) particle. A potential V we assume {{to refer to the}} harmonic confinement or finite well of an arbitrary depth. We analyze spectral solutions of the pertinent nonlocal quantum systems with a focus on their m-dependence. Extremal mass m regimes for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of H are investigated: (i) m≪ 1 <b>spectral</b> <b>affinity</b> ("closeness") with the Cauchy-eigenvalue problem (T_m ∼ T_ 0 =ħ c |∇ |) and (ii) m ≫ 1 <b>spectral</b> <b>affinity</b> with the nonrelativistic eigenvalue problem (T_m ∼ -ħ ^ 2 Δ / 2 m). To this end we generalize to nonlocal operators an efficient computer-assisted method to solve Schrödinger eigenvalue problems, widely used in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. A resultant spectrum-generating algorithm allows to carry out all computations directly in the configuration space of the nonlocal quantum system. This allows for a proper assessment of the spatial nonlocality impact on simulation outcomes. Although the nonlocality of H might seem to stay in conflict with various numerics-enforced cutoffs, this potentially serious obstacle is kept under control and effectively tamed.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades we have become {{increasingly}} aware of the fundamental importance of water, and aqueous alteration, on primitive solar-system bodies. Some carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites have been altered by interactions with liquid water within the first 10 million years after formation of their parent asteroids. Millimeter to centimeter-sized aggregates of purple halite containing aqueous fluid inclusions were found in the matrix of two freshly-fallen brecciated H chondrite falls, Monahans (1998, hereafter simply "Monahans") (H 5) and Zag (H 3 - 6) (Zolensky et al., 1999; Whitby et al., 2000; Bogard et al., 2001) In order to understand origin and evolution of the aqueous fluids inside these inclusions we much measure the actual fluid composition, and also learn the O and H isotopic composition of the water. It has taken a decade for laboratory analytical techniques to catch up to these particular nanomole-sized aqueous samples. We have recently been successful in (1) measuring the isotopic composition of H and O in the water in a few fluid inclusions from the Zag and Monahans halite, (2) mineralogical characterization of the solid mineral phases associated with the aqueous fluids within the halite, and (3) the first minor element analyses of the fluid itself. A Cameca ims- 1270 equipped with a cryo-sample-stage of Hokkaido University was specially prepared for the O and H isotopic measurements. The cryo-sample-stage (Techno. I. S. Corp.) was cooled down to c. a. - 190 C using liquid nitrogen at which the aqueous fluid in inclusions was frozen. We excavated the salt crystal surfaces to expose the frozen fluids using a 15 keV Cs+ beam and measured negative secondary ions. The secondary ions from deep craters of approximately 10 m in depth emitted stably but the intensities changed gradually during measurement cycles because of shifting states of charge compensation, resulting in rather poor reproducibility of multiple measurements of standard fluid inclusions of +/- 90 0 / 00 (2 sigma) for delta D, and +/- 29 0 / 00 (2 sigma) for delta O- 18. On the other hand, the reproducibility of Delta O- 17 is plus or minus 8 / 00 (2 sigma) because the observed variations of isotope ratios follow a mass dependent fractionation law. Variations of delta D of the aqueous fluids range over sog,a 330 (90; 2 sigma) to + 1200 (90) 0 / 00 for Monahans and delta 300 (96) 0 / 00 to + 90 (98) 0 / 00 for Zag. Delta O- 17 of aqueous fluids range over delta 16 (22) 0 / 00 to + 18 (10) 0 / 00 for Monahans and + 3 (10) 0 / 00 to + 27 (11) 0 / 00 for Zag. These variations are larger than the reproducibility of standard analyses and suggest that isotope equilibria were under way in the fluids before trapping into halite. The mean values of delta D and Delta O- 17 are + 290 0 / 00 and + 9 0 / 00, respectively. The mean values and the variations of these fluids are different from the representative values of ordinary chondrites, verifying our working hypothesis that the fluid inclusion-bearing halites were not indigenous to the H chondrite parent-asteroid but rather represent exogenous material delivered onto the asteroid from a separate cryovolcanically-active body. This initial isotopic work has demonstrated the feasibility of the measurements, but also revealed sample processing and analytical shortcomings that are now being addressed. Examination of solid mineral inclusions within Monahans and Zag halite grains by confocal Raman spectroscopy at the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory has revealed them to be metal, magnetite, forsteritic olivine (Fo. 98), macromolecular carbon (MMC), pyroxenes, feldspar with Raman <b>spectral</b> <b>affinity</b> to anorthoclase and, probably, fine-grained lepidocrocite (FeO(OH)). In addition, one inclusion features aliphatic material with Raman spectral features consistent with a mixture of short-chain aliphatic compounds. We have initiated analyses of the bulk composition of the fluids within the inclusions in Zag and Monahans halites at Virginia Tech by LA ICPMS using angilent 7500 ce quadrupole ICPMS and a Lambda Physik GeoLas 193 nm excimer laser ablation system. Preliminary results reveal that the inclusion aqueous fluids contain highly charged cations of Ca, Mg and Fe. The minerals and compounds discovered thus far within Monahans/Zag halites are indicative of an originating body at least partly composed of unequilibrated anhydrous materials (high Fo olivine, pyroxenes, feldspars, possibly the metal) which were subjected to aqueous alteration (the halite parent brine) and containing a light organic component (the short-chain aliphatic compounds). This material was ejected from the originating body with little or no disruption, as evidenced with the presence of fluid inclusions. An actively geysering body similar to modern Enceladus (Postberg et al., 2011) may be a reasonable analogue in this respect. Also, the originating body should have been within close proximity to the H chondrite parent in order to generate the number of halite grains seen in Monahans and Zag. Other candidates for Monahans/Zag halite parent bodie(s) may include a young Ceres with its possible liquid ocean, or Main Belt comets...|$|E

Its efficiency is due to the priors, which are derived from the <b>spectral</b> <b>affinities</b> between every pair of trajectories. We test our algorithm with synthetic and real data.

40|$|Abstract—While {{clustering}} {{is usually}} an unsupervised opera-tion, there are circumstances {{where we have}} access to prior belief that pairs of samples should (or should not) be assigned with the same cluster. Constrained clustering aims to exploit this prior belief as constraint (or weak supervision) to influence the cluster formation so as to obtain a data structure more closely resembling human perception. Two important issues remain open: (1) how to exploit sparse constraints effectively, (2) how to handle ill-conditioned/noisy constraints generated by imperfect oracles. In this paper we present a novel pairwise similarity measure framework to address the above issues. Specifically, in contrast to existing constrained clustering approaches that blindly rely on all features for constraint propagation, our approach searches for neighbourhoods driven by discriminative feature selection for more effective constraint diffusion. Crucially, we formulate a novel approach to handling the noisy constraint problem, which has been unrealistically ignored in constrained clustering literature. Extensive comparative results show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art constrained clustering approaches and can generally benefit existing pairwise similarity based data clustering algorithms, such as <b>spectral</b> clustering and <b>affinity</b> propagation.

40|$|Abstract. Composite {{spectra of}} {{different}} rotational {{aspects of the}} S asteroid 433 Eros were assembled from previous studies, covering the wavelength range 0 ø 33 - 2. 5 grn. These data allow us to measure significant attributes of Eros's spectrum • its mafic mineral absorptions, and the degree and nature of compositional heterogeneity of its surfaceo We also evaluated previous S-asteroid taxonomies using independent methods • and f_rom this test dete__rrnined that the taxonomy of Gaffey et al. [1993] provides a sound basis for relating Eros to other S asteroids. On average, Eros resembles the S(IV) asteroids, which bear the closest resemblance to ordinary chondrites in mafic mineralogy • However • Eros also exhibits distinct rotational spectral variations comparable to the greatest yet recognized on an S asteroid. One side of the asteroid has a shorter-wavelength 1 -pm absorption and a stronger 2 -grn absorption than the globat average, and is interpreted to be richer in pyroxene; the opposite face has a longer-wavelength I-grn absorption and a weaker 2 -grn absorption, and is interpreted to be richer in olivineo The pyroxene-rich side coincides with a facet-like face identified in radar studies, and the olivine-hch side coincides with a convex-shaped face. Each side of the asteroid exhibits <b>spectral</b> <b>affinities</b> with a different spectral class of S asteroids, demonstrating that such subdivisions of S asteroids represent different parts of a compositional continuum. High spatial resolution measurement of the mineralogic and elemental compositions and especially the geologic settings of these different materials by the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous mission will provide a great advance {{in the understanding of}} the origin and evolution of a candidate ordinary chondrite parent body...|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{clustering}} (SC) {{has become}} one of the most popular clustering methods. Given an affinity matrix, SC explores its spectral-graph structure to partition data into disjoint meaningful groups. However, in many applications, there are multiple potentially useful features and thereby multiple affinity matrices. For applying spectral clustering to such cases, these affinity matrices must be aggregated into a single one. Unfortunately, affinity measures based on different features could have different characteristics. Some are more effective than others. We propose a multi-affinity spectral clustering (MASC) algorithm which extends the SC algorithm with multiple affinities available. By automatically adjusting the weights of affinity matrices, MASC is more immune to ineffective affinities and irrelevant features. This makes the choice of similarity or distance-metric measures for clustering less crucial. Experiments show that MASC is effective in simultaneous clustering and feature fusion, thus maintaining robustness of SC for multi-affinity clustering problems.

40|$|In vitro {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare kinact, KI and inactivation efficiency (kinact/KI) of cytochrome P 450 (P 450) 2 C 9 by tienilic acid and (±) -suprofen using (S) -flurbiprofen, diclofenac, and (S) -warfarin as reporter substrates. Although the inactivation of P 450 2 C 9 by tienilic acid when (S) -flurbiprofen and diclofenac were used as substrates was similar (efficiency of ∼ 9 ml/min/μmol), the inactivation kinetics were characterized by a sigmoidal profile. (±) -Suprofen inactivation of (S) -flurbiprofen and diclofenac hydroxylation was also described by a sigmoidal profile, although inactivation was markedly less efficient (∼ 1 ml/min/μmol). In contrast, inactivation of P 450 2 C 9 -mediated (S) -warfarin 7 -hydroxylation by tienilic acid and (±) -suprofen was best fit to a hyperbolic equation, where inactivation efficiency was moderately higher (10 ml/min/μmol) and ∼ 3 -fold higher (3 ml/min/μmol), respectively, relative {{to that of the}} other probe substrates, which argues for careful consideration of reporter substrate when mechanism-based inactivation of P 450 2 C 9 is assessed in vitro. Further investigations into the increased inactivation seen with tienilic acid relative to that with (±) -suprofen revealed that tienilic acid is a higher affinity substrate with a <b>spectral</b> binding <b>affinity</b> constant (Ks) of 2 μM and an in vitro half-life of 5 min compared with a Ks of 21 μM and a 50 min in vitro half-life for (±) -suprofen. Lastly, a close analog of tienilic acid with the carboxylate functionality replaced by an oxirane ring was devoid of inactivation properties, which suggests that an ionic binding interaction with a positively charged residue in the P 450 2 C 9 active site is critical for recognition and mechanism-based inactivation by these close structural analogs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{comparing}} clusterings both partitionally and geometrically. Our approach {{is motivated by}} the following observation: {{the vast majority of}} previous techniques for comparing clusterings are entirely partitional, i. e., they examine assignments of points in set theoretic terms after they have been partitioned. In doing so, these methods ignore the spatial layout of the data, disregarding the fact that this information is responsible for generating the clusterings to begin with. We demonstrate that this leads to a variety of failure modes. Previous comparison techniques often fail to differentiate between significant changes made in data being clustered. We formulate a new measure for comparing clusterings that combines spatial and partitional information into a single measure using optimization theory. Doing so eliminates pathological conditions in previous approaches. It also simultaneously removes common limitations, such as that each clustering must have the same number of clusters or they are over identical datasets. This approach is stable, easily implemented, and has strong intuitive appeal. spatial properties as well as their cluster membership assignments. We view a clustering as a partition of a set of points located in a space with an associated distance function. This view is natural, since popular clustering algorithms, e. g., k-means, <b>spectral</b> clustering, <b>affinity</b> propagation, etc., take as input not only a collection of points to be clustered but also a distance function on the space in which the points lie. This distance function may be specified implicitly and it may be transformed by a kernel, but it must be defined one way or another and its properties are crucial to a clustering algorithm’s output. In contrast, almost all existing clustering comparison techniques ignore the distances between points, treating clusterings as partitions of disembodied atoms. While this approach has merit under some circumstances, it seems surprising to ignore the distance func...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the human}} lung {{cytochrome}} P 450 2 A 13 (CYP 2 A 13) and its liver counterpart cytochrome P 450 2 A 6 (CYP 2 A 6) are 94 % identical in amino acid sequence, they metabolize {{a number of}} substrates with substantially different efficiencies. To determine differences in binding for a diverse set of cytochrome P 450 2 A ligands, we have measured the <b>spectral</b> binding <b>affinities</b> (KD) for nicotine, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), coumarin, 2 ′-methoxyacetophenone (MAP), and 8 -methoxypsoralen. The differences in the KD values for CYP 2 A 6 versus CYP 2 A 13 ranged from 74 -fold for 2 ′-methoxyacetophenone to 1. 1 -fold for coumarin, with CYP 2 A 13 demonstrating the higher affinity. To identify active site amino acids responsible for the differences in binding of MAP, PEITC, and coumarin, 10 CYP 2 A 13 mutant proteins were generated in which individual amino acids from the CYP 2 A 6 active site were substituted into CYP 2 A 13 at the corresponding position. Titrations revealed that substitutions at positions 208, 300, and 301 individually had the largest effects on ligand binding. The collective relevance of these amino acids to differential ligand selectivity was verified by evaluating binding to CYP 2 A 6 mutant enzymes that incorporate several of the CYP 2 A 13 amino acids at these positions. Inclusion of four CYP 2 A 13 amino acids resulted in a CYP 2 A 6 mutant protein (I 208 S/I 300 F/G 301 A/S 369 G) with binding affinities for MAP and PEITC much more similar to those observed for CYP 2 A 13 than to those for CYP 2 A 6 without altering coumarin binding.

40|$|Mapping of {{structural}} and functional connectivity may provide {{deeper understanding of}} brain function and disfunction. Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DMRI) is a powerful technique to non-invasively delineate white matter tracts and to obtain a three-dimensional description of the structural architecture of the brain. However, DMRI tractography methods produce highly multi-dimensional datasets whose interpretation requires advanced analytical tools. Indeed, manual identification of specific neuroanatomical tracts based on prior anatomical knowledge is time-consuming and prone to operator-induced bias. Here we propose an automatic multi-subject fiber clustering method that enables retrieval of group-wise white matter fiber bundles. In order to account for variance across subjects, we developed a multi-subject approach based on a method known as Dominant Sets algorithm, via an intra- and cross-subject clustering. The intra-subject step allows us to reduce {{the complexity of the}} raw tractography data, thus obtaining homogeneous neuroanatomically-plausible bundles in each diffusion space.

Quantitative analysis was conducted comparing our algorithm with <b>spectral</b> clustering and <b>affinity</b> propagation methods on synthetic dataset.

40|$|The use of {{lanthanide}} complexes for {{the detection}} of biologically relevant species such as anions, pH and metal ions has grown significantly over the past decade. Such probes offer significant advantages over conventional probes; sharp narrow emission lines encode detailed spectral information and allow ratiometric analysis, and their luminescence is long-lived allowing selective spectral acquisition. Many lanthanide-based probes operate in aqueous media, but few have been applied to intracellular measurements. The introductory chapter considers the design of lanthanide based probes for cellular applications. The fundamentals of lanthanide emission are discussed, and how the ligand structure needs to be carefully constructed to maximise emission efficiency. Reported bicarbonate- and pH-responsive probes, both lanthanide based and non-lanthanide based, are reviewed, leading to a set of proposed novel probe structures. The synthesis of these probes with further reasoning behind their design is described in chapter two. The chapter concludes with an overview of the complexes in terms of their emission spectral form, hydration number, HPLC and mass spectrometry properties. Chapter three presents work on bicarbonate-responsive probes. Through a series of <b>spectral</b> titrations, <b>affinity</b> constants for a range of anions were assessed. A high selectivity for bicarbonate was observed over other oxy-anions, and in the presence of protein. The complexes exhibited a mitochondrial localisation profile, and the europium luminescence intensity was modulated reversibly in response to pCO 2. The terbium analogues showed negligible change under such conditions, and thus a europium to terbium emission intensity ratio could be used to calibrate pCO 2. This principle was also applied to the analysis of bicarbonate levels in simulated biological fluid, and in a serum sample. Several pH-responsive complexes are described in chapter four. Key aspects of pH-probe design were highlighted in early examples, leading to the final set of probes based on reversible sulphonamide ligation. Spectral titrations were performed to assess pKa values, and the use of europium to terbium emission intensity ratios was again found to offer a convenient method for assessing pH. Unprecedented changes in CPL were found in response to pH in these systems, and gem values could be used to report upon pH. The complexes were observed to exhibit a lysosomal distribution. Finally, chapter five contains experimental procedures for each compound synthesised, as well as general experimental procedures. Both sets of complexes described in this thesis show great promise for use as well-defined intracellular probes of bicarbonate or pH. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In 2014 the number of active users on Twitter {{is reported to be}} more than 288 million users who are posting around 500 million tweets daily. Therefore, detecting topics from Twitter streams in a real time becomes a challenging task that needs scalable and efficient techniques to handle this large amount of data. In this work, we scale an Exemplar-based technique that detects topics from Twitter streams, where each of the detected topics is represented by one tweet (i. e, exemplar). Using exemplar tweets to represent the detected topics, makes these topics easier to interpret as opposed to representing them by uncorrelated terms as in other {{topic detection}} algorithms. The approach is implemented using Apache Giraph and is being extended here to efficiently support sliding windows. Experimental results on four datasets show that the optimized Giraph implementation achieves a speedup of up to nineteen times over the native implementation, while maintaining good quality of the detected topics. In addition, Giraph Exemplar-based approach achieves the best topic recall and term precision against K-means, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), while maintaining a good term recall and running time. The approach is also deployed for detecting topics from real-time Twitter streams and its scalability is demonstrated.

Yet we experimentally observed that the oxidation potentials of 3 a similar to 3 e shifted by ca. - 200 mV in the presence of anions such as CH 3 CO 2 - and F- in acetonitrile and the chemical shifts of the ferrocene aromatic protons shifted to high field upon anion binding to the thiourea moiety in 3 a similar to 3 e.
