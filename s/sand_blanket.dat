Then, model predictions are compared with observations made during a fully instrumented field DR trial. The respective laboratory tests utilized to extract the model parameters certainly confirmed the applicability of the chosen constitutive models for the relevant geomaterials involved in the field DR test. Furthermore, the analytical predictions of the drop hammer displacement and acceleration, as well as pore pressures and lateral displacements in the drop hammer vicinity, agree reasonably well with those observed during the full-scale field DR.

40|$|Vertical drains {{combined}} with vacuum pressure and surcharge preloading {{are widely used}} to accelerate the consolidation process of soft clay in order to decrease the pore pressure {{as well as to}} increase the effective stress. Currently {{there are two types of}} vacuum preloading systems commercially available; (a) membrane system with an airtight membrane over the drainage layer and, (b) membraneless system where a vacuum system is connected to individual drain.

This study presents the analytical solutions of vertical drains with vacuum preloading for both membrane and membraneless systems. According to the field and laboratory observations, the vacuum in both of the membraneless and membrane system was assumed to be decreasing along the drain whereas in the membrane system, it was maintained at a constant level.

40|$|To reduce {{railway track}} {{maintenance}} costs {{and meet the}} growing demand for rail travel the railway industry needs to significantly increase the performance of old existing tracks and design any new tracks accordingly. In this thesis, a new full-scale laboratory Geopavement & Railway Accelerated Fatigue Testing (GRAFT) facility at Heriot-Watt University is developed to study the performance of both unreinforced and reinforced railway track substructure systems. The new GRAFT facility enables accelerated testing of full-scale railway tracks and innovative railway products under realistic railway loading conditions. The unreinforced track systems represent typical railway tracks in the UK while the reinforced track systems represent sections of track implemented with various geosynthetic products. GRAFT consists of a track constructed within a steel tank. The track comprises a 750 mm clay subgrade layer overlain by a clay formation layer overlain by a 300 mm ballast layer. The track includes three hardwood sleeper sections overlain by an I-section steel beam which has similar stiffness properties to a BS 113 A rail section. Cyclic loading {{is applied to the}} track from a hydraulic testing machine with the centre sleeper directly under the loading actuator. The loading mechanism replicates a repeated quasi static single wheel load on the central sleeper of one half of a 3 m long section of railway track. Based on the results found from the testing programme in GRAFT empirical relationships are developed between the unreinforced track performance in terms of track settlement and stiffness and the subgrade modulus, applied load and number of applied cycles. These relationships fit the GRAFT data presented in this thesis well and it is thought that they could be used (tentatively) to estimate track settlement on track after tamping/ballast renewal/new track. These relationships are shown to be consistent with other well known track settlement models and they indicate that subgrade stiffness and applied vertical load are two of the most significant parameters that influence track substructure deterioration. The results found from the reinforced track tests quantify the improvement in track performance available with each product under various track conditions. Two ballast ii reinforcement products have been tested; XiTRACK reinforcement and geocell reinforcement, along with a reinforced geocomposite used primarily for separation at the ballast/subgrade interface. In addition, a geocomposite product designed to replace a traditional <b>sand</b> <b>blanket,</b> used on the tracks where severe subgrade erosion conditions prevail, has been tested in GRAFT under flooding conditions. The most significant results show that XiTRACK reinforcement can considerably improve the performance of railway tracks while the performance of the track implemented with the <b>sand</b> <b>blanket</b> replacement product indicates that currently a traditional <b>sand</b> <b>blanket</b> with a geotextile separator is the recommended option for tracks with subgrade wet spots. From all the data recorded empirical settlement models are proposed for each of the geosynthetics compared for reinforcement purposes. These models form the basis for reinforced track design graphs that could potentially be used to form part of an initial cost-benefit analysis of different track reinforcement techniques considered for improving track performance and reducing maintenance. In order to use the track settlement design graphs developed within this thesis (in the field) a reliable measure of subgrade stiffness needs to be made on track. A reliable insitu measuring device could enhance railway site investigations. Several in-situ measuring devices that could potentially be used to measures subgrade stiffness and strength in the field have been tested within GRAFT. The devices studied include the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP), Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD), Pocket Penetrometer and Proving Ring Penetrometer. The accuracy of these devices is compared to Plate Load Tests (PLT) and unconfined compression strength tests and suggestions towards the use of such devices on track made. The results indicate that the DCP {{has the potential to be}} a quick and accurate in-situ measuring device for railway track site investigations. The GRAFT facility and the results found in GRAFT have been validated using a basic static 3 D FE computer model termed SART 3 D (Static Analysis of Railway Track 3 D). The program has been calibrated to GRAFT by modifying the FE mesh for the dimensions of GRAFT and inputting the GRAFT track properties. The validated results from this thesis have direct practical implications to the railway industry in terms of iii design recommendations on how best to investigate and improve key geotechnical parameters that influence railway track performance and hence reduce maintenance costs and extend asset life. A review of current design procedures used in the railway industry is given and a new design procedure is suggested to reduce track maintenance and offer an optimised design and maintenance strategy...|$|E

40|$|The marine Eucla basin in {{southern}} Australia {{is emerging as}} a major new heavy minerals province in Australia. Beach placers {{are associated with a}} series of partially buried Cenozoic coastal barrier sands formed along an arcuate 2, 000 -km-long basin margin, the trace of which is up to 320 km inland of the present coastline. The presence of high-grade deposits with dominant zircon over ilmenite and lesser amounts of rutile and leucoxene was established with the discovery of the Jacinth and Ambrosia heavy mineral deposits in late 2004. An additional 10 heavy mineral prospects were subsequently identified and are at various stages of evaluation. The Eucla basin and its adjacent paleovalley system have a large areal extent that contains a complicated succession of marine and non marine strata spanning a wide range of depositional environments. Four distinct constructional phases for the development of shorelines can be recognized and correlated with major third-order sea-level events, established by others from the marine depositional record as occurring during the middle Eocene (∼ 42. 5 Ma), late middle Eocene (39 - 36 Ma), late Eocene (36 - 34 Ma), and Miocene-Pliocene (15 - 2. 6 Ma). Prevailing westerly winds built extensive dune systems by longshore drift. Sediment movement was from west to east. Detrital zircon rocks from the Ooldea and Barton barriers show a distribution of zircon age that is consistent with the Proterozoic Musgrave province {{to the north of the}} basin as the dominant primary source area of the heavy minerals, with a contribution from the Albany Fraser orogen to the west. The likelihood is that these heavy minerals have been recycled via sedimentary basins that flank the Musgrave province and include the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer basin and Permian to Mesozoic deposits of the Bight basin. Our current depositional model is summarized as follows: (1) initial rapid transgression and deposition of a shallow marine sand sheet subsequently overlain by shallow marine limestone during middle Eocene; (2) a major Eocene transgression and deposition of a shelf barrier and lagoonal shoreface marine complex during the late middle Eocene; (3) further transgression and highstand deposition during the late Eocene; (4) renewed transgression of barrier lagoonal and possibly flooding deltaic <b>sand</b> <b>blanket</b> in the southeastern coastal plain with neotectonic uplift tilting in the western Eucla margin during Mio-Pliocene time.

40|$|The trace fossil Macaronichnus segregatis is {{interpreted}} {{to be produced}} by opheliid polychaetes that feed on epigranular microbes and organic matter commonly abundant in shallow-marine foreshore sands. Resulting traces are horizontal and typically random in orientation, but sometimes perpendicular to the shoreline. However, M. segregatis in Neogene sandy sediments from Santa Maria Island in the Azores shows a vertical or sub-vertical orientation. This is explained by vertical flow of pore waters and oxygenation fluctuations within the mixing zone between interstitial marine and freshwater aquifers-where epigranular microbes and organic matter are most enriched. On reefless volcanic oceanic islands like the Azores, insular shelves are invariably steep, narrow, and exposed to strong swell. Aquifers in this setting respond rapidly to small changes on account of limited shelf space and a high potential differential that stimulates a vertical shift in habitats. Freshwater aquifers on small, low-relief oceanic islands form a thin lens, the edges of which are wedged against marine interstitial waters and migrate {{up and down in}} response to changes caused by tides, storm surges and precipitation. During the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene, Santa Maria was an island fitting this description. Due to a waning volcanism, intense marine erosion and gradual submersion, the island developed a wide shallow platform covered by sandy shoals, as exemplified by the Malbusca section with vertical Macaronichnus. The process, however, is more acute on small, reflective beaches perched on rocky island coasts. Here, <b>sand</b> <b>blankets</b> cover small ramps cut in the basaltic bedrock, resulting in very limited freshwater aquifers subject to strong changes due to the low permeability of basalts. The mixing zone is therefore forced to migrate chiefly up and down, mostly due to tides. The same response is dramatic in sandy fillings trapped in basalt fissures. As a consequence, the producer of Macaronichnus was tightly constrained in movement. Both situations occur in the "Pedra-que-pica" section on Santa Maria...|$|R

40|$|The Scarborough Formation is the {{youngest}} marine horizon of formation status within the dominantly deltaic Aalenian - Bajocian Ravenscar Group, Cleveland Basin, northeast England. Sedimentary facies analysis has been performed on the three conformable lithostratigraphic units which make {{up the bulk of}} the Scarborough Formation outcrop: Blea Wyke, Byland Limestone and Crinoid Grit Members. This form of analysis was performed in an effort to determine the depositional environments of the members. The information derived from the study enables one to trace the palaeogeographic evolution of the Cleveland Basin throughout much of Scarborough Formation times. The clastic Blea Wyke Member [6 facies] is attributed to deposition in a shallow [< 4 m], essentially microtidal,delta-destructive marine embayment. This embayment formed through non-eustatic marine transgression initiated by the compactional subsidence of an abandoned [Gristhorpe Member] delta lobe. Open to the east, the embayment covered some 2000 km 2 of the Cleveland Basin when fully established. A range of sand bodies evolved on the silty embayment floor in response to spatial and temporal changes in the wind-forced wave and current regime. These sand bodies included subtidal shoals, laterally extensive storm-emplaced <b>sand</b> <b>blankets,</b> and a classic delta-destructive sheet sand formed through the landward translation of a low-profile barrier bar. Under sustained rate-of-subsidence controlled marine transgression, clastic input to the Blea Wyke Member embayment eventually waned. In response, the overlying Byland Limestone Member [6 facies] was deposited {{in the western part of}} the Cleveland Basin in the form of a carbonate-dominated lagoon-barrier-inner shelf  complex. The barrier component of the complex evolved through transgressive upward-shoaling under the influence of wind-forced wave and current activity. Composed of pellet lime grainstones, it protected a lagoon within which the dominant deposits were pellet lime mudstones, wackestones and packstones. Lithological and faunal similarities between the lagoon and inner shelf suggest that much of the shelf region may have comprised former back-barrier lagoon-fills exhumed during transgression. Byland Limestone Member times were terminated by an acceleration in the rate of marine transgression followed by tectonic uplift and subsequent geomorphic decay of the major landmass to the north [Mid North Sea High]. Transgression generated an east-west orientated epeiric seaway connecting the Sole Pit Trough with an areally restricted Pennine Massif. Within this seaway, clastic sediment derived chiefly from the Mid North Sea High was deposited in the form of a progradational, regional-scale composite sheet sand body: the Crinoid Grit Member [8 facies]. Deposition occurred under the combined influence of tidal currents, wind-forced currents and wave activity. Three main facies belts are recognised: paralic tidal sandwave complex, storm-dominated inner shelf and sandy middle shelf. The presence of a tidal sandwave complex is particularly interesting; it indicates that the forging of a marine connection to the west of the Cleveland Basin was necessary before tidal cyclicity could become prominent within the basin...|$|R

40|$|Florida's {{population}} growth creates ever-increasing pres-sures on the state's springs and other fragile water resources. This drawing illustrates {{many of the}} complex relationships that exist between a Florida community and the environment which sustains it. Water for various uses is withdrawn from subsurface limestones which are extremely porous and permeable. Ground water which resides in these limestones is naturally protected from various types of con-taminants by a widespread confining layer (intermediate confining unit) which is predominantly clay. The situation {{is complicated by the}} presence of discontinuous carbonate lenses (the intermediate aquifer system) and fractures with-in the confining layer. Limestone is vulnerable to extensive dissolution leading to the development of sinkholes which may breach the confining unit in the process of their forma-tion. This same dissolution process results in the formation of large springs and the conduit systems that supply water to them. Springs are highly prized features of Florida’s environ-ment that discharge large amounts of ground water. The spring pictured here includes as part of its recharge mecha-nism, a newly formed sinkhole, ostensibly distant from it. Precipitation over a large area moves down through soil and sand into fractures that eventually are connected to spring-feeding conduits. Surficial sands and clayey <b>sands</b> which <b>blanket</b> the confining layer are subject to major impacts resulting from human activities. Subsurface storage tanks will be buried within them, municipal solid waste will be dis-posed into them and locally, small domestic wells may be drilled into them where their permeability and porosity make them a viable surficial aquifer (surficial aquifer system).

40|$|We {{present the}} results of K-feldspar IRSL dating of the four lower {{terraces}} (T 3 –T 6) of the Portuguese Tejo River, in the Arripiado-Chamusca area. Terrace correlation was based upon: a) analysis of aerial photographs, geomorphological mapping and field topographic survey; b) sedimentology of the deposits; and c) luminescence dating. Sediment sampled for luminescence dating gave unusually high dose rates, of between 3. 4 and 6. 2 Gy/ka and, as a result, quartz OSL was often found to be in saturation. We therefore used the IRSL signal from K-feldspar as the principal luminescence technique. The K-feldspar age results support sometimes complex geomorphic correlations, as fluvial terraces have been vertically displaced by faults (known from previous studies). Integration of these new ages with those obtained previously in the more upstream reaches of the Tejo River in Portugal indicates that the corrected K-feldspar IRSL ages are stratigraphically and geomorphologically consistent over a distance of 120 km along the Tejo valley. However, we are sceptical of {{the accuracy of the}} K-feldspar ages of samples from the T 3 and T 4 terraces (with uncorrected De values > 500 Gy). In these cases the Dose Rate Correction (DRC) model puts the natural signals close to luminescence saturation, giving a minimum corrected De of about 1000 Gy, and thus minimum terrace ages; this may even be true for those doses > 200 Gy. Luminescence dating results suggest that: T 3 is older than 300 ka, probably ca. 420 – 360 ka (wMarine Isotope Stage [MIS] 11); T 4 is ca. 340 – 150 ka (wMIS 9 - 6); T 5 is 136 – 75 ka (wMIS 5); T 6 is 60 – 30 ka (MIS 3); an aeolian <b>sand</b> unit that <b>blankets</b> T 6 and some of the older terraces is 30 – 12 ka.

Geochemical data and petrographic analysis indicate that the clastic rocks have graywacke, arkose, and quartz arenite protoliths, and the carbonate rocks were originally laminated, silty limestone and dolomite of possible algal origin. The composite section displays lithologic and stratigraphic similarities to terrigenous detrital sequences of Upper Precambrian (Late Proterozoic) and Lower Cambrian age in the Caborca region of central Sonora, Mexico. In particular, Unit G and units 0 through F exhibit affinities to the Proveedora Quartzite and Puerto Blanco Formation, respectively. The correlations indicate that the pre-batholithic rocks of San Felipe {{are part of the}} 100 initial miogeoclinal deposits of the Cordilleran geosyncline, and indicate at least 500 meters of originally southward-thickening strata between the two areas. Positioned 100 to 150 kilometers south of the recognized exposures of the Caborca terrane, the thickening trend implies a southward direction of transport for upper Precambrian to Lower Cambrian strata in northwestern Mexico. The orientation of this trend is approximately 1200 to the northwestward depositional direction of the geosyncline in the western United States, suggesting that the craton margin possessed a corner in southwesternmost United States or northwestern Mexico...|$|R
