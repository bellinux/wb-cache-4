50|$|The {{braking system}} {{consisted}} of a hand-powered <b>spindle</b> <b>brake</b> operating on the tender axles, and a Hardy-type vacuum brake operating on {{the first and third}} coupled axles and both tender axles. For service on the inclined sections, a supplementary counter-pressure brake of Riggenbach type was fitted.|$|E
50|$|There was proper {{shielding}} of {{the operator}} from chuck contact, coolant and flying swarf. Both leadscrews ran in sealed oil baths. The apron {{was of a}} totally novel design. The leadscrew engaged with a worm wheel {{instead of the usual}} halfnuts. The apron gear system could engage every metric and imperial thread directly and automatically. The leadscrew could be disengaged for each cut without losing register. This made it easy to turn and thread directly against an endstop, even into blind holes. Accordingly, the lathe was equipped with an assortment of endstops both for the saddle and crossfeed. The endstop trip mechanism had a sensitive adjustment. There was a foot-operated emergency stop and <b>spindle</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
40|$|Mechanism brakes {{rotation}} {{with minimal}} shock. Balls rising on spiral ramp generate large axial force on brake friction plates, thereby generating large braking torque. Counter triggers rise of ball. Brake used to automatically stop control mechanisms on aircraft and ships. Serves as <b>spindle</b> <b>brake</b> on machine tool. On robot, prevents overtravel of arm or holds it in fixed position...|$|E
50|$|Brake linings {{can also}} be found just about {{everywhere}} there are braking systems, from elevator safety <b>brakes</b> to <b>spindle</b> <b>brakes</b> inside a VCR. The form and materials are frequently different, but the principle is the same.|$|R
5000|$|The mid-1950s {{and early}} 1960s custom Deuce was {{typically}} fenderless and steeply chopped, {{and almost all}} Ford (or Mercury, with the [...] flatty, introduced in 1939); a Halibrand quick-change rearend was also typical, and an Edelbrock intake manifold or Harman and Collins ignition magneto would not be uncommon. Reproduction <b>spindles,</b> <b>brake</b> drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today. [...] Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro, Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a [...] "slingshot" [...] design for the flatty. [...] Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts. The first Jimmy supercharger on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.|$|R

Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced by another; the 1937 Buick grille was often used on a Ford. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 De Soto.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{used the}} <b>spindles</b> and disc <b>brake</b> assemblies of the Ford Cortina mk4/5, with bespoke wishbones and coil over dampers. The Ford Escort mk2 supplied the {{rack and pinion}} steering rack. At the rear, the donor Moto Guzzi or Honda motorcycle suspension was used with its twin coil over dampers, brakes, and transfer case.|$|R
50|$|Unsprung weight {{transfer}} is calculated {{based on the}} weight of the vehicle's components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, <b>brakes,</b> <b>spindles,</b> half the control arm's weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The {{weight transfer}} for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.|$|R
25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the <b>spindle</b> and the <b>braking</b> magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut {{into the side of}} the disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|R
