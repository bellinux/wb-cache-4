In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later seen on a boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E

This figure was beaten in the 1912 Grand Final when 54,463 saw Essendon defeat South Melbourne. The big finals crowds (and increasing cricket attendances) prompted the MCC to cut down the eleven fifty-year-old elm trees inside the ground and turn the stadium into a concrete bowl, complete with extra stands and standing room. The record fell again in the last grand final before World War I, when the excitement of St Kilda's first premiership attempt drew 59,479 spectators.|$|E

In November, Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, led his people to Fort Brooke, where they were to board ships to go west. This was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles.

25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim. It features a group of rootless and bored young couples who {{spend much of their}} time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply <b>sitting</b> <b>around.</b> The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity {{on the part of the}} women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. Katzelmacher was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.|$|E

25|$|Indonesia {{seems to}} have been a travel {{destination}} for centuries. Some panels in Borobudur bas-reliefs depicted drink vendors, warungs (small restaurant), tavern or lodging where people drinking and dancing. The historical record about travel in Indonesia can be found since 14th century. The Nagarakretagama reported about King Hayam Wuruk's royal travel throughout Majapahit realm in East Java with large numbers of carriages, accompanied by nobles, royal courtiers, officials and servants. Although it seems as stately affair, for some instances the king's journey is somewhat resembles modern day tour, as the king visited numbers of interesting places; from temples such as Palah and Jajawa, to enjoying mountain scenery, having bath in petirtaan (bathing pools) and beach. The 15th-century travelogue of Bujangga Manik, a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from Pakuan Pajajaran, reported about his travel around Java and Bali. Although his travel was a pilgrimage one; visiting temples and sacred places in Java and Bali, sometimes he behaves like a modern-day tourist, such as <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> fanning his body while enjoying beautiful mountain scenery in Puncak area, look upon Gede volcano that he describes as the highest point around Pakuan Pajajaran (capital of Sunda kingdom).|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to {{pay a visit to}} one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the money to go to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E

He brought the heroes of ancient Greece and the soldier dead in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. It was terrific and the Panthers sat, spellbound.

500|$|The band's third album, Fables of the Reconstruction (1985), {{demonstrated}} {{a change in}} direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, {{who had worked with}} Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up. The gloominess surrounding the sessions ended up providing the context for the album itself. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of Southern mythology, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by [...] "the whole idea of the old men <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> the fire, passing on...legends and fables to the grandchildren".|$|E
