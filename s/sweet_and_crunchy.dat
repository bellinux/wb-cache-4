In homage to the name, some varieties of fukujinzuke consists of seven different kind of vegetables, adding sword beans (natamame), perilla, shiitake mushrooms and/or sesame seeds to the four main ingredients. Lotus root is sometimes replaced with the similarly <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> <b>crunchy</b> carrot, and the red varieties often add sliced beetroot for color.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Anderson on Allmusic {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, awarding it {{four out of}} five stars. Anderson stated: [...] "The Dollyrots are certainly nothing new -- no genre-transgressing experiments, no incongruous fusions, no mind-expanding instrumental solos or side-long suites. Just 13 tight, compact, <b>sweet,</b> <b>and</b> <b>crunchy</b> bursts of punky power pop". Anderson also praised singer Kelly Ogden, saying that [...] "her voice is clear and sharp, and her delivery is by turns sweet and snotty." [...] Hunter Felt on PopMatters wrote [...] "What Eat My Heart Out does have are elements missing in most paint-by-numbers pop-punk: a sense of true fun, not the forced and contrived [...] "fun" [...] of the Blink-182 wannabes, and an infectious energy", adding that the band [...] "actually {{seem to be able to}} translate their well-regarded live shows onto a disc without sacrificing the spontaneity their music requires".|$|E
50|$|Raw water {{chestnuts}} {{are slightly}} <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> very <b>crunchy.</b> Boiled water chestnuts have a firm <b>and</b> slightly <b>crunchy</b> texture, {{with a very}} mild and slightly nutty flavour that may easily be overpowered by seasonings or sauces with which the water chestnut is served or cooked. They often are combined with bamboo shoots, coriander, ginger, sesame oil, and snow peas. Steamed or sauteed vegetable medleys frequently contain water chestnuts. They often are used in noodle or rice dishes.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} of apple cultivars resistant to scab, {{one of the}} main diseases of fruit tree, started 70 years ago. Nonetheless, growers have been slow planting them because of the uncertainty of consumer acceptance linked to their sensory properties. Scab-resistant apples have the advantage to be more easily cultivated in organic farming as offering a higher disease control. Moreover, these kinds of apples produced in sustainable agriculture seem to have potentialities on the market since they meet expectations of ecology-oriented consumers [1 - 3]. The goal of the present study is to assess the sensory quality of scab-resistant apples cultivated in both organic and conventional farming in order to support their diffusion among local growers. The study included 3 scab-resistant apple cultivars (Crimson Crisp, Dalinette and Fujion) grown under organic or conventional conditions in different parcels of the same field and in two locations (A- 203 m and B- 656 m a. s. l.). Fruits were analysed after two-months of conservation in refrigerated conditions. The samples were evaluated by 18 trained judges using the conventional profile method with a 33 -attribute list (odours, texture and flavours). Apple samples were prepared and presented anonymously in a randomised balanced order. The panel described and differentiated the 3 cultivars: Crimson Crisp is sourer <b>and</b> <b>crunchier,</b> Fuji is <b>sweeter</b> <b>and</b> Dalinette more floury. Results also show that cultivation practices seem to have an effect on Crimson Crisp: organic apples were perceived <b>sweeter</b> <b>and</b> <b>crunchier.</b> Interestingly, the opposite influence on texture attributes was found for Fuji samples. The location effect impacted the texture of all samples (decrease of hardness and crunchiness, increase of flouriness when increasing the altitude) but in a less pronounced manner for Dalinette. The effects of cultivation practice and location/altitude on sensory profile of scab-resistant apples revealed to be cultivar-dependant. A confirmation of these results with other varieties and different year production is considerated as a prospectiv...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to compare fruit morphology, physico-chemistry and bioactive compounds content of the edible pulp of six Mammea americana accessions. The results showed that this fruit was rather big, weighing on average 600 to 1100 g depending on the accession, and spherical to oblate-shaped. The pulp represented between 50 and 70 % {{of the weight of}} the whole fruit. The pulp adhered only partially to the seeds in 5 of the 6 accessions studied, while the last one exhibited full adherence. The fresh pulp was acidic, <b>sweet,</b> succulent <b>and</b> <b>crunchy.</b> The fruits studied had a variety of qualities, providing various opportunities for post-harvest uses: fruit salads, nectar preparation, jams and jellies, or export. We have established {{for the first time the}} total phenolic compounds and total flavonoids contents in the pulp of mamey apple fruits. The pulp colour was highly correlated with total phenolic compounds and total carotenoids contents...|$|R

30|$|Hypsizygus marmoreus (Peck.) Bigelow (Tricholomataceae), {{also known}} as bunashimeji and hon-shimeji, has been {{successfully}} and commercially cultivated in East Asia (Akavia et al. 2006). In China, H. marmoreus has become increasingly popular due to its mild, <b>sweet,</b> nutty flavor <b>and</b> <b>crunchy</b> texture {{as well as some}} physiologically beneficial components. Nowadays, the substrates used for culturing mushrooms from plants, such as sawdust, corncob and wheat bran, are usually contaminated. Contaminations will severely inhibit mushroom growth, which may reduce the fruit body production. If the contaminations, such as heavy metals, are accumulated in crop plants, they will also accumulate in the fruit body of mushroom, posing a severe threat to human health through food chains (Järup and Åkesson 2009; Podazza et al. 2012).|$|R

Veronese Vialone Nano Rice from Verona (PGI) {{is a type of}} rice with short, plump grains, which have a creamy consistency when cooked.

30|$|The idea of {{language}} acquisition has long occupied {{the minds of}} philosophers, linguists, and psychologists. Behaviorist proponents argued that language acquisition occurs through repeated successful associations made between stimulus and response (Hutchinson and Waters 1987). On the other hand, nativists believed that language acquisition is governed by an innate universal grammar which genetically determines the process of acquisition (Brown 1994). Early attempts to establish a non-nativist outlook on a child’s language acquisition concentrated on the frequency of use for first acquired words and their semantic complexity (Nelson 1977). Afterwards, usage-based theorists (e.g., Tomasello 2003) proposed that saliency is a noteworthy element. From a different perspective, Greenspan and Shanker (2004) argued that it is affect that prevents the social cognitive approach from falling back into a nativist’s paradigm. Furthermore, affective experience is the critical missing fragment which determines word saliency for {{a child in the}} usage-based aspect. Thus, a word like “mommy” is learned not only based on its high frequency, but also on the emotions (joy, love, satisfaction, etc.) that are associated with the word. Similarly, “apple” is not simply a fruit that is round and red; it conveys the notion of an enjoyable snack for many people since it is <b>sweet,</b> juicy, <b>and</b> <b>crunchy</b> (Greenspan <b>and</b> Shanker 2004).|$|R
40|$|The low {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} consumption identified by the World Health Organization is a significant factor for adverse health consequences, like obesity and noncommunicable diseases. In the worldwide effort of boosting {{fruit and vegetable}} consumption to at least five servings {{of fruits and vegetables}} per day (5 -A-Day), healthy, mildly <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> salty dried <b>crunchy</b> vegetable snacks can add up increasing attractiveness of vegetables among youngsters. The objectives of this research were to obtain <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> salty dried parsnip snacks, pretreated with concentrated whey (CW) and concentrated hydrolyzed whey (HW), to study the influence of osmotic pressure and temperature (45, 55 and 65 °C) on the convective drying process and to estimate the kinetic parameters (diffusion coefficients, activation energy) of parsnip drying. Nonlinear regression models were applied to estimate the drying parameters based on Henderson - Pabis equations. Results have shown that the activation energy required during drying by the chips treated with HW (23. 89 kJ·mol- 1) and CW (20. 06 kJ·mol- 1) is lower than in the reference sample (31. 02 kJ·mol- 1). Moreover, these represents a smart valorization of a by product from dairy industry rich in valuable minerals, proteins and sugars in the veggie industry...|$|R
