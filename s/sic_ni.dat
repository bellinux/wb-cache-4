The thermal shift rate of epitaxial graphene on 6 H-SiC(0001) is found to be about three times that of freestanding graphene. This result is explained quantitatively as a consequence of pinning by the substrate. In contrast, graphene grown on polycrystalline Ni films is shown to be unpinned, i. e., to behave elastically as freestanding, despite the relatively strong interaction with the metal substrate.

30|$|A {{graphitization}} {{temperature of}} ~ 1473  K or higher, however, {{is still too}} high to be fully compatible with Si technology. Several {{attempts have been made}} to reduce the graphitization temperature of GOS, including the addition of a small amount of oxygen [24] or monosilane [25] into the vacuum used for the graphitization annealing. Although these methods succeeded in forming epitaxial graphene at ~ 1273  K, the graphene quality was much lower than that of the conventional GOS and EG methods. Recently, low-temperature (~ 973  K) formation of EG on SiC bulk crystals has been reported by Escobedo-Cousin et al. [26], who utilized a solid-phase chemical reaction between <b>SiC</b> and <b>Ni.</b> In fact, the formation of a “thin graphite layer” at low temperatures had been reported for ohmic-contact fabrication on <b>SiC</b> using <b>Ni,</b> well before [27] or at around the same time [28] of the rise of the graphene fever in the mid- 2000 s. Although these earlier studies suggested nickel silicide formation at the Ni/SiC interface and subsequent emission of excessive C atoms as a possible mechanism of the graphite formation, little is known about the details of the process. It has also been unclear whether this method is applicable to the GOS process, i.e., on 3 C-SiC films. Here, we report the first application of this Ni-assisted graphene formation to GOS. Moreover, solid-phase reactions during heating/annealing/cooling procedures have been investigated in detail by using in situ synchrotron-radiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SR-XPS). Angle-resolved (AR) analysis was also utilized to clarify the stacking order of the layers. As a result, we demonstrate that this Ni-assisted method is equally applicable to 3 C-SiC thin films (GOS), where graphene forms at temperatures less than 1273  K. We also clarify the role of Ni/SiC reactions, in which not only the formation of Ni silicide but also Ni carbonization is suggested as a key process in the formation of graphene.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Practical {{design of}} {{high-voltage}} SiC Schottky recti-fiers {{requires an understanding}} of the device physics that affect the key performance parameters. Forward characteristics of SiC Schottky rectifiers follow thermionic emission theory and are relatively well understood. However, the reverse characteristics are not well understood and have not been experimentally in-vestigated in-depth. In this paper we report the analysis and experimental results of both the forward and reverse char-acteristics of high-voltage SiC Schottky rectifiers. Ti and Ni Schottky rectifiers with boron implant edge termination were fabricated on n-type 4 H <b>SiC</b> samples. <b>Ni</b> Schottky rectifiers fabricated on a 13 -m thick 3 : 51015 cm 3 nitrogen doped epilayer have a current density of 100 A/cm 2 at approximately 2 V forward bias and a reverse leakage current density of less than 0. 1 A/cm 2 at a reverse bias of 1720 V. The reverse leakage current is observed to depend on device area, Schottky barrier height, electric field at the metal-semiconductor interface, and temperature (a decreasing temperature dependence with increasing reverse bias). In addition, the reverse leakage current magnitude is larger and the electric field dependence is stronger than predicted by thermionic emission and image-force barrier height lowering. This suggests the reverse leakage current is due to a combination of thermionic field emission and field emission.

40|$|Silicon carbide is a {{promising}} wide bandgap semiconductormaterial for high-temperature, high-power, and high-frequencydevice applications. However, {{there are still}} a number offactors that are limiting the device performance. Among them,one of the most important and critical factors is the formationof low resistivity Ohmic contacts and high-temperature stableSchottky diodes on silicon carbide. In this thesis, different metals (TiW, Ti, TiC, Al, and Ni) and different deposition techniques (sputtering andevaporation) were suggested and investigated for this purpose. Both electrical and material characterizations were performedusing various techniques, such as I-V, C-V, RBS, XRD, XPS,LEED, SEM, AFM, and SIMS. For the Schottky contacts to n- and p-type 4 H-SiC, sputteredTiW Schottky contacts had excellent rectifying behavior afterannealing at 500 ºC in vacuum with a thermally stableideality factor of 1. 06 and 1. 08 for n- and p-type,respectively. It was also observed that the SBH for p-type SiC(ΦBp) strongly depends on the choice the metal with alinear relationship ΦBp= 4. 51 - 0. 58 Φm, indicating no strong Fermi-level pinning. Finally, the behavior of Schottky diodes was investigated byincorporation of size-selected Au nano-particles in Ti Schottkycontacts on silicon carbide. The reduction of the SBH isexplained by using a simple dipole layer approach, withenhanced electric field at the interface due to the small sizeof the circular patch (Au nano-particles) and large differenceof the barrier height between two metals (Ti and Au) on both n-and p-SiC. For the Ohmic contacts, titanium carbide (TiC) was used ascontacts to both n- and p-type 4 H-SiC epilayers as well as onAl implanted layers. The TiC contacts were epitaxiallydeposited using a co-evaporation method with an e-beam Tisource and a Knudsen cell for C 60, in a UHV system at low substrate temperature(500 ºC).

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of semiconductor nanowires {{has been studied}} intensively worldwide for {{a wide spectrum of}} materials. Such low-dimensional nanostructures are not only interesting for fundamental research due to their unique structural and physical properties relative to their bulk counterparts, but also offer fascinating potential for future technological applications. Deeper understanding and sufficient control of the growth of nanowires are central to the current research interest. The objective of the thesis work is synthesizing semiconductor nanowires using various growth processes, with a focus on the spontaneous growth process, which offers an opportunity for the control of spatial positioning of nanowires. Zinc oxide (ZnO) based and Silicon carbide (SiC) based nanowires have been concentrated to synthesize using vapor-solid (VS) and vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) techniques respectively. ZnO is one of very interesting semiconductor material because of its physical and chemical properties. Also, {{it is well known that}} high n-type conductivity can be achieved by alloying zinc oxide with group III elements (such as Al, In or Ga) in ternary or even quaternary oxide compounds, in order to obtain transparent conducting oxides (TCOs). In this part of work, there were two major materials have been synthesized such as vertically aligned ZnO nanorods and ternary Zn(In,Ga,Sn) O nanorods using vapor phase technique. First, solution-free and catalyst-free vertically aligned ZnO nanorods have been synthesized by thermal CVD reactor at relatively low temperature (< 500 °C) to produce high-surface 3 D photoanode on glass substrate. Different TCOs films such as Al doped ZnO films deposited by PED, RF-sputtering techniques and ITO were considered for the growth as starting seeding layer for the nanorods. The aim of this work is mainly focused to control the thickness and length of these nanostructures by varying not only the growth parameters, such as amount of Zn evaporation, but also substrate characteristics, such as grain size of Al doped ZnO and ITO seeding films. Second, Indium Zinc oxide nanorods (IZO-NRs) have been obtained at temperatures lower than 500 °C using same CVD system, with a resulting indium concentration larger than 1 %. The growth of these ternary oxide nanostructures has been obtained at relatively low temperature, starting from the corresponding metals, thanks to the direct deposition on the growth substrate of an In layer, which in its molten state and upon mixture with Zn acts as growth seed. The obtained indium concentration corresponds to the value required to get metallic behavior and make this ternary oxide a TCO (transparent conducting oxide), while the used temperature range makes it compatible also with commercial glass substrates. Same technique have been used to obtain GaZnO and SnZnO nanostructures. Among many kind of semiconductor, SiC is an important wide band gap IV-IV semiconducting material and it exhibit excellent, unique physical and mechanical properties at nano-scale, which lead to their potential applications for being used as the building blocks in nanoelectronics and nanooptoelectronics. Also, it has biocompatibility and inertness can be exploited for biomedical applications. In this part of work, there were two types of SiC nanowires have been synthesized using VLS growth technique. First, Cubic SiC nanowires were successfully grown using home-made induction heated Vapor Phase Epitaxy (VPE) reactor on Si (100) and Si (111) substrate using nickel (Ni) and Iron (Fe) as a catalysts. The main aim of this work is to optimize the condition to grow <b>SiC</b> nanowires with <b>Ni</b> and Fe catalyst. The size and shape of the nanowires has been controlled using temperature and gas flow rate. Second, self-assembled SiC core with SiO 2 shell coaxial nanowires using Ni and Fe catalyst have been synthesized by thermal CVD reactor. The growth conditions were optimized for both catalyst using temperature, gas flow rate. This SiC /SiO 2 coaxial core/shell nanowires (NWs) are intriguing as novel nanostructured to be functionalized because of the 3 C-SiC biocompatibility and of the presence of a SiO 2 native shell that favours surface functionalization. Those findings are encouraging in the prospective to employ this functionalized system for different nano-medical applications such as targeted therapy against deep tumor cells...|$|R
