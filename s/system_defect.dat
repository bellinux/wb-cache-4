40|$|Software systems evolve {{over time}} due {{to changes in}} requirements, {{optimization}} of code, fixes for security and reliability bugs etc. Code churn, which measures the changes made to a component {{over a period of}} time, quantifies the extent of this change. We present a technique for early prediction of <b>system</b> <b>defect</b> density using a set of relative code churn measures that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as component size and the temporal extent of churn. Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute measures of code churn are poor predictors of defect density, our set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early indicators of <b>system</b> <b>defect</b> density. Furthermore, our code churn metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not faultprone binaries with an accuracy of 89. 0 percent...|$|E

40|$|Progressive {{multifocal}} leukoencephalopathy (PML) is {{a devastating}} demyelinating disease with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} and no effective, targeted therapies. It is most often observed in association with abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity, in particular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but also occurs in association with lymphoproliferative diseases, certain immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory regimens, and other conditions. The etiologic agent of PML is a small, ubiquitous polyomavirus, the JC virus (JCV, also known as JCPyV), for which at least 50 % of the adult general population is seropositive. PML results when JCV replicates within cerebral oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, leading to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination.

40|$|We {{describe}} the braiding statistics of topological twist defects in abelian bosonic bilayer (mmn) fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which reduce to the Z_n toric code when m= 0.

We propose local statistical measurements that distinguish the fractional charge, or species, of a defect-quasiparticle composite. Degenerate ground states and basis transformations of a multi-defect system {{are characterized by}} a consistent set of fusion properties. Non-abelian unitary exchange operations are determined using half braids between defects, and projectively represent the sphere braid group in a closed <b>system.</b> <b>Defect</b> spin statistics are modified by equating exchange with 4 π rotation. The braiding S matrix is identified with a Dehn twist (instead of a π/ 2 rotation) on a torus decorated with a non-trivial twofold branch cut, and represents the congruent subgroup Γ_ 0 (2) of modular transformations.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Although up to 2 % {{of women}} undergo surgery during pregnancy, {{teratogenic}} effects of general anesthesia {{have not been}} adequately studied. Recently, an association between first-trimester operations and central nervous <b>system</b> <b>defects</b> has been described. This issue was explored in a population-based case-control study. METHODS. Case patients included live-born and stillborn infants with central nervous <b>system</b> <b>defects</b> born to residents of metropolitan Atlanta, Ga, between 1968 and 1980. Control patients included normal babies frequency matched to case patients by race, birth hospital, and period of birth. Conditional logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} adjust for potential confounding factors. RESULTS. Of 694 mothers of infants with central nervous <b>system</b> <b>defects,</b> 12 reported first-trimester anesthesia exposure; 34 of 2984 control mothers reported such exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 8, 3. 3). A striking association was observed between reported anesthesia exposure and hydrocephalus with another major defect (OR = 9. 6, 95 % CI = 3. 8, 24. 6). The strongest association was that of anesthesia exposure with hydrocephalus and eye defects (OR = 39. 6, 95 % CI = 7. 5, 209. 2). CONCLUSIONS. An increased risk of hydrocephalus with other defects was found among offspring of mothers with reported first-trimester anesthesia.

Here {{we report that}} Runx 3 knockout (KO) mice develop spontaneous eosinophilic lung inflammation associated with airway remodeling and mucus hypersecretion. Runx 3 is specifically expressed in mature dendritic cells (DC) and mediates their response to TGF-β. In the absence of Runx 3, DC become insensitive to TGF-β-induced maturation inhibition, and TGF-β-dependent Langerhans cell development is impaired. Maturation of Runx 3 KO DC is accelerated and accompanied by increased efficacy to stimulate T cells and aberrant expression of β 2 -integrins. Lung alveoli of Runx 3 KO mice accumulate DC characteristic of allergic airway inflammation.
