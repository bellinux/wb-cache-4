40|$|Literature {{concerning}} the time frames for detection of various seminal components commonly tested for in forensic laboratories in sexual assault cases {{is limited in}} quantity and in scope. Determining a more accurate time since intercourse (TSI) interval based on an extensive review of forensic case work would provide investigators with a tool for estimating the time elapsed between the occurrence of a sexual assault and the collection of a Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit (SAECK) which could be vital information in certain cases. This study demonstrates {{that the presence of}} intact spermatozoa is a significant finding on microscope slides prepared from vaginal, anorectal, and oral swabs and that the percentage of intact sperm cells decreases over time. This study also proved that sperm tails are lost during the preparation of microscope slides from SAECK swabs by directly comparing medical personnel-prepared smear slides and analyst-prepared extract slides from 95 Boston Police Department (BPD) Crime Laboratory Unit cases. Additionally, this study presents maximum TSI values for the persistence of sperm heads, intact spermatozoa, and prostate specific antigen (P 30) through a retrospective examination of 355 cases processed by the BPD Crime Laboratory Unit over 5 years. The maximum persistence values for P 30 in the vaginal, anorectal, and oral cavities were 19 hours, 17 hours, and 20 hours, respectively. In the vaginal cavity, maximum persistence values for intact spermatozoa were 43 <b>hours</b> for smear <b>slides</b> and 41. 5 <b>hours</b> for extract <b>slides.</b> The maximum persistence of sperm heads was equivalent for vaginal smear and extract <b>slides</b> at 105 <b>hours.</b> In the anorectal cavity, maximum persistence values for intact spermatozoa were 43 <b>hours</b> for smear <b>slides</b> and 13 <b>hours</b> for extract <b>slides.</b> The maximum persistence of sperm heads was equivalent for anorectal smear and extract <b>slides</b> at 43 <b>hours.</b> In the oral cavity, maximum persistence values for intact spermatozoa were 3. 75 <b>hours</b> for smear <b>slides</b> and 5 <b>hours</b> for extract <b>slides.</b> The maximum persistence of sperm heads were equivalent for oral smear and extract <b>slides</b> at 24 <b>hours...</b>|$|R
30|$|Given {{that each}} trend is {{described}} by a collection of tweets over time, we can aggregate data in sliding time windows [t, t+ℓ) of duration ℓ and compute features on the subsets of tweets produced in these windows. A window can slide by time intervals of duration δ. The next window therefore contains tweets produced in the interval [t+δ, t+ℓ +δ). We experimented with various time window lengths and sliding parameters, and the optimal performance is often obtained with windows of duration ℓ= 6 <b>hours</b> <b>sliding</b> by δ= 20 minutes.|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} circumferential {{segmented ring}} seal {{was designed for}} direct replacement of a helicopter transmission elastomeric lip seal operating on a shaft diameter of 13. 91 centimeters (5. 481 in.) at sliding velocities to 52. 48 m/sec (10 330 ft/min). The modifications involved the garter spring tension, shaft roundness, seal housing flatness, and pumping grooves to inhibit leakage. Operation of the seals in bench tests under simulated helicopter transmission conditions revealed that the seal leakage rate was within acceptable limits and that the wear rate was negligible. The low leakage and wear rates were confirmed in flight tests of 600 and 175 <b>hours</b> (<b>sliding</b> speed, 48. 11 m/sec (9470 ft/min)).

Additionally, immunostaining for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) CD- 31 (rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse CD- 31, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), Von Willebrand factor (rabbit polyclonal von Willebrand factor antibody), and Ki 67 (rabbit monoclonal anti-mouse Ki 67, Abcam Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) were performed to illustrate changes in neoangiogenesis and vascular density. Briefly, following rehydration and antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using methanol containing 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide. After that, the sections were incubated for 1 h with the subsequent primary monoclonal antibody. The bound antibodies were visualized using DakoCyomation Envision-horseradish peroxidase and chromagen using the EnVision™ FLEX kit (Dako Canada, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The slides were counterstained with hemotoxylin and analyzed under a microscope (Axiocam HR, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The images were edited with Adobe® Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) to remove connective and non-tumor tissue surrounding the tumor. Then, using MetaMorph® Microscopy Automation & Image Analysis Software (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), color thresholds were defined for the entire tumor area and the specific antibody bound tissue only. Percent of binding was calculated from the resulting number of pixels {{for each of the}} investigated factors.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} results of {{experiments}} designed {{to evaluate the}} ability of our machine learning framework to discriminate between organic and promoted trends. For all experiments, each feature time series consists of 120 real-valued data points equally divided {{before and after the}} trending point. Although in principle we could use the entire time series for classification, ex-post information would not serve our goal of early detection of social media campaigns in a streaming scenario that resembles a real setting, where information about the future evolution of a trend is obviously unavailable. For this reason, we consider only a subset consisting of L data points ending with delay D since the trending point; D ≤ 0 for early detection, D > 0 for classification after trending. We evaluate the performance of our detection framework {{as a function of the}} delay parameter D. The case D= 0 involves detection immediately at trending time. However, we also consider D < 0 to examine the performance of our algorithms based on data preceding the trending point; of course the detection would not occur until D= 0, when one would become aware of the trending hashtag. Time series are encoded using the settings described above (L= 35 windows of length ℓ= 6 <b>hours</b> <b>sliding</b> every δ= 20 minutes).|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{potential}} of NaHCO 3 versus human serum to induce germ tube formation in Candida albicans was investigated. Specimens. A total of 100 isolates {{were obtained from}} oral swabs of patients presenting with thrush. Approval for the study was granted by the Joint Research Ethics Committee (JREC/ 23 / 08). Method. Confirmed C. albicans isolates by routine methods were tested for germ tube induction using 5 different concentrations of Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3 and Tris-maleate buffer control. Standard control strains included were C. albicans (ATCC 10231) and C. krusei (ATCC 6258). Microculture was done in 20 [*]μL inoculums on microscope <b>slides</b> for 3 <b>hours</b> at 37 °C. The rate of germ tube formation at 10 -minute intervals was determined on 100 isolates using the optimum 20 [*]mM Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3 concentration. Parallel germ tube formation using human serum was done in test tubes. Results. The optimum concentration of NaHCO 3 in Tris-maleate buffer for germ tube induction was 20 [*]mM for 67 % of isolates. Only 21 % of isolates formed germ tubes in Tris-maleate buffer control. There {{was no significant difference}} in induction between human serum and Tris-maleate buffered NaHCO 3. Conclusion.

His character Shaun appeared in one episode and was seen grooming runaway pupil Chlo Grainger into prostitution. In 2008, Coghill was cast in EastEnders in the controversial role of Tony King, Bianca Jackson's boyfriend. His first episodes were televised in September 2008. Over the course of three months, it emerged that the character had been having a relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney Dean for three years, starting when Whitney was just 12 years old. He was also seen 'grooming' Lauren Branning. The storyline ended in December 2008 when Whitney told Bianca, who then told the police. Tony was arrested, thus ending Coghill's three-month stint in the show. Coghill reprised the role for the character's trial, which was screened in December 2009. After leaving EastEnders, Coghill appeared as ambulance driver Bobby Sheridan in the medical drama series The Royal, from 14 December 2008. In February 2016, he appeared in BBC One drama series Moving On. He appeared in series 4 of Line of Duty on BBC One in April 2017.|$|R

Paul Bunyan is an interpretive program based on an old-fashioned Minnesota logger camp, {{complete}} with staff in period attire, serving pancakes and sausage for breakfast, and offering such activities as tomahawk throwing, kubb, loggerball, crosscut saws, and spar pole climbing. The lunch activity is a trip down to Crawdad Landing on the Cedar Creek, where Scouts eat a sack lunch and spend an <b>hour</b> <b>sliding</b> down a giant tarp into the creek, often getting extremely muddy in the process. Enduring as one of Ingersoll's most popular attractions, Horseshoe Bend is the dinner outpost and interpretive program based on a cantina in the Old West. The program includes horseshoes, tomahawk throwing, a blacksmith forge, lassoing [...] "cattle" [...] and even a [...] "bucking bronco". Much of the food is prepared over an open fire or in Dutch ovens. Dessert consists of IBC Root Beer, kettle corn, and fresh, homemade ice cream, hand-cranked by volunteering Scouts. In recent years, the Camp Wilderness program has incorporated a new program called Indian Village. Here, campers have the opportunity to learn Indian Leg Wrestling as well as Indian Stick Wrestling. Later on, campers are able to try their hand at throwing atlatls, a form of Native American spear. This lunch time program, unlike the other main parts of Camp Wilderness, is not made to be a recreation but a historical interpretation of Native American games and activities, presented for the campers.|$|R

Sosyal medya profilleri kullanıcının yaşam hikâyesini yansıtırken, hikâye özelliğiyle kullanıcılar gündelik hayatlarından kesitleri fotoğraf, video, konum verisi, emojiler, metin gibi unsurları kullanarak paylaşmaktadır. Herkesin kendi hikâyesini anlatma ve beğenilme arzusunu serbest bıraktığı bu çağda, sosyal medya anlatıları idealize edilen ve kolektif imgelemin ürünü olan kimlikler sunmaktadır. Sosyal medya hikâyelerinin 24 saat sonunda uçucu olma özelliği, hızlı içerik üretim, paylaşım ve tüketimini körüklemektedir. Hız hikâyeyi deneyimden, auradan ve derin bir anlatı dilinden uzakta tutmakta, yerine ‘an’ı yaşarken aktarmanın cazibesini koymaktadır.

The {{narrative}} influences ways {{of seeing}} {{of people and}} it is shaped according to {{the characteristics of the}} media it has posted. Mass media, visual culture and digital media have shaped the stories according to their structural characteristics. Social media has created a new narrative culture. While social media profiles reflect the user's life story, users share their moments with photos, videos, location data, emoji, text, etc. from their everyday lives with the ephemeral story feature. In this era, which everyone is telling their story and releasing the desire for pleasure, people provides idealized identities via social media stories. The fading out feature of social media stories (ephemeral stories) after 24 hours provokes rapid content production, sharing and consumption. Speed keeps the story away from experience, aura and a deep narrative language. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, said: “Timeline is your life story. Tell your whole life story in a single page. ” Social media users, show places where they travel by using photos with locational data and hashtags; share moments of their lives in <b>slides</b> with 24 <b>hour</b> ephemeral stories; and transfer an event to their friends with live broadcasting, on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook etc. With all these facilities users share moments from everyday life, build an online profile that reflects ideal identity and tell their stories. Shared contents are shaped by followers’ comments and likes, so become collective products. Social media profiles have been the carriers of personal history and affect digital memory. All of these effects, like all narratives, change the perception, language and life style of the users. With the corrosion of public space and the rise of private space, forms of socialization in urban space have also transformed. This life style has changed the transfer of experiences and stories. With the fall of public space and the diffusion of social media into everyday life, the individual constructs an identity through the social media profiles and thus tells their own stories. Digital storytelling in social media has turned into a tool of self presentation and profile pages reflect idealized selves. Human, who needs to be seen by the others to be aware of her / his existence, has created more visible ways of presentation of the self with the help of social networks. Social media users who are attracted by many followers become micro-celebrities. So the narrative transforms into performance. Sharing of moments of private life in social media and consuming those contents constantly, changes the perception of intimacy and imposes transparency. Social media users who shares his / her own life story and follows others’ lives, performs with the desire for pleasure. The aesthetics expected from art works are not sought in social media narratives. Because these narratives have created their own aesthetic values such as duck face selfies. Social media stories transform from punctum to studium. In addition, social media users are telling their stories with new language practices. Using hashtags is the short and fun way to express what to be said. Because of the using non-aesthetic visuals and hashtag language, digital storytelling become standart. Social media timelines resemble an album where memories are recorded. In addition they offer the possibility to record a moment while living. Therefore, sharing a moment while living has become a part of that moment. Today our memories are filled with photos, videos, text etc. in social media rather than our remembrances, and users share on their social media profiles what they want to remember from their personal history. That means, social media narratives functions as digital memory and manipulates the natural functioning of memory. Users’ moments are not only in their memory but also in digital networks. The things we remember and experience are the values that make up identity. The memory needs to repeat the stories to remember and rituals protect collective memory. Social media narratives creates a collective memory and imagination with its own rituals. In this study, narrative is considered as a building stone of human perception of the world. Social media narratives are evaluated within the context of storytelling, and the impact of social media narratives on the individual’s way of seeing is discussed. The effects of social media narratives on identity, aesthetics, language and memory are considered in a crtical frame. First of all, presentation of the self, the desire for pleasure and transformation of perception of intimacy will be mentioned. Secondly, aesthetic and language of social media narratives will be discussed. Finally, the existence of the experience transfer which is an important element of the story will be questioned, and the effects of social media narratives on memory will be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|SLIDE 3 : The Indian Head River {{forms the}} Northern Border of the Town of Hanson, Other towns that impact {{the water quality}} {{directly}} {{in the areas of}} study include Pembroke to the east and Hanover to the north, northeast. There are approximately 8 miles between our upstream site near Factory Pond and our downstream site at Ludham’s Ford or as other’s call it, Curtis’ Crossing. The river covers about eight acres of land in this area and was most likely used as a fishing and travel spot for the Wompatuck Indians. A guide named James Luddam carried Governor Winthrop across the Indian Head River in 1632 {{in order to get to}} Weymouth, Massachusetts. Though the river is called The Drinkwater River in other towns, we have chosen to refer to it as the Indian Head River in the scope of our study. There is a small beaver population and the river is annually stocked with trout. Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife has posted the river in its entirety from Forge pond in Hanover to route 3 in Norwell and Pembroke including Factory Pond as P 6; fishing resources contaminated with mercury. If herring are caught, they must be thrown back into the river. This applies more to the Pembroke side of the river, as there is a fish ladder in Luddams Ford Park. The likely source of the contamination is from the no longer existing Clapps Rubber Factory. Two new housing developments bracket the river just downstream of our site B location (State St.), one in the town of Hanson and the other in the town of Hanover. SLIDE 4 : This year we sampled at three sites along the river: Site A: Broadway Street in Hanson is our upstream site Site B: State Street in Hanson is approximately midway between site A and site C Site C: Curtis Crossing. The river here defines the line between the towns of Hanover and Pembroke SLIDE 5 : The road map shows the course the river takes after our furthest downstream site. From this point onwards, the river is known as the North River. The North River empties into Scituate Harbor. SLIDE 6 : This is our Site A at Broadway Street. Just upstream is an impoundment that releases water from Factory Pond into the river. The bottom is generally cobbled but there are sandy spots all along the edges and under the vegetation. SLIDE 7 : Here are the 17 hour dissolved oxygen and temperature data for October. Typically, as temperature decreases, DO increases which we see in the first hours of data collection. SLIDE 8 : These are the 17 hour dissolved oxygen and pH results from October. It shows a nice relationship between pH and DO. When dissolved oxygen concentrations are high, the pH of the water is higher showing that photosynthesis is taking place. However, as the night time hours persist, dissolved oxygen concentrations decrease as do pH levels showing a rise in carbon dioxide levels (acidification) SLIDE 9 : This is our Site B site at State St. The water flows from a small impoundment upstream and splits into two parts creating a small island. The two streams reunite about 500 yards from the split. This is where we took our samples. The flow is swift as the two streams unite. There is also a bridge that spans the river just downstream of the impoundment. SLIDE 10 : Here are the dissolved oxygen levels and temperature comparisons for site B. Despite the strong current and mixing as the two streams come together, dissolved oxygen levels are slightly lower that those at Site A and there are no wide fluctuations in temperature as we saw at site A. SLIDE 11 : This is the comparison of pH and Dissolved Oxygen for site B. The pH is higher here than at site A. This could be a result of the bridge construction and crumbling of the cement portions of the bridge. SLIDE 12 : This is our third site at Curtis Crossing in Pembroke. The habitat is pretty much like that at Site A, rocky cobble and riffle but sandy along the edges and under the vegetation. One thing we thought was strange was that the discharge here seemed to be much lower that it should be considering what it has been in past years and the distance downstream from site A. Once again, there is an impoundment directly upstream of this site and another cement bridge that spans the river. SLIDE 13 : Dissolved oxygen is slightly higher here than at Site B. SLIDE 14 : pH is lower here than at Site B. This graph also shows a good relationship between Dissolved oxygen and pH. (pH is high during daylight hours when photosynthesis takes place, but the water becomes more acidic as less carbon dioxide is absorbed during the night time <b>hours.).</b> <b>SLIDE</b> 15 : This graph compares Dissolved Oxygen for all three sites. The lowest levels are at Site B. The average DO for site A is 7. 90 mg/L, for Site B is 7. 63 and for site C is 8. 35. These readings are above the acceptable limits in Massachusetts waterways for both warm water and cold water fisheries. SLIDE 16 : This graph shows the comparison of pH for the three sites: The average pH at Site A is 7. 0, For Site B is 8. 30 and for Site C is 7. 0. SLIDE 17 : Finally, we compared the Temperature data for the three sites. The average Temperature for Site A was 15. 53 oC, for site B was 14. 33 oC and for Site C was 15. 12412 oC. SLIDE 18 : This graph shows all of the average data including the average oxygen saturation for each site. As you can see, both sites A and C compare pretty well, however in each measurement taken, it looks like Site B is slightly off with a lower temperature, a higher pH and lower oxygen saturation that the other two sites. SLIDE 19 : This is the nitrogen load data (kg/day) for the three sites. The one interesting thing that we found was that the load is much lower that it has been in other years. SLIDE 20 : Here, we have included data collected since our monitoring began 2001. The highest loads were reported in the fall of 2003 and then again in the fall of 2004. This year the load in all three sites is relatively low. What the root cause of high concentrations of nitrogen still remains a mystery. SLIDE 20 : Here we are trying to show the net change in the upstream discharge at Site A (Broadway St.) to downstream discharge at site C (Curtis Crossing). We thought that there might be a relationship between the reductions in load this year to the discharge of the river beginning at Site A. The difference in discharge in 2001 was almost 16 cubic feet per second. Last October, the difference in discharge between the two sites was a little over 2 cubic feet per second. Where did the water go? SLIDE 21 : There is a stream gauge at Site C in Pembroke and these are the mean discharge measurements for the past 19 years. The low readings in 2003 helped us to confirm the accuracy of past measurements. The data also helps to illustrate the wide fluctuations in discharge over a long period of time. SLIDE 22 : Macroinvertebrates and the Biotic Index: Multiple sweeps were made in each of the habitat types at all three sites. We combined all of our sweeps. Later, picks were taken from each sample using the density adjustment factor to two hundred organisms. SLIDE 23 : Results for Site A: About 47 % of the sample was made up of net-spinning members of Trichoptera. Approximately 1 % of the sample was cased Caddisfly larvae. 12 percent of the sample were amphipods or scuds 35 percent were fingernail clams and snails. There was a fair representation of organisms from many different families including dragonfly larvae, beetle larvae and midges. We did not find any representative mayflies or stoneflies at this site. The biotic index or measurement of the relative tolerance and biodiversity of the sample was pretty good at 4. 538. SLIDE 24 : Results for Site B: 50 percent of the sample was made of the net-spinning caddisfly, Hydropsychidae. 18 % of the sample consisted of the other net-spinner, Philopotamidae. Approximately 20 % of the sample from Ephemeroptera (Heptagendae) The biotic index or 3. 9 was also pretty good SLIDE 25 : Hydropsychidae is also the dominant organism at site C. There is a little more biodiversity here and more representatives with a lower biotic index give this site the best biotic index 3. 68) of the three sites studied. SLIDE 26 : We collected water samples in early April and analyzed them for Fecal Coliform concentrations here at the watershed lab. The average for all three sites was below 35 colonies per 100 ml. This tells us that the nitrogen load is probably not due to any significant septic contamination. SLIDE 27 : CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found the Indian Head River at our three study sites to be relatively healthy. The biodiversity at all three sites is good and the nitrogen load is way below what it has been in past years. Even though it was a strain to do three sites, it was interesting to have the middle site at State Street this year. This showed us that there can be minor, unexplainable differences along the course of a river. Could it be the bridge that is raising the pH at Site B? Is it some other factor that not only affects pH but also the temperature and the dissolved oxygen? There are such similarities between Broadway St. and Curtis Crossing that it seems significant even though the differences at State St. are small...|$|R
