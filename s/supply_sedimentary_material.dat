40|$|The Northern Carmine Bee-Eater (Merops nubicus) {{lives and}} breeds in a well demarcated region {{stretching}} across Africa {{close to the}} 15 °N line of latitude. The Bee-Eater zone appears {{to be associated with}} a band of loess, defined by Scheidig on his 1934 map as second-order loess. Bee-eaters are known to favour loess for nesting tunnels and it appears that the 15 °N material is sufficiently loess-like. Obvious sources for particulate materials for the 15 °N band are the Fonta-Djalon highlands which <b>supply</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> to the River Niger; the Bodele Depression, the deepest part of Lake Megachad, source of dust for the World; the Ethiopian highlands at the eastern end of 15 °N which supply silt to the Nile system and particulates to the 15 °N region. In soil moisture terms the region is ustic, which is possibly a necessary condition for bee-eater nests. The clastic material requires an ustic environment. The River Niger {{can be seen as a}} loess river; in some senses a mirror-image of a major loess river like the Danube; but where a restricted range of particle inputs leads to a restricted range of loess deposit outputs. Nevertheless loess river considerations can be applied. The Niger delivers second-order loess and an important loessic admixture to the landscape. Enough loess for selective nesters like the Carmine Bee-Eaters to build their nest tunnels in it. It seems likely that climate change will cause a change in bee-eater distribution; it seems unlikely that they will abandon their nesting regions, the living and wintering zones may shift.

Geochemical and sedimentation data indicate that the leading mechanism <b>supplying</b> aluminosilicate <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> to the surface layer of bottom sediments is seasonal melting of the Anuchin glacier and the mountain glacier on the southeastern part of the valley hosting the lake.

40|$|The Apuseni Mountains {{were formed}} during Late Cretaceous {{convergence}} between the Tisia and the Dacia microplates {{as part of}} the Alpine orogen. The mountain range comprises a sedimentary succession similar to the Gosau Group of the Eastern Alps. This work focuses on the sedimentological and geodynamic evolution of the Gosau basin of the Apuseni Mts. and attempts a direct comparison to the relatively well studied Gosau Group deposits of the Eastern Alps. By analyzing the Upper Cretaceous Gosau sediments and the surrounding geological units, we were able to add critical evidence for reconstructing the Late Mesozoic to Paleogene geodynamic evolution of the Apuseni Mountains. Nannoplankton investigations show that Gosau sedimentation started diachronously after Late Turonian times. The burial history indicates low subsidence rates during deposition of the terrestrial and shallow marine Lower Gosau Subgroup and increased subsidence rates during the period of deep marine Upper Gosau Subgroup sedimentation. The Gosau Group of the Apuseni Mountains was deposited in a forearc basin <b>supplied</b> with <b>sedimentary</b> <b>material</b> from an obducted forearc region and the crystalline hinterland, as reflected by heavy mineral and paleocurrent analysis. Zircon fission track age populations show no fluctuation of exhumation rates in the surrounding geological units, which served as source areas for the detrital material, whereas increased exhumation at the K/Pg boundary can be proven by thermal modeling on apatite fission track data. Synchronously to the Gosau sedimentation, deep marine turbidites were deposited in the deep-sea trench basin formed by the subduction of the Transylvanian Ocean. The similarities to the Gosau occurrences of the Eastern Alps lead to direct correlation with the Alpine paleogeographic evolution and to the assumption that a continuous ocean basin (South Penninic - Transylvanian Ocean Basin) was consumed until Late Cretaceous times...|$|R
