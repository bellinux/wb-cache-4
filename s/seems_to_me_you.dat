Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is [...] "convinced {{that the new}} Robert Zemeckis movie {{treatment}} sacrifices {{the power of the}} original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie—the mother of the monster he has just slain. What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' ...

'It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'" [...] Other commentators pointed to the theories elucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.|$|E
