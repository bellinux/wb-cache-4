40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete finite-element treatment for unsaturated soil problems. A new formulation of general constitutive equations for unsaturated soils is first presented. In the incremental stress-strain equations, the suction or the {{pore water pressure}} is treated as a strain variable instead of a stress variable. The global governing equations are derived in terms of displacement and pore water pressure. The discretized governing equations are then solved using an adaptive time-stepping scheme which automatically adjusts the time-step size so that the integration error in the displacements and pore pressures lies close to a specified tolerance. The non-linearity caused by suction-dependent plastic yielding, suction-dependent degree of saturation, and saturation-dependent permeability is treated {{in a similar way}} to the elastoplasticity. An explicit stress integration scheme is used to solve the constitutive stress-strain equations at the Gauss point level.

When a crash is detected by the aircraft system, the black-box data could be stored in all nodes using data storage protocol for WSN.

40|$|A {{series of}} pyrochlore-type lead-ruthenium oxide (Pb 2 Ru 2 O 7 -δ) {{containing}} various amounts of oxygen vacancies was prepared by varying the heat-treatment temperature, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity {{as well as}} the electrochemical redox property in acid and alkaline <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>evaluated</b> <b>using</b> rotating disk electrode. The specific ORR activity was increased with increasing the amount of oxygen vacancies, and linearly correlated to the charge amount of electrochemical redox of Pb 2 Ru 2 O 7 -δ both in acid and alkaline solution. We concluded that the surface oxygen vacancy participates in the electrochemical redox of Pb 2 Ru 2 O 7 -δ, and at the same time, behaves as the active site for ORR. The ORR activity in alkaline solution was much higher than that in acid solution, possibly because of the difference of the facility of electrochemical desorption of adsorbed oxygen species in the ORR process. Additionally, the effect of humidity on the ORR activity was investigated by single cell test. It was revealed that Pb 2 Ru 2 O 7 -δ shows absolutely high ORR activity in dry condition. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

Equilibrium experimental data were successfully described by Freundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity of S 957 (7. 5 g metaldehyde/g S 957) exceeded those of MN 200 and GAC. Thermodynamic {{studies showed that}} sorption of metaldehyde onto all sorbents is endothermic and processes are controlled by entropic rather than enthalpic changes. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that experimental data for MN 200 and GAC obey pseudo-second order models with rates limited by particle diffusion. Comparatively, S 957 was shown to obey a pseudo-first order model with a rate-limiting step of metaldehyde diffusion through the solid/liquid interface. Results obtained suggest that metaldehyde adsorption onto MN 200 and GAC are driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, as leaching tendencies were high since no degradation of metaldehyde occurred. Conversely, adsorption of metaldehyde onto S 957 occurs via ion-exchange processes, where sulfonic and phosphonic functionalities degrade adsorbed metaldehyde molecules and failure to detect metaldehyde in leaching studies for S 957 supports this theory. Consequently, the high adsorption capacity and absence of leaching indicate S 957 is promising for metaldehyde removal from source water...|$|E

From the experimental data, Ca(OH) 2 is leached considerably with the increase in immersion time. The pore structure of concrete can also be affected by the formation of an oriented structure of water in concrete materials; (ii) incorporation of fly ash makes a difference for the performance of concrete submersed in solutions as the total porosity and the pore connectivity can be lower.

The sol-gel coatings were prepared by condensation and polymerization of TEOS/MPTS, TEOS/MTES, TMOS/MPTS and TMOS/MTES mixtures with a molar ratio of 1. 0 and deposited by dip-coating on the carbon steel substrates. The coated steels embedded in AAFA mortar presented higher corrosion potential and lower corrosion current density values than those embedded in OPC mortar, indicating that the coatings were more efficient in preventing corrosion of the rebars in this environment. Hybrid coatings synthesized with TEOS/MTES and TMOS/MTES mixtures showed the longest permanence of steel in the passive state when covering rebars embedded in carbonated AAFA mortar.

Initially, the concentration of DOX in the NALG-DOX solution was ~[*][*] 4  μg/mL, indicating that the encapsulation efficiency, or ratio of DOX in NALG-DOX to initial DOX added to formulation, for the NALG-DOX is ~[*] 7 %. While this encapsulation efficiency is considered low compared to similar particles [57], this is likely due to the initial DOX present in the aqueous phase. We did not iterate on the formulation by lowering the amount of DOX present in the initial aqueous phase and hypothesize that the efficiency could be improved by lowering the amount of DOX in the initial formulation. The unencapsulated DOX is likely passing through the 3  kDa filter washes {{at the end of}} the synthesis. With the availability and relative low cost of doxorubicin, we opted to “saturate” the formulation with DOX, knowing that large amounts of the leftover DOX would likely pass through unencapsulated.
