5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, <b>stringed</b> instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While <b>stringed</b> instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, <b>stringed</b> instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred <b>stringed</b> instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern <b>stringed</b> instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in Europe until this period. <b>Stringed</b> instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, <b>stringed</b> instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E

Even though households may have ready access to food supplies, individual food security requires appropriate resources, markets and social networks. Randy <b>Stringe...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} <b>stringed</b> instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other <b>stringed</b> instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment may be {{as simple}} as {{clapping}} hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and talking drums, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, <b>stringed</b> instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.|$|E

40|$|This article {{belongs to}} the Special Issue: Gut Microbiota and Gut FunctionCancer {{patients}} receiving chemotherapy often develop mucositis {{as a direct result}} of their treatment. Recently, the intestinal microbiota has attracted significant attention in the investigation of the pathobiology of mucositis, with a number of studies investigating the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the microbiota. With significant effects on the intestinal microbiota occurring following the administration of chemotherapy, there is now interest surrounding the downstream pathological effects that may be associated with the altered intestinal ecology. This review seeks to identify links between signalling pathways previously demonstrated to have a role in the development of mucositis, and the altered intestinal microbiota.

40|$|Many {{factors have}} been used to explain {{adoption}} behaviours of managers in the hospitality industry. Studies employing these {{factors have been}} carried out with the assumption (implicit or explicit) that the managers are free and independent in their decision to adopt innovations {{such as the use of}} e-marketing without much attention to the effects of external pressures. In this paper we provide a relatively new conceptual framework for innovation adoption in the field of tourism based on the concept of institutional isomorphism. We argue that e-marketing adoption decisions by tourist operators can be influenced either singly or jointly by important aspects of institutional factors namely ‘institutional isomorphism’, which, when combined with the traditional innovation adoption factors can enhance a better understanding of tour operators adoption behaviour.

40|$|Drawing on the {{experience}} of greater metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, the paper points to the links and gaps between science and public policy. The paper explores urban stormwater management lessons emerging from a ten-year, prolonged dry period that impacted the integrity of urban forests in the City of Adelaide. Among the questions addressed: will stormwater remain, as its historic and institutional settings suggest, a liability or can it become an asset? Who owns stormwater resources and to whom is its management vested? The paper examines these issues with consideration to the dangers of continuing to use urban forestry management practices that are not informed by science. The study concludes that a more integrated approach to urban water management can maintain the integrity of urban forests in ways that potentially enhance social amenities and economic efficiency.

40|$|The "input {{to state}} stability" (iss) {{property}} provides a natural {{framework in which}} to formulate notions of stability with respect to input perturbations. In this expository paper, we review various equivalent definitions expressed in stability, Lyapunov-theoretic, and dissipation terms. We sketch some applications to the stabilization of cascades of systems and of linear systems subject to control saturation. 1 Introduction There are two very conceptually different ways of formulating the notion of stability of control systems. One of them, which we may call the input/output approach, relies on operator-theoretic techniques. Among the main contributions to this area, one may cite the foundational work by Zames, Sandberg, Desoer, Safanov, Vidyasagar, and others. In this approach, a "system" is a causal operator F between spaces of signals, and "stability" is taken to mean that F maps bounded inputs into bounded outputs, or finite-energy inputs into finite-energy outputs.

5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no <b>stringed</b> instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 12 FEB 2002 Rapid economic and agricultural sector growth have enhanced greatly food security in Asia {{during the past}} three decades. Most studies suggest this positive trend will continue into the next century. This paper reviews past trends and future prospects in access and availability of food in Asia at the national level. The paper concludes that the positive overall trend in increased food security relies on the capacity of Asian economies to address several key policy issues, including sustained economic growth, population pressure, structural changes in domestic economies, shifts in international comparative advantage, technological changes, developments in the domestic and international food markets, and environmental sustainability. The paper identifies cost-effective ways to increase food security in light of these issues and suggests that Asia’s food security can be maintained only if international and domestic policies, institutional frameworks, and public expenditure patterns are conducive to cost–effective and sustainable agriculture development.

40|$|Purpose – Price {{satisfaction}} is an influential factor in competitive performance and business success. Strong price satisfaction enhances and sustains high quality business relationships, leading to improved profits for chain participants. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to explore the dimensions of price satisfaction in the context of the Malaysian dairy industry. The aim is to determine which dimensions of price satisfaction affect relationship performance between Malaysian dairy producers and the dairy processers who purchase their milk. Design/methodology/approach – In total, eight hypotheses are tested using partial least square methods on survey results from 133 dairy producers in Malaysia. Findings – The study results suggest that relative price, price-quality ratio and price fairness influence producers’ loyalty and improved business relationship performance. Practical implications – To achieve long-term, sustainable business relationships involving consistent high quality supplies, milk buyers need to understand and capture the price satisfaction dimensions. Originality/value – The paper provides insights into the important linkages between price satisfaction and business performance in an agriculture industry.

40|$|Consumers and the {{producers}} have shown interest in organics, but there exist gaps in their common interest. Producers require premiums {{for their products}} based on the peculiarity of their pro- duction circumstances and the perceived benefits inherent in their products. Predicting consumer willingness {{to pay a premium}} for the environmental benefits of organics (WTPe) is a challenge and is of interest in this study. The contingent valuation method was used to gather information on WTPe from a sample that yielded 2, 099 surveys. The econometric test ordered probit regression and other analyses were carried out. On average, respondents indicated WTP 23 % premium. The proposed hypotheses were tested, and all were accepted except social demographic variables that presented a mixed outcome. The results have implications for consumer sensitization and enlightenment programs of the wine indus- try, wine market segmentation, and government’s climate change policy. This study is exploratory and has presented a snapshot sce- nario. Confirmatory and longitudinal studies are recommended to validate this study’s outcomes.

40|$|This study uses a best-worst (BW) scaling {{experiment}} {{to explore the}} relative importance of buyer attributes for chilli farmers participating in traditional and modern supermarket channels. For the BW scaling tasks, 11 buyer attributes were allocated into choice sets and chilli farmers selected both the ‘best’ and ’worst’ in each choice set. Farmers in the traditional channel perceived cash payment at delivery, price premiums for value adding and high price per kg as the most important buyer attributes. Supermarket farmers also indicated price premiums for value adding and cash payment at delivery as very important attributes. However, supermarket farmers also perceived established relationships as being important. Farmers from both channels perceived the attributes of input provision and technical assistance to be the least important. These results imply that if buyers want to obtain continuous and uninterrupted supplies from their producers, they will need to do more in terms of offering price premiums for higher quality products and other incentives such as paying cash upon delivery.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of molecularly targeted anticancer therapies {{has brought the}} promise of longer survival times for select patients with cancers previously considered untreatable. However, it has also brought new toxicities that require understanding and management, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are associated with a broad range of adverse effects, with vascular toxicity being particularly serious. This review focuses on the current understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of macrovascular toxicities (hypertension, hemorrhage, and thromboembolism), their incidence and severity, the current clinical management, and implications in the advanced cancer setting. Movement of these agents into the early disease setting will alter the impact of these toxicities. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria. Information for this review was collected by searching PubMed/Medline and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract databases. The medical subject heading terms used included toxicity, hypertension, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, risk factors, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism, combined with free text search terms including, but not limited to, VEGF inhibitor*, bevacizumab, sunitinib, and sorafenib.
