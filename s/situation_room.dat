This "Multiplayer Video-Piece" is a {{remarkable}} experiment in participatory theatre, which combines elements of installation, "expert"-theatre, parcours and re-enactment. The following text provides {{a brief description of}} <b>Situation</b> <b>Rooms,</b> followed by an e-mail interview with Helgard Haug, Stefan Kaegi and Daniel Wetzel. This interview addresses questions and topics such as: the hybrid genre of <b>Situation</b> <b>Rooms,</b> its relation to earlier works, specific compositional decisions (about duration, the use of iPads, absent "experts"), and the piece's approach to interaction with the audience (including potential cognitive overload and denial of space for individual assessments, immersion, incompleteness as a principle), and aspects of audience feedback. The interview also considers the role of empathy, audiences' emotional involvement, the work's (apparent) proximity to practices of traditional theatre, and participation as an aspect of theatre and politics. 21 page(s...|$|R

25|$|While Ventura has {{not held}} public office {{since the end}} of his term as {{governor}} in 2003, he has remained politically active and has occasionally hinted at intentions of possibly running again for political office. In an interview on CNN's The <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> on April 7, 2008, Ventura said that he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race. A poll commissioned by Twin Cities station Fox 9 put him at 24 percent, behind Democratic candidate Al Franken at 32 percent and Norm Coleman at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on Larry King Live on July 14, 2008, that he would not run; Ventura's decision not to join the race was partly rooted from a fear of a potential lack of privacy for his family, a concern that contributed to his refusal to seek a second term as governor.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{provision of}} heterogeneous information stemming from various sources, being geographic or thematic maps, measurement values, damage assessment reports or weather forecasts {{play a major}} role in risk and crisis management. Most often these tasks are performed by public civil agencies on different administrative levels which all have their own information and communication systems for the provision of data and services. The possibility of sharing and fusioning all relevant information, especially in case of transboundary natural hazards, is often quite limited. Even in those intra-agency cases in which data exchange should be basically possible, different data formats and service interfaces, but also differences in the thematic views, temporal and spatial resolutions and semantic descriptions about the crisis situation, hinder an efficient interpretation of the existing data observations. This is of particular concern if the data is to be used in time critical decision making situations as they regularly occur in <b>situation</b> <b>rooms</b> for crisis management. This paper first describes how the problem of syntactic and semantic interoperability may be approached by the design of open serviceoriented architectures (SOA) based upon international standards, such as those of the European research projects ORCHESTRA (Open Architecture and Spatial Data Infrastructure for Risk Management, [URL]), SANY (Sensors Anywhere) and TRIDEC (Collaborative, complex and critical decision-support in evolving crises, [URL] eu). These architectural approaches support the design and implementation of risk and crisis management application relying upon standard interfaces of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The Reference Model of the ORCHESTRA Architecture (RM-OA) [Usländer, T. (ed.) (2007) ] was recognized as OGC bestpractices architecture in 2007 and since then has been extended and refined in numerous research and implementation projects. The paper then proceeds with pointing out how human computer interaction in <b>situation</b> <b>rooms</b> for emergency management may be designed in such a way that spatial data and other information can be intuitively presented to crisis managers, relieving them from the chore of performing complex interaction schemes while already overloaded with time-critical decision making...|$|R

40|$|In many {{contemporary}} theatre productions, a mixing of modes of performance, presentation, and participation is observed. In this scenario, change and adaptation occur within specific media precisely through their interrelation with other media. Lars Elleström describes intermediality as “intermodal relations in media,” or “media intermultimodality. ” This essay explores Elleström’s account of modes and modalities {{in order to}} address the adaptation of media form and function in contemporary theatre and performance. It proposes that the notion of modal transposition across media helps to account for both the technical efficacy and aesthetic affordances of contemporary intermedial performance, particularly in “reality trend” work that aims to provide lived and felt encounters and draws on actual lives and experiences. By way of example, the essay examines Before I Sleep (dreamthinkspeak), Hotel Medea (Zecora Ura Theatre), The Drowned Man (Punchdrunk), <b>Situation</b> <b>Rooms</b> (Rimini Protokoll), and The Pixelated Revolution (Rabih Mroué). Taken together, these productions suggest that modal transposition serves a characteristic agenda: the provision of encounters with actuality, where both artwork and experience are pluralized, segmented, and synthesized. ...|$|R
