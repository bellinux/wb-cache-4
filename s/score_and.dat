40|$|The role {{of self-efficacy}} beliefs as a {{mediator}} and moderator {{of the relation between}} the home environment and well-being was examined for both European American and African American children ages 10 through 15. There was evidence that self-efficacy beliefs pertaining to school and to family functioned {{as a mediator}} between EAHOME <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> social behavior and also between EA-HOME <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> an overall problems index. The effects occurred in both ethnic groups but more often in European American adolescents.

40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to determine the effects of screen position of a mathematics exercise on sixth grade student accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response times while completing a computer generated mathematics exercise. To determine the effects of screen position of mathematics exercises on accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response times of sixth grade students two dependent variables (accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response time) were used with one independent variable (screen position). ^ The Computer Generated Mathematics Exercise Program was the instrument designed to be used in this study. The program was administered to a sample of 190 sixth grade students from one southwest Iowa and three northwest Missouri elementary schools. The statistical procedure used was a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVAS) on the dependent variables (accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response times) and the independent variable (screen position). ^ The results indicated there was no significant effect of varying the screen position of computerized mathematics exercises on sixth grade student accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response times while completing a computer generated mathematics exercise. The results supported the hypothesis that the screen position of mathematics exercises has no effect on sixth grade accuracy <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> response times. ...|$|R

40|$|Listening {{difficulty}} ratings is a {{new measure}} to evaluate speech transmission performance in public spaces. The advantage {{is that it can}} evaluate sound fields with higher speech transmission performance more accurately and sensitively, than intelligibility scores. The effect of aging, or hearing level on listening difficulty ratings has not been clarified yet. In this paper, the results of the listening tests demonstrated that hearing levels above 2 kHz significantly affect both word intelligibility <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> listening difficulty ratings for the aged. For the aged, both of them can be estimated from the results for the young plus the average of hearing levels at 2 and 4 kHz. The equations for estimating the word intelligibility <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> the. listening difficulty ratings for the aged are obtained from the multiple linear regression analyses. The estimated <b>scores.</b> <b>and</b> ratings generally coincide with the measured <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> ratings, and the averaged difference between them is 5. 2 % for the word intelligibility <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> 3. 8 % for the listening difficulty ratings, in the range of listening tests performed in this paper. 加齢が音声の聴き取りに及ぼす影響を検討した...|$|R
