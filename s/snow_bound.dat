In one of these shocks they seemed to be going through a thicket of underbrush; but Provy Smith knew that they were the tops of pine-trees. At last there was one shock longer and lasting, followed by a deepening thunder below them. The avalanche had struck a ledge in the mountain side, and precipitated its lower part into the valley.|$|R

60|$|There was {{absolute}} stillness, {{not even}} a grass blade moved; but the air {{was filled with the}} presage of summer, and the softness of the carpet, which returned no sound beneath the horse's feet, had its significance.

Bird and beast had left it, and the waste had lain empty under the coldness of death; but life had once more conquered, and the earth was green again. Even among the almost unlettered born upon it there are few men impervious to the influence of the prairie on such a night; and in days not long gone by the half-breed voyageurs told strange stories of visions seen on it during the lonely journeys they made for the great fur-trading company. Its vastness and its emptiness impresses the human atom who becomes conscious of an indefinite awe or is uplifted by an exaltation which vanishes with the dawn, for there are times when, through the silence of measureless spaces, man's spirit rises into partial touch with the greater things unseen.|$|R

Understanding recent changes in trends in avalanche and snow immersion risk at ski areas will help us better educate and protect ski area users.

The NARSID risk in the U. S. is currently 15 times greater than the avalanche risk in bounds at a ski area. In 2005 - 06 alone, 40 % of the total snowboard fatalities at U. S. ski areas were NARSIDs.

40|$|This master???s {{project was}} written {{for the purpose of}} {{presenting}} a variety of literature about outdoor recreation for the handicapped. The project {{is in the form of}} an annotated bibliography for easier selection of appropriate information. The outdoor recreation activity most cited in this bibliography is camping. However, in recent years, other outdoor recreation opportunities have been made available to disabled people. Horseback riding, <b>snow</b> skiing, ???Outward <b>Bound???</b> adventures and airplane flying represent just a few of these new opportunities. The significance of this bibliography is that it highlights these activities in magazine articles, books, monographs, and agency guides to provide the reader with sources for further information. Two basic definitions were used to identify relevant sources: 1) a handicapped individual was defined as a person with a physical, mental, emotional or social impairment which makes achievement unusually difficult and 2) outdoor recreation was defined as any activity which helps an individual gain a sense of appreciation and/or exhilaration from his/her relationship to the natural world. Aquatic activities such as swimming and skin diving were left out as outdoor recreation activities because such activities represent a separate area of recreation. The materials for the project were compiled over a two-month period in the summer of 1979 at these library resources of California State University, Northridge: 1) Recreation Grant Office; 2) Oviatt Library and 3) South Library. Two recommendations for this work are: 1) updating the bibliography yearly and 2) centrally locating the collection of sources for the purposes of retrieval and dissemination...|$|R

50|$|With the passes of the Sierras and the Rocky Mountains blocked in winter, another winter route, the Mormon Road between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles was {{developed}} by a Mormon expedition from their new settlements at and around Salt Lake City, and by some Mormon Battalion soldiers returning to Utah in 1847-48. The first significant use of the route was by parties of Forty-Niners late in 1849, and by some Mormon trains, to avoid crossing the <b>snow</b> <b>bound</b> Sierra Nevada Mountains by linking up with the Old Spanish Trail in southern Utah and closely following it, with alterations to {{the route of the}} mule trails only to allow wagons to traverse it for the first time. Soon afterward it was the route Mormon colonists followed to settle southwestern Utah, a mission in Las Vegas and a colony in San Bernardino, California. This wagon route, also called by some of its early travelers the Southern Route, of the California Trail, remained a minor migration route and in the early 1850s a mail route. After some alterations of the route between Cajon Pass and the border of California and in southern Utah, in 1855, it became a significant seasonal trade route between California and Utah, until 1869, when the transcontinental railroad ended Utah's winter isolation.|$|E
5000|$|The farm {{houses were}} {{located on the}} outer edge, the centre ground was {{originally}} left empty but eventually the artisans, shops and school took over this inner area. The main farmhouse gable faced onto the main road and the run of main buildings formed one side of an enclosed courtyard that was accessed through a main gate onto the street (see sketch layout). The family rooms faced the street, then horse, then cow stabling. The animals were stalled all year, too dry in summer to graze and <b>snow</b> <b>bound</b> over winter. At {{the far end of}} the courtyard were the hay barns and the bake-house. Originally used for retting the flax but when the flax industry declined and there was a change over to barley production (much prized by the brewing industry) they became the family bakehouse. Bread and cake baking for special occasions still used the village bakery. These family bakehouses were impractical and uneconomic for a family, and by World War II only some 20 were left. On the opposite side to the main farmhouse was the dowager’s house with pig sty and poultry beyond. Contrary to local traditions elsewhere the Laimes (grain stores) were positioned outside of the courtyard on the opposite side of the main street, or sometimes in the orchard.Unusually houses were known by their 17th-century (if not older) names and not, because of recurrences of the same surnames, by the current owner. Farms were passed down to the younger son, who then had to make proportionate payment or dowry to other siblings. Around 1877-82 the patchwork pattern of fields was re-divided and each farmer had his land close together. The smaller farmers were known as ‘cow-farmers’ and the small holdings as ‘gardeners’.|$|E
