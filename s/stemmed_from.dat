5|$|Isabeau was popularly {{seen as a}} spendthrift {{and irresponsible}} philanderess. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries historians re-examined the {{extensive}} chronicles of her lifetime, concluding that many elements of her reputation were unearned and <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> factionalism and propaganda.|$|E

Also, [...] ("to drink") is written ըմպել because it <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the noun [...] ("mouthful," [...] ումպ): ումպ-ել.|$|R
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a personal belief {{that his wife}} Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E
5|$|Rapoport {{has argued}} that Sorabji's {{reluctance}} to make commercial recordings of his music <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a fear of losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
5|$|At 17:30, {{three hours}} into the war, the twelfth and final {{infantry}} wave crossed, bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32,000 men (around 6,400 in each bridgehead). By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks. The magnitude of Israeli losses <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> their insistence to reach their comrades in the Bar Lev Line, and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers.|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} identifies key ways {{in which}} regulatory responses can differ across national boundaries. Some of these differences <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> variations in the perceived acceptability of an activity in different cultures. Others <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> different approaches to the common problem of identifying and regulating hazardous activity. Yet, others <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> differences in reaction to scientific or technological breakthroughs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} name of Laredo is unclear. Some {{scholars}} say the name might <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> Glaretum which means [...] "sandy, rocky place" [...] others state that Laredo <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> Euskara and means [...] "beautiful prairies". Laredo might also <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> Laridae which means gull {{or it might}} be made up of two Latin words lar which means home and edo which means birth.|$|R
5|$|Deeper {{insight into}} the nature of chess came with two younger players. American Paul Morphy, an {{extraordinary}} chess prodigy, won against all important competitors (except Howard Staunton, who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an {{international}} treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 {{vote in the}} Senate. The primary objections <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India, whose industrial base and carbon footprint have grown rapidly, and fears that the exemptions would lead to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts by}} Magnus to besiege Swedish-controlled Reval were faltering, {{with support from}} neither Ivan nor Magnus' brother, Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming. Ivan's {{attention}} was focused elsewhere, while Frederick's reluctance perhaps <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a new spirit of Swedish–Danish unity that made him unwilling to invade Livonia on behalf of Magnus, whose state was a vassal of Russia. The siege was abandoned in March 1561, whereupon Swedish action in the Baltic escalated, with the passive backing of Sigismund, John's brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{has made}} {{numerous}} inflammatory {{statements in the}} press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits.

5|$|Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, starting Sunday, 22 June 1941, during World War II. The operation <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> Nazi Germany's ideological aims to conquer the western Soviet Union {{so that it could}} be repopulated by Germans, to use Slavs as a slave-labour force for the Axis war-effort, and to seize the oil reserves of the Caucasus and the agricultural resources of Soviet territories.|$|E
5|$|The LaRouche {{criminal}} {{trials in}} the mid-1980s <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche and members of his movement.

LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.|$|E
5|$|The {{third of}} five children, Serevi {{was born in}} Suva, {{on the island of}} Viti Levu on 20 May 1968. He was raised by staunch Christian parents who were both heavily {{involved}} in the Church. Serevi's inspiration to play rugby <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his childhood, when Fiji defeated the British Lions in 1977. He missed watching the match, and decided to take up rugby after seeing how happy the victory made the people of Fiji.|$|E

5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E
5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
