The origin—whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol—is immaterial; {{all of them are}} suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which—as is common today—has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous <b>stringiness</b> after being cooked.|$|E
5000|$|Some cheeses, like raclette, melt smoothly; many tend {{to become}} stringy or suffer from a {{separation}} of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly {{in the presence of}} acids or starch. Fondue, with wine providing the acidity, {{is a good example of}} a smoothly melted cheese dish. Elastic <b>stringiness</b> is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including pizza and Welsh rarebit. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying [...] "you can't melt cheese twice" [...] (meaning [...] "some things can only be done once") refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.|$|E

40|$|Findings are {{presented}} indicating {{the effects of}} nutrient solutions containing combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at different levels, on the tissues causing <b>stringiness</b> in celery petioles. These tissues are the collenchyma strands and the vascular bundles. High applications of nitrogen stimulated succulent growth and hence retarded maturity and development of <b>stringiness</b> in the collenchyma, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the vascular bundles. Phosphorus had no direct effect on <b>stringiness.</b> Potassium had a marked effect in increasing <b>stringiness</b> when applied in large amounts. The cell walls of the collenchyma strands became thicker as maturity progressed. This thickening of the cell walls of collenchyma tissue resulted in their increased <b>stringiness.</b> The size of the collenchyma strands was no indication of amount of string present but maturity was an indication since <b>stringiness</b> increased with age.

40|$|String cheese samples {{ranging in}} pH from 5. 0 to 5. 9 were {{prepared}} by kneading Mozzarella curd and stretching it 2 to 80 times. Rheological properties were examined by compression, stress relaxation, and flow property tests. <b>Stringiness</b> was tested by a device {{specifically designed for}} this purpose: a standardized string was pulled from the sample at a direction perpendicular to {{the orientation of the}} curd and the amount of fibres resulting from this process was quantitated using digital image analysis. Force-deformation curves implied that the curd prepared by kneading may be considered to be an incompressible viscoelastic body similar to rubber. Curd made at pH 5. 0 flowed more easily then the other curds. Changes in pH had greater effects on rheological properties than the moisture content. The effect of temperature on the flow properties should be considered when pumping the curd through pipes, extruding from nozzles, and in stretch processing. <b>Stringiness</b> was low at 5 w 10 C but was markedly increased at 25 C, at which temperature string cheese should be consumed. Optimal <b>stringiness</b> was obtained in cheese curd samples having a pH of 5. 4. Light microscopy and electron microscopy revealed that <b>stringiness</b> is associated with a uniform longitudinal orientation of the protein matrix. Moderate <b>stringiness</b> occurred in a network of casein subunits having diameters equal to those of casein submicelles.

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} lamb meat foods (Wiener sausage, ham, roasted meat, and roasted leg) were {{developed}} based on 8 different genotypes to improve lamb meat quality and quantity, and {{to study the}} differences among them. The <b>stringiness,</b> flavour, and odour of the products were judged in food sensory evaluation {{by a total of}} 265 (60 % male and 40 % female) randomly selected consumers. In <b>stringiness</b> and flavour five (from 1 to 5), and concerning odour three (from 1 to 3) categories were created according to decreasing quality. The consumers represented different age groups: below 20 years, between 21 – 30, 31 – 40, 41 – 50, 51 – 60, 61 – 70, and above 70 years. The groups of consumers were involved in sheep farming, other animal farming, other agriculture sector, industry, catering, education, other service; administrative department of the state, were students, and others. Analyses of variance were calculated to estimate the effects of the genotype of lamb, the gender, age, and occupation of judging consumers on the sensory evaluation of the meat foods. In conclusion, new lamb meat foods were highly appreciated by consumers, who made definite distinctions among genotypes according to flavour, stinginess, and odour.

40|$|Following {{some recent}} work by Gross, we {{consider}} the partition function for QCD on a two dimensional torus and study its <b>stringiness.</b> We present strong evidence that the free energy corresponds to a sum over branched surfaces with small handles mapped into the target space. The sum is modded out by all diffeomorphisms on the world-sheet. This leaves a sum over disconnected classes of maps. We prove that the free energy gives a consistent result for all smooth maps of the torus into the torus which cover the target space $p$ times, where $p$ is prime, and conjecture that {{this is true for}} all coverings. Each class can also contain integrations over the positions of branch points and small handles which act as ``moduli'' on the surface. We show that the free energy is consistent for any number of handles and that the first few leading terms are consistent with contributions from maps with branch points.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} polysaccharides to function as fat mimetics in low-fat (LF) mozzarella string cheese to improve functionality by acting like fat globules to separate protein fibers during cheese extrusion. Low-fat mozzarella cheese curd made from 273 kg of 0. 7 % fat milk was salted {{at a rate of}} 10 g/kg then divided into 3. 6 -kg batches that were hand-stretched in 5 % brine at 80 ° C and formed into a homogeneous mass. The hot cheese was hand mixed with a hot 80 ° polysaccharide slurry, placed into a small piston-driven extruder and then forced through a 16 -mm die to form the string cheese. Extruded string cheese was cut manually into approximately 15 -cm lengths. From preliminary trials using starches (waxy corn, waxy rice, and instant tapioca starch), xanthan and guar gums, and polydextrose, we determined that LF string cheese made using xanthan gum most closely resembled commercial string cheese. LF cheese was then made using a 10 % xanthan gum slurry added at 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % (wt/wt) levels. Cheeses were analyzed for fat, salt, pH, and moisture. After 2 wk of 4 ° C storage, the cheese was analyzed for extent of <b>stringiness</b> by pulling apart the cheese longitudinally, visually observing and photographing the size, length and appearance of individual strings of cheese. Hardness was determined using a Warner-Bratzler shear test. A consumer liking test was conducted after 2 and 8 wk storage time at 6 ° C. At 2 -wk storage, using a hedonic scale (1 to 9) for overall liking, the LF string cheese with 1 % added xanthan slurry (score = 6. 8) was liked more (PWhen considered on a JAR scale, most of the panelists scored the LF cheese with added xanthan gum (1 %) as having the right texture, while only some did so for the retail cheese. The LF control cheese with no added gum was considered too firm. Using a visual comparison, adding the xanthan gum slurry produced greater fiber formation with the longest and most complete string separation.

40|$|International audienceAbstract 1. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of ｣tocopheryl acetate (50 ppm) and υ-carotene (15 ppm) dietary supplementation on the oxidative status of raw turkey breast and leg muscles assessed through the thiobarbituric acid test values, the vitamin E levels and the antioxidant enzyme activities. In parallel, a quantitative descriptive sensory analysis was carried out on cooked, stored and reheated samples. 2. Vitamin E was present in the accurate quantity to reduce oxidation, since iron-induced reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly lower in antioxidant supplemented treatments. The results suggest that the presence of υ-carotene in the diet seems to limit the accumulation of ｣tocopherol in turkey muscles. 3. In the present study, there is no conclusive relationship between the antioxidant dietary supplementations and the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. 4. Sensory evaluation showed that a longer supplementation time and dose could be necessary in turkeys to prevent meat from rancidity and warmed-over flavour (WOF). Leg pastiness and <b>stringiness</b> were modified by antioxidant dietary supplementation indicating the possible cooperation between antioxidants and cystein proteinases in the perception of meat quality. 5.

The thesis is aimed at meaning {{and quality of the}} muscle meat of the broiler and description of the influence of the feed on the sensoric qualities. The samples of the broiler (breast and thigh muscle meat) were evaluated from four breeders (A, B, C, D) in three different times. The meat has been evaluated for smell, colour, <b>stringiness,</b> fragility, juiciness, chewability and taste. The differences among individual breeders in analysed properties were assessed as an effects of the feed. The evaluation shows the best poultry breeder {{in the sense of the}} breast muscle, has been breeder D. This breeder achieved the best results (p < 0, 05) in three parametrs (colour, chewability and taste). The best breeder, in the sense as regards thigh muscle, has been the breeder A, who achieved the best results (p < 0, 05) in four parametrs from seven (fragility, juiciness, chewability and taste).

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A {{focus group}} {{interview}} consisting of 25 international Taiwanese students and a consumer survey in which 793 native Taiwanese urbanites participated were conducted. Both studies investigated the purchasing and consumption behaviors, attitudes, opinions and expectations of Taiwanese people toward cheese. The focus group results provided good predictions and explanations of survey findings. Consuming fast foods introduced cheese to Asians. However, cheese {{may not be the}} main reason to consume fast foods. Cheese was considered as an ingredient in foods. Consuming cheese at a restaurant was more frequent than at home. Cheese sandwiches, fast foods, au gratin foods, cheesecake and spaghetti were popularly consumed at restaurants. Home consumption frequency of cheese was less than once a month. Subjects whose parents and elders do not accept cheese, were not knowledgeable about cheese. Chinese culture influenced subjects' attitudes and behaviors relating to cheese. First, cheese was consumed in a hot and melted form. Then, small packages of cheese were purchased for home use. Finally, subjects were willing to try new Chinese foods specially developed for cheese. Sensory, visual and marketing factors influenced decision-making of cheese purchasing. Strong product characteristics affecting cheese purchasing were price (moderate), health concerns (low in fat and cholesterol and high in calcium) and form (sliced cheese individually wrapped with plastic film). The important sensory expectations of cheese were the presence of <b>stringiness</b> (appearance and texture), creaminess (aroma), softness, fineness, melted in hands, and smoothness (texture), and milkiness and buttery (flavor) and the absence of oiliness (appearance and flavor), stickiness (appearance) and bitter and sour aftertaste (flavor).

Intensive moisturization of the lesions and use of emollient oils have been recommended for the prevention and treatment of striae distensae rubra. The aim of this research was to formulate an emollient water-in-oil cosmetic cream containing argan oil, which may be helpful in the prevention or early treatment of striae distensae. Patients and methods: Sensory evaluation of the consistency, firmness, adhesiveness, oiliness, spreadability, and rapidity of penetration into the skin was evaluated by 22 volunteers using 10 -point scales for each descriptor. The instrumental characterization of the cream was performed using Brookfield® CT 3 Texture Analyzer. The cutaneous changes induced by the topical use of the cream were evaluated by assessing the thickness of the epidermis, hydration, and elasticity of the skin using DermaLab® Combo scanner. Results: Ultrasound measurements showed an improvement in the elasticity of the epidermis following the application of cream. The product was well tolerated and appreciated by the consumers in terms of its spreadability, penetration ability, and lack of stickiness. The values recorded for texture analysis were firmness 10. 16 ± 0. 15  mJ, adhesiveness 30. 94 ± 6. 87  g, consistency 1229. 50 ± 119. 78  g, spreadability 481. 50 ± 39  g, and <b>stringiness</b> 0. 56 ± 0. 09  mJ. Conclusion: A water-in-oil cream containing argan oil and emollient ingredients with appropriate physical characteristics was obtained.

40|$|Cellulose {{derivatives}} containing associating hydrophobic groups {{along their}} hydrophilic backbone {{are used as}} rheology modifiers {{in the formulation of}} water-based spray paints, medicinal sprays, cosmetics and printable inks. Jetting and spraying applications of these materials involve progressive thinning and break-up of a fluid column or sheet into drops. Strong extensional kinematics develop in the thinning fluid neck. In viscous Newtonian fluids, inertial and viscous stresses oppose the surface tension-driven instability. In aqueous solutions of polymers such as Ethyl Hydroxy-Ethyl Cellulose (EHEC), chain elongation provides additional elastic stresses that can delay the capillary-driven pinch-off, influencing the sprayability or jettability of the complex fluid. In this study, we quantify the transient response of thinning filaments of cellulose ether solutions to extensional flows in a Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) and in a forced jet undergoing break-up using Rayleigh Ohnesorge Jetting Extensional Rheometry (ROJER). We also characterize the steady state molecular deformations using measurements of the flow-induced birefringence and excess pressure drop in an extensional stagnation point flow using a Cross-Slot Extensional Rheometer (CSER). We show that under the high extension rates encountered in jetting and spraying, the semi-dilute solutions of hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxy-ethyl cellulose (hmEHEC) exhibit extensional thinning, while the unmodified bare chains of EHEC display an increase in extensional viscosity, up to a plateau value. For both EHEC and hmEHEC dispersions, the low extensibility of the cellulose derivatives limits the Trouton ratio observed at the highest extension rates attained (close to 10 [superscript 5] s[superscript − 1]) to around 10 – 20. The reduction in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate for the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether is primarily caused by the disruption of a transient elastic network that is initially formed by intermolecular association of hydrophobic stickers. This extensional thinning behavior, in conjunction with the low extensibility of the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether additives, makes these rheology modifiers ideal for controlling the extensional rheology in formulations that require jetting or spraying, with minimal residual <b>stringiness</b> or stranding.
