40|$|As the {{vibration}} of high speed train becomes fierce {{when the train}} runs at high speed, {{it is crucial to}} develop a novel suspension system to negotiate train’s vibration. This paper presents a novel suspension based on Magnetorheological fluid (MRF) damper and MRF based smart air spring. The MRF damper is used to generate variable damping while the smart air spring is used to generate field-dependent stiffness. In this paper, the two kind smart devices, MRF dampers and smart air spring, are developed firstly. Then the dynamic performances of these two devices are tested by MTS. Based on the testing results, the two devices are equipped to a high speed train which is built in ADAMS. The skyhook control algorithm is employed to control the novel suspension. In order to compare {{the vibration}} suppression capability of the novel suspension with other kind suspensions, three other different suspension systems are also considered and simulated in this paper. The other three kind suspensions are variable damping with fixed <b>stiffness</b> <b>suspension,</b> variable <b>stiffness</b> with fixed damping suspension and passive suspension.

30|$|The black {{curve in}} Fig.  9 b {{shows that the}} carbody {{acceleration}} increases with the equipment <b>suspension</b> <b>stiffness</b> first, but then decreases sharply, and increases again.

30|$|The {{suspension}} elements are directly proportional {{with the standard}} deviation of car body lateral acceleration and inversely proportional with the standard deviation of the car body lateral stroke. Lateral <b>suspension</b> <b>stiffness</b> elements of secondary air suspensions, K_sy, and secondary center pivot suspension, K_cpy, have both {{significant impact on the}} lateral response of the rail vehicle in comparison to the effect of the viscous lateral damper, C_sy. Secondary air <b>suspension</b> <b>stiffness</b> along lateral direction, K_sy, has the most significant effect on the passenger comfort, since its effect is doubled by the existence of two number of secondary air suspensions in comparison to single-center pivot suspension. The selection of softer lateral <b>suspension</b> <b>stiffness</b> provides better ride quality resulting in lower lateral car body accelerations but greater lateral car body displacements.|$|E
