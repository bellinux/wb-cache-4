40|$|We use <b>street</b> <b>addresses</b> {{to refer}} to {{locations}} in a city. <b>Street</b> <b>addresses</b> are easy to remember and communicate because they follow a symbolic addressing scheme, containing human intelligible symbols. However, <b>street</b> <b>addresses</b> can often be ambiguous or confusing and don't provide complete coverage of outdoor spaces. Latitude and longitude coordinates, a metric addressing scheme, are unambiguous and accommodate locations {{that may not have}} <b>street</b> <b>addresses.</b> However, latitude and longitude coordinates are unusable on a daily basis because they must be specified to many digits to be useful at human-level scales. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a new hybrid addressing scheme, Human Intelligible Positioning (HIP), which uses a metric addressing scheme as its substrate. Addresses in this metric addressing scheme are mapped to two-dimensional offsets within named coordinate systems. HIP addresses combine the easy memorability and communicability of <b>street</b> <b>addresses</b> with the precision and universal outdoor coverage of latitude and longitude coordinates. by Vishwanath Venugopalan.

5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a <b>street</b> <b>address</b> on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{was born}} on March 19, 1848, the fourth child of Nicholas Porter Earp and his second wife, Virginia Ann Cooksey.

Some evidence supports Wyatt Earp's birthplace as 406 South 3rd Street in Monmouth, Illinois, though the <b>street</b> <b>address</b> is disputed by Monmouth College professor and historian William Urban.

5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the Bastille {{had come to}} {{separate}} the more aristocratic quarter of Le Marais in the old city from the working class district of the faubourg Saint-Antoine that lay beyond the Louis XIV boulevard. The Marais was a fashionable area, frequented by foreign visitors and tourists, but few went beyond the Bastille into the faubourg. The faubourg was characterised by its built-up, densely populated areas, particularly in the north, and its numerous workshops producing soft furnishings. Paris as a whole had continued to grow, reaching slightly less than 800,000 inhabitants by the reign of Louis XVI, {{and many of the}} residents around the faubourg had migrated to Paris from the countryside relatively recently. The Bastille had its own <b>street</b> <b>address,</b> being officially known as No. 232, rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E

5|$|At about 5 a.m., Parsons {{stopped at}} a Texaco service station 23 miles to the north. He was wearing Ernest's clothes and had assumed his identity. Parsons told the station {{attendant}} he needed to hose out red construction paint from the car's interior and offered to give him Ernest's construction tools. The attendant said that he observed Parsons throwing away clothing, books, posters and carpentry tools into a dumpster. Parsons asked the attendant about the distance to Denver and spoke of Ernest's 9-year-old son as his own. He purchased cigarettes and food with Ernest's MasterCard credit card before leaving. At 7:23 a.m., Parsons used the credit card to check into a Quality Inn at Richfield, Utah. He used the card again at about 10 a.m. to purchase seat covers and floor mats from Kmart {{to cover up the}} blood stains in the car. A clerk called the Richfield Police Department after Parsons attempted to purchase $300 worth of items at 12:34 p.m. and the credit card was found to be over its limit. The attendant back at the Texaco station called the Beaver County Sheriff's Office after discovering bloody items in the dumpster. Deputy Raymond Goodwin found Ernest's bank statement and Parsons' bloody clothes in the dumpster. After calling Ernest's wife Beverley, the officers concluded that the person who visited the service station was not Richard Ernest. At about 4:25 p.m. on August 31, a Utah Highway Patrol officer found Parsons sleeping in Ernest's car at the Red Creek rest area on Interstate 70, west of Salina, Utah. When Parsons was brought into the Richfield police station where the bloody clothes were gathered, he continued to insist that he was Ernest. When officers asked for his <b>street</b> <b>address,</b> Parsons asked for a lawyer. Sheriff Kenneth Yardley recalled that Parsons asked if he could keep his book to read.|$|E

This numbering system is also used in Queens, New York City. Exceptions to this numbering system generally exist on the Glen Rock, Hawthorne, and Saddle Brook sides of Fair Lawn and within the Radburn development. The system, dating {{at least as far}} back as the 1930s, was designed to allow emergency personnel to quickly locate addresses.|$|E
