500|$|James Jackson of The Times {{rated the}} first episode {{four out of five}} stars, calling Nesbitt's {{performance}} as Hyde [...] "as entertainingly [...] as a dozen Doctor Who villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that distinguishes this series from other adaptations. The Daily Telegraph's Stephen Pile criticised the script for [...] "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour" [...] and for being [...] "cheesy". He also criticised Hyde's gravity-defying hijinks and mistook Michelle Ryan for a model. In the same newspaper, James Walton called {{the first episode}} a combination of [...] "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of DVDTalk was full of compliments for the series, summing up its review with the statement [...] "six episodes, 300 minutes, not a <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event".|$|E

He {{was eager to}} land the role, feeling that he related to the character extremely well. In preparation for filming, he had to bleach his hair and gain 15 pounds. Lawrence, a close friend, has always spoken highly of him as an actor; in regards to his portrayal of Peeta Mellark she stated, [...] "He's charming, he's sweet, he's down to earth, he's normal. He embodies all of it and brings it all to Peeta ... he's got all those great qualities and every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> comes across in every line he says out loud as Peeta." [...] He became known for his pranks on set, leading to an accident as he was play-fighting with Lawrence who {{kicked him in the}} head, unintentionally knocking him unconscious and giving him a concussion. The initial film, The Hunger Games, was released on March 23, 2012, and went on {{to become one of the}} highest-grossing films of the year. Hutcherson received the MTV Movie Award for [...] "Best Male Performance". He was also awarded the 2012 NewNowNext award for [...] "Next Mega Star" [...] and the National Association of Theatre Owners's 2012 CinemaCon award for [...] "Breakthrough Performer of the Year".

500|$|Although the {{painting}} was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{into the hands of}} a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." [...] The Times said, [...] "We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but {{as far as we can}} comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly", and criticised Etty for a [...] "slovenly manner" [...] and for [...] "abusing his rich gifts, and [...] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that [...] "The work is one of extraordinary power" [...] and that [...] "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree." ...|$|E

2500|$|The System Lords are not {{a unified}} body and {{frequently}} war against each other for dominance, though they will ally {{in the face of}} mutual threats. One of the main strategies of both the Tok'ra and the Asgard is to play the System Lords against one another, so that no <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> becomes too powerful to topple. The System Lords employ elite, highly dangerous Goa'uld assassins known as Ash'raks, who have been known to use stealth devices to become invisible, and wield a device called a hara'kesh that serves as a weapon, an interrogation device, and an instrument of torture. The System Lords can also turn captured enemies into assassins called za'tarcs, using mind control to implant dormant commands hidden by false memories. People who are turned into za'tarcs {{are not a}}ware of it until their programming activates. A System Lord's most trusted servant and confidant is called a lo'taur, a human slave who {{can be used as a}} host in an emergency.

2500|$|In October 1991, Foster {{released}} her first feature {{film as a}} director, Little Man Tate, a drama about a child prodigy who struggles {{to come to terms}} with being different. The main role was played by previously unknown actor Adam Hann-Byrd, and Foster co-starred as his working-class single mother. She had found the script from the [...] "slush pile" [...] at Orion Pictures, and explained that for her debut film she [...] "wanted a piece that was not autobiographical, but that had to do with the 10 philosophies I've accumulated in the past 25 years. Every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> if they weren't in the script from the beginning, they're there now." [...] Although she was publicly lauded for her choice to become a director, many reviewers felt that the film itself did not live up to the high expectations, and regarded it as [...] "less adventurous than many films in which [...] had starred". Regardless, it was a moderate box office success. Foster's final film appearance of the year came in a small role as a prostitute in Shadows and Fog (1991), directed by Woody Allen, with whom she had wanted to collaborate since the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} a great {{humanitarian}} action was performed by squad chief Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, which received from you praiseworthy and commendable words: not entering you in battle because of my injured soldiers, I left for Arkevan and Lankaran through a woody road, wanting to save them from captivity and followed the convoy which was accompanied by unarmed injured soldiers and Russian refugees, totalling 350 people, of whom 260 were injured soldiers, 40 caretakers of the horses, and 50 Russian fugitive soldiers.
