5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} {{drew to a}} close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison, {{grandson}} of territorial Governor William Henry Harrison, was elected President after an intense battle that attracted more than 300,000 partisans to Indianapolis {{to hear him}} <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> his famous front porch. Fort Benjamin Harrison was named in his honor. Six Hoosiers have been elected as Vice-President. The most recent was Mike Pence, elected in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E

25|$|A devout Methodist, Cruikshank entered Union Theological Seminary in 1926 and {{obtained}} a Master of Divinity degree in 1929. During {{his time at}} Union Theological Seminary, Cruikshank became acquainted with the liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr's teachings about the social gospel {{as well as his}} deep involvement in the labor union movement (he was an outspoken critic of Henry Ford and allowed union organizers to <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> his pulpit on union issues) were highly influential in forming Cruikshank's personal beliefs and life.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the {{national}} convention began in St. Louis on June 16, 1896, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates. The former governor, who remained in Canton, followed events at the convention closely by telephone, {{and was able to}} hear part of Foraker's speech nominating him over the line. When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states, its votes gave McKinley the nomination, which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house, anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate's home. Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> his front porch. The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman Garret Hobart of New Jersey for vice president, a choice actually made, by most accounts, by Hanna. Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer Herbert Croly pointed out, [...] "if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it".|$|E
500|$|Both the {{character}} and her role as narrator were generally well received by critics throughout the series, and for which Strong received nominations for multiple accolades. In his review of the pilot, Tom Shales of The Washington Post complimented Mary Alice character's narrations, writing: [...] "Even though narration {{has become the most}} overused technique in prime-time television (needed, perhaps, to help move the narrative along quickly now that hour-length shows have shrunk to as little as 41 minutes plus commercials), the producers of Desperate Housewives use it well, and Strong's uncomplaining perkiness adds yet another layer of irony to the enterprise." [...] Peter Schorn of IGN commended Strong's narrations as well as the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide, calling {{the character}}'s [...] "dark secret" [...] the [...] "McGuffin that powers this first season". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Mary Alice's suicide scene as [...] "mysterious and somber but mostly funny", pointing out that the soundtrack music remains [...] "light and happy" [...] throughout and likened the character's narration to that of Glenn Close in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Celia Wren, also writing for The Washington Post, confirmed that the [...] "idyllic small-town" [...] setting of Desperate Housewives as well as Mary Alice's narration style as a deceased and omniscient narrator were influenced by Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915), for which she complimented the series, writing: [...] "There's a lot of material to work with: Masters's poetic portrait gallery from 1915 gets its oomph from blowtorching the concept of idyllic small-town America. Its largely embittered personalities <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> beyond the grave of murders, seductions, suicides, hypocrisies, political corruption—enough scandalous behavior to make Desperate Housewives look like Little Women." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} did not <b>speak</b> <b>from</b> their breakup until 2008. That August, Jerry Finn {{suffered}} a cerebral hemorrhage {{and was taken}} off life support. On September 19, Barker and Goldstein {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of the}} night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I thought he was going to die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. [...] "Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again. The trio eventually met up in the hospital, laying the grounds for what was going to be the band's reunion. Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting. Hoppus remembered: [...] "I remember [...] said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.|$|E
