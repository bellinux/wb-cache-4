40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{studying}} the influence of PFJ and/or <b>sodium</b> <b>disulphite</b> on Yacon pulp colour, and evaluating the sensory attributes of Yacon non-sugar pastes. A colour kinetic evaluation of browning in 11 treatments containing Yacon tubers, yellow passion fruit juice (PFJ) and/or <b>sodium</b> <b>disulphite,</b> {{over the course of}} 240 minutes was studied to inactivate the PPOs activity. The evaluation of the colour alterations of Yacon tuber by the addition of variable amounts of PFJ and <b>sodium</b> <b>disulphite</b> enabled identification of efficient treatments for the inhibition of browning: T 7 (300 g kg - 1 PFJ), T 8 (400 g kg - 1 PFJ), and T 10 (150 g kg - 1 PFJ + 0. 25 g kg - 1 <b>sodium</b> <b>disulphite).</b> These treatments presented high colour intensity (C*) and an insignificant (P < 0. 05) total colour degradation (&# 916;E). The products elaborated by the cooking of these ingredients were submitted to the acceptability test and data showed that T 7 garnered an acceptance index of 78 %.

30|$|The {{silicic acid}} content was {{measured}} by spectrophotometry using molybdenum blue assay[13]. It {{is based on the}} reaction of silicic acid [Si(OH) 4 with molybdic acid (or ammonium molybdate) at pH 1.5 to 2 to form the yellow isomer beta silicomolybdate (SiMO 12 O 40) 4 −. This molybdate complex is then reduced by <b>sodium</b> <b>disulphite</b> to silicomolybdenum blue to increase spectrophotometric sensitivity. This allows determination of silicic acid concentration in the range of 10 to 70 μgs/ml with a variance of ± 10 %.|$|E
