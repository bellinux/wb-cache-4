5000|$|The {{optional}} INFO chunk allows RIFF {{files to}} be [...] "tagged" [...] with information {{falling into a}} number of predefined categories, such as copyright ("ICOP"), comments ("ICMT"), artist ("IART"), in a standardised way. These details can be read from a RIFF file even if the rest of the file format is unrecognized. The standard also allows the use of user-defined fields. Programmers intending to use non-standard fields should bear in mind that the same non-standard <b>subchunk</b> ID may be used by different applications in different (and potentially incompatible) ways.|$|E
40|$|The WAVE {{file format}} is {{a subset of}} Microsoft's RIFF {{specification}} for the storage of multimedia files. A RIFF file starts out with a file header followed by a sequence of data chunks. A WAVE file is often just a RIFF file with a single "WAVE " chunk which consists of two sub-chunks [...] a "fmt " chunk specifying the data format and a "data " chunk containing the actual sample data. Call this form the "Canonical form". Who knows how it really all works. I use the standard WAVE format as created by the sox program: Offset Size Name Description The canonical WAVE format starts with the RIFF header: 0 4 ChunkID Contains the letters "RIFF " in ASCII form (0 x 52494646 big-endian form). 4 4 ChunkSize 36 + <b>SubChunk</b> 2 Size, or more precisely: 4 + (8 + <b>SubChunk</b> 1 Size) + (8 + <b>SubChunk</b> 2 Size) This {{is the size of}} the rest of the chunk following this number. This is the size of the entire file in bytes minus 8 bytes for the two fields not included in this count...|$|E
5000|$|Two chunk identifiers, [...] "RIFF" [...] and [...] "LIST", {{introduce}} a chunk that can contain <b>subchunks.</b> The RIFF and LIST chunk data (appearing after the identifier and length) have the following format: ...|$|R
5000|$|A RIFF file is a tagged file format. It has a {{specific}} container format (a chunk) {{that includes a}} four character tag (FourCC) and the size (number of bytes) of the chunk. The tag specifies how the data within the chunk should be interpreted, {{and there are several}} standard FourCC tags. Tags consisting of all capital letters are reserved tags. The outermost chunk of a RIFF file has a [...] form tag; the first four bytes of chunk data are a FourCC that specify the form type and are followed by a sequence of <b>subchunks.</b> In the case of a WAV file, those four bytes are the FourCC [...] The remainder of the RIFF data is a sequence of chunks describing the audio information.|$|R
