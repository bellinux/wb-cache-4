50|$|Slabs may be {{strengthened}} by applying FRP strips at their bottom (tension) face. This {{will result in}} better flexural performance, since the tensile resistance of the slabs is supplemented by the tensile strength of FRP. In the case of beams and slabs, the effectiveness of FRP strengthening depends {{on the performance of}} the resin chosen for bonding. This is particularly an issue for shear strengthening using side bonding or U-wraps. Columns are typically wrapped with FRP around their perimeter, as with closed or complete wrapping. This not only results in higher shear resistance, but more crucial for column design, it results in increased compressive strength under axial loading. The FRP wrap works by restraining the lateral expansion of the column, which can enhance confinement in a similar manner as <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> does for the column core.|$|E

30|$|Positioning {{of the six}} {{reinforcement}} bars and the centre cathode bar {{was done with the}} help of a wooden base, where bars were slotted in pre-drilled holes. The specimens were cast in the inverted position such that each bar protruded out of one end of the specimen by 15  mm when in the upright position. The protrusions of the bars were meant to allow connection of the electric circuit from the power supply to the specimens. After the main bars were put in place, <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcements</b> were then tied to the main bars. Subsequently, epoxy coating was applied to both ends of the region of each specimen to prevent corrosion to these regions. Spacer blocks were also put along the <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcements</b> to ensure required concrete cover. Large pipes of 208  mm diameter were also cut which formed the moulds of the specimens. A slit was made along the longitudinal direction of each pipe to facilitate the removal of the formwork upon demoulding. The slit was then closed by tying wires around the pipe. After that, the pipes were placed onto the wooden base and sealed along the circumference using silicone. Silicone was also applied along the slit to close up the gap.|$|R

A new proposed beam-column connection introduced as 'twisted opposing rectangular spiral' was investigated in this research in both experimental and numerical manners along with comparing its seismic performance with both normal rectangular spiral and conventional shear reinforcement systems. The design of three full-scale beam-column connections was performed according to Eurocode (EC 8 - 04) for high ductility classes, and the quasi-static cyclic loading recommended by American Concrete Institute Building Code (ACI 318 - 08) was hired to conduct the seismic tests.

The use of <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is rather a new concept used in construction industry and still being studied on its application. <b>Spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is believed to improve the bonding between concrete and steel, and currently being used in precast concrete connection. A series of laboratory testing was carried out to obtain required values which demonstrate the behaviour of beam anchored with <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Total of six concrete beam specimens containing grouted <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were constructed and tested for flexural capacity, deflection and bond-slip of reinforcement. The parameters included in study were different inner diameter (33 mm and 58 mm) and pitch distance (15 mm and 30 mm) of <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> By using simple statistically and graphical method, analysis was carried out to determine the effectiveness of end anchorage in providing full flexural resistance to the concrete beam.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, confined concrete is a popular topic among researchers. This is because, the ductile behaviour and strength of the concrete increases, when it is confined. Hence confinement effect is considered in seismic design of concrete structures. To find the strength enhancement due to confinement, various models have been proposed. Some of these models are Mander's model, Shah's model and modified L-L model. These models were developed for concrete confined by <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> (the <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was anchored to the main reinforcement bars). Almost all the experiments in the past on concrete confined with <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were carried out anchoring the <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to the main reinforcement bars. In the present study experiments were carried out without fixing the spiral to the main reinforcement bars. The obtained experimental results were compared with the available models. It was found that modified L-L model was very close to the results obtained. Some applications that could use the confinement effect, such as increasing the column load carrying capacity in post construction stage and using <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to increase shear resistance in beams and flat slabs (punching shear) were discussed. Then the experimental results by using spiral as shear resistors were given and it was compared with the confinement effectiveness of the spiral.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown that fiber {{reinforced}} concretes can improve post-peak behaviour, ductility and energy-dissipation ability of concrete elements under flexure, shear and axial load. Ductile behaviour is one of the essential characteristics that have to be possessed by structures located in moderate to high seismic regions. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a series of nine macro synthetic fiber-reinforced concrete (MSNFRC) circular columns. The objective of the studies was to investigate the effects of the macro synthetic fibers on strength and ductility of the columns. The test parameters were the spacing of the <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and the volume fraction of the macro synthetic fibers. In two-thirds of the specimens, when macro synthetic fibers were added to the specimens, <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was reduced. The remaining specimens were detailed in accordance with the code minimum requirement for <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in order to examine the influence of the fibers on strength and ductility.

40|$|Bridge {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Texas which utilize precast bent caps typically employ grouted vertical ducts in the cap-to-column connections.

Thirty-two, large-scale pullout tests of connectors grouted in galvanized steel and plastic ducts were conducted to investigate the response of this type of connector. The results indicate that the tensile capacity is sensitive to the type of duct, the embedded length of the connector, the number of connectors tested simultaneously in tension, and the placement of the connector within the duct. However, the results were not sensitive to epoxy coating on the connector or to the presence of <b>spiral</b> transverse <b>reinforcement</b> around the group of connectors.

40|$|Quality in {{relation}} to higher education is anything but an innocent project: it is ideologically constructed and conducted. Quality {{has been set up}} as its own enterprise and systematically disseminates the meaning of higher education, explicitly and implicitly, stabilizing an ideological formation and establishing a social consensus. In a <b>spiral</b> of mutual <b>reinforcements,</b> quality naturalizes particular practices and, also, legitimizes this naturalness. The systematic critics of quality, however, call that ideological synthesis into increasing question. Quality in higher education is faced with a legitimation problem. It is therefore an appropriate moment to ask: can quality in higher education ever be legitimate? This study comes at these issues by being essentially conceptual in character, although there are also some empirical elements in it. In developing a theoretical understanding, quality in higher education is here advanced as a network of discourses. I further contend that these discourses and networks are backed up by power and that this helps to sustain their ideological character. The theoretical resources for the thesis have mainly been drawn by writers working in philosophy arid sociology and from social and educational theory, {{as well as in the}} field of higher education. The empirical location of the research is that of England and Greece. By drawing on examples of quality practices from these two countries, I am trying to illustrate my argument. The argument though is independent of England and Greece. The thesis has more than a purely theoretical interest. I try to show, in the face of a legitimation problem, that a legitimate quality system in higher education is still possible. I suggest that epistemologically a legitimate system can only be enhancement led, as it is the only place where creative spgces are possible. The major task is to imagine the characteristics of a theory which can account for these creative spaces in enhancementled environments of higher education.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite material have attracted structural and architectural engineers as alternative construction materials {{of the traditional}} wood, steel and concrete. Concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFTs) system {{is one of the}} most promising applications of the FRP composit material. This innovative integrated system can protect RC structures from aggressive environmental conditions; sequentially expand the service life of structures. Nevertheless, limited knowledge is available on the CFFT system at extreme service environments. Data related to durability of the CFFT as integrated system comparing with conventional ones is one of the major challenges that need to be addressed. These data are moer required prior to the widespread acceptance and implementation of FRP materials in civil infrastructure. Farther, comprehensive databases in this specific are critical to provide designers and practicing engineers with the knowledge to select the best solution toward achieving a sustainable built environment. This thesis focuses on evaluating the short and long term effect of freze-thaw cycles on the mechanical behavior of the filament wound glass-FRP (GFRP) tubes. In addition, the thesis evaluating the axial performances of reinforced and unreinforced CFFT columns through experimental and theoretical study. To fulfill the objectives of this research, an experimental program has been designed to examine three main parts. (I) Mechanical properties of the GFRP tubes; (II) The axial behavior of CFFT cylinders; (III) The axial behavior of CFFT reinforced and unreinforced columns. The effect of five parameters and their interactions were investigated; namely, the effect of different freze-thaw cycles (in dry air, frsh and/or salt water), number of cycles (100 and/or 300 cycles), two different thicknesses (2. 65 mm and 6. 4 mm) of the GFRP tube. The influence of using different types of internal longitudinal reinforcement (steel, GFRP, and carbon FRP bars) and the type of transverse <b>reinforcements</b> (<b>spiral</b> steel or FRP tubes) are included in the test variables. Based on the finding of experimental investigation regarding mechanical properties of the GFRP tubes (part I), neither the type nor the number of freze [...] thaw cycles affect the strength of GFRP tube used in this study. However, increasing in the stiffness, reductions in the strains and transition in failure mechanisms are identified after 300 freze-thaw cycles. The experimental results of axial compression tests on CFFT cylinders (part II) indicated low influence of the freze-thaw cycles on the average ultimate strength of CFFT tube with the large thickness. While, significant and sever degradation was reflected on the behavior of CFFT cylinders with the small thickness after 300 freze-thaw cycles. Based on the experimental test results of (part II) environmental reduction factors were proposed to consider the effect freze/thaw cycles on the strength capacity of CFFT cylinders. Also, the regression analysis was used to predict the service life environmental reduction Factors to design CFFT member for up to 75 years. In addition, an assessment of selected FRP-confined models has been presented to predict the ultimate strength of CFFT cylinders based on the test results of (part I). Finally, comparisons between the experimental results and those predicted by the selected models were presented. The experimental investigation on the performance of reinforced CFFT columns (part III) indicated that the freze-thaw exposure brings about individual degradation, in different levels, in the component of the CFFT (GFRP tube, concrete and reinforcement) as integrated systems. This degradation resulted in reduction in the axial carrying capacities of the conditioned columns. Nevertheless, an increase in compressive strength of the CFFT columns was evident over the RC conventional columns. Based on the test results of this (part III), environmental reduction factors were proposed to account for the effect of freze/thaw cycles on the axial load capacity of reinforced and unreinforced CFFT columns. The data obtained from the test results of (part I), predicted confined compressive strength optained from (part II) and the proposed environmental reduction factors from (part III) were used in the ACI 440 - 2 R- 08 and CAN/CSA S 806 - 08 design equations to predict the nominal capacity of CFFT columns in sever environmental condition...|$|R

The test variables considered include the different levels of impact energy and strain rate, GFRP tube thickness and volumetric ratio of SR. The impact behavior of this hybrid structure is also compared with the CFFT and conventional SR column counterparts. The test results indicate that the failure pattern of this hybrid structure is highly dependent on the level of impact energy.

The test parameters included the GFRP-spiral-reinforcement ratio (different spiral spacings [150 and 200 mm] and spiral diameters [13 and 15 mm]). As designed, the beams failed in shear due to GFRP-spiral rupture. The test results indicated that the higher the GFRP <b>spiral</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio, the higher the enhancement of the shear strength due to the confinement, which controls shear cracks and improves aggregate interlocking...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} causes continual degradation to the worldwide infrastructures {{and it has}} prompted the need for challenges to those involved with reinforced concrete structures. Recently, the use of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) tubes as structurally integrated stay-in-place forms for concrete members, such as beams, columns, bridge piers, piles and fender piles has emerged as an innovative solution to the corrosion problem. In such integrated systems, the FRP tubes may act as a permanent form, often as a protective jacket for concrete, and especially as external reinforcement in the primary and secondary directions such as for confinement. Furthermore, the use of concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFT) technique is predicated on performance attributes linked to their high strength-to-weight ratios, expand the service life of structures, enhance corrosion resistance, and potentially high durability. This dissertation evaluates the axial and flexural performances of reinforced CFFT through experimental and analytical investigations. The details description and {{the findings of the}} investigations are presented through seven articles. To fulfill the objectives of this research, an experimental program has been designed including pure compression tests (33 specimens), axial-eccentric load tests (4 specimens) and pure flexure tests (10 specimens). Experimental investigations of the behaviour of CFFT have generally been carried out without using internal longitudinal reinforcement. The CFFT system of this study consists basically of filament-wound glass FRP tubes filled with concrete and reinforced internally with steel or FRP bars. Five types of new FRP tubes have been used with different thicknesses and two different diameters, 152 and 213 mm. Pure compression tests have been conducted on 40 specimens with a total height ranging from 305 mm to 1520 mm. One of the main objectives of testing these specimens is to evaluate the design equations of the North American codes and design guidelines to predict the ultimate load capacities of reinforced and unreinforced short CFFT columns. In addition, the effect of three parameters and their interactions on the buckling behaviour were investigated for these specimens; namely, the FRP tube thickness, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio. The effect of eccentric load on the behaviour of four CFFT specimens of diameters 152 mm and long 912 mm, has been evaluated using four different eccentricity values (15, 30, 45 and 60 mm). Based on the finding of experimental and theoretical investigation for the CFFT columns, a new confinement model is proposed for the confined concrete compressive strength of the CFFT cylinders. Also, the design equations are modified to accurately predict the ultimate and yield loads capacities of internally reinforced and unreinforced short CFFT columns. In addition, the theoretical analysis was utilized to correlate the slenderness ratio of the CFFT columns to various material characteristics and geometric properties of the FRP tubes and concrete. It was found that a slenderness ratio of 12 gave a safe value for the design purposes. However a more precise formula for the slenderness ratio was proposed to control the buckling mode of failure. Pure flexural tests have been conducted on 10 RCFFT and RC beams of a total length 2000 mm with constant diameter 213 mm. The test variables were the type of internal reinforcements (steel or GFRP bars), the FRP tube thickness, concrete compressive strength and the type of transverse <b>reinforcements</b> (<b>spiral</b> steel or FRP tubes). The influence of the considered variables on the flexural behaviour of the tested RCFFT beams is presented. A simplified analytical method is developed to predict the yield and resisting moments corresponding to the failure modes of the tested RCFFT beams. The analysis was conducted according to the equations derived from linear elastic analysis. This analysis was found to be acceptable for predicting the ultimate and yield moments capacities of the FRP or steel-RCFFT beams. In addition, an analytical investigation to examine the validity of the available design provisions for predicting the load-deflection response of CFFT is conducted. The effective moments of inertia of the tested beams are analyzed using the different available code, manuals and design guidelines equations. The results of the analysis are compared with the experimental values. It has been found that the predicted tension stiffening for steel or FRP-RCFFT beams using the conventional equations (steel or FRP-RC member) is underestimated and hence the predicted deflections are overestimated. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study, new proposed equations and a modified expression for the effective moment of inertia of a simply supported CFFT beams reinforced with steel or GFRP bars are introduced...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of lateral confining reinforcement on the ductile behaviour of reinforced concrete columns. The contents of the chapters are summarized as follows. In Chapter one, the general problems in seismic design are discussed and earthquake design methods based on the ductile design approach are described. Japanese, New Zealand and United States design codes are compared. Finally, the scope of this research project is outlined. In Chapter two, after reviewing previous research on confined concrete, the factors which affect the effectiveness of lateral confinement are discussed. Especially the effects of the yield strength of transverse reinforcement, the compressive strength of plain concrete and the strain gradient in the column section due to bending are discussed based on tests which were conducted by the author et al at Kyoto University and Akashi Technological College, Japan. In the axial compression tests on spirally reinforced concrete cylinders (150 mm in diameter by 300 mm in height), the yield strength of transverse reinforcement and the compressive strength of plain concrete were varied from 161 MPa to 1352 MPa and from 17 MPa to 60 MPa, respectively, as experimental parameters. It is found that, when high strength spirals are used as confining reinforcement, the strength and ductility of the confined core concrete are remarkably enhanced but need to be estimated assuming several failure modes which could occur. These are based on the observations that concrete cylinders with high strength spirals suddenly failed at a concrete compressive strain of 2 to 3. 5 % due to explosive crushing of the core concrete between the spiral bars or due to bearing failure of the core concrete immediately beneath the spiral bars, while the concrete cylinders with ordinary strength spirals failed in a gentle manner normally observed. In addition, eccentric loading tests were conducted on concrete columns with 200 mm square section confined by square spirals. It is found that the effectiveness of confining reinforcement is reduced by the presence of the strain gradient along the transverse section of column. In Chapter three, the effectiveness of transverse reinforcement with various types of anchorage details which simplify the fabrication of reinforcing cages are investigated. Eight reinforced concrete columns, with either 400 mm or 550 mm square cross sections, were tested subjected to axial compression loading and cyclic lateral loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The transverse reinforcement consisted of arrangements of square perimeter hoops with 135 ° end hooks, cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° or 180 ° end hooks, and 'U' and 'J' shaped cross ties and perimeter hoops with tension splices. Conclusions are reached with regard to the effectiveness of the tested anchorage details in the plastic hinge regions of columns designed for earthquake resistance. In Chapter four, the effectiveness of interlocking <b>spirals</b> as transverse <b>reinforcement</b> is studied. Firstly, the general aspects and the related problems of interlocking spirals to provide adequate ductility in the potential plastic hinge region of columns are discussed, referring to the provisions in the New Zealand code,the CALTRANS (California Transportation Authority) code and other related codes. Secondly, based on those discussions, a design method to securely interlock the spirals is proposed. Thirdly, the effectiveness of interlocking spirals is assessed based on column tests conducted as part of this study. Three columns with interlocking spirals and, for comparison, one rectangular column with rectangular hoopsandcross ties, were tested under cyclic horizontal loading which simulated a severe earthquake. The sections of those columns were 400 mm by 600 mm. In Chapter five, analytical models to investigate the buckling behaviour of longitudinal reinforcement restrained by cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks and by peripheral hoops are proposed. The analyzed results using the proposed models compare well with the experimental observations described in Chapter three. Using those proposed models, a method to check the effectiveness of cross ties with 90 ° and 135 ° end hooks is proposed for practical design purposes. In Chapter six, a theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture referred to as the "Energy Balance Theory", which has been developed by Mander, Priestley and Park at University of Canterbury, is introduced. After discussing the problems in the "Energy Balance Theory", a modified theory for the prediction of the ultimate longitudinal compressive concrete strain at the stage of first hoop fracture is proposed. The predictions from the modified theory are found to compare well with previous experimental results...|$|R
