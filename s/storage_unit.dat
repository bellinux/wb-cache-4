5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> thawing his remains. Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E

Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E

5|$|The {{contents}} of a <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> are put up for auction if the rental fees are not paid for sixty days. Although the TV show Storage Wars created increased interest in the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value. Sometimes auctioning the renter's property can result in disputes between Public Storage and the renter. In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.|$|E
5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC disk <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 disk <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> {{which consisted of}} 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were pneumatically actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E

25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

25|$|From 1 January 1955 the {{squadron}} was dedicated as a <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> relocated to Gardermoen and made responsible for storing 42 Vampires and 49 other aircraft {{of a wide}} range of obsolete models.

The reactivation took place on 1 September 1955 and the first Sabre landed at Gardermoen twelve days later. Training was initially carried out with the Lockheed T-33A. The first F-86K was airborne on 1 November. The Sabres were intended for defence against possible Soviet attacks, using ground-controlled interception. They were all-weather fighters and advanced compared to the air force's other fighters. The 337 Squadron was therefore manned with experienced fighter crews.|$|E

The Vampires were retired in 1954 and 337 {{was made a}} <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> It was reactivated as an operational unit on 1 September 1955, returning to Gardermoen. It then operated the North American F-86K Sabre. This role lasted 1 September 1963, when the squadron was deactivated. The squadron was reactivated on 1 January 1980 and based at Bardufoss. Its new role was to operate six Westland Lynx helicopters for the newly created Coast Guard. The NH90 replacements were ordered in 2001, but delays caused the Lynxes to remain in service until 2014.|$|E
