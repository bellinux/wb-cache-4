25|$|EMB 110K <b>Stretched</b> <b>version</b> with 0.85m (2ft 9½in) {{fuselage}} {{plug and}} 750shp (560kW) PT6A-34 engines and fitted with ventral fin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the Navajo {{with more}} {{powerful}} 350-hp (261-kW) counter-rotating engines (a Lycoming TIO-540 and a Lycoming LTIO-540) to eliminate critical engine issues.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, {{the luxurious}} Mercedes-Benz 600 was introduced, {{with a range}} {{including}} a long wheelbase version called Pullman. Later, <b>stretched</b> <b>versions</b> of regular Mercedes-Benz S-Class cars were also called Pullman.|$|R
50|$|ISCO {{manufactured}} {{an entire}} range of Iscomorphot anamorphic adapters for the 8mm and 16mm cine markets. These lenses were available in 1.5× and 2× horizontal <b>stretch</b> <b>versions,</b> and are distinct from true Iscoramas.|$|R
50|$|The ZA to ZD were {{basically}} <b>stretched</b> <b>versions</b> of the XR to XY series Ford Falcons respectively, {{with the extra}} length added behind the rear door, moving the rear seat back and giving more leg room.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the Tudor 1 (but not {{the same}} as the Tudor 2 with the {{fuselage}} lengthened by only 6ft/1.83m). It could seat up to 32 passengers, 11 built.|$|E
25|$|Embraer {{considered}} {{producing an}} aircraft which {{was known as}} the E195X, a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the E195. It would have seated approximately 130 passengers. The E195X was apparently a response to an American Airlines request for an aircraft to replace its McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. Embraer abandoned plans for the 195X in May 2010, following concerns that its range would be too short.|$|E
25|$|Yakovlev Yak-50 was {{an early}} {{experimental}} turbojet interceptor aircraft designed in 1948 by the Yakovlev OKB in the USSR. The aircraft was essentially a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the Yakovlev Yak-30 (1948), with a more powerful engine and greater wing sweep. The Yak-50 is perhaps most significant as the first Yakovlev aircraft equipped with velosipednoye (bicycle) landing gear, a trademark of later Yakovlev designs. The Yak-50 designation was later reused for a propeller-driven aerobatic and trainer aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stretch</b> <b>versions</b> of the IKA Rambler Ambassador {{were used}} as {{official}} government limousines. The [...] "Presidential" [...] models featured longer a rear door and side window, as well as broader C-pillar with padded vinyl roof cover and a small rear window.|$|R

25|$|Boeing 717-300X: Proposed <b>stretched</b> <b>version,</b> {{formerly}} MD-95-50; {{studies suggest}} typical two-class seating for 130 passengers, with overall length increased to 138ft 4 in (42.16 m) by addition of nine frames (five forward and four aft of wing); higher MTOW and space-limited payloads weights; additional service door aft of wing; and 21,000lb (93.4kN) BR 715C1-30 engines. AirTran {{expressed interest in}} converting some -200 options to this model. Was under consideration late 2003 by Star Alliance Group (Air Canada, Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa and SAS); interest was reported from Delta, Iberia and Northwest Airlines.|$|E
25|$|The Airbus {{product line}} {{started with the}} A300, the world's first twin-aisle, twin-engined aircraft. A shorter, re-winged, re-engined variant of the A300 {{is known as the}} A310. Building on its success, Airbus {{launched}} the A320, particularly notable for being the first commercial jet to use a fly-by-wire control system. The A320 has been, and continues to be, a great commercial success. The A318 and A319 are shorter derivatives with some of the latter under construction for the corporate business jet market as Airbus Corporate Jets. A <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> is known as the A321. The A320 family's primary competitor is the Boeing 737 family.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, MD-11 was launched, an {{improved}} and upgraded version of DC-10. The MD-11 {{was the most}} advanced trijet aircraft to be developed. It sold 200 units, but was discontinued in 2001 after the merger with Boeing as it competed with the Boeing 777. The final commercial aircraft design {{to be made by}} McDonnell Douglas came in 1988. The MD-90 was a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the MD-80, equipped with International Aero Engines V2500 turbofans, the largest rear-mounted engines ever on a commercial jet. The MD-95, a modern regional airliner closely resembling the DC-9-30, was the last McDonnell Douglas designed commercial jet produced.|$|E
5000|$|Trasco Bremen {{offered a}} <b>stretch</b> {{limousine}} <b>version</b> called the [...] "1000 SEL".|$|R
50|$|A <b>stretched</b> {{transport}} <b>version</b> of {{the aircraft}} was produced as the Caproni Ca.148.|$|R
25|$|AS 332L1 – <b>Stretched</b> civil <b>version,</b> {{with a long}} {{fuselage}} and {{an airline}} interior.|$|R
25|$|Early flight trials, however, {{showed the}} qualities of a turboprop, {{resulting}} in a February 1949 order from the Ministry of Supply for a prototype of a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> with more powerful engines, the Type 700. Meanwhile, the first prototype Type 630 was awarded a restricted Certificate of Airworthiness on 15 September 1949, followed by a full certificate on 27 July 1950, which allowed the aircraft to be placed into trial service with BEA on 29 July to familiarise the pilots and ground crew with the new aircraft. It flew scheduled flights between London and Paris, and London and Edinburgh until 23 August 1950. 29 July 1950 flight between Northolt and Paris – Le Bourget Airport with 14 paying passengers was the first scheduled airline flight by any turbine-powered aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The A119 {{designation}} {{was first}} {{applied to a}} proposed 11-seat <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the A109 in the 1970s; however this concept did not emerge and no such rotorcraft actually built. The helicopter that was eventually to enter production as the A119 was conceived in 1994, as Agusta was recovering from a period of financial woes that had nearly put the company out of business. In February 1995, the second of two prototypes conducted its first flight. The first prototype was used for static tests. Civil certification was originally anticipated in 1997, this deadline was missed allegedly due to multiple issues such as personnel problems, the need to concentrate resources {{on the development of}} the A109 Power, and further development to increase the aircraft's performance to meet customer expectations.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing {{development of a}} jet-powered variant of the 328, initially designated as the Dornier 328-300 and later simply known as the Dornier 328JET, which had been started under Deutsche Aerospace; Fairchild Dornier sought to develop a <b>stretched</b> <b>version,</b> designated as the Dornier 428JET, and a dedicated freighter model. Further derivatives of the 328 included the shortened Dornier 528, the further stretched Dornier 728JET and the significantly enlargened Dornier 928JET. In {{addition to}} typical passenger models, business jet configurations of both the 728JET and 928JET were projected, tentatively referred to as Envoy 3 and Envoy 7 respectively. The ambitious family project drew {{the support of the}} German government, who guaranteed $350 million-worth of loans for the scheme. During the late 1990s, Fairchild Dornier struggled to find both capital and strategic partners to support the project, and the company ultimately entered bankruptcy in April 2002.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stretched</b> {{fuselage}} <b>version</b> {{with metal}} wings, {{powered by a}} 545-HP Allison 250-C20B turboshaft engine.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{aircraft}} seen regularly is the Boeing 757-200 {{operated by}} United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Other aircraft typically seen include the Airbus A319 and A320, Boeing 737-700 and the Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet. Due to its high altitude and short runway, Jackson Hole Airport does not typically see <b>stretched</b> <b>versions</b> of aircraft {{such as the}} Airbus A321 or Boeing 737-900ER.|$|R
50|$|The Antonov An-158 is a <b>stretched</b> {{fuselage}} <b>version</b> of the aircraft, accommodating up to 99 passengers.|$|R
500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the -200ER, Boeing turned its attention to a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the airliner. On October 16, 1997, the 777-300 made its first flight. [...] At [...] in length, the -300 became the longest airliner yet produced (until the A340-600), and had a 20percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model. The -300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the FAA and JAA on May 4, 1998, and entered service with launch customer Cathay Pacific on May 27, 1998.|$|E
500|$|The Castle-class {{corvette}} was a <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of {{the preceding}} Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced [...] at standard load and [...] at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of [...] and a deep draught of [...] They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of [...] and gave a maximum speed of [...] The Castles carried a maximum of [...] of fuel oil that gave them a range of [...] at [...] The ships' complement was 99 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|The 767-300, {{the first}} <b>stretched</b> <b>version</b> of the aircraft, entered service with Japan Airlines in 1986. The type {{features}} a [...] fuselage extension over the 767-200, achieved by additional sections inserted {{before and after}} the wings, for an overall length of [...] Reflecting the growth potential built into the original 767 design, the wings, engines, and most systems were largely unchanged on the 767-300. An optional mid-cabin exit door is positioned ahead of the wings on the left, while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and Rolls-Royce RB211 engines later became available. The 767-300's increased capacity has been used on high-density routes within Asia and Europe. Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining. As of July 2016, 54 of the variant were in airline service. The type's main competitor was the Airbus A300.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stretched,</b> {{supersonic}} <b>version</b> of A-7 {{powered by}} an F100, optimized for interdiction role, but cancelled after two prototypes were built.|$|R
5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future <b>stretched</b> <b>versions</b> of the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Cessna {{launched}} its successful line of Citation business jets in 1970, with the Cessna Fan Jet 500, later renamed Cessna Citation I. Though small and slow, {{it was much}} safer, easier to fly, and less expensive to purchase and operate than the Learjet, and quickly gained prominence. <b>Stretched</b> <b>versions</b> followed, and eventually produced larger, faster business jets matching or exceeding Learjet performance and capacity. Today, Cessna business jets are the world's most popular, with over 3,000 flying.|$|R
