5|$|The {{company had}} {{a loss of}} NOK3.4 million in 2008. In April 2009, Vildanden {{terminated}} its agreement with Aviatrans {{with the intention of}} using larger aircraft. In July, an agreement was made with DAT to operate an ATR-42 on the Bergen route. From 1 August, the Stockholm route was terminated. The company stated that they had been considering having a <b>stop-over</b> at Moss Airport, Rygge on the Stockholm flights, but instead decided to terminate the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a <b>stop-over</b> at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with Germany {{came to an}} end a few weeks after Operation Effective was cancelled, and shortly afterwards it was announced that the division would be redeployed to the Pacific to participate in the invasion of Japan after a brief <b>stop-over</b> in the United States. The deactivation of the 17th Airborne Division meant that the 13th acquired several combat units from that division to bolster it for its envisioned action in Japan. The division arrived in New York City on 23 August, but did not leave the United States before the surrender of Japan in September 1945. With the conflict at an end, the division was no longer required by the United States Army, and it was permanently inactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 25 February 1946, with its personnel transferred to the command of the 82nd Airborne Division.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar <b>stop-over</b> sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} are unknown, Theodore did not renew his attack on Constantinople in 1226 or the years thereafter. Instead, {{he seems to have}} {{occupied}} himself with domestic affairs, as well as taking care to improve relations with Frederick II during the latter's <b>stop-over</b> at Corfu and Cephallonia to lead the Sixth Crusade in 1228. In 1229, he even sent a company of Greek troops to serve under Frederick in Italy. At the same time, Theodore presided over a rupture in relations with Venice, after his governor in Corfu sequestered the cargo of a shipwrecked Venetian ship. Theodore issued an edict on 19 August 1228 prohibiting Venetian merchants from practising commerce in his realm. In January of the same year, Robert of Courtenay died, leaving the throne of the Latin Empire to his eleven-year-old brother, Baldwin II. With a regency taking over the governance of the state, the Latin Empire stood further enfeebled. At this moment, John Asen offered an alliance. Baldwin II would marry his daughter Helena, while John Asen would take over the regency and lend his assistance at repelling Theodore's attacks. The Latin barons viewed the offer with mistrust, as it would offer John Asen every opportunity to take over Constantinople himself; instead, they strung out negotiations, and eventually chose the 80-year-old but energetic John of Brienne (r. 1229–37) as regent. Although the Bulgarian offer failed, it served to open a rift between Theodore and his nominal ally. In a move clearly directed against John Asen, in September 1228, Theodore agreed to a one-year truce with the Latin Empire's regent, Narjot of Toucy, with the border between the two empires running along a line from Ainos to Vrysis.|$|E
5|$|Raids resumed soon after, {{in which}} the Cretans were joined by North African and Syrian fleets. The Peloponnese in {{particular}} suffered considerably from their raids, but also Euboea and the Cyclades: the islands of Patmos, Karpathos and nearby Sokastro came under Cretan control, and Cretan rule extended {{as far north as}} Aegina in the Saronic Gulf, and to Elafonisos and Cythera off the southern coast of the Peloponnese; the great Cycladic island of Naxos, probably along with the neighbouring islands of Paros and Ios, was forced to pay them the poll-tax (jizya). As the Muslim presence left generally few material or literary traces, the list of islands at one time controlled or occupied by them could well be longer. Nevertheless, the impact of this new wave of Arab raids was felt across the Aegean, where some islands were deserted altogether, and elsewhere coastal sites were abandoned for better protected inland locations. Athens may have been occupied in c. 896–902, and in 904, a Syrian fleet led by Leo of Tripoli sacked the Byzantine Empire's second city, Thessalonica. The Arabs of Crete co-operated closely with their Syrian counterparts, who often used Crete as a base or a <b>stop-over,</b> as during Leo of Tripoli's fleet return from Thessalonica, when many of the over 20,000 Thessalonian captives were sold or gifted as slaves in Crete. Likewise, the Cretan emirate received strong support from the Tulunid governors of Egypt (868–905), but their Ikhshidid successors neglected aid to Crete. In 911, another large-scale Byzantine expedition of well over 100 ships was launched against Crete, headed by the admiral Himerios, but it was forced to leave the island after a few months. On its return journey, Himerios' fleet was destroyed in battle off Chios by the Syrian fleet.|$|E

25|$|At present, {{there are}} five {{protected}} areas in Kuwait recognized by the IUCN. In response to Kuwait becoming the 169th signatory of the Ramsar Convention, Bubyan island's Mubarak al-Kabeer reserve was designated as the country's first Wetland of International Importance. The 50,948ha reserve consists of small lagoons and shallow salt marshes and is important as a <b>stop-over</b> for migrating birds on two migration routes. The reserve {{is home to the}} world's largest breeding colony of crab-plover.|$|E
25|$|Schiaparelli was {{dissatisfied}} by {{a lifestyle}} that whilst refined and comfortable, she considered cloistered and unfulfilling. Her craving for adventure and exploration of the wider world led to her taking measures to remedy this, and when a friend offered her a post caring for orphaned children in an English country house, she saw an opportunity to leave. The placement however, proved uncongenial to Schiaparelli, who subsequently planned {{a return to the}} <b>stop-over</b> city of Paris rather than admit defeat by returning to Rome and her family.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{intended}} use {{was as a}} <b>stop-over</b> for large numbers of aircraft in transit. This happened only once, in late 1944, when ninety Junkers Ju 87 Stukas refuled at Eggemoen. During early 1945 the Wehrmacht designated Eggemoen as a site to fly out senior officials should Germany surrender. Air defenses were installed, with 88 mm guns installed at Vågård and Gundersby, as well as smaller guns at the airfield itself. The Gundersby gun was dismounted and sent elsewhere. A wooden dummy was placed in its place, and Allied intelligence never discovered this.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{dimensioned}} to handle one Fokker F-27 Friendship at a time. These aircraft {{were used by}} Braathens SAFE on both the coastal routes and the services to the capital. The 1972 summer routes involved three daily services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, including one with a <b>stop-over</b> in Ålesund. Some of the larger routes instead were flown using the Fokker F-28 Fellowship. There were also three daily services on the coastal route. In cases when Ålesund Airport, Vigra was closed, Braathens would land their larger 124-seat Boeing 737-200s at Årø, making the terminal feel cramped.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 supercapacitors enabled LRV's {{to operate}} in the {{historical}} city area of Heidelberg without catenary overhead wires preserving the city's architectural heritage. The SC equipment cost an additional €270,000 per vehicle, which was expected to be recovered over the first 15 years of operation. The supercapacitors are charged at <b>stop-over</b> stations when the vehicle is at a scheduled stop. This approach may allow many LRV city lines to serve catenary overhead wires that are too expensive to fully route installation. In April 2011 German regional transport operator Rhein-Neckar, responsible for Heidelberg, ordered a further 11 units.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the Spanish claim, Nevis {{continued}} to be a popular <b>stop-over</b> point for English and Dutch ships {{on their way to the}} North American continent. Captain Bartholomew Gilbert of Plymouth visited the island in 1603, spending two weeks to cut twenty tons of lignum vitae wood. Gilbert sailed on to Virginia to seek out survivors of the Roanoke settlement in what is now North Carolina. Captain John Smith visited Nevis also on his way to Virginia in 1607. This was the voyage which founded Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the New World.|$|E
25|$|With Braathens' withdrawal, both Nordsjøfly and Norving skirmished {{to apply}} for a concession. Nordsjøfly was awarded the privilege. Norving bought Nordsjøfly in 1982 and {{incorporated}} it into its operations, taking over the Farsund route. Busy Bee and Norving applied to operate services from Stavanger to Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, respectively. Both were granted their requests, on the condition they make a <b>stop-over</b> at Lista. Busy Bee protested by not starting the route, while Norving started flying in May 1983 with a Cessna Conquest. The route was terminated in February 1988 when Norving pulled out of all scheduled services in Southern Norway.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{created as a}} simple landing field in 1933. With the {{break-out}} of World War II the airport {{was used by the}} Norwegian Army Air Service as a <b>stop-over</b> for flights heading to Northern Norway. After the German forces took control of the area in 1940 they immediately started construction of a wooden runway. More than a thousand people participated in the construction. This allowed them to use the airfield as a stopover for Junkers Ju 87s, especially for bombing raids during the Battles of Narvik. Throughout the war the airport saw daily landings of bombers in transit between Southern and Northern Norway.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} {{to build an}} airport in Røros was taken {{by a group of}} individuals in 1954, with Olav Bergersen as the most enthusiastic. They contacted Braathens SAFE and asked if they were interested in operating flights out of the town. The airline had recently gained the right to fly between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, and was therefore asked if they would be interested in making a <b>stop-over</b> for some of their services in Røros. Ludvig G. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Notodden.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of Britain's ports in {{thirteen}} of its former continental colonies, Bermuda was also used as a <b>stop-over</b> point between Canada and Britain's Caribbean possessions, and assumed a new strategic prominence for the Royal Navy. Hamilton, a centrally located port founded in 1790, became the seat of government in 1815. This was partly resultant from the Royal Navy having invested twelve years, following American independence, in charting Bermuda's reefs. It did this in order to locate the deepwater channel by which shipping might reach the islands in, and at the West of, the Great Sound, which it had begun acquiring {{with a view to}} building a naval base. However, that channel also gave access to Hamilton Harbour.|$|E
25|$|With the German {{capitulation}} on 8 May 1945, {{the airport}} at first taken by Allied troops, who disarmed any German military equipment. The airport was subsequently {{taken over by}} Norwegian authorities. DNL resumed scheduled flights from Trondheim on 27 May 1946, serving Ilsvika with Ju 52 seaplanes with a <b>stop-over</b> on their Northern Norway route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen took {{in a letter to}} the editor in Adresseavisen in 1947 initiative to establishing a land airport in Trøndelag. The Bukken Bruse Accident which killed nineteen people were killed in a crash during landing at the water aerodrome at Hommelvik. However, DNL, and its successor Scandinavian Airlines System never chose to operate out of Lade. Instead they moved their flights to Trondheim Airport, Værnes from 1952.|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of DC-8-aircraft, SAS started a direct service to New York. Fornebu had too short a runway to handle the DC-8, so Flesland became the main intercontinental hub in Norway. Another important factor during the 1960s was the low range of the aircraft—thus Bergen was a <b>stop-over</b> for aircraft from Stockholm and Copenhagen. Later the route was taken over using the Boeing 747. SAS started a direct service from Bergen to Tromsø in 1965. Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget opened in 1970, with Braathens SAFE receiving the route concession from Bergen. Two years later, in a national realignment of concessions, SAS lost their right to fly to Tromsø. Instead Braathens SAFE was granted the right to fly from Bergen via Ålesund, Kristiansund and the newly opened Molde Airport, Årø to Bodø and Tromsø.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, {{citizens}} of Wilmington became {{eager to take}} advantage of railroad transportation. Plans were developed to build a railroad line from the capital of Raleigh to Wilmington. This was later changed when the {{citizens of}} Raleigh did not care to make the venture of a stock subscription to secure the railroad. The end point was changed to Weldon. When construction of the railroad line was finally completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of railroad track in the world. The railroad also controlled a line of steamboats that ran from Wilmington to Charleston; it was widely used for passenger travel and transportation of freight. Regular boat lines served Fayetteville, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main <b>stop-over</b> point, contributing greatly to its commerce.|$|E
25|$|Around 1940 {{the federal}} government, through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), {{determined}} that the Pittsburgh area needed a military airport to defend the industrial wealth of the area {{and to provide a}} training base and <b>stop-over</b> facility. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was continuing to invest in infrastructure across the country in the waning years of the Great Depression, before the US entered World War II, which had started in 1939. The agricultural expanses of Moon Township were attractive to airport planners in the city. The Civil Aeronautics Administration proposed $2.6 million to the county for a $6 million field in August 1941. The County bought the Bell Farm, and federal agencies began construction of the runways on April 20, 1942, after the US had entered the war.|$|E
25|$|In the 1992–1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South Africa {{and got his}} 200th wicket in his 143rd match. Akram took 46 wickets in {{calendar}} year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over. He took six 4-wicket hauls in 1993, the most by him in any year. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India which Pakistan lost and {{went out of the}} World Cup. Wasim's great career was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April 1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan's captain. During the team's <b>stop-over</b> in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates—Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed—and two female British tourists; he was charged with possession of marijuana. Between 1994 and 1996, he took 84 wickets in 39 matches.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{stationed}} at Lade consisted {{for the most}} part of transporters and Stukas. In addition to serving as a <b>stop-over</b> for flights northwards, Lade was important for the defense of Trondheim and the submarine bases. This was organized as part of Jagdgruppe Drontheim of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG5). The airport was bombed by the Royal Air Force's Beaufighters by the 248 and 235 Squadron in April 1942. As of 1943 Lade stationed the staff of IV/JG5 with their twelve Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 aircraft and a detachment of 10/JG5 of five Bf 109G-6s. In an American attack of Dora on 24 July 1943, the winds caused the artificial smoke to cover Lade, but not Dora, allowing the Americans to see their target, but not allow the Germans to scramble their aircraft in defense. In 1944 and 1945 Lade was the base of staff for JG5 and IV/Zerstörergeschwader 26, as well as Messerschmitt Bf 110G from the latter. Transportgeschwader 5 had Ju 52s {{stationed at}} Lade during 1944.|$|E
25|$|According to {{numerous}} reports, Yeltsin was alcohol dependent. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's {{visit to the}} U.S. in 1989 {{for a series of}} lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. The article, reprinted by Pravda, reported that Yeltsin often appeared drunk in public. His alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and an incident during a flight <b>stop-over</b> at Shannon Airport, Ireland, in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Albert Reynolds was told that Yeltsin was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. Reynolds tried to make excuses for him in an effort to offset his own humiliation in vainly waiting outside the plane to meet him. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Yumasheva claimed that her father had suffered a heart attack on the flight from the United States to Moscow and was therefore {{not in a position to}} leave the plane.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple years}} before dying {{he was often}} heard {{remarking}} that he had grown old and this {{to some of his}} devotees was him dropping hints about his final days being imminently close. On the morning of 28 May 1968, as a part of his daily routine, he washed his face, tied his turban and smeared his forehead with a saffron mark (called tilak in Hinduism). All throughout the day, many people had come to visit him. Later-on in the noon, some sadhus (wandering monks) too had come to visit him. He used to give alms to these visiting sadhus (some of whom he would call as mere jugglers in ochre robes) who, on their journey to Amarnath shrine, would <b>stop-over</b> at his place. On this day too, he gave these sadhus whatever money he had in his cloth purse. He is then said to have gone into a state of meditative trance (called samadhi in Hinduism) till about 5:30pm when he asked for some water and was helped to drink a tumbler full of sweet water. He died at about 5:45pm and his recorded last words were Om Namah Shivaya (the mantra of Lord Shiva). On his death, Swami Nand Lal, is said to have remarked that Kashmir was being rocked by an earthquake. He is also said to have predicted Bhagwan Gopinath's death a week in advance.|$|E
