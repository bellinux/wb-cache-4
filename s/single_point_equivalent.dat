40|$|A high {{explosive}} detonation is characterised by the rapid {{release of energy}} as a mass of explosive material is converted into a high pressure, high temperature gas. As this gas expands it displaces the surrounding air, causing a high pressure shock wave to travel through the air away from the explosive at supersonic speed. This shock wave can potentially cause significant damage as it impacts a structure [...] it is {{the challenge of the}} engineer to ensure that our infrastructure is robust {{enough to be able to}} withstand such extreme loading. The first aspect of blast engineering is to be able to predict and quantify the spatial and temporal variation of the load acting on the target to a sufficient level of accuracy. Whilst experimental trials and higher order numerical schemes offer useful insights, the time and expense associated with such methods renders them unusable for the early stages of design. Accordingly, semi-empirical blast predictions are more often favoured. These semi-empirical predictions assume that the target forms a reflecting surface that is effectively infinite in dimensions perpendicular to the direction of travel of the blast wave. For finite-sized targets, however, the presence of target edges is known to significantly alter the pressure acting on the loaded face in a process known as blast wave clearing [...] diffraction of the blast wave around the target which causes a relief wave to sweep in from the edges of the reflecting surface. Current methods for predicting blast wave clearing fail to capture the physical process, and as such are inadequate at providing valid blast pressure predictions. Approximating the relief wave as an acoustic pulse allows for accurate predictions which are based on physically valid principles. Accurate prediction of cleared blast pressure loads has enabled the effect of blast wave clearing to be identified and quantified. Secondly, the target response to this load must be predicted. The single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) method approximates the distributed properties of the real life system into <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>equivalent</b> values. This procedure is well established for the target properties, and by transforming the spatial variation of cleared blast pressure in a similar manner (by conserving energy between real life and equivalent systems), clearing blast pressure loads can be modelled in SDOF analyses. The marked effect of clearing on structural response has been clearly demonstrated in this thesis. The combined improvements to both load prediction and response modelling has allowed a full parametric study to be conducted on finite-sized targets subjected to blast loads. Neglecting clearing can be largely over-conservative for small targets, and for targets with plastic resistance significantly less than the applied transient blast force. It has been observed, however, that neglecting clearing can sometimes be non-conservative through a combination of target rebound, plasticity and early negative pressures caused by the clearing waves. Findings in the PhD thesis should be used to highlight the complex nature of blast-target interaction, particularly when blast wave clearing is concerned, and should dispel the myth that a design will be safe if clearing is neglected. Results presented in the study can also be used by practising engineers to determine the likely effect that blast wave clearing will have on any configuration of explosive mass, stand-off, target size and dynamic properties, and the numerical models developed within have the potential for widespread use in existing commercial software...|$|E

40|$|Although the <b>single</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>point</b> dipole {{model has}} been used to {{represent}} well-localised bio-electrical sources, in realistic situations the source is distributed. Consequently, position estimates of point dipoles determined by inverse algorithms suffer from systematic error due to the non-exact applicability of the inverse model. In realistic situations, this systematic error cannot be avoided, a limitation that is independent of the complexity of the torso model used. This study quantitatively investigates the intrinsic limitations in the assignment of a location to the equivalent dipole due to distributed electrical source. To simulate arrhythmic activity in the heart, a model of a wave of depolarisation spreading from a focal source over the surface of a spherical shell is used. The activity is represented by a sequence of concentric belt sources (obtained by slicing the shell with a sequence of parallel plane pairs), with constant dipole moment per unit length (circumferentially) directed parallel to the propagation direction. The distributed source is represented by N dipoles at equal arc lengths along the belt. The sum of the dipole potentials is calculated at predefined electrode locations. The inverse problem involves finding a <b>single</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>point</b> dipole that best reproduces the electrode potentials due to the distributed source. The inverse problem is implemented by minimising the chi 2 per degree of freedom. It is found that the trajectory traced by the equivalent dipole is sensitive to the location of the spherical shell relative to the fixed electrodes. It is shown that this trajectory does not coincide with the sequence of geometrical centres of the consecutive belt sources. For distributed sources within a bounded spherical medium, displaced from the sphere's centre by 40 % of the sphere's radius, it is found that the error in the equivalent dipole location varies from 3 to 20 % for sources with size between 5 and 50 % of the sphere's radius. Finally, a method is devised to obtain the size of the distributed source during the cardiac cycle...|$|R

40|$|Background: Integrated working between {{health and}} social care {{services}} within England has been encouraged by Government policy in the last decade, and has been argued to provide a seamless, joined up experience for service users (Department of Health 2011). One way of integrating care is {{through the use of}} a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to {{health and social}} care services. A <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to services has been trialled in mental health and learning disability services to improve access, and following on from policy (e. g. Department of Health 2007) and support from literature (Rogers, Entwistle & Pencheon 1998; Lovell & Richards 2000; Raine, Carter, Sensky & Black 2005) a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access to health and social care for older adults has been implemented in parts of the UK. This thesis examines the implementation of one such <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access. Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access and whether it had any impact upon integrated working within a county in England, UK. Methods: An ethnographic approach was taken, using a combination of methods including interviews, focus groups and observations. This was complemented by a grounded theory approach to analysis. Findings: The <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access had an adverse effect upon integration. The poor management of change and lack of communication led to issues within the <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access such as failure of IT systems and duplication. Staff became frustrated and disengaged from the process, and consequently reported feeling disempowered, retreating back to their professional 'tribes'. Conclusion: Firm conclusions about the efficacy of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access with regard to its effect upon integrated working could not be reached. However, the findings suggest that clear communication, continued change management and recognition of professional culture are decisive factors when attempting to integrate health and social care. Further research into the impact of a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> of access upon integration as well as outcomes for service users is recommended...|$|R
