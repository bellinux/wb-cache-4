5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.

5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different <b>socio-economic</b> backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest <b>socio-economic</b> group.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>socio-economic</b> {{stagnation}} Brezhnev {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{proclaimed the}} new {{administration}} a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of <b>socio-economic</b> elites. U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties, {{and the absence of}} freedom of speech and press.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began {{to fear that}} {{the rise of a}} {{powerful}} Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Frères (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for <b>socio-economic</b> advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that use of formula can vary {{according}} to the parents' <b>socio-economic</b> status, ethnicity or other characteristics.

In the United States, mothers of lower <b>socio-economic</b> status have been found less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.|$|E
