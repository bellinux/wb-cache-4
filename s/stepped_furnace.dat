From the obtained investigation results it has been found that the uniform heating of the feedstock in the <b>stepped</b> <b>furnace</b> does not insure the uniform plastic flow of metal over the rolled band length. Therefore, it is necessary to modify the method of feedstock heating in the stepper furnace in order to obtain a uniform temperature over the length of the feedstock before the first rolling stand...|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis an {{implementation}} of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) on a <b>stepping</b> <b>furnace</b> in a steel mill is modeled and proposed. The {{study is a}} case study at the company Štore&STEEL d. o. o. with intentions of realization. In a steel mill a <b>stepping</b> <b>furnace</b> is used to preheat the steel billets for later forging. The <b>stepping</b> <b>furnace</b> is gas fired and already has recuperation of the inlet air implemented. Still there is high temperature of the stack after recuperation, which makes application of an ORC worth of researching and modeling. First the flue gas over one year of furnace operation is analyzed in terms of temperature and volumetric flow. Mass flow and heat capacity are calculated. A layout of an ORC is proposed and modeled in IPSEpro for different temperatures of the flue gas resulting in different output powers and efficiencies. For each temperature an economic viability calculation with the method of reference cost of electric energy is done. The results are presented and the best design and conditions are proposed. The results of the thesis proved that further detailed measurements and calculation are worthwhile, as the flue gas from the <b>stepping</b> <b>furnace</b> has satisfactory conditions to make an application of an Organic Rankine cycle viable. Also the least ammount of state support to fulfill the companies conditions on return of investment is calculated and presented. Finally there are additional measurements and calculations suggested...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{is presented to}} simultaneously diffuse boron and phosphorus in silicon, and grow an in-situ passivating oxide in a single <b>furnace</b> <b>step.</b> It is shown that limited solid doping sources made from P and B Spin-On Dopant (SOD) films can produce optimal n{sup +} and p{sup +} profiles simultaneously without the deleterious effects of cross doping. A high quality passivating oxide is grown in-situ beneath the thin ({approximately} 60 {angstrom}) diffusion glass, resulting in low J{sub o} values below 100 fA/cm{sup 2 } for transparent ({approximately} 100 {Omega}/{open_square}) phosphorus and boron diffusions. For {{the first time it}} is shown that impurities present in the boron SOD film can be effectively filtered out by employing separate source wafers, resulting in bulk lifetimes in excess of 1 ms for the sample wafers. The degree of lifetime degradation in the sources is related to the gettering efficiency of boron in silicon. This novel simultaneous diffusion, in-situ oxidation, impurity filtering and gettering technique was successfully used to produce 20. 3 % Fz, and 19. 1 % Cz solar cells, in one <b>furnace</b> <b>step...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} high temperature treatments followed by only high-pressure water rinse (HPR) of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium cavities. The objective {{is to provide a}} cost effective alternative to the typical cavity processing sequence, by eliminating the material removal <b>step</b> post <b>furnace</b> treatment while preserving or improving the RF performance. The studies have been conducted in the temperature range 800 - 1000 C for different conditions of the starting substrate: large grain and fine grain, electro-polished (EP) and centrifugal barrel polished (CBP) to mirror finish. An interesting effect of the grain size on the performances is found. Cavity results and samples characterization show that furnace contaminants cause poor cavity performance, and a practical solution is found to prevent surface contamination. Extraordinary values of residual resistances ~ 1 nOhm and below are then consistently achieved for the contamination-free cavities. These results lead to a more cost-effective processing and improved RF performance, and, in conjunction with CBP, open a potential pathway to acid-free processing...|$|R
30|$|The same figure {{depicts the}} {{temperature}} {{variation in the}} chimney and the membrane module inlet with time. It is evident that the same pattern with CO 2 /NO concentrations variations exists, which indicates that temperature and concentration curves are strongly correlated as they both {{are affected by the}} different <b>steps</b> of the <b>furnace</b> operation. When chimney’s temperature falls below 90  °C, it is anticipated that bricks’ firing process has already been stalled and tunnel’s cooling is in progress. Below this temperature there is also a decrease of the CO 2 /NO concentrations, while for higher temperatures these concentrations increase. A slight hysteresis of the temperature response may be attributed to gaseous accumulation within the tunnel, and most importantly due to the thermal inertia of the tunnel walls material to endure the high temperatures imposed by the process. The gaseous components are cooled before entering the membrane module not to exceed 40  °C, so that the module’s inlet temperature remains constant over time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Chromium in urine can be {{regarded}} as a marker of internal chromium exposure. More frequent effects are observed to the skin, respiratory and renal systems. Occupational exposure to total chromium can be determined by means of workplace atmospheres measurements and biological monitoring (in urine). Because very small quantity is excreted, considerable analytical sensitivity is required for urinary total chromium determinations. This paper describes a new determination method for total chromium in urine using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) with a background correction. The atomisation temperature used was 2400 o C and a cleaning <b>step</b> for graphite <b>furnace</b> after each samples series was realized. The validation of GFAAS method was made in concordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). To determine the performance parameters for the method (linearity, accuracy and precision) standard calibration solutions were used in the concentration range of 10 - 100 µg/L. After validation, total chromium determinations in urine were made to involved personal in pigments obtaining process. The measured values of total chromium are situated between 0. 01 – 29. 67 µgCr/g Creatinine (under the maximum accepted limit- 30 µgCr/g Creatinine) ...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed is an arrangement, dopant {{source and}} method {{used in the}} {{fabrication}} of photocells that minimize handling of cell wafers and involve a single <b>furnace</b> <b>step.</b> First, dopant sources are created by depositing selected dopants onto both surfaces of source wafers. The concentration of dopant that {{is placed on the}} surface is relatively low so that the sources are starved sources. These sources are stacked with photocell wafers in alternating orientation in a furnace. Next, the temperature is raised and thermal diffusion takes place whereby the dopant leaves the source wafers and becomes diffused in a cell wafer creating the junctions necessary for photocells to operate. The concentration of dopant diffused into a single side of the cell wafer is proportional to the concentration placed on the respective dopant source facing the side of the cell wafer. Then, in the same thermal cycle, a layer of oxide is created by introducing oxygen into the furnace environment after sufficient diffusion has taken place. Finally, the cell wafers receive an anti-reflective coating and electrical contacts for the purpose of gathering electrical charge. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured Er 3 +–Si {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) codoped Al 2 O 3 {{films were}} synthesized by a one step laser based deposition process which allows {{to form the}} Si NPs in situ at room temperature, and to control their size and separation with the Er ions in the nanoscale. Two different thermal annealing treatments are studied in order to optimize the photoluminescence (PL) emission: rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 900 °C during 2 min, and conventional <b>furnace</b> <b>step</b> annealing at different temperatures up to 750 °C for 1 h. After RTA process the films show an important enhancement on the photoluminescence lifetime values which is related to a reduction of the non-radiative decay channels. Nevertheless, the Si NPs to Er ions energy transfer is strongly reduced. In contrast after conventional furnace annealing up to 700 °C, although {{there is only a}} moderate increase of the photoluminescence lifetime values, the excitation of Er ions through Si NPs is still active and as a consequence a large enhancement of the photoluminescence intensity with respect to the Er-only doped film is achieved. These different behaviours are most likely related to structural and chemical changes in the Er environment upon the different annealing processes.

40|$|Aluminum is {{produced}} by the electrolytic reduction of alumina dissolved in molten cryolite. This process requires carbon anodes which are consumed during the electrolysis. The anodes contribute roughly with 15 % to the total aluminum production cost. If the anode quality is poor the share can as well reach 25 %. It is known that the anode behavior during aluminum electrolysis is significantly influenced by the anode baking process. However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge to predict the anode behavior through given baking parameters. In addition, process control of industrial furnaces is still to a large degree empirical. Often the emission of industrial furnaces causes problems as deposits can accumulate in the exhaust system which leads to fire incidents. This investigation has three major goals: The prediction of the anode behavior during electrolysis for a given heat treatment. The understanding of the process control of industrial scale open-top anode baking furnaces. The emission control of the open-top anode baking furnace. The baking parameters are defined in this thesis as the anode heat-up rate and the baking level. Through pilot baking it is shown that the baking level is basically determined by the final baking temperature although the soaking duration has some influence too. The anode baking level can be estimated with a calculation for any given baking curve. Therefore the impact of the temperature and soaking duration on the real density anode property needs to be determined through a pilot study. The optimum baking parameters regarding the anode behavior during electrolysis depend on the material. Some anode materials react more sensitive to the heat treatment than others do and are therfore more difficult to handle in the industrial baking process. Through pilot scale anode baking it is shown how to predict the anode behavior during electrolysis. Process control of the anode baking in industrial open-top furnaces is complex since the anode baking is indirectly controlled by the combustion process inside the flues. Through measurements the combustion process is analyzed in this thesis. The results show that a furnace operated at its physical limits is difficult to control regarding to emissions. However, the gained knowledge allows to optimize existing furnace process control systems. The furnace emissions are mainly caused by insufficient combustion of the pitch fumes formed during the pyrolysis of the anode binder pitch. It is shown that emission problems cannot always be solved by a well chosen control system setup. In such a situation combustion control is required in addition to temperature control. A technology has been developed to measure online the combustion situation of each flue. For this purpose 2 -color pyrometers, together with an intelligent signal processing, are required. This technology is integrated since 10 months in an industrial baking furnace control system. The results are promising. The developed technology is an important <b>step</b> for <b>furnace</b> operation at maximum productivity and minimum emission. A patent has been applied for the combination of online combustion analysis concurrent with temperature measurement (swiss apply No. 01598 / 02 by Mauriz Lustenberger and Felix Keller, R&D Carbon Ltd.

40|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} the mechanisms and controls on argon diffusion in K-feldspar has {{led us to}} undertake direct diffusion measurements on a crystal with simple microtextures, over a range of temperatures. Measurements of argon diffusion profiles in a gem-quality iron-rich orthoclase heated in a cold seal apparatus, have been undertaken in situ using an ultra-violet laser ablation microprobe (UVLAMP) technique. The results agree very closely with the previously determined bulk values for Benson Mines orthoclase (activation energy (E) = 43. 8 ± 1 kcal mol - 1) and vacuum furnace cycle-heating studies of K-feldspars (E= 46 ± 6 kcal mol - 1). However, instead of defining a single activation energy (E) and diffusion coefficient (Do), the data yield two sets of parameters: a low-temperature (550 - 720 °C) array with an E of 47. 2 ± 2. 5 kcal mol - 1 (198. 2 ± 10. 5 kJ mol - 1) and a Do of 0. 0374 + 0. 1123 - 0. 0281 cm 2 s - 1, and a high-temperature (725 - 1019 °C) array with an E of 63. 8 ± 3. 4 kcal mol - 1 (268. 0 ± 14. 3 kJ mol - 1) and a Do of 55. 0 + 225. 5 - 44. 2 cm 2 s - 1. The new results closely reproduce two sets of apparent activation energies previously measured in cycle-heating studies of Madagascar K-feldspar (40 ± 3 and 57 ± 3 kcal mol - 1). Previous interpretations of the two arrays have included multiple domains with variable activation energies and fast track diffusion. However, the UV depth profile analyses indicate simple diffusion to the grain surface and importantly, diffusion radii calculated by combining the UVLAMP and cycle-heating data, {{are the same as}} the physical grain sizes used in the experiments, around 1 mm. Vacuum <b>furnace</b> <b>stepped</b> heating experiments on slowly cooled K-feldspars have been interpreted as showing diffusion radii of around 6 μm and indicate complex populations of sub-grains. This study indicates that Madagascar K-feldspar and thus probably all gem-quality K-feldspars act as single diffusion domains and that short-circuit (or pipe) diffusion was not an important loss mechanism. An apparent diffusion compensation relationship in the stepped heating data for Madagascar K-feldspar implies that similar relationships seen in other K-feldspars are a result of a range of diffusion mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{of actual}} accomplishments with goals and objectives: (1) Growth of 12 ingots [...] Washington State University (WSU) more than met this {{goal for the}} project by growing 12 final ingots for the year. Nine of the twelve crystal growth ingots {{resolved}} gamma radiation at room temperature. The other three ingots where resistivity of {approx} 3 x 10 {sup 8 } Ohm*cm for CG 32 a, CG 36, and CG 42 lower than expected, however none of these were tried with blocking contacts. All ingots were evaluated from tip to heel. In these three cases, the group III, dopant Aluminum (Al) was not detected to a level to compensate the Cd vacancies in the cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) thus the ingots were lower resistivity. The nine ingots that were successful radiation detectors averaged a bulk resistivity of 1. 25 x 10 {sup 10 } Ohm*cm and with a average {mu}{tau} product for electrons of {approx} 2 x 10 {sup - 4 } cm{sup 2 }/V with a 1 / 4 microsecond shaping time with samples {approx} 2 mm in thickness. (2) Attempt new compensations techniques [...] WSU also met this goal. Several doping schemes were attempted and investigated with various amounts of excess Tellurium added to the growth. The combination of Al and Erbium (Er) were first attempted for these ingots and subsequently CG 34 was grown with Al, Er and Holmium. These compensation techniques produced radiation detectors and are currently under investigation. These growths were made with significant different doping levels to determine the affect of the dopants. CG 43 was doped with Indium and Er. Indium was introduced instead of Al to determine if Indium is more soluble than Al for CZT and was less oxidized. This may decrease the amount of low resistivity ingots grown by doping with Indium instead of Al. (3) Grow large single crystals [...] Several changes in approach occurred in the crystal growth <b>furnace.</b> <b>Steps</b> were taken to maximize the crystal growth interface during growth by modifying liners, quartz, heat sinks, crucibles and various growth steps and temperature profiles. CG 39 ingot was a single crystal except on the edges. We consider that single crystals are necessary but are not yet {{the key to the}} best radiation response. Starting this with very few changes we were unable to reproduce the single crystal in CG 40. (4) CZT defect characterization [...] Upgraded defect characterization techniques and tools were implemented as well improving the cutting process to reduce damage. An automated thermoelectric effect spectroscopy (TEES) and thermally stimulated current (TSC) machine was modified and tested [...] Infrared transmission microscopy was improved to better analyze the role of these inclusions. These three devices improved defect analysis capabilities and helped produce a presentation...|$|R
