2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two <b>step</b> <b>chain</b> of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
50|$|The {{track system}} {{is built into}} the truss to guide the <b>step</b> <b>chain,</b> which {{continuously}} pulls the steps from the bottom platform and back to the top in an endless loop. One track guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the comb plate. Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At {{the top and bottom of}} the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the bottom landing, where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the bottom landing. At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A fair {{scheduling}} algorithm {{accounting for}} the weight and execution time of tasks is critical in the Grid environment. The MTWCT (Minimize Total Weighted Completion Time) has been proved to minimize the total weighted completion time {{of a set of}} independent tasks in a processor, but it results in another problem that the response time of some tasks is far longer. To decrease the incidence of the starvation phenomena, an improved algorithm named CSA (Controlled Scheduling algorithm) based on MTWCT is proposed, which computes the ρ factors of tasks by the execution time and weight of step chains, and selects the unexecuted <b>step</b> <b>chain</b> in terms of ρ factor and the executed time of task. Experimental results exhibit that CSA compared with the MTWCT, decreases the completion time of short tasks and the average turnaround time by sacrificing a little total weighted completion time...|$|E

The top sites {{are found to be}} preferred for NH 3 adsorption on Ni(111) and Pd(111). The diffusion barrier is calculated to be substantially higher for Pd(111) than for Ni(111). We also find that during the first dissociation step (NH 3 => NH 2 +H) on Ni(111) surface NH 2 moves from the top site to the nearest hollow site, while on Ni(211) it moves from the initial top site at the step edge to the bridge site in the same <b>step</b> <b>chain.</b> H is found to occupy the hollow sites for both surfaces. For the reaction on Ni(111), the Ead is found to be 0. 23 eV lower than E 1, while at the step of Ni(211), E 1 and Ead are almost equal to each other.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{temperature}} gradient inside fuel droplets on droplet evaporation, break-up and the ignition of fuel vapour/air mixture is investigated based on a zero-dimensional code. This code {{takes into account the}} coupling between the liquid and gas phases and describes the autoignition process based on the eight <b>step</b> <b>chain</b> branching reaction scheme (the Shell model). The effect of temperature gradient inside droplets is investigated by comparing the ‘effective thermal conductivity’ model and the ‘infinite thermal conductivity’ model, both of which have been implemented in the zero-dimensional code. The predictions of the code are validated against available experimental data. It is pointed out that in the absence of break-up, the influence of the temperature gradient in droplets on droplet evaporation in a realistic diesel engine environment is generally small (a few percent). In the presence of the break-up process, however, the temperature gradient inside the droplets can lead to a significant decrease in evaporation time. This is attributed {{to the fact that the}} effect of temperature gradient inside droplets leads to a substantial increase in droplet surface temperature at the initial stages of its heating. This is translated into a decrease in surface tension and the threshold radii of the unstable droplets. Even in the absence of break-up, the {{effect of the}} temperature gradient inside the droplets leads to a noticeable decrease in the total ignition delay. In the presence of break-up this effect is enhanced substantially, leading to more than halving of the total ignition delay. It is recommended that the effect of the temperature gradient inside the droplets is taken into account in computational fluid dynamics codes describing droplet break-up and evaporation processes, and the ignition of the evaporated fuel/air mixture...|$|E
40|$|Laminins are multifunctional, multidomain glycoproteins found {{predominantly}} in basement membranes, They are [alpha]/[beta]/[gamma] heterotrimers assembled from I I known chains. To date, twelve cell- and tissue-specific laminin isoforms {{have been}} reported Laminins play at least two essential roles First, they are major structural elements of all basement membranes. Second, they are signaling molecules that Interact with cellular receptors mediating processes such as cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and tumor progression. In addition, five laminin genes {{have been associated with}} inherited human diseases and three more targeted laminin gene deletions resulted either In developmental lethality or potential disease processes Though previous studies have Implicated laminins In various platelet and leukocyte functions expression, recognition and use of laminin isoforms by these cells are poorly understood, This thesis describes the synthesis, expression, integrin receptors and functional roles of laminin- 8 in haematopoietic cells. As a first <b>step,</b> <b>chain</b> specificity of commonly used monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to human laminins was defined by using recombinant laminin [beta] 1 and [gamma] 1 chains. 'Thereafter, Western blotting of platelet cell lysate and immunoaffinity purified platelet laminin revealed polypeptides of 180 / 230 / 220 KDa, corresponding to laminin [alpha] 4, [beta] 1 and [gamma] 1 chains, respectively. Subsequent microsequencing confirmed the identify of the chains, hence constituting laminin- 8 ([alpha] 4 [beta] 1 [gamma] 1), a laminin isoform first described in 1997 and expressed, together with laminin- 10 ([alpha] 5,[beta] 1 [gamma] 1), by vascular endothelial cells Results from RT-PCR, metabolic labeling, immunoaffinity purification and Western blotting showed that erythromegakaryocytic cells as well as monocytic and lymphoid (T, B and NK) cells were able to synthesize laminin- 8. In blood platelets and leukocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes and PMNs), laminin- 8 had mainly an intracellular localization as detected by Immunofluorescence, and was partially secreted following stimulation of the cells. Cellular receptors for laminin- 8 are not known and no evidence for the functional role of laminin- 8 has hitherto been described. Immobilized recombinant laminin- 8 promoted adhesion of platelets, monocytic cells and stimulated blood lymphocytes This adhesive Interaction was largely inhibited by mAbs to Integrin [alpha] 6 and [beta] 1 chains, indicating that [alpha] 6 [beta] 1 integrin is a receptor for laminin- 8 The adhesion of monocytic cells was also partially inhibited by mAbs to [beta] 2 Integrins, Laminin- 10, which was more adhesive than laminin- 8, was similarly recognized by [alpha] 6 [beta] 1 integrin in blood lymphocytes. Recombinant laminin- 8 largely promoted chemokine-induced migration of blood monocytes and, to a lower extent, of lymphocytes and PMNs. In contrast, laminin- 10 was either Inactive or inhibitory. Laminin- 8 was more effective than the prototype laminin- 1 ([alpha] 1 [beta] 1 [gamma] 1). In further studies, immobilized recombinant laminin- 8 together with mAb to CD 3 strongly stimulated proliferation of Isolated blood T cells via a 6, 61 integrin, whereas laminin- 8 or the CD 3 mAb on their own failed to induce any significant cell proliferation. Laminin- 10, but not laminin- 1, also costimulated T cell proliferation. Finally, platelet laminin- 8 was found to inhibit agonist-induced platelet aggregation and P-selectin surface expression. The inhibitor), effect on the platelet responses was independent of the type of agonist used Moreover, the inhibition of platelet aggregation was reversed by mAbs to integrin [beta] 1 and, to a lower extent, [alpha] 6 chain. Thus, platelet laminin- 8, through [beta] 1 integrIn receptors may limit platelet activation. For the first time, the presence of a molecularly defined laminin in blood platelets and leukocytes is described and the synthesis of a complete laminin molecule by haematopoietic cells Is shown. In addition, integrin receptors for the novel laminin- 8 are identified and the role of laminin- 8 in leukocyte migration, lymphocyte proliferation and platelet activation are described. Differential recognition and use of laminin- 8 and - 10 by leukocytes is also reported Altogether, the results Indicate a major role of laminin- 8 In platelet and leukocyte physiology.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed helical morphologies for PET/SWNTs and PEN/SWNTs {{and the formation of}} lobules with different orientations for PBT/SWNTs. To explain the morphological behavior one model was proposed based on crystallographic interactions, that is, epitaxy. Theoretical epitaxy calculations indicated that epitaxy is not possible from the strict epitaxy point of view. Instead, aromatic self-assembly mechanism was proposed based on π-π interactions and the chirality of the nanotube. It was proposed that the mechanism implies two steps to produce helical or lobular morphologies with different orientations. In the first <b>step</b> polymer <b>chains</b> were approached, aligned parallel to the nanotube axis and adsorbed due to electrostatic interactions and the flexibility of the molecule.
