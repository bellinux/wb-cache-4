Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) found that motivation was highest when the individual believed that the goal was easily attainable and very valuable.

25|$|Before this council started, {{the crew}} of the Washington had already begun a full mutiny, refusing to man the guns, and {{throwing}} munitions into the sea. Attempts of Story himself, and Van Braam to reason with the mutineers had been of no avail. When asked during the council of war to describe the situation aboard their ships all, except Captain Van Senden of Batavier, had similar stories. In these circumstances it <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible</b> to engage in battle. Besides, the officers calculated that their continued resistance would contribute little to the fight against the invasion, as the disembarkation had already taken place. Scuttling the fleet <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible,</b> because the crews would not allow it. Finally, some calculated {{that it would be better}} to surrender without resistance, because in that case the ships would end up in the possession of the Stadtholder, instead of becoming war booty for the British.|$|E

25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible.</b> It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1738, a {{boat with}} {{passengers}} {{was on its}} way from Pamplona to Aparri. Near the port, a sudden gale blew and it was swept out to sea. With the strong winds, heavy rains and big waves, rescue <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible.</b> A passenger on a pilgrimage to Piat began to pray the holy rosary and exhorted his fellow passengers to join him. They all did; soon afterward, the rain stopped, the winds died down and the boat and its passengers made it safely to port.|$|E

25|$|Gerald Cohen, in {{his essay}} 'Complete Bullshit', has cited the 'Althusserian school' {{as an example of}} 'bullshit' and a factor in his co-founding the 'Non-Bullshit Marxism Group'. He says that 'the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the {{interpellation}} of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it often <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to determine whether or not}} the theses in which those ideas figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: on one of them they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false'.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1763, Prussia had recovered nearly all of Silesia from the Austrians, and after the Battle of Burkersdorf it controlled most of Saxony outside of Dresden; Austria still held Dresden and the southeastern edge of Saxony, along with the county of Glatz in southern Silesia. The warring powers in Central Europe had essentially fought to a stalemate. Prussia's finances were stable, but the country was devastated, and the realm's manpower was spent; an offensive against Dresden <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible.</b> Austria, for its part, was facing a severe financial crisis and had {{to reduce the size}} of its army, greatly decreasing its offensive power; without Russian support it had little hope of reconquering Silesia. The belligerents in the wider Seven Years' War had already begun peace talks; now, negotiators from Austria, Prussia and Saxony convened on 30 December 1762 at Hubertusburg palace, near the front lines in Saxony, to discuss terms of peace.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the original, however, the producers decided to centre Sherlock in their adaptation, so Sherlock only threatens to stay behind in London. In addition, the three episodes of the second series show Sherlock dealing, respectively, with love, fear, and death. Here, the producers wanted Sherlock, an arch-rationalist, to confront something that <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible,</b> especially since their Sherlock is still a young character who has not experienced fear yet. Freeman stated that {{when he sees the}} hound, Sherlock becomes [...] "really terrified" [...] and for some time, stops trusting the evidence he has seen.|$|E
500|$|From his {{diagrams}} {{of a few}} particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman {{could then}} model all of physics {{in terms of the}} spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as [...] "put-ons". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles; the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible</b> if quarks were real.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 20 October 1953, Gielgud, usually highly {{discreet}} about casual sex, was arrested in Chelsea for cruising in a public lavatory. Until the 1960s sexual activity of any kind between men was illegal in Britain. The Home Secretary of the day, David Maxwell Fyfe, was fervently homophobic, urging the police to arrest anyone who contravened the Victorian laws against homosexuality. Gielgud was fined; when the press reported the story, he thought his disgrace would end his career. When the news broke he was in Liverpool on the pre-London tour of a new play, A Day by the Sea. According to the biographer Richard Huggett, Gielgud was so paralysed by nerves that the prospect of going onstage as usual <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible,</b> but his fellow players, led by Sybil Thorndike, encouraged him: ...|$|E
500|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory posits that all biological systems must have evolved incrementally, {{through a combination}} of natural selection and genetic drift. Both Darwin and his early detractors recognized the potential problems that could arise for his theory of natural selection if the lineage of organs and other biological features could not be accounted for by gradual, step-by-step changes over successive generations; if all the intermediary stages between an initial organ and the organ it will become are not all improvements upon the original, it will be impossible for the later organ to develop by the process of natural selection alone. Complex organs such as the eye had been presented by William Paley as exemplifying the need for design by God, and anticipating early criticisms that the evolution of the eye and other complex organs <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible,</b> Darwin noted that: ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it <b>seemed</b> <b>impossible</b> to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E

500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds.

GameSpy noted that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, [...] "the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director's head than in this final product." [...] Aside from the plot, they stated that the overall package was worth playing through to the end. G4TV awarded it [...] "Best Story" [...] at their 2003 G-Phoria awards show. Fan response was also positive; Kingdom Hearts was voted as the 19th best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu, 16th by the users of website GameFAQs, and 92nd by IGN users. Kingdom Hearts ranked ninth on IGN's most recent [...] "Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time" [...] list. It was also a nominee for the Best Game Award from the [...] for 2001-2002.
