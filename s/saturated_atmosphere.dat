60|$|We {{returned}} on the 7th of August to Churra, {{where we}} employed ourselves {{during the rest}} of the month in collecting and studying the plants of the neighbourhood. We hired a large and good bungalow, in which three immense coal fires* [This coal is excellent for many purposes. We found it generally used by the Assam steamers, and were informed on board that in which we traversed the Sunderbunds, some months afterwards, that her furnaces consumed 729 lbs. per hour; whereas the consumption of English coal was 800 lbs., of Burdwan coal 8401bs., and of Assam 900 lbs.] were kept up for drying plants and papers, and fifteen men were always employed, some in changing, and some in collecting, from morning till night. The coal was procured within a mile of our door, and cost about six shillings a month; it was of the finest quality, and gave great heat and few ashes. Torrents of rain descended almost daily, twelve inches in as many hours being frequently registered; and we remarked that it was impossible to judge of the quantity by estimation, an apparent deluge sometimes proving much less in amount than much lighter but steadier falls; hence the greatest fall is probably that in which the drops are moderately large; very close together, and which pass through a <b>saturated</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The temperature of the rain here and elsewhere in India was always a degree or two below that of the air.|$|E

60|$|Other {{phenomena}} of no less importance than {{the distribution of}} vapour, and more or less depending on it, are the duration and amount of solar and terrestrial radiation. Towards D the sun is rarely seen during the rainy season, as well from the constant presence of nimbi aloft, as from fog {{on the surface of}} the ground. An absence of both light and heat is the result south of the parallel of Kinchin; and at C low fogs prevail at the same season, but do not intercept either the same amount of light or heat; whilst at T there is much sunshine and bright light. During the night, again, there is no terrestrial radiation between S and P; the rain either continues to pour--in some months with increased violence--or the <b>saturated</b> <b>atmosphere</b> is condensed into a thick white mist, which hangs over the redundant vegetation. A bright starlight night is almost unknown in the summer months at 6000 to 10,000 feet, but is frequent in December and January, and at intervals between October and May, when, however, vegetation is little affected by the cold of nocturnal radiation. In the regions north of Kinchin, starlight nights are more frequent, and the cold produced by radiation, at 14,000 feet, is often severe towards the end of the rains in September. Still the amount of clear weather during the night is small; the fog clears off for an hour or two at sunset as the wind falls, but the returning cold north current again chills the air soon afterwards, and rolling masses of vapour are hence flying overhead, or sweeping the surface of the earth, throughout the summer nights. In the Tibetan regions, on the other hand, bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the warmest months.|$|E

40|$|At leaf water {{potentials}} (ψ) {{of around}} - 2. 5 MPa, detached leaves of Sloanea woollsii F. Muell., an Australian subtropical rainforest tree, {{were able to}} absorb small amounts of water vapour from a <b>saturated</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> but absorbed considerably more liquid water if their surfaces remained wet. When leaves attached to small branches exhibiting a ψ of - 2 MPa were sprayed with water and maintained in a <b>saturated</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> leaf ψ returned to saturation values within about 6 h. In a further experiment, a ψ of - 2 MPa was imposed on detached, forked branches. Branches were then exposed to a <b>saturated</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and leaves on {{one half of the}} fork were kept wet whilst the rest remained dry. Leaf ψ was measured periodically for both dry and wet leaves and in both cases was found to increase with time. This indicated that leaf surface water was imbibed by wet leaves and transported into the branch resulting in alleviation of low water potentials in the dry leaves. In the submontane rainforests in which S. woollsii occurs, extended periods with little or no rainfall occur regularly. Throughout the year, foliage is wet by fog or dew alone for about 25 % of the time. It is suggested that the presence of leaf surface water during rainless periods when leaf Psi is low may be important for the survival of S. woollsii. The actual mechanism of foliar absorption is uncertain, but is likely to be direct imbibition through the cuticle...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{mechanism}} of continuously chlorinated silver-silver chloride electrode performance was studied {{by using a}} wiped, rotating, partially submerged, cylindrical silver cathode. The cell performance using a zinc anode was measured, {{and the rate of}} chlorination of silver was calculated for several water <b>saturated</b> chlorine <b>atmospheres.</b> At 75 °F, with a chlorine partial pressure of 1. 00 atm and a rotation speed of 1. 36 RPS, a current density of over 100 ma/cm², based on the 13. 74 cm² submerged cathode area, was observed when the cathode polarization was 0. 19 volts (versus a silver-silver chloride reference electrode). The maximum power density produced was 32 milliwatts/cm² at a current density of 70 ma/cm² under the above operating conditions. The chlorination of silver followed the linear growth equation w = 1. 80 x 10 ⁻⁷ + 6. 65 x 10 ⁻⁷ t, (where w is the weight of chloride formed in g-atoms/cm², and t is exposure time in seconds) during exposures of 0. 2 to 2. 0 seconds in a 1. 00 atm water <b>saturated</b> chlorine <b>atmosphere.</b> At lower chlorine partial pressures, the growth of the chloride film was found to follow logarithmic growth equations of the form w = K₁ + K₂ 1 n t...|$|R

40|$|Chitosan biopolymers are {{increasingly}} being used in advanced biomedical applications, where aqueous interactions profoundly influence their physical properties and also their in vivo biomolecular and cellular activity. Here, hydration of chitosan films is studied by dielectric spectroscopy in a conventional constraining plate configuration and compared with free standing films. Film hydration proceeds by an initial water uptake followed by a spontaneous dehydration (deswelling) even in <b>saturated</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> At water contents above a critical value, - 9. 5 wt % a dielectric loss resonance peak (beta wet) arises from relaxation of evolving chitosan-water complexes, below this value insufficient interchain space for oscillation of these complexes prevents beta wet appearing. The beta wet frequency was related to water content by a power law with the frequency changing by - 3 orders of magnitude. Importantly the scaling exponents (slopes) differed significantly for unconstrained (free standing) and volume constrained films indicating the effect of internal stresses in constrained films. Both dielectric and conductivity behavior were influenced by internal constraining stresses affecting both oscillatory motion and charge mobility. In biomedical devices, biopolymers may be free standing, surface adhered, or enclosed structures imposing different internal stresses on polymer chains and the mobility of their segments.
