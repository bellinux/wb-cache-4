40|$|Economic {{activity}} is classified according to sector in national accounts (with sectors referring to mining, manufacturing, and so on). Over and above being {{a way of}} classifying economic activities, in certain heterodox economics traditions – notably the structuralist and Kaldorian traditions – <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> is thought to matter for growth. <b>Sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> is, however, not integral to Marxian economics, which tends to analyse economic activity in dimensions other than sectors. It is not clear a priori to what extent and in what ways <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> matters in a Marxian schema. This paper thus investigates the meaning and implications of <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and the sector specificity of growth from a Marxian theoretical perspective, and hence how to think through changes in <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} performance of city-regions is {{closely linked to}} the performance of the national economy. However, the performance of the national economy can also depend on the performance of one or more major city-regions, that act as growth poles. Because of their <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and other characteristics, some cities are better equipped to become growth poles than others. This paper studies 46 major city-regions across Europe. The <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and changes in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> of city-regions are studied using data from CE’s European Regional Database, itself based on Eurostat’s Regio database. The data analysis attempts to explain city-region performance by drawing parallels between <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and {{economic performance}}. The data analysis is supplemented by local anecdotal evidence provided by CE’s annual European reporting system ‘European Regional Prospects’, for example the historical importance of river and seafront activities. The paper goes on to discuss {{the extent to which the}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> of cities can explain why some city-regions grow faster than others. The data analysis will be used to group cities in ‘hard’ typologies according to sectoral specialisation. These sectoral typologies are then compared with typologies according to the local, ‘softer’, evidence provided by CE’s regional consultants. This evidence will also be used to draw out the more subtle influences on city-region growth and these will be used to group cities in ‘soft’ typologies. ...|$|R

40|$|Not {{only are}} levels of {{economic}} development in the association states in Central East Europe lower than the average EU- 15.

In its latest report on cohesion policy, the EU Commission accordingly placed particular emphasis on <b>sectoral</b> <b>structures</b> when contemplating future intervention policy in newly acceeding members. Our analysis shows, however, that the patterns of <b>sectoral</b> <b>structures</b> play only a minor role as determinants of the lower level of development, measured here as productivity gap. The explanatory power of sectoral differennces is significant only in Slovakia. The suggestions made in the EU-report is not supported by our analysis.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and its changes in the European and Central Asian countries. In the paper we analyse the <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> in both country groups {{and try to figure out}} the development trends being accompanied by these changes. The paper aims to empirically investigate the relationship between <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and socio-economic development. One of the essential characteristics of the structural change process is the growing importance of service sector, i. e. tertiarization. The speed and mode of tertiarization can be different. First, this can lead to downsizing industry; second, in countries with high share of primary sector the process can result in downsizing agriculture, without any loss in industry share. A challenging research question for this study is whether the process of tertiarization results from the overall globalization or depends also on the socio-economic development level of a certain country. We use the cross country data about the European Union and OECD member countries as well as Newly Independent States of former Soviet Union on socio-economic development and sectoral distribution of GDP, using data from the World Bank, the United Nations and Freedom House...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> on the long run macroeconomic inventory behaviour of national economies. Data on 15 OECD countries {{are included in the}} analysis, which is based on correlation and cluster analysis methodologies. The study is part of a long-term research project exploring factors influencing the inventory behaviour of national economies. First, we introduce some basic characteristics of macroeconomic inventory formation in the 15 OECD countries. We argue that our previous results on the existence of specific characteristic features of macroeconomic inventory investment are justified, hence it makes sense to study the factors influencing these features. We then examine the contribution of various sectors to the production of in the countries involved and the relationship between <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> and inventory intensity (annual inventory change/Gross Value Added). We find that the high share of agriculture and manufacturing increases inventory intensity, that the increasing share of services has a negative effect and that the role of construction and trade is not obvious. The relatively low stability of the statistical results warns us to be cautious with our judgements. Further, case-by-case analysis would be required to obtain more solid results.

40|$|With few exceptions, induced {{innovation}} theories give little {{consideration to}} the role of distortions or externalities as determinants of the commodity or factor biases of innovations demanded by farmers.

In this context, when some sectors contribute morethan others to land degradation and soil erosion externalities, the capacity for divergence between privately optimal and welfare-maximizing allocations of research resources - calculated at market and shadow prices respectively - is substantial.

40|$|Prior to the 1989 revolution, the {{structure}} of the Czech economy was characterised by the so-called industrialisation structure of GDP. Industry was the largest and most developed sector in the economy followed by services while agriculture remained the smallest sector.

The Czech economy recorded a rapid transformation from the industrialiation structure into the services sector oriented one.

In contrast with this historical experience of European developed countries, recent changes in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>structure</b> of the Czech and other transition economies have been generated by economic decline.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{investigated}} {{the development of}} business ownership (self-employment) rates over time at the sectoral level, and the effect these rates have on sectoral output growth. In an earlier exercise, Carree et al. (2002) presented a two-equation model to analyse the interrelationship between economy-wide business-ownership rates and economic development. Their analysis raises an important research question: {{to what extent do}} differences in business ownership at the economy-wide level reflect differences in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>structures</b> of economies or differences in business-ownership rates at the sectoral (or even industry) level? The current paper investigates this question making use of a sectoral data base of 21 OECD countries for the period 1970 - 98. Our estimation results suggest that for our sample of OECD countries there is, on average, a too low business-ownership rate in manufacturing and a too high business-ownership rate in services. The results also show that the results found in Carree et al. (2002) are not solely due to countries differing in <b>sectoral</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R
