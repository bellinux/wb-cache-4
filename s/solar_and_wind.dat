5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
25|$|According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, {{most studies}} critiquing <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy look only at {{individual}} generators {{and not at}} the system wide effects of <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Correlations between power swings drop substantially as more <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> farms are integrated (a process known as geographical smoothing) and a wider geographic area also enables a larger pool of energy efficiency efforts to abate intermittency.|$|E

25|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>solar</b> are {{somewhat}} complementary. A {{comparison of the}} output of the <b>solar</b> panels <b>and</b> the <b>wind</b> turbine at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy shows the effect. In winter there tends to be more <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> less <b>solar,</b> <b>and</b> in summer more <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> less <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> during the day more <b>solar</b> <b>and</b> less <b>wind.</b> There is always no <b>solar</b> at night, <b>and</b> there is often more wind at night than during the day, so solar can be used somewhat to fill in the peak demand in the day, <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> can supply much of the demand during the night. There is however a substantial need for storage and transmission to fill in the gaps between demand and supply.|$|R
