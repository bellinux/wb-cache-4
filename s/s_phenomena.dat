40|$|The caldera of the Phlegraean Fields (also {{known as}} Campi Flegrei) {{is one of}} the most {{dangerous}} and populated volcanic area in the world, covering an area that comprises the western part of Naples and the Gulf of Pozzuoli. The main peculiarity of current volcanic activity is the gradual and periodic lift (positive or negative) of part of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface (bradyseism) combined, only during the positive phase, with a strong sismicity and surficial hydrotermal activity. Deformative models, calibrated using land-based measurements, highlighted the Gulf of Pozzuoli as the area with the largest deformation.

These effects may be exacerbated by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or the presence of primary Raynaud 73 <b>s</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The goal of these studies was to use an established model of vibration-induced injury in Zucker rats. Lean Zucker rats have a normal metabolic profile, while obese Zucker rats display symptoms of metabolic disorder or Type II diabetes. This study examined the effects of vibration in obese and lean rats. Zucker rats were exposed to 4 h of vibration for 10 consecutive days at a frequency of 125 Hz and acceleration of 49 m/s(2) for 10 consecutive days. Sensory function was checked using transcutaneous electrical stimulation on days 1, 5 and 9 of the exposure. Once the study was complete the ventral tail nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were dissected, and levels of various transcripts involved in sensorineural dysfunction were measured. Sensorineural dysfunction was assessed using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Obese Zucker rats displayed very few changes in sensorineural function. However they did display significant changes in transcript levels for factors involved in synapse formation, peripheral nerve remodeling, and inflammation. The changes in transcript levels suggested that obese Zucker rats had some level of sensory nerve injury prior to exposure, and that exposure to vibration activated pathways involved in injury and re-innervation.

40|$|Marginalisation is {{a process}} of {{distancing}} (either by coercion or voluntarily) from the centre and relegate to the margin. In the social context, this marginalisation is lack of importance to certain socially disadvantaged groups. This disadvantage might be due to caste, class, gender or lack of political opportunities. However, within the same society there are privileged groups who are at the centre of all importance. This difference between advantaged groups at the centre and disadvantaged (marginalised) groups at the periphery has been problematised in popular media like cinema. The present paper shows that how marginalised sections are portrayed in Hindi cinema? For this, the cases of Peepli Live released in 2010 have been selected. The paper has been divided into two parts. The first part deals with the farmer’s suicide and the second part with the politics of suicide and the politics of marginalisation. These issues have been taken keeping in mind the recent problems of the marginalised sections in society, especially the problems faced by the farmers in contemporary times. Various studies and news reports show that farmers’ suicides are post 1990 <b>s</b> <b>phenomena</b> inflated by the undertaking of measures to open Indian economy by the methods of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG). This was the phase, which witnessed incredible growth of the industrial sector as compared to the agricultural sector. These facts were enough to break the myth of ‘developing’ India. In fact, the increasing number of farmers’ suicide rather depicted government’s bias towards economic growth neglecting socio-economic concerns of the farmers. At this juncture of bias and neglect, one can identify a breeding ground for politics of suicide from farmers’ side and politics of marginalisation from the politicians’ side.

40|$|Background Living {{with and}} caring for patient with {{schizophrenia}} is difficult, often long-term responsibilities. These caregiving experiences have been studied in a holistic and meaningful manner by using qualitative approaches. Aims, objectives This systematic review aims to determine the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with person with schizophrenia. Background Schizophrenia {{is one of the}} most severe chronic mental illnesses, characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking and of emotional responsiveness. Families are often required to play the major role of taking responsibility for caring for these patients. Objectives The objective of this review was to synthesize the best available evidence on the meaningfulness of caregiving experiences of families living with and taking care of persons with schizophrenia. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Family members of a person, years and older, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia for at least six months. Types of intervention, <b>s,</b> <b>phenomena</b> of interest The review considered qualitative studies that explore caregiving experiences of families of persons with schizophrenia that related to their caring for, or living with, their family member with schizophrenia. These experiences included caring tasks, feelings, attitudes or beliefs, needs coping or help-seeking behaviors and ways to solve problems. This review included studies conducted in either hospital or community settings. Types of studies The review considered any qualitative studies that drew on caregiving experiences of families of persons with schizophrenia using research methodologies including, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory and ethnography. Types of outcomes The outcomes of interest included, but were not limited to, the following,. Subjective accounts related to caregiving of families of persons with schizophrenia.,. Attitudes, beliefs or feelings of family members toward living with, or caring for, a person with schizophrenia.,. Family members, perceptions of caring tasks, responses or actions to persons with schizophrenia.,. Perceived needs of families of persons with schizophrenia.,. Coping, help-seeking behaviors, and ways to solve problems of families of persons with schizophrenia. Search strategy A comprehensive search strategy was developed to find both published and unpublished studies in English and Thai languages from, -,. CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and two Thai language databases were searched. Methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval were independently assessed by two reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using a standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data collection Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis Findings were synthesized using the Joanna Briggs Institute, s approach of meta-synthesis by meta-aggregation. Results Twenty-seven papers were included in the review. There were, findings extracted from the, papers, which aggregated into, categories. The last step was to synthesis the categories that appeared to share attributes into statement recommendations for practice. Six synthesized findings were derived from, categories, Once the diagnosis has been made, and family caregivers have responded to the illness, the health care system and their ill relatives, health care providers need to be aware and sensitive to their response and provide care accordingly, Living with and taking care of a person with schizophrenia has a tremendous impact on the caregiver, s life both negatively and positively, therefore intervention for this hidden victim is urgently required, Living with and taking care of persons with schizophrenia requires caregivers to adjust to the caregiving role and to their own emotional needs, and the ultimate goal is to integrate the caregiving role into their life, therefore interventions to prepare them to take on this role effectively as well as to maintain their original role and to take care of themselves well are needed, Caregivers need to receive caregiving support from others including professional health care providers, other family members, friends as well as self-help groups to help them to live with and care for their family member diagnosed with schizophrenia effectively, thus those group resources need to be made available at the community level, Caregivers need to apply various skills to provide care for their ill relatives by dealing with aggressive behavior, psychotic symptoms, as well as other facets of their everyday life, ie education, work, socialization, life skills, and other aspects of daily living, therefore caregiving skills training intervention needs to be developed beyond the existing psycho-education group, and, Caregivers express their needs and concerns about the long term care facility and seek sustainable help for their ill relatives. This needs to be conveyed to the policy makers and other related organizations. Conclusions This systematic review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence on the caregiving experiences of families living with and taking care of persons with schizophrenia. The six synthesized findings derived from, qualitative study papers met the inclusion criteria of quality methodology appraisal. Therefore, these findings can serve as robust evidence that reflects the voice of caregivers which in turn can be used to further develop intervention that is suitable for their needs.

Temeljitim proučavanjem dostupnih i relevantnih pisanih i arheoloških vrela ocrtava uređenje vladarske curtis, upozorava na važnu ulogu koju u uspostavi novih odnosa igraju franački misionari te analizira okolnosti u kojima je upravni aparat vladara izgrađivan instaliranjem župana i podžupana. Kao rezultat takve raščlambe postavlja tezu da su građevinski zahvati na sakralnom objektu vezani uz oblikovanje i legitimiranje novoga društvenoga poretka kakav se izgrađuje odpočetka 9. stoljeća. The paper, {{based upon}} the preseroed {{historic}} sources, both published and unpublished ones, presented here in the Appendices, and upon the so far published archaeological researches, discusses the conditions prevailing in the early Middle Ages at the locality of BijaĆi. Thus, it analyses the sequence and importance of the works performed on the church ofSt. Martha/St. John. The author starts {{with the assumption that}} the early-medieval world 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phenomena,</b> from the institutions of a state that is being constituted, through social and economic relations to civil engineering and sepulchral customs, cannot be researched and analysed separatedfrom each other. The initial position ofthe discussion is the assumption that the early-medieval world was created by the human activities in a multitude ofmutually linked social dimensions, wherefore, it is to be viewed as a complex product of various practices. From the presented analyses results, there are separated those that relate to arranging ofthe reignal property in the area between Trogir and the riverJadro where, in the !lb century, there was established a system ofrelationships that a French missionary described, apparently correctly, by the word curtis. It is a complex system ofliving agglomerations of a relatively small popUlation, grouped around building ensembles created by rebuilding of the Roman and late-Roman structures. Apparently, each such centre was made of a sacral structure, church, and residentiaI and husbandry areas where the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s representatives resided. The property as a whole was ruled by the viceroy (župan) ofKlis, which was his primary task. The daily management and organisation, at least in some areas, such as in Bijaći, was entrusted to the Frank missionaries. The scarcepopulation cultivated only asmallpart ofthe land, a large part ofthe energy being certainly dedicated to cattle breeding and food gathering activities. In this limited world, the power and the prestige were related to the ruler (dux Croatorum), and the growing system ofsocial relations of dominance and subordinacy was justified also ideologically by creation of a symbolic universe where Christian sacral cult made a special role. The dynamics of the social and economic relations, however, introduced novelties into the system, amonR more important ones, apparently, being building up of the administrative system {{in the second half of}} the !lb century, whereby the missionaries were gradually replaced in their administrative offices by new sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s officers -the sub-viceroys (podžupan). For their seroice, they were awarded with lands taken from the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s properties, whereby, as it may be concludedfrom the case ofBijaći, the titles to the local sacral objects were transferred as well. Since they owned their office to the n [...] tler 2 ̆ 7 s will and mercy, in their behaviour and acting before the inferiors, they had to reproduce the ruler 2 ̆ 7 s acts, and, at the other side, to the ruler they had to show signs of respect and complete subordinacy. The material traces, now visible in archaeological traces, of their establishing and presentation in the local community are the building interventions on the sacral object as one ofthe centralpoints ofthe symbolic universe. The wide-spreading of such practice in the Principality generated a standardisation ofworks, today known as style characteristics. While the development that took place in the !;Ih century being acceptably documented in archaeological and written sources, the transformations made in the l (jh and lllh centuries, the period that left very few sources, may be noted only by the insight into the lih century situation. The key elements in the territory that is studied here are two phenomena -the growth of importance of urban settlements (Split, TrogirJand their expanding role in the life ofthe local community, and the demographic growth, which means numerous changes, from ecologic anes (the process ofclearing and cultivation of the land, appearance of new settlements, etc.), through migrations (movement into towns) to the dietary ones. The lack ofsources preventsfollowing ofthe social stratification process up, wherefore this process is felt in its results only. In this particular case, the result that could have been noticed relates to the growth of a branch of the sub-viceroy 2 ̆ 7 s family through their court services, which deserved the reward in the form ofthe (inheritable) viceroy 2 ̆ 7 s office in Omiš. The rest ofthe sub-viceroy 2 ̆ 7 s family, in the conditions prevailing in the lih century (already visible dominance of the nearby town ofTrogirJ, succeeded in preserving their dominant role at the moment of rising of new powers, but constantly lost agreat deal ofthe potential by moving of a part oftheir juniors to the nearby towns. The cumulative outcome of these events is the appearance of the town community Which, in the beginning ofthe lJih century, became an important partner ofthe royal power, succeeding to consolidate all the achievements by shaping and formal establishment of the town borough, that will definitely destroy the system established in the !;Ih century and described by the complex notion of a curtis...|$|E
40|$|O tema Gravitação Clássica faz parte do currículo vigente para o Ensino Médio, sendo ministrado na 1 a série desse nível de ensino. Esta dissertação apresenta uma pesquisa a respeito do tema Gravitação Clássica no Ensino Médio baseada em dois eixos norteadores e complementares de pesquisa e ação. O primeiro eixo apóia-se na análise de 21 livros didáticos de Física, que são mais comumente utilizados no Ensino Médio na cidade de Natal/RN. O segundo eixo, trabalhado após serem verificadas as deficiências mais comuns presentes nos livros didáticos, corresponde à elaboração, seguida da aplicação prática, de um curso sugerindo como abordar o tema em sala de aula. Os Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais para o Ensino Médio (PCNEM) advogam que esse tema é muito importante para a formação dos alunos e que o seu estudo auxilia na compreensão de diversos fenômenos da natureza. Considerando essa visão do tema pelos PCNEM, os 21 livros analisados foram separados em dois grupos: o primeiro grupo, com 10 livros, foi editado antes da divulgação dos PCNEM, e o segundo grupo, com 11 livros, após a sua divulgação. Independentemente de pertencer ao primeiro ou ao segundo grupo, a grande maioria dos livros didáticos relega o tema para um segundo plano; dois deles chegam ao extremo de sugerir, nas orientações aos professores, que o conteúdo Gravitação seja omitido, caso o tempo seja insuficiente. Essa constatação sinaliza no sentido de que os PCNEM não produziram nenhuma mudança na concepção dos autores dos livros a respeito do tema. Para a análise dos livros didáticos, utilizou-se como instrumento um roteiro que elaboramos, por meio do qual se procurou evidenciar a importância relativa da contextualização histórica e filosófica do tema, da experiência cotidiana dos alunos e da interdisciplinaridade, entre outros pontos. Constatou-se que os livros didáticos pouco enfatizam os aspectos históricos da construção do conhecimento, a relação com as questões do cotidiano e o caráter interdisciplinar do tema Gravitação. Chama a atenção a não concordância entre os autores a respeito do conhecimento {{anterior}} ou dos pré-requisitos necessários aos alunos para iniciarem o estudo da Gravitação. O curso que elaboramos foi ministrado tanto para professores como para alunos, sendo abordados aspectos teóricos e práticos, com ênfase em questões históricas e em questões relacionadas com o cotidiano das pessoas. O curso para professores foi realizado como uma atividade de extensão da UFRN e foi ministrado, pela autora desta dissertação, na Escola Estadual Francisco Ivo Cavalcanti (Natal/RN). Fizeram-se presentes a esse evento 23 professores de várias escolas da rede pública e de várias áreas do conhecimento. O orientador e os colegas mestrandos da autora desta dissertação atuaram como colaboradores, registrando opiniões e relatos dos participantes. O curso para alunos contou com a participação de 300 alunos regularmente matriculados em seis diferentes turmas do 1 º ano do Ensino Médio da Escola Marista de Natal/RN, onde a autora desta dissertação atua como professora de Física. Esse curso para alunos foi realizado como parte das atividades curriculares normais, ficando três turmas sob responsabilidade direta da autora desta dissertação e três outras a cargo de outro professor da escola, que atuou como colaborador. Tanto o curso para professores como o curso para alunos constou de duas etapas, cada uma de 5 horas. A primeira etapa foi desdobrada em dois momentos, sendo o primeiro centrado no levantamento das concepções espontâneas sobre Gravitação, trabalhando-se basicamente com os experimentos de lançamento livre e pêndulo; o segundo momento centrou-se em apresentações teóricas e discussões sobre os modelos de universo. A segunda etapa do curso foi um aprofundamento sobre as Leis de Kepler e a Lei da Gravitação Universal de Newton, sendo utilizadas, como instrumentos motivadores, práticas envolvendo construções do sistema solar em escala. Como instrumentos de avaliação de ambos os cursos, foram utilizados questionários e relatos de opiniões, além de avaliações usuais, na versão do curso para alunos. Os professores participantes demonstraram disponibilidade para realizar práticas interdisciplinares; todavia, segundo seus próprios relatos, eles freqüentemente esbarravam na dificuldade do como fazer. Da experiência vivida nos dois cursos, verificou-se que a abordagem aqui proposta para o tema Gravitação Clássica, apoiada no tripé teoria, prática e aspectos históricos e filosóficos, é viável e efetiva. Espera-se que essa pesquisa possa contribuir na formação de uma opinião, entre os professores, a respeito de como abordar o tema Gravitação Clássica, e possa fornecer subsídios para que os interessados desenvolvam práticas em sala de aula visando aprimorar o ensino desse tema, que é de importância ímpar na formação dos alunos do Ensino MédioThe {{subject of}} Classic Gravitation {{is part of}} the actual curriculum for High School in Brazil, and it is taught {{in the first year of}} that education level. This master thesis presents a research regarding the subject Classic Gravitation in High School. This research was based in two complementary guidelines of research and action. The first guideline was the analysis of 21 didactic books of physics which are the more frequently used in High School, in the city of Natal/RN. The second guideline, worked after being verified the most common deficiencies presents in the didactic books, was the elaboration, followed by a practical application, of a course suggesting how to approach that subject in the classroom. The Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais para o Ensino Médio (National Curricular Parameters for High School PCNEM) defend that Classic Gravitation is very important in the student s formation and that its study helps the comprehension of many nature <b>s</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Because of this vision of that subject by the PCNEM, the 21 analyzed books were separated in two groups: the first one, containing 10 books, was edited before the spreading of PCNEM, and the second, with 11 books, after that spreading. Whatever the group to which the didactic books belonged, the great majority of them let that subject in a second plan; two of them even suggesting, in the teacher s orientations, that the subject Gravitation can be suppressed in case of insufficient time. These analyses points that the PCNEM had produced no changes in the conception of the authors that wrote books regarding that subject. To analyze the didactic books, we elaborated a script which was used as an analysis tool, in which we put in evidence the relative importance of the historic and philosophic contextualization of the subject, the quotidian experience of the students and the interdisciplinary approach, among other aspects. It became evident that the didactic books give very little emphasis to historic aspects of the knowledge construction, to the relations with the day-by-day questions and to the interdisciplinary character of the subject Gravitation. It calls attention the non concordance among the authors opinions regarding the necessary previous knowledge or prerequisites the students should fulfill in order to begin to study Gravitation. The course we elaborated was given to a group of teachers as well as to students. In those courses we treated theoretical and practical aspects and emphasized historical questions and the ones which are related to people s daily life. The course for teachers was realized as an extra-mural activity of the UFRN and was given by the author of this thesis at the Escola Estadual Francisco Ivo Cavalcanti (a state public school in Natal/RN). There were 23 teachers present, from several public schools and several fields of knowledge. The thesis supervisor and the master degree s colleagues of the author acted as collaborators, reporting the participants opinions and speeches. The course to the students, on the other hand, had the participation of 300 regular students who belonged to 6 different 1 st year classes of the High School Escola Marista de Natal (RN), in which the author acts as a physics teacher. The student s course was realized as part of the regular curriculum activities, in which three classes stood under the responsibility of the author and other three classes in charge of another Marista s teacher, who participated as a collaborator. The teacher s course as well as the students one were given in two stages, with five hours each. The first stage was divided in two moments, the first one focused on the survey of the spontaneous conceptions about gravitation, in which we worked basically with experiments of free throwing and pendulum, and the second one focused in theoretical presentations and quarrels about universe s models. In the second stage of the course we improved the study of Kepler s laws and the Newton s Universal Gravitation law, and we used as motivating tools some practices involving the construction of the solar system in scale. As instruments for evaluating both courses we used questionnaires and reported the speeches with participants opinions, beyond usual written evaluations in the course for the students. The teachers who participated in the course showed very good wills in realizing interdisciplinary practices; nevertheless, according their own speeches, they frequently came across the difficulty of how to do. From the experience we had in both courses, we conclude that the approach we propose hear to the teaching of the subject Classic Gravitation, supported on the tripod theory, practice and historical and philosophical aspects, is viable and effective. One hopes that this research may contribute in the formation of a opinion, among the teachers, concerning how to approach the subject of Classic Gravitation, and may offer suggestions in order those who want to apply that approach may develop classroom practices aiming to improve the teaching of that subject, which has a singular importance in the formation of High School student...|$|E

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of systemic sclerosis (SSc) may allow {{the start of}} treatment that could slow disease progression. For this reason early {{diagnosis of}} the disease is of pivotal importance.

The focus {{of this study was}} on the genesis and development of the moral panic and social typing associated with the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of Mods and Rockers. It looked at the ways in which their deviant behaviour was perceived and conceptualised; whether there was a unitary or a divergent set of images, the modes through which these images were transmitted {{and the ways in which}} agents of social control reacted. Behavioural questions, such as the emergence of the Mods and Rockers' particular styles, were explored but the primary concern was in the variable of societal reaction to this manifestation of youth culture. The data are currently held at the Radzinowicz Library of Criminology, University of Cambridge. The UK Data Service have developed an online teaching resource, Teaching resource: Folk devils and moral panics, based on the archived materials.

40|$|Fibrosis, {{inflammation}} and vascular dysfunction are major features of systemic sclerosis and the multiple organ-specific complications that characterize this disease. Several manifestations of systemic sclerosis, including Raynaud 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> digital ulceration, scleroderma renal crisis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, {{contribute significantly to}} morbidity and mortality and are understood to share similarities in their underlying vasculopathy. In recent years, a number of treatment options have become available that ease the burden of these manifestations, including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, prostanoids and prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type- 5 inhibitors. Several of these treatments have demonstrated beneficial effects against more than one complication, {{as a result of}} the similarities in the pathology underlying these manifestations. However, physicians involved in the management of patients with systemic sclerosis are faced with differing levels of evidence supporting these treatments, and historically little international consensus on the treatment of some manifestations, such as digital ulcers. The aim of this article is to evaluate the level of evidence supporting each intervention in systemic sclerosis, thereby facilitating decision-making in the clinic...|$|R
40|$|The desired {{frequency}} response of a filter is periodic in frequency {{and can be}} expanded in Fourier series. One possible way of obtaining FIR filter is to truncate the infinite Fourier series. But abrupt truncation of the Fourier series results in oscillation in the pass band and stop band. These oscillations are due to slow convergence of the Fourier series by the Gibb 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> To reduce these oscillations the Fourier coefficients of the filter are modified by multiplying the infinite impulse response with a finite weighing sequence called a window. The Fourier transform (FT) of a window consists of a central lobe and side lobes. The central lobe contains most of {{the energy of the}} window. To get an FIR filter, the desired impulse response and window function are multiplied, which results to give finite length non-causal sequence. Since Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) is generalization of FT.

Thus, in order to meet business goals, senior executives are increasingly holding HR departments accountable for delivering human capital results that are aligned to business strategy.

40|$|Usually {{regarded}} as a 1970 <b>s</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> this article demonstrates that the debate between Jürgen Habermas and Niklas Luhmann continued until Luhmann’s death in 1998, and {{that the development of}} the two theorists’ positions during the 1980 s and 1990 s was characterised by convergence rather than by divergence. In the realm of legal theory, the article suggests, convergence advanced to the extent that Habermas’ discourse theory may be characterised as a normative superstructure to Luhmann’s descriptive theory of society. It is further shown that the debate’s result was an almost complete absorption of Habermas’ theory by Luhmann’s systems theoretical complex – an outcome facilitated by Luhmann’s deliberate translation of central Habermasian concepts into systems theoretical concepts. The article argues that both the debate and Habermas’ conversion were made possible because not only Habermas’ but also Luhmann’s work can be considered a further development of the German idealist tradition. What Luhmann did not acknowledge was that this manoeuvre permitted the achievement of Habermas’ normative objectives; nor did he notice that it could eradicate a central flaw in the system theoretical construction, by allowing the context within which distinctions are drawn to be mapped ‐ an issue of pivotal importance for grasping relationships between different social systems, and coordinating them, via the deployment of legal instruments...|$|R
