25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies {{and goes on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> evangelicals think of his services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
25|$|Some {{narrative}} {{history has}} survived {{for most of}} the Hellenistic world, at least of the kings and the wars; this is lacking for India. The main Greco-Roman source on the Indo-Greeks is Justin, who wrote an anthology drawn from the Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, who in turn wrote, from Greek sources, at the time of Augustus Caesar. In addition to these dozen sentences, the geographer Strabo mentions India a few times {{in the course of his}} long dispute with Eratosthenes about the shape of Eurasia. Most of these are purely geographical claims, but he does mention that Eratosthenes' sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the Greek kings conquered further than Alexander; Strabo does not believe them on this, but modern historians do; nor does he believe that Menander and Demetrius son of Euthydemus conquered more tribes than Alexander There is half a story about Menander in one of the books of Polybius which has not come down to us intact.|$|E

500|$|The {{construction}} of the first limestone forts around the city began in the Early Middle Ages, {{towards the end of}} the 8th century. But, the [...] "old chronicles" [...] <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that. It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades. The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long invasion by the Saracens in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect is}} not unlike the English [...] sound, which is {{typically}} written g before i or e, but j before other vowels (gem, jam), or the Castilian Spanish [...] sound, which is written c before i or e and z before other vowels (cinco, zapato): it is more accurate to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in Assyrian cuneiform, where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels.

2500|$|In 1988 a study {{published}} in Annals of Neurology reporting findings from post-mortem examinations on 137 elderly persons unexpectedly revealed that there was a discrepancy between the degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and the clinical manifestations of the disease. This is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> participants whose brains had extensive Alzheimer's disease pathology, clinically had no or very little manifestations of the disease. Furthermore, the study showed that these persons had higher brain weights and greater number of neurons as compared to age-matched controls. The investigators speculated with two possible explanations for this phenomenon: these people may have had incipient Alzheimer's disease but somehow avoided the loss of large numbers of neurons, or alternatively, started with larger brains and more neurons and thus might be said to have had a greater [...] "reserve".
