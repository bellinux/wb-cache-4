5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party headquarters. <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party and subsequently leaked to the media. <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
