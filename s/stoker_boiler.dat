40|$|In summary, stoker-fired boilers that cofire or {{switch to}} biomass fuel may {{potentially}} {{have to deal}} with ash behavior issues such as production of different concentrations and quantities of fine particulate or aerosols and ash-fouling deposition. <b>Stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> operators that are considering switching to biomass and adding potential infrastructure to accommodate the switch may also at the same time be looking into upgrades that will allow for generating additional power for sale on the grid. This is the case for the feasibility study being done currently for a small (< 1 -MW) stoker facility at the North Dakota State Penitentiary, which is considering not only the incorporation of a lower-cost biomass fuel but also a refurbishing of the <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> to burn slightly hotter with the ability to generate more power and sell excess energy on the grid.

40|$|Biomass fuel is {{considered}} a promising substitute for traditional fossil fuels. Amid {{a great variety of}} methods for converting the energy in biomass fuel into usable energy, direct combustion is still the dominant technology employed by industry. Because biomass fuel possess a much wider range of physical and chemical properties than fossil fuel, its combustion behavior is similarly diverse (and typically differs from fossil fuel), with a similar range seen in emissions characteristics. To address the variability the fuel stream imposes on the system, this work endeavors to use numerical modeling to investigate biomass combustion in a <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> to provide physically insightful details while requiring minimal time and effort relative to the traditional experimental approach. In {{the first part of this}} work, a comprehensive model was developed to investigate the co-firing of different kinds of biomass including oat hulls, wood chips and natural gas with coal in a <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> located in the Power Plant of the University of Iowa. Later, this model is employed in the optimization of the air supply system and plans for efficiently injecting light weight biomass, such as oat hulls, into the <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler.</b> The other key problem is in NOx prediction and reduction for the <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler.</b> This was by combining a standard CFD model describing the turbulent dynamics and combustion with several sub-models specifically developed for this study to model the fuel bed, fuel particle movement, and fuel gasification. To verify and baseline these sub-models, a series of experiments are performed, including a temperature measurement campaign for coal combustion in the boiler, a chemical lab analysis of oat hull chemical characteristics, an experiment measuring oat hull particles 2 ̆ 7 physical properties, and a high-heating-rate gasification test of oat hulls. In particular, the <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> temperature measurements are unique in the number of points measured and the range of firing conditions. The simulation showed that for the co-firing of oat hulls with coal, the flame temperature decreased with increasing oat hull fraction. The oat hull particles follow the flow and burn in suspension due to their light weight. The simulation showed that increasing injection velocity could slightly reduce the peak temperature and thereby reduce NOx levels. It was also observed that there is a critical velocity above which the trend of decreasing CO 2 is reversed. The co-firing of other types of biomass such as wood chips and natural gas in the <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> were also studied. The result of co-firing wood chips shows that adding wood chips decreases the flame. The flame zone is also shortened when compared to pure coal, primarily resulting from a higher oxygen environment above the coal bed due to the high oxygen content of the wood chips. Co-firing natural gas with coal resulted in the high temperature zone shifting from the back wall closer to the front wall, significantly reducing the overall flame length. The level of predicted NOx agreed very well with the experimental data. The simulations showed that injecting Urea with the secondary air system on the front wall can greatly reduce the NOx level inside the boiler for minimal cost and effort...|$|E

This information is important as it helps identify the impact of coal properties on the accumulation of trace elements, primarily mercury, in combustion waste. The study is the continuation of research work on the impact of mercury compounds accumulated in combustion waste on the natural environment (mercury from landfills of slag, and fly ash). Studies were undertaken because no in-depth analysis {{of the impact of the}} temperature of particular zones of <b>stoker</b> fired <b>boilers</b> on the physical and chemical parameters of the post-process slag, including mercury content, had been reported in literature. Both of the coals examined, classified as bituminous coal according to the International Classification of Seam Coals and of type 32. 1 according to the PN-G- 97002 : 1982 standard, showed an average mercury content of 0. 0849  μg/g. In the chemical composition determined for the ash derived from burnt coal, the dominance of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 over other oxides was found. This feature results in the increase of the softening temperature and ash melting and, therefore, during the combustion of coal tested in a <b>stoker</b> fired <b>boiler,</b> only ash was subjected to the sintering process. Mercury content in the other examined samples taken from various locations of the <b>stoker</b> fired <b>boiler</b> (drying – 32 – 1050  °C, degassing – 1050 – 1020  °C, and burn-out – 1020 – 400  °C) varied from 0. 0668 to 0. 0009  μg/g and was determined with the use of a LECO atomic absorption spectrometer. The analyses of the elemental composition, performed with the application of XRF spectrometry, for ash obtained from samples collected from different sampling points of the <b>stoker</b> fired <b>boiler</b> showed that the largest concentration of trace elements was observed for the ash derived from the samples collected in the degassing zone (temperature range 1050 – 850  °C) ...|$|R

This is not the case any longer as coal qualities on the inland market have deteriorated and such scenarios have led to unusual and often poor combustion performance and major plant stoppages. In-depth research and new technologies have been necessary to establish the cause of these unusual events. This research study looks at the combustion behaviour of four different types of coal (coal A, B, C and D) in one particular spreader <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler.</b> Combustion conditions remained constant for all coals. The main focus of the investigation is based on thermographic flame temperature analysis of each coal and the interpreted results together with the physical and chemical properties of the coals. In deciding the best performing coal, factors considered include the steam output, the flame temperature recorded, the combustion efficiency determined and the amount of unburnt carbon registered in the fly and bottom ash samples. Interpretation of the results also included checking possible correlations of the above factors to determine the specific parameters that may have influenced the observed combustion behaviours. Implications and applications of the achieved results are made with regards to the efficiency, safety and environmental conditions of the plant and possible recommendations as to the best coal of choice for the boiler under investigation are presented.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biomass {{facilities}} have received increasing attention {{as a strategy}} to increase the use of renewable fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation and heating sectors, but these facilities can potentially increase local air pollution and associated health effects. Comparing the economic costs and public health benefits of alternative biomass fuel, heating technology, and pollution control technology options provides decision-makers with the necessary information to make optimal choices in a given location. METHODS: For {{a case study of}} a combined heat and power biomass facility in Syracuse, New York, we used stack testing to estimate emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) for both the deployed technology (staged combustion pellet boiler with an electrostatic precipitator) and a conventional alternative (wood chip <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler</b> with a multicyclone). We used the atmospheric dispersion model AERMOD to calculate the contribution of either fuel-technology configuration to ambient primary PM 2. 5 in a 10 km x 10 km region surrounding the facility, and we quantified the incremental contribution to population mortality and morbidity. We assigned economic values to health outcomes and compared the health benefits of the lower-emitting technology with the incremental costs. RESULTS: In total, the incremental annualized cost of the lower-emitting pellet boiler was $ 190, 000 greater, driven by a greater cost of the pellet fuel and pollution control technology, offset in part by reduced fuel storage costs. PM 2. 5 emissions were a factor of 23 lower with the pellet boiler with electrostatic precipitator, with corresponding differences in contributions to ambient primary PM 2. 5 concentrations. The monetary value of the public health benefits of selecting the pellet-fired boiler technology with electrostatic precipitator was $ 1. 7 million annually, greatly exceeding the differential costs even when accounting for uncertainties. Our analyses also showed complex spatial patterns of health benefits given non-uniform age distributions and air pollution levels. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental investment in a lower-emitting staged combustion pellet boiler with an electrostatic precipitator was well justified by the population health improvements over the conventional wood chip technology with a multicyclone, even given the focus on only primary PM 2. 5 within a small spatial domain. Our analytical framework could be generalized to other settings to inform optimal strategies for proposed new facilities or populations.

40|$|Most of the {{electrical}} power produced in South Africa {{arises from the}} combustion of coal. The combustion of coal produces by-products {{in the form of}} fine particulates that are released to the atmosphere and these may cause respiratory infections in humans. The current literature studies have divided such particulates into three modes based upon particle size. For example, pyrolysis, i. e. that part of combustion of coal that leads to the emissions of gaseous and heavy hydrocarbon products, characteristically produces ultrafine fly ash particles smaller than 1 micron. The burning of porous char particles or particles that fragment lead to particle size ranges mainly between 1 and 3 microns; while dense chars and mineral forms that melt and coalesce with each other produce larger fly ash particles generally larger than 3 microns. The original aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the three modes of coal fly ash formed by South African coals when combusted in a pulverised fuel (Pf) boiler and a chain grate <b>stoker</b> <b>boiler.</b> This, however, was not possible due to the lack of appropriate equipment for the capture of fly ash material in the three different sizes. For this reason, an alternate approach was taken. Namely, bulk samples of fly ash were taken from an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) of Pf boilers, chain grate boiler, from the out-going stack of a Pf boiler, and from the exit stack of a chain grate stoker. Particle size distribution analyses were undertaken on these samples and the < 10 micron material was send out for further analyses using XRD, SEM EDS and XRF. The samples taken from the stack of the Pf boiler were iso-kinetically sampled and the fly ash was captured in the filter fibres of thimbles. Due to the small quantity of sample and the fact that the fly ash was effectively trapped within the fibers, no particle sizing analysis could be undertaken on these samples, only SEM EDS was used to analyse the fly ash particles trapped within the fibers. The feed coals were analysed using similar techniques to those used on fly ash particles. The purpose of the amended investigation was to compare; (1) the size distributions and qualities of the < 10 micron fly ashes from a Pf boiler ESP and the chain grate stoker relative to one another and to their feed coals, and (2) the Pf boiler ESP fly ash sample and the out-going stack sample from the same boiler. The research has shown that the fly ash compositions reflect the feed coal mineral content, and that the ESP at the back end of the Pf boiler has efficiently captured most of 5 - 10 micron particles and less than 5 micron material through, as seen in the stack samples. The chain grate stoker fly ash samples have not passed through an efficient pre-screening process, thereby allowing both ultra fine < 5 micron and 5 to 10 micron material into the atmosphere...|$|E
