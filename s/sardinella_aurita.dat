5000|$|Predating the Independence of Namibia in 1990, the International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries (ICSEAF) was {{responsible}} for the management of the fisheries in the region both in the exclusive economic zones of Angola, Namibia and South Africa and in the adjacent water of the high seas. ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the [...] located in Madrid, Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs). ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as hake, horse mackerel and pilchards off Namibia and horse mackerels (Trachurus capensis and T. trecae) and sardinellas (<b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> and S. maderensis) in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988. At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a 200 nmi km EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it. Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body.

We investigated the diel and vertical movements of preflexion fish larvae within and above the leaf canopy of Posidonia oceanica to determine if it acts as an important habitat for larval stage fish. Samples were taken with moored plankton nets during the night and day at two depths (13 and 15 m) over five consecutive days in July 2000 in the Marine Protected Area off Tabarca Island (Spain, SW Mediterranean Sea).

40|$|<b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> is {{the most}} {{abundant}} small pelagic fish in the Senegalese-Mauritanian region. The success of its reproduction crucially depends on the local circulation as this determines whether larvae reach coastal nursery areas favorable to their survival or are dispersed into the open ocean. As a first step towards evaluating sardinella vulnerability to climate-driven hydrodynamical changes, this study aims at underpinning how transport pathways drive optimal spatial and seasonal patterns for sardinella reproduction. We have used two estimates of the Senegalese-Mauritanian coastal seasonal circulation simulated by two hydrodynamical model configurations that differ in their forcing and topography. Nursery areas are determined by evaluating coastal retention with a Lagrangian individual-based model that accounts for processes such as diel vertical migration and mortality {{as a result of}} lethal temperature exposure. Our results suggest thatthe shelf zones located at the Arguin Bank (19. 5 degrees N- 21 degrees N) and south of Senegal (12 degrees N- 14. 75 degrees N) are highly retentive. We find maximum retention rates in July-August and November-December over the Arguin Bank; from February-July and November-December over the southern Senegalese shelf; and lower retention rates over the central region (14. 75 degrees N- 19. 5 degrees N) that are locally maximum in June-July when the upwelling weakens. These retention areas and their seasonality are in agreement with previously reported spawning patterns, suggesting that the <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> spawning strategy may result from a trade-off between retention patterns associated with the seasonal circulation and food availability. Exposure to lethal temperatures, although not well studied, could be a further limiting factor for spawning.

This study was undertaken with this in mind. Interviews were conducted among 60 fishermen between February and March 2010. Economic assessment of small-scale fishing activities were done using questionnaires based on direct market pricing and contingent valuation methods.

The type and abundance of ingested prey were related to the plankton composition in the environment in order to determine prey-type selectivity. The feeding incidence observed was among the highest reported for clupeid larvae, with higher values during the day (68. 6 %) than at night (7. 7 %), indicating that <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> larvae are diurnal predators.

Larval habitat characteristics of both species were investigated during different upwelling intensity regimes. Three surveys were carried out to sample fish larvae during cold (permanent upwelling) and warm (low upwelling) seasons along the southern coastal upwelling area of the CCEBE (13 degrees- 22. 5 degrees N). Sardina pilchardus larvae were observed in areas of strong upwelling during both seasons.

40|$|Abstract − Long term {{changes in}} catches of two {{sardinella}} species off equatorial West Africa seem inconsistent with their thermal preferences. Sardinella maderensis is usually fished during the warm season in low salinity waters, while S. aurita {{is associated with}} cold upwelled waters. However, in the Congo fisheries, S. maderensis dominated the catches from 1964 to 1983, when temperatures were moderate or cool; subsequently S. aurita became the most important from 1984 onward, as there was pronounced warming. The movement of water masses related to Atlantic Niño-like episodes explains this paradox. These warm events are associated with enhancement of the equatorial counter currents. When the eastward transport strengthens south of the equator (Benguela Niño), it drives an influx of warm water towards Angola, which repels <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> northwards. Then, trapped near the coast by the subsuperficial warm water intrusion and the deviation of the Congo River plume, S. aurita becomes more concentrated and vulnerable to fishing. This is the most frequent situation during warm events. However, when the anomaly involves the {{north equatorial counter current}} (Guinea Niño), we assume that this surge of water in the Bight of Biafra leads to a water leakage toward the south, along the Gabon coast. This warm and low salinity water tongue, homologous to the Peruvian El Niño current, would drive Sardinella maderensis towards the Congo fisheries, but would force <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> offshore making it less accessible to the fisheries. This situation is likely to have occurred in 1987 – 1988 when there were large catches of several species linked to brackish waters (bongas, Pseudotolithus, soles, catfish, sharks and spiny lobsters). On the contrary, decadal variations of catches of the two species are consistent with regime shifts of the Congo River: Sardinella maderensis is dominan...|$|E

The success of its reproduction crucially depends on the local circulation as this determines whether larvae reach coastal nursery areas favorable to their survival or are dispersed into the open ocean. As a first step towards evaluating sardinella vulnerability to climate-driven hydrodynamical changes, this study aims at underpinning how transport pathways drive optimal spatial and seasonal patterns for sardinella reproduction. We have used two estimates of the Senegalese–Mauritanian coastal seasonal circulation simulated by two hydrodynamical model configurations that differ in their forcing and topography. Nursery areas are determined by evaluating coastal retention with a Lagrangian individual-based model that accounts for processes such as diel vertical migration and mortality {{as a result of}} lethal temperature exposure. Our results suggest that the shelf zones located at the Arguin Bank (19. 5 °N– 21 °N) and south of Senegal (12 °N– 14. 75 °N) are highly retentive. We find maximum retention rates in July–August and November–December over the Arguin Bank; from February–July and November–December over the southern Senegalese shelf; and lower retention rates over the central region (14. 75 °N– 19. 5 °N) that are locally maximum in June–July when the upwelling weakens. These retention areas and their seasonality are in agreement with previously reported spawning patterns, suggesting that the <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> spawning strategy may result from a trade-off between retention patterns associated with the seasonal circulation and food availability. Exposure to lethal temperatures, although not well studied, could be a further limiting factor for spawning. The Lagrangian analysis reveals important connectivity between sub-regions within and south of the system and hence underlines the importance for joint management of the <b>Sardinella</b> <b>aurita</b> stock...|$|E
