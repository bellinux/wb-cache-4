5|$|Herring was {{involved}} in politics throughout the 1930s. He {{was elected to the}} Melbourne Club in 1927, a year before Sir Thomas Lyle became its president. He joined the Young Nationalists, an organisation founded by Robert Menzies and Wilfrid Kent Hughes. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was {{also a member of the}} clandestine far-right wing paramilitary organisation known as the White Guard, White Army or League of National Security. Composed primarily of former soldiers, the White Guard saw themselves as defenders of order who stood ready to stop a Catholic or Communist revolution in the wake of an emergency like the 1923 Victorian Police strike. After failing to gain United Australia Party preselection for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran in 1931, he ran as an unendorsed candidate (i.e. one lacking formal political endorsement) for the seat of Brighton in 1936. He gained 12,258 votes, losing by just 528. Herring also joined the Christian <b>service</b> <b>organisation</b> Toc H in 1925 and became its Victorian Area Commissioner in 1936.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to explore the {{personal}} and contextual factors that affect the level of willingness to adopt EVA within financial <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> (non-life insurance) in Taiwan. Data were collected from a stratified sample of managers and top executives of the 15 domestic (i. e., locally-controlled) financial <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> in Taiwan. We employ Ordinal Logistic Regression Models to analyse the data. Results of the data analysis identified five conditions that determine the adoption of EVA among Taiwanese financial <b>service</b> <b>organisations.</b> We also found that the typical Taiwanese financial <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> manager's willingness to adopt EVA is contingent upon the ability of EVA to balance conflicting objectives...|$|R
5000|$|The method {{represents}} {{a translation of}} Taiichi Ohno's ideas behind the Toyota Production System for <b>service</b> <b>organisations.</b> The method makes the assumption that service is different from manufacturing. According to the Vanguard Method, there is inherently greater variety in customer demand, hence the need to design to absorb that variety. Proponents of the Vanguard method recommend that <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> avoid the 'lean tools' developed for 'lean manufacturing' as they don't apply well in <b>service</b> <b>organisations.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the weeks}} that followed, the British {{authorities}} became concerned that the Germans would retaliate in kind. When intelligence reported {{the arrival of a}} German paratroop battalion across the Channel, Rowe was given orders to move the unit with all haste. The task of finding a suitable site eventually fell to Spencer Freeman of the Emergency <b>Service</b> <b>Organisation.</b> Freeman began scouring lists of schools and partially completed hospitals by the Ministry of Works and Buildings, but none seemed suitable. While waiting out an air raid in Bristol, Freeman recalled someone having mentioned Malvern College. This had originally been set aside {{for the use of the}} Admiralty in case they were forced to leave London, but by this time the threat of invasion no longer seemed immediate and the site was no longer needed for their use.|$|E
25|$|The BFS {{went through}} further changes in 1967, {{when it was}} {{established}} as a permanent Civil <b>Service</b> <b>organisation.</b> Its role changed again in 1972 following the signature of the Treaty on the Basis of Relations between East and West Germany, when the two states agreed to recognise each other. The British government took the view {{at this point that}} the United Kingdom was no longer responsible for the inner German border and considered eliminating the BFS altogether. However, it was decided that it would continue to have a very limited role on the border, chiefly involving conducting liaison with the German border agencies. It was reduced to 16 members with only the British Frontier Post at Helmstedt, manned by four personnel, remaining open. The BFS was finally dissolved on 28 May 1991, following the reunification of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Wong {{received}} her degree {{of social work}} from the University of Hong Kong in 1975 and was immediately employed by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups as a social worker. She was sent to Kowloon West at first and became a supervisor responsible for affairs of teenagers and counselling services in districts including Yau Ma Tei, Sham Shui Po and Tsuen Wan. Wong later received HSBC scholarship from 1974 to 1975, Rotary Foundation Educational Award from 1977 to 1978 and PEO International Peace Scholarship from 1978 to 1979. These scholarships allowed her to further study in the University of Toronto in Canada from 1977 to 1979. After obtaining a master's degree of social work from Toronto, Wong returned to the Federation of Youth Group and was immediately promoted as Executive Secretary (Operations). Later in 1980, she was further promoted as general secretary (later renamed Executive Director) {{at the age of}} 28 and thus becoming the leader of the Federation. In this capacity, she has successfully expanded the Federation to be a major teenage <b>service</b> <b>organisation</b> in Hong Kong with a total number of 800 employees.|$|E
40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>organisations</b> still {{struggle}} with {{the adoption of a}} road to excellence. Evidence exists that processes and systems in <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> are not always as advanced as in manufacturing organisations. Adding a quality smile to the face of the service provider will not solve the problems that are caused by defects in the underlying work processes and systems. Attention to the hardware in <b>service</b> <b>organisations,</b> i. e. to the service design, should instead create a more reliable process flow and time for the service staff to develop improvement activities and spend more time with customers. The way <b>service</b> <b>organisations</b> started to take excellence seriously is by making their processes transparent, eliminating undesired steps and deleting loops. In this paper the focus is on expanding this approach by adding information systems and information sources into a process map. This seems to be a promising approach for small and medium sized <b>service</b> <b>organisations,</b> without having to invest in expensive and rigid business process automation. information systems;quality management;process mapping;service organisations...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{resilience}} figures prominently {{in discussions of}} disaster risk reduction, emergency management and community safety. Overwhelmingly, such discussions view resilience as a highly desirable characteristic of communities. Policies and practices of emergency <b>services</b> <b>organisations</b> imply that a major role of such organisations is to promote and foster community resilience. Yet there is little appreciation {{of the importance of}} resilience as a necessary characteristic of emergency <b>services</b> <b>organisations.</b> In this paper we argue that emergency <b>services</b> <b>organisations</b> need to address their own resilience issues in order to properly fulfil their community protection responsibilities. The concept of organisational resilience in relation to Australia&# 039;s volunteer-based emergency <b>services</b> <b>organisations</b> is discussed and the importance of organisational climate and organisational culture in relation to organisational resilience is stressed...|$|R
500|$|The school {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during its {{time on the}} Victoria Embankment. The curriculum had been consolidated {{at the turn of}} the century, the Combined Cadet Force was modernised, the house system had been reorganised, the [...] "mission", what is now the annual charity appeal, had been started and a Community <b>Service</b> <b>Organisation</b> had been set up as an alternative to the Combined Cadet Force. It was compulsory for a boy, above the third form, to serve in one of these organisations for at least four school terms. This is a tradition which still exists today. In 1925, the school acquired its sports grounds at Grove Park, Lewisham. This site included a pavilion, containing offices, changing rooms, toilets and showers, which was designed, by Old Citizen Ralph Knott, to also be a memorial to those Old Citizens who had lost their lives in the First World War. When J. A. Boyes became headmaster in 1964, further modernisations were made in the building. As the number of pupils increased over the years, overcrowding became a problem. Headmaster Boyes, believed that a new, modern building was needed for the school, and his efforts managed to secure a site on the banks of the River Thames for a new facility.|$|E
