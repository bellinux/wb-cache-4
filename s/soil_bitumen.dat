40|$|There are {{reported}} some results of nonconfined compression test and Marshall {{test for the}} compacted samples of <b>soil</b> <b>bitumen,</b> in which three kinds of soil are mixed with anion bituminous emulsion ME- 3 and cation one CME- 3 using slaked lime and cement respectively as an additive, and which are soaked in water for 24 hours after various period of curing...|$|E
40|$|In {{the soil}} stabilization, how much {{stabilizing}} agent to be admixed for soil {{is important not}} only in view of stability but also in economy. On this problem of <b>soil</b> <b>bitumen,</b> as already explaind in the first report, the calculating formulas have been proposed by C. L. Mckesson and I. R. F. respectively. Writers have performed the soaked Marshal and Hveem stabilometer test for the specimens of which evaporation ratios are constant at 40 % but quantities of emulsion are variable from 6 to 21 %. Subsequently investigated about the adequateness of these formulas according to research the admixing quantity of emulsion giving the maximum stability, the obtained results are mentioned here as the third report...|$|E
40|$|Black Cotton Soils {{which are}} a type of {{expansive}} soil are basically susceptible to volumetric changes, with the changes in moisture. This {{is due to the}} presence of mineral montmorillonite, which as an expansive lattice. In this paper an attempt has been made in finding the Unconfined Compressive Strength of black cotton <b>soil</b> by adding <b>Bitumen</b> Emulsion and Sea Shell powder as admixtures. The admixture bitumen emulsion is added at a proportion of 20 % to 26 % with an increment of 2 % in the dry weight of the soil. Similarly sea shell powder is added at a proportion of 12 % to 18 % with an increment of 2 %. It was concluded that the addition of admixtures had increased the unconfined compressive strength of the black cotton <b>soil.</b> For <b>bitumen</b> emulsion the maximum strength obtained at 24 % was 559. 67 KN/m 2 and for sea shell powders it was 273 KN/m 2 at 16 % from 67. 28 KN/m 2 of the natural <b>soil.</b> KEY WORDS: <b>bitumen</b> emulsion, black cotton soil, sea shell powder, unconfined compressive strength. 1...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} {{geotechnical}} tests reveal that samples from upper clay layer and bottom mottled clay layer are poorly graded soils with engineering properties (fines of 61 and 63 %, plasticity index of 30 and 31 %, CBR at 95 % of 21 and 19 %) {{which do not}} allow their use as raw materials in road construction. INL samples are gravel and sand soils well graded having engineering properties (fines of 26 %, plasticity index of 26 % and CBR of 39 %) that meet specifications require for sub-base materials for light traffic roads. However, Atterberg’s consistency limit tests indicate that the samples are moderate to high plastic soils with moderate swelling potential. Hence, their use as base and sub-base construction materials for heavy traffic roads require pre-treatment with non-plastic <b>soils,</b> <b>bitumen,</b> cement and/or lime. The direct shear test {{results show that the}} soils have high bearing capacity (cohesion of 62 kPa and 27.2 ° of angle of internal friction) making them to be useful in slope stability and in shallow foundation design.|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} base, soil {{is one of}} nature’s most {{abundant}} construction materials. Almost all type of construction is built with or upon the soil. The {{most important part of}} a road pavement is subgrade soil and its strength. If strength of soil is poor, then stabilization is normally needed. Subgrade is sometimes stabilized or replaced with stronger soil material so as to improve the strength. Such stabilization is also suitable when the available subgrade is made up of weak soil. Increase in sub grade strength may lead to economy in the structural thicknesses of a pavement. Cement, fly ash, lime, fibers etc. are very commonly used for soil stabilization. The main objective of this experimental study is to improve the properties of the gravel <b>soil</b> by adding <b>bitumen</b> emulsion. An attempt has been made to use emulsion for improving the strength of gravel soil expressed in terms of CBR values which may prove to be economical. In this study, the whole laboratory work revolves around the basic properties of soil and its strength in terms of CBR. A little cement added to provide better soil strength. It is observed that excellent soil strength results by using cationic bitumen emulsion (CMS) with little quantity of cement used as filler. The appropriate mixing conditions for gravelly <b>soil</b> with CMS <b>Bitumen</b> emulsion have been first attempted. This is followed by deciding four particular material conditions to show the variation in dry density and CBR value to achieve the best possible strength properties of gravel soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{stabilized}} soil mass by bituminous emulsion is deformed when loaded {{as much as}} {{the other}} structures, but the behavior of its deformation is different corresponding to the value of load, speed of loading, water content and temperature of the sample. Generally speaking, in the case of small and rapid loading, low moisture and temperature, it is tended to show an elastic condition in which the stress is proportional to the strain, but in he other case it happens to flow plastically and becomes a viscoelastic state. The writers have experimentally measured the stresses and strains about the test pieces of <b>soil</b> <b>bitumen</b> being compressed at 1 mm/min rate of strain after the dry and wet curing formerly suggested. It is reported here to be investigated the results with a viscoelastic theory...|$|E
40|$|The soil {{stabilization}} of highway subgrade and base course {{is able to}} classify the following methods by the kinds of additives : (1) Mechanical {{soil stabilization}}, (2) Soil stabilization with cement, (3) <b>Soil</b> stabilization with <b>bitumen,</b> (4) <b>Soil</b> stabilization with chemicals. Three kinds of soil stabilization with cement, bitumen and chemicals are adopted in our experiments. The soil sample is terra rossa, which is so widely distributed to Carust terrace at Mine and Akiyoshi districts. The percentage of clay in this soil is 43,liquid limit is 74. 6 and plastic index is 42. 5. It is generally said that the soil in which the percentage of clay is more than 30,liquid limit is more than 40 and plastic index is more than 18,is difficult to be stabilized economically. In this point of view, Terra rossa {{is a very interesting}} soil. There are various methods testing the effect of soil stabilization, but unconfined compression test, Marshal test and modified CBR test are tried in our experiments. The results of these experiments are mentioned in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the improvement of strength and durability properties of lateritic soil blocks using Millet Husk Ash (MHA) and Bitumen as additives so as to reduce its high cost and find alternative disposal method for agricultural waste. The lateritic soil samples were selected and treated with 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of MHA by weight of laterite. The lateritic soil-MHA mixture was later admixed with 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, 12 % and 14 % cut-back bitumen solution by weight of laterite. Both the natural lateritic soil, lateritic and MHA, and the blend of <b>Soil,</b> MHA and <b>Bitumen</b> were first subjected to physical and chemical analysis using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electromagnetic Machine (SEM) to determine their engineering properties followed by the performance test on bricks cast with varying quantities of the additives. A total of one hundred and ninety two (192) cubes were tested for moisture absorption, erodability and compressive strength tests. The result of the test showed that MHA and Bitumen acted as pozzolana in performance test on the soil blocks. Up to 30 % MHA – laterite and 20 % MHA admixed with 8 % laterite were found to give optimum compressive strength of 10. 8 N/mm 2 and 10. 9 N/mm 2 for the bricks produced. The result also showed that about 50 % MHA blended with 14 % Bitumen solution ensured water tight bricks. Thus the use of MHA as partial replacement of cement will provide an economic use of by-product and consequently produce a cheaper soil block construction without comprising its strength...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{industrial}} and civil activities, {{large quantities of}} toxic and carcinogenic substances are released into environment and represent a potential hazard to human health of exposed receptors. The human health risk assessment procedure become complex and time expensive when the analyzed geographical area {{is characterized by the}} presence of multiple sources, multi-exposure pathways and multiple typologies of receptors. The EHHRA-GIS tool is an innovative approach for estimating the human health risk through an integrated procedure able to manage all the steps of the analysis in a georeferenced structure with a graphical user interface. As a result the developed tool is a Decision Support System useful to support stakeholders and local authorities interested in assessing and managing human health risks in a territory where several industrial sources emit dangerous pollutants able to impact on different environmental media. The aim of risk assessment in EHHRA-GIS is the calculation of the upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk and noncarcinogenic hazards for each of the pathways and receptors identified in the study area. Summing risks and hazards for each specific receptor, through all possible pathways of exposure, it is possible to obtain a computation of total individual risk and total hazard quotient and display on maps iso-risk contours. In order to calculate the spatial and temporal distribution of the concentrations in different environmental media, the user can employ predictive and transport models, multimedia and food-chain models integrated in the tool. The procedure is completed with the application of a sensitivity analysis with the aim of investigate how risk values are dependent on variability and uncertainty in the factors contributing to risk. In this work the EHHRA-GIS tool has been applied for the assessment of human health risk {{in the area of the}} valley of the Pace torrent situated in the north zone of the city of Messina (Italy). The pollution sources present in the area are: a Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator active since 1979, a dismissed landfill of urban solid waste used for about 30 years, a platform of urban solid waste treatment which causes the presence of heavy vehicles, and two open pits for the production of bitumen. The land use of the study area is predominately agricultural and residential. The assessment has considered all the environmental media studying the distribution of pollutants using air dispersion model for emission of the incinerator and the two sites for the production of <b>bitumen,</b> <b>soil</b> and groundwater dispersion models for release of leach ate from the dismissed landfill into the subsoil of the study area. The calculation of the total human health risk in the area is useful in order to reduce the emissions considered according to the imminent application of the IPPC Directive...|$|R
