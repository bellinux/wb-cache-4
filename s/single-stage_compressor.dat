These featured a <b>single-stage</b> <b>compressor,</b> and improvements included the expansion of the heat transfer area, improved power transfer and brakes, an automated smoke box door, and other improvements. The Tehoro class was designed for use on both passenger and freight trains, and was used primarily on the Gyeongui and Gyeongbu lines. The next thirteen came in 1929, five from Gyeongseong and four each from Mitsubishi and Hitachi's Kasato works; the last of these became the largest producer of Tehoro class locomotives. Another eighteen were delivered in 1937, nine each from Hitachi Kasato and Kawasaki, and in 1938, as part of Sentetsu's general renumbering, the Tehoro class locomotives in service received numbers テホロ1 through テホロ39.

40|$|Summary. [...] Low-speed {{tests have}} been carried out on a family of three <b>single-stage</b> <b>compressors</b> of {{different}} diameter ratios. The simple blade design tested showed considerable variations of performance as the diameter ratio was decreased from 0. 65 to 0. 35 but most of these variations are predictable by simple means and it is expected that they may be partially avoided by appropriate design methods. It is recommended that low-stagger constant ~ 3 stages of low diameter ratio should be designed on the basis of radial equilibrium after the inlet guide blades. In the interests of minimizing the loss of working range at low diameter ratios, at least the outer half of the blades should be designed as far below nominal conditions as other considerations allow. The performance of such stages is fairly well estimated by integration of the strip performances of the various sections of the blade, though further information is necessary to fully define the work-done characteristic. Evidence is shown that the establishment of radial equilibrium demands an axial distance which increases considerably with decreasing diameter ratio, and it is suggested that conditions upstream of a stator-blade row are influenced by conditions required for radial equilibrium downstream of that row. 1. Introduction. [...] In the application of the gas turbine to the high-speed-aircraft field, where the Overall diameter of the engine, becomes of great importance, designers are continually tempted to increase the air mass flow per unit frontal area of the engine by decreasing the hub diamete...|$|R
