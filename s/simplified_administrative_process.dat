40|$|This paper probes {{the puzzle}} of why {{only a few of}} those for whom {{bankruptcy}} would be economically valuable ever choose to file. We use empirical evidence about the patterns of bankruptcy filings to understand what drives the point in time at which the filings occur, and to generate policy recommendations about how the bankruptcy and debt-collection system sorts those that need relief from those that do not. The paper combines three kinds of data. First, quantitative data collected from judicial filing records that show the weekly, monthly, and annual patterns of bankruptcy filings. Second, 40 interviews with industry professionals (consumer and creditor attorneys, trustees, and judges) from five states (Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Texas). The interviews probe why people file when they do and what distinguishes those that choose to file from those that hold off. Third, survey data from the 2007 Consumer Bankruptcy Project, the first nationally representative sample of bankrupt households. The survey data explores the struggles families endure before they choose to file. The data support two empirical findings. The first is about the role of aggressive collection in motivating bankruptcy filings. Generally, apart from foreclosure-related filings, the emergency bankruptcy filing is largely a myth. Creditor collection activity does not force people into an immediate bankruptcy. On the contrary, it wears them down slowly but ineluctably, like water dripping on a stone. Second, the primary factor that affects the date on which people actually file is their ability to save up the money to pay their attorneys and filing fees. Thus, among other things, we see an annual peak shortly after families receive their tax refunds, and a semi-monthly peak related to the receipt of paychecks. Finally, we build two important policy recommendations on those findings. First, we argue that the existing collection process is flawed by a prisoner’s dilemma that leads to excessive and wasteful “dunning” by creditors. Because each creditor has an incentive to be first in line to collect, and because the creditors can dun their debtors at little or no cost to themselves, creditors as a group naturally engage in dunning activities that debtors find intolerable – a level of activities from which a rational single creditor would refrain. We recommend a variety of solutions to strengthen the FDCPA. Some are at the level of detail (extending it to in-house collection, increasing the statutory damages, and the like). But the most important is a “do-not-call” rule modeled on the do-not-call list for telemarketers. Specifically, we recommend a low-transaction-cost mechanism (activated by telephone call or Internet site) that would automatically and immediately stop all creditor collection activity. Second, corollary to our argument that excessive collection causes inappropriate filings, we also believe that the excessive filing costs deter socially valuable filings. To respond to that problem, building on earlier work, we argue that low-income low-asset filers should have access to a <b>simplified</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>process</b> that provides prompt relief without the costs and delay of judicial process...|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. The role {{of foreign}} direct investment, in driving {{economic}} growth and development has been a contested one. There have always been views in favour of FDI and against. Foreign investment is attracted by predictable, transparent, non-discriminatory regulations of the host country. Consequently, negative administrative barriers (legal and regulatory requirements for establishing, operating and locating a business) can deter foreign investors. <b>Administrative</b> <b>processes</b> in South Africa are not consistent, efficient and transparent and they generally interfere with the operation of free markets. Theoretically, foreign investors are likely to invest in countries where <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> are consistent, efficient, transparent {{and high levels of}} certainty. This study‘s aims were to identify administrative barriers encountered in South Africa by foreign investor and to ascertain the levels of consistency, efficiency and transparency of administrative procedures. The study further propose solutions aimed at improving the levels of consistency, transparency and efficiency of <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> in order to easy, simplify or mitigate the burden of these processes. The study adopted a positivistic view and descriptive research method was employed. The survey questionnaire was used as the main data-gathering instrument for this study. The study found out that there were high levels of administrative barriers to foreign direct investment in South Africa and the processes were not consistency, efficient and transparent. The main conclusions drawn from this research were that current <b>administrative</b> <b>processes</b> to foreign direct investment are barriers to investment as they add an extra burden and cost to the investor investing in South Africa. This study proposed a multi-pronged administrative simplification strategies aimed at reducing and <b>simplifying</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Productivity {{is defined}} as the ratio of outputs to inputs. When applied to the public sector, {{productivity}} becomes a key performance indicator that shows how efficiently public resources are employed in providing public services. Until not too long ago productivity in the public sector was assumed to be flat as outputs were given the same price as the cost of producing them. Recent methodological approaches suggest to measure outputs directly in order to count with realistic productivity estimates. Empirical public sector productivity studies are still in its infancy. This paper proposes to contribute to this new field by analysing productivity changes in the area of tax collection. This is a key area in which, as of 2008, the central government spent over £ 3. 3 bn in administrative resources and which provided more than £ 450 bn in revenue, involving the processing of more than 24 million different tax forms. We contend that key changes in public management approaches in the UK during the last twenty years {{may be related to the}} observed changes in tax collection productivity. Specifically, we posit that the transition from the so called New Public Management (NPM) approach to Digital Era Governance (DEG) one, which focuses on the re-centralisation of government agencies and the reliance on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to <b>simplify</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>processes,</b> must have had an impact on productivity. We test this assumption by analysing productivity trends during an eleven year period from 1997 to 2008. We find some support for our assumption, showing that the transition to DEG in the early 2000 s led to a drop in productivity, which recovered its upward trend towards the mid 2000 s. We also analyse how ICT and outsourcing expenditure contributed to productivity increases and we also explore how service quality levels have performed during the analysed period. We conclude by highlighting that recent productivity increases should be coupled with higher service quality levels in order to improve customer experience with this public service. Overall, this paper shows the potential to expand this analytical framework to other public services to expand our comparative knowledge of performance across the UK public sector...|$|R
40|$|A privately-owned eye {{hospital}} operating since 1923 {{is beginning}} to take steps in managing its brand. The approach is based on Service-Dominant Logic, to ensure patient-orientation and relevance. Research was conducted to determine the factors that determine patients 2 ̆ 7 hospital choice, hospital quality evaluation, and the hospital 2 ̆ 7 s performance in those factors. The results suggested that there are six factors considered when choosing a hospital: the perceived ability to cure illnesses, the skill of the doctors, the specialization of the hospital, the complete equipment owned by the hospital, the experience level of the doctors, {{and the extent of}} the patient 2 ̆ 7 s trust to the hospital. The hospital performs well in all six factors. Among the many factors considered when evaluating a hospital 2 ̆ 7 s quality, there are three factors which have higher importance than average, but the hospital 2 ̆ 7 s performance is lower than average: speed of treatment, established trust, and friendliness. The hospital is bound by the Code of Ethics of Indonesian Hospital, in conducting its promotional activities. The hospital is advised to communicate its competence in the six most important decision factors; it is done by placing posters and information boards throughout the hospital, and by opening a new media for communication with the public: online social media (Facebook). The hospital is advised to improve its quality by forming an Information Center, providing Patient Notification Service, <b>simplifying</b> the <b>administrative</b> <b>process,</b> and encouraging doctors to be more confident and give more explanations...|$|R
