5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the station}} was proving {{inadequate}} for the passenger numbers, and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926. The new buildings were made of brick; with a large, four-chimneyed building containing most of the facilities; {{as well as a}} separate parcels office. The northern platform had a wooden awning built, which is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> today.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. <b>Still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
5|$|The Kingswood branch {{was again}} not upgraded, and still {{retained}} its 1871 track. It was abandoned {{at the end}} of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and the siding to the brickworks was removed, {{with the exception of the}} rails on the level crossing which in 1984 were <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches.|$|E
5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E

A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the American airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église. Two German military cemeteries are located nearby.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|In later campaigns, the Croatian {{army would}} pursue {{a variant of}} blitzkrieg tactics, with the Guard brigades {{punching}} through the enemy lines while the other units simply held the lines at other points and completed an encirclement of the enemy units. In a further attempt to bolster its armed forces, Croatia hired Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI) in September 1994 to train some of its officers and NCOs. Begun in January 1995, MPRI's assignment involved fifteen advisors who taught basic officer leadership skills and training management. MPRI activities were reviewed in advance by the US State Department to ensure they did not involve tactical training or violate the UN arms embargo <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> {{on the morning}} of 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half way between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half way between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, {{had managed}} to block the North Korean's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to push it back and inflict {{substantial}} casualties. However, by the evening of August 6, KPA held firmly on to their bridgehead. Attempted crossings that night were repulsed to the south by South Korean forces, but {{an unknown number of}} reinforcements were moved across the river the night of August 6–7. On August 7–8, the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions across the river to the north, but were repulsed by 21st Infantry, which was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the bridgehead, instead. By August 8, an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E

5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, O'Brien, by now in {{poor health}} as a {{consequence}} of alcohol abuse, sold his shares in the brewery to Joseph Segber, who appointed F. Vinnicomb to manage the company day-to-day. The sale of alcohol in the territory was suspended in the autumn of 1919, full prohibition followed the next year, and the company ceased trading. Initially the premises were kept maintained, probably in case the company was able to reopen, but most of the equipment was sold off to a new brewery in Fairbanks in 1933. The buildings were soon dismantled, probably for firewood, and vegetation reclaimed the site. The rusting brewery steam boiler remained on the site, surrounded by mounds of used bottles, many of which were dug up and removed by collectors over subsequent years, leaving perhaps over 3,000 intact bottles <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The remains of a Perfection Bottling Machine and a Crown capping device were left buried beneath the debris.|$|E
5|$|In March 1935 {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany {{prompted}} a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per Expansion Scheme M, the last before the outbreak of war) {{and the number of}} aircraft to 2,549. But it was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its full course. It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate provision for reserves (75 percent), but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 percent which averaged 57 percent over all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence, but given Trenchard's policy (which was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised ASW aircraft, and the Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.|$|E

5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI).

Because the UN arms embargo was <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> MPRI was hired ostensibly {{to prepare the}} HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources, including an article in The New York Times by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports, that MPRI may also have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia, although MPRI, American and Croatian officials have denied such claims. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers.

Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is <b>still</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains.
