60|$|These {{reflections}} have dispelled the agitation {{with which}} I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes {{so much to}} tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which {{have been made in}} the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my <b>study</b> <b>day</b> and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{animal studies}} have {{suggested}} that changes in oxygen tension may alter airway responses to bronchoconstrictor and bronchodilator stimuli. These effects may have relevance to the management of acute exacerbations of asthma but have not been well studied in man. This study was designed therefore to examine the effect of acute hyperoxia (Fio 2 1. 0) on the bronchodilator response to salbutamol in stable asthmatic patients. METHODS: Twelve stable adult asthmatic patients (three women) were studied using a randomised double blind placebo controlled crossover design. On two <b>study</b> <b>days</b> following baseline measurements patients breathed either air (Fio 2 0. 21) or oxygen (Fio 2 1. 0) for 10 minutes alone and then in combination with three incremental doses of nebulised salbutamol administered at 15 minute intervals. The same protocol was employed on two further <b>study</b> <b>days</b> using nebulised saline instead of salbutamol. RESULTS: The mean absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) from baseline after salbutamol was similar on the normoxic and hyperoxic <b>study</b> <b>days</b> but significantly greater than the <b>study</b> <b>days</b> on which nebulised saline was administered. CONCLUSION: Acute hyperoxi does not potentiate the immediate bronchodilator response to salbutamol in stable asthmatic patients...|$|R
