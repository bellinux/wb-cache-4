5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact}} that some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
25|$|Emissions may be {{measured}} over long time periods. This measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions. Cumulative emissions give <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> {{who is responsible}} for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs (IEA, 2007, p.199).|$|E

25|$|Old {{newspapers}} in Galena, Illinois also give <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the Warriors {{activity in the}} few years after the Black Hawk War. In the fall of 1835 The Galena Advertiser reported that river navigation was closed as of November 7 and that the Warrior, along with the steamboat Galena, had departed for Pittsburgh. Navigation reopened, after the winter, in April 1836, and the Advertiser stated that the Warrior {{was one of several}} vessels that had departed for St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to objectively measure the qualities of physiological ripeness, researchers in the wine industry have been continuing pursuing methods that give <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the grapes development in these areas. For instance, some wineries have started using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine the concentration of color producing anthocyanins in the skins of grapes. A sizable amount of research has gone into studying methods to determine the presence of flavor precursors and glycosides in the ripening grapes.|$|E

25|$|Single {{malt whisky}} is whisky {{from a single}} {{distillery}} made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as single-cask, it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery.

25|$|Henderson Street first {{appeared}} in the Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directories in the year 1886/87.

Over the following ten years, more and more entries and house numbers appear. Though a listing in the P.O. directories was not automatic (and did require payment of a charge), the listings available give <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the kind of early residents and businesses on the street.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{freeze-up}} {{depends on}} the heat storage in the lake and therefore on its depth, the rate and temperature of any inflow, and water-air energy fluxes. Information on lake depth is often unavailable, although <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the depth of shallow lakes in the Arctic {{can be obtained from}} airborne radar imagery during late winter (Sellman et al. 1975) and spaceborne optical imagery during summer (Duguay and Lafleur 1997). The timing of breakup is modified by snow depth on the ice as well as by ice thickness and freshwater inflow.|$|E

25|$|Indications {{are that}} it {{probably}} had large seasonal changes in discharge, evident by cross-bedded sandstones deposited at stages of lower flow, although whilst the flow was seasonal, it is perhaps doubtful if this system was ephemeral in nature for there is relatively little evidence of any large-scale aeolian sandstones in the basinal settings of the Midlands. It is clear that more locally sourced material such as carboniferous limestone and reworked earlier Triassic sandstone from the Clent Formation just south of Birmingham were also important components of the river systems as they flowed northwards giving <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the relief of the basin margins.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> {{the level}} of search {{interest}} by adoptees can be gleaned from the case of England and Wales which opened adoptees' birth records in 1975. The UK Office for National Statistics has projected that 33% of all adoptees would eventually request a copy of their original birth records, exceeding original forecasts made in 1975 when {{it was believed that}} {{only a small fraction of}} the adoptee population would request their records. The projection is known to underestimate the true search rate, however, since many adoptees of the era get their birth records by other means.|$|E
25|$|By the 14th century Birmingham {{seems to}} have been {{established}} as a particular centre of the wool trade. Two Birmingham merchants represented Warwickshire at the council held in York in 1322 to discuss the standardisation of wool staples, and others attended the Westminster wool merchants assemblies of 1340, 1342 and 1343, a period when at least one Birmingham merchant was trading considerable amounts of wool with continental Europe. Aulnage records for 1397 give <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the size of Birmingham's textile trade at the time, the 44 broadcloths sold being {{a tiny fraction of the}} 3,000 sold in the major textile centre of Coventry, but making up almost a third of the trade of the rest of Warwickshire.|$|E

25|$|The Ministry of Education (MoE) {{provides}} <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> {{achievements in}} the five years from 2008/9 to 2012/13 although statistics do depend upon the accuracy of data collected. Primary school enrolment has increased substantially but only about half of those enrolled manage to complete both cycles. There are a large number of over-age children enrolling for grade 1 although this has been declining. This is shown by the difference between gross intake rate (GIR) and net intake rate (NIR). GIR is the percentage of children enrolled for grade 1, regardless of age, out {{of the population of the}} appropriate age of 7 years. NIR is the percentage of children of appropriate age out of the population of that age.|$|E
25|$|Governor Conway {{pushed the}} {{legislature}} to revise the militia laws and successfully sparked {{a renewed interest in}} the militia. He commissioned a printing of a digest of the militia laws of Arkansas in 1860. A review of the election returns for militia officers in each county in 1860 and the spring of 1861 provide <b>some</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the success of Governor Conway's attempt to revitalize the organization of the state militia. The militia was organized into two divisions of four brigades each. Each county supplied at least one regiment, and companies were normally organized in each township. Several counties had more than one regiment and one, Lawrence County, had three militia regiments. Regimental and company officers were elected at the annual muster. The election results were forwarded to the Governor either by the regimental commander or by the county clerk. The exact strength of these units is unclear. In May 1860, Col. George M. Holt, commander of the 18th Regiment from Saline County, claimed to have 1,000 to 1,200 men available and requested that the county be granted permission to form a second regiment.|$|E
