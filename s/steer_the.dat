5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|To <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> canoe in mid-ocean on a {{consistent}} course, the navigator selects a star and keeps the canoe pointed toward it. Should it become cloud-blocked, or rise too high in the sky, he selects another star but offsets his reference to remain true to the first, or steers at the same relative angle to the swell as when steering toward the star.|$|E
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} wrestling <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> to <b>the</b> ground is to lean from the galloping horse which is running beside <b>the</b> <b>steer,</b> transferring <b>the</b> {{weight of the}} upper body to the neck of <b>the</b> <b>steer,</b> {{with one hand on}} the near horn of <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> and <b>the</b> far horn grasped in the crook of the other elbow. One then lets the horse carry his feet by <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> until his feet naturally fall out of <b>the</b> stirrups. <b>The</b> <b>steer</b> wrestler then slides with his feet turned slightly to the left, twisting the head of <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> toward one by pushing down with the near hand and pulling up and in with the far elbow. Finally <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> wrestler lets go of the near horn, and puts <b>the</b> <b>steer's</b> nose in <b>the</b> crook of his left elbow, and throws his weight backwards causing <b>the</b> <b>steer</b> to become unbalanced and fall to the ground.|$|R

In a trial match against the North Queensland Cowboys, Hunt played in the halfback position but he returned to fullback for the opening NRL game. Hunt scored two tries against the Canberra Raiders in Round 8 of the competition, following this performance with another two tries against Manly in Round 10.|$|E
5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} when the NHC began issuing {{advisories}} on the depression, officials issued a tropical storm warning for northern Honduras that eventually covered the country's entire coastline. A tropical storm warning was also issued for the coast of Belize. When the NHC began issuing advisories on the depression, the agency anticipated the depression would intensify into a strong tropical storm, based on low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the agency noted uncertainty in the track. A ridge to the north was expected to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> nascent depression westward, and two tropical cyclone forecast models predicted the storm would continue west-northwestward to strike Belize. Other models forecast a more immediate landfall, which would limit intensification. While the storm was active, officials in Honduras issued a yellow alert for seven departments where heavy rainfall had occurred. A nationwide yellow alert was also issued for El Salvador, meaning there was potential for flooding and landslides, although alerts were dropped on October21 when the threat of rainfall diminished.|$|E

5|$|Benefiting {{from his}} {{experience}} in England, Hassett scored five centuries in his nine matches for 1938–39 and {{finished second in the}} first-class aggregates for the season. This included a run of seven matches {{in the middle of the}} season in which he scored five centuries and four fifties and ended the season with 967 runs at 74.38. He made 211 not out and 102 in two matches against South Australia, whose attack was led by Clarrie Grimmett, the world record holder for the most career Test wickets. Hassett also scored centuries in both matches against Queensland and another against Western Australia. In the first match against Queensland, he scored 104 in the first innings before adding 73 in the second innings to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> Victorians to a narrow three-wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Harry Bradshaw, {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his five years at Arsenal, he managed to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances.|$|E

He won promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 2002–03, but Wrexham entered administration in December 2004 and the resulting points deduction saw them relegated once more. Despite the financial problems he managed the club to the Football League Trophy title in 2005, in addition to two successive FAW Premier Cup wins in 2002 and 2003. He was dismissed in January 2007, months after the club exited administration. He married in October 1967 and has three children.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a significant wave height of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{three weeks}} after commissioning, Bismarck left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. Sperrbrecher 13 escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, {{and then on to}} Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship's power-plant was given a {{thorough}} workout; Bismarck made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to <b>steer</b> <b>the</b> ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E
