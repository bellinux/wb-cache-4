5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E
25|$|These {{technical}} {{schools had}} several hundred different programs. Their narrow specializations had advantages {{in that they}} offered in-depth training, reducing the need for on-the-job training and thereby lowering learning time and costs. Moreover, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> motivated to study if there were links between training and future jobs. Much of the training could be done at existing enterprises, where staff and equipment was available at little additional cost.|$|E

That year, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, {{compared}} What's So Amazing About Grace? to Chuck Swindoll's book The Grace Awakening, calling both [...] "wonderful books on grace [...] did {{a valuable service}} rescuing the doctrine of grace from the legalists who say that we must earn our salvation". Christian professor Craig Detweiler writes in his 2008 book A Purple State of Mind: Finding Middle Ground in a Divided Culture that, {{if he could have}} given his students a graduation present, {{it would have been a}} copy of What's So Amazing About Grace? because many of his Christian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned with avoiding the forbidden than they were with enjoying the permitted. Detweiler writes that Christianity was founded on forgiveness and that Christians should not bear the burden of guilt, and he therefore agrees with Yancey that [...] "grace" [...] is [...] "our last best word".|$|E

2500|$|Holy Cross {{administration}} {{has stated that}} a unifying goal {{of the program is}} an effort to [...] "bridge the gap" [...] between the academic and social lives of students. In its analysis of FYP participants in relation to the first-year class as a whole, evaluations showed that FYP students [...] "rated their residence more favorably than did other first-year students,... perceived a greater sense of community and tolerance among their floormates,... and behaved more responsibly than other first-year students as evidenced by fewer disciplinary cases and alcohol-related incidents." [...] Additionally, after their first year, FYP <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely than other students to assume campus leadership positions, participate in the Honors and Study Abroad programs, achieve significantly higher grades, and be more active in community outreach programs.|$|E
2500|$|Ten years later, in 1936, {{as part of}} {{a series}} of [...] "confessions" [...] he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein {{appeared}} without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a [...] "Ja, ja," [...] though other former <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not [...] "to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought." [...] Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, [...] "This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The bohemian {{traits of}} post-war Paris {{spread to other}} urban parts of the French-speaking world, notably to Algiers, where an {{underground}} culture of [...] "jazz clubs, girls and drugs" [...] grew up - {{in the words of}} punk rock producer Marc Zermati, who was in the city {{at the height of the}} Algerian war in the late 1950s, [...] "all very French". However, that war marked a turning point which, in the view of some, was so traumatic that [...] "ordinary French people" [...] looked instead to America [...] as [...] "a new model for pleasure and happiness". This, in turn, led to the ye-ye music of the early to mid 1960s (named after the British band, the Beatles' use of [...] "yeah, yeah" [...] in some their early songs) and the rise of such singers as Johnny Halliday and Françoise Hardy. The French also adopted a number of British singers (Petula Clark, Gillian Hills, Jane Birkin) who performed successfully in French, Birkin forming a long-term relationship with singer/songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who was a seminal figure in French popular music in the 1960s and 70s. In 1968 major industrial and student unrest in Paris and other parts of France came close to ousting the government of President Charles de Gaulle, who, after leading the Free French during the Second World War, had returned to power at the time of the Algerian emergency. The events of 1968 represented a further significant landmark in post-war France, although their longer term impact was probably more on cultural, social and academic life than on the political system, which, through the constitution of the Fifth Republic (1958), has remained broadly intact. Indeed, one paradox of 1968 was that the first student demonstrations broke out at Nanterre, whose catchment area included the affluent and [...] "chic" [...] 16th and 17th arrondissements of Paris. Its <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> modish and [...] "trendy" [...] than those of the Sorbonne in the city's Latin Quarter, being described at the time in terms that typify more generally the styles and attitudes of young people the late 1960s: ...|$|E

Lady Constance was in the Sheepshanks gallery, copying [...] "Sterne's Maria," [...] by Charles Landseer, as best she could. She had been annoyed some minutes before by the {{behavior}} of a stout woman in a rich costume of black silk, who had stopped for a moment to inspect her drawing. Lady Constance, by a look, had made her aware that she was considered intrusive, whereupon she had first stared Lady Constance out of countenance, and then deliberately scanned her work with an expression which conveyed a low opinion of its merit. Having thus revenged herself, she stood looking uneasily at the door for a minute, and at last wandered away into the adjoining gallery. A few minutes later Marmaduke entered, looking round as if in search of someone.|$|E
60|$|The same {{influence}} {{of public opinion}} was decisive in the teachers' strike, which was {{on the point of}} being settled when I left Peking. The Government, which is always impecunious, owing to corruption, had left its teachers unpaid for many months. At last they struck to enforce payment, and went on a peaceful deputation to the Government, accompanied by many students. There was a clash with the soldiers and police, and many teachers and <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> or less severely wounded. This led to a terrific outcry, because the love of education in China is profound and widespread. The newspapers clamoured for revolution. The Government had just spent nine million dollars in corrupt payments to three Tuchuns who had descended upon the capital to extort blackmail. It could not find any colourable pretext for refusing the few hundred thousands required by the teachers, and it capitulated in panic. I do not think there is any Anglo-Saxon country where the interests of teachers would have roused the same degree of public feeling.|$|E
