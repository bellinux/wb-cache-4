40|$|Abstract: Near {{bottom current}} {{measurements}} have been compared with <b>sonographs</b> revealing {{a variety of}} subtidal dune geometries at eight stations in the middle reaches of the macrotidal Tay Estuary, Scotland. At six stations, dune asymmetries {{did not support the}} tidal dominance xpressed in terms of maximum or average current speeds. Determination of bottom tidal current dominance according to the length of time during which a speed of 0. 5 ms- 1 was exceeded, as a proxy for the inequality of the total ebb and flood tide bedload sediment transports, provides a better, but not perfect, correlation with <b>sonographs.</b> Other controls on dune asymmetry and reversal are height, sediment discharge rate and bottom current velocity fluctuations. The study has shown that bedload transport processes and pathways in this relatively small (c. 8 km 2), dynamic part of the estuary are far more complex than previously inferred and near bed flows do not simply correspond with the surface water circulation pattern. Neither <b>sonographs</b> nor current data alone are adequate to gain an understanding of subtidal bedforms in such an environment. Estuaries are important, complex and highly variable geomorphological systems located at the interface between river-derived freshwaters and saline coastal waters. Such water bodies are therefore characterized by significant gradients in both physico-chemical and biological factors, in particular salinity and suspended sediment con-centration. There have been countless investiga-tions world-wide focusing on the understanding of suspended sediment circulation, transport, erosion/resuspension and deposition within estu-arine systems (e. g.

5000|$|Halpern {{initiated}} groundbreaking {{research for}} her time, [...] "she began and conducted {{much of her}} fieldwork during a period when it was actually illegal for First Nations cultures to be celebrated, much less preserved." [...] It was not until 1947 that Halpern really began to pursue ethnomusicology. When she began this collection process, it was widely thought that [...] "Indians" [...] had no music. [...] "It took six years of intensive contactmaking before I was successful in convincing the Indians that they should sing for me their old authentic songs," [...] she wrote. In many cases, these folksongs were very personal, {{and in some cases}} so sacred that they were not to be heard by the uninitiated, and as a result, the First Nations were not willing to “give” their songs to just anyone. She had to work closely with them and win their confidence over time. In her years working with different Native groups (mostly the Kwakwaka'wakw called Kwakiutl and Nuuchahnulth called Nootka), she collected upwards of 300 folksongs, many of which were made available on LPs from the Folkways Ethnic Library. Eight records in total were released, available in sets of two, released in 1967, 1974, 1981, and finally 1986. Her first success was with Chief Billy Assu, of the Kwakwaka'wakw. The younger generations that would usually inherit this culture generally wanted to be westernised, and as a result did not take the time to learn these cultural songs. It is said that once Assu realized that his music would die with him, he offered her “one hundred songs.” After Halpern had recorded over 80 of Assu’s folksongs, she was helped by Mungo Martin, also a Kwakwaka'wakw man, and an artist and songwriter. With him she recorded another 124 songs. As her collection expanded, she did analyses of them, and did her best to share what she had learned, though this was slowed somewhat by the work she was still doing with the university. While her works have sometimes been criticized for their “cultural material,” especially in instances of her record’s liner notes having misspellings, incomplete information, or the improper citing of a song-owner which “does them a great disservice,” it is widely agreed that her musical descriptions were largely flawless. She began to explore the fact that Native music was significantly different from European music, and that listening with [...] "western" [...] ears would not provide a full understanding. In order to understand the music she recorded, [...] "Halpern had to free herself from the standard concepts and structures of Western music and notation. To analyze the beat, Halpern made use of medieval modal notation, which used stressed and unstressed beats. This showed that the beat fell into prescribed patterns, similar to iambus, dactyl, trochee, and anapest." [...] Through it all, she had very much respect for Native music, and considered it extremely important. Later in her work she was able to use sonography to measure the nuances of the sounds used in the folksongs. She believed that music was a marker of the complexity of the society that made it, and <b>sonograph</b> data showed just how complex these songs were.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The BIG’ 95 {{debris flow}} {{affected}} 2, 200 km 2 of the Ebro continental slope and {{rise in the}} western Mediterranean Sea. The resulting deposit of sandy and silty mud has a volume of 26 km 3 and is up to 150 m thick. Dating yields a minimum failure age of ca. 11, 500 cal yr BP. Swath bathymetry data, very-high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, side-scan <b>sonographs,</b> and sediment cores indicate that the debris flow consisted of two main components: relatively coarse, more mobile material, which was mostly remolded during flow; and finer, more cohesive material, which moved as independent blocks and partially kept its internal coherence. These blocks were partially buoyant and were pushed and dragged up to 15 km by the mobile material. During transport the blocks broke into smaller fragments. The more mobile material kept on flowing, reaching almost 2, 000 m water depth in the Valencia Channel after traveling, 110 km.

40|$|Today, {{there still}} exists a {{controversial}} issue, {{as to the}} high incidence of early embryonic death in mares, mated on the first post partum oestrus. The {{purpose of this study was}} first, to determine the post partum period of uterine involution in fine pace Colombian mares using endometrial cytology and ultra <b>sonograph.</b> Secondly, to determine the relation between the neutrophil percentages found in cytology and the echogenicity of accumulated intrauterine fluid during the first 30 post partum days. Twenty (n= 20) mares were examined beginning on the 6 th post partum day and on alternate days, up to the 30 th day. All subjects were grazing Kikuyo grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) at la Sabana de Bogotá, 2. 600 meters over sea level, 4 º north latitude and with an average temperature of 13 º C. From the 3 rd postpartum day, all 20 mares were exposed to 2 healthy stallions, to establish their heat behaviour. Ten of them, following complete randomization, were inseminated on the first postpartum heat, while the others were inseminated on the second post partum heat. Genital examination was carried out by a technician, who did not know the reproductive history of any of the experimental mares. Examinations included rectal palpation, ultra <b>sonograph</b> (Pie Medical 480, linear array, 5 MHz), vaginal swabs and endometrial cytology. Uterine dimension was recorded by rectal palpation and ultra <b>sonograph,</b> it was included the uterine horn dimensions (tip, middle, and corporo-cornual junction) of previously gravid and non gravid uterus. Intrauterine fluid detection was performed by the use of an echogenicity scale. Ovaric structures were recorded (preovulatory follicles and ovulation). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 15 post ovulation and then confirmed on day 40. Endometrial cytology samples were taken from uterus after the perineal area was disinfected using non covered isopos with a Pollanski speculum. Smears specimens were fixed with metil alcohol for 15 minutes and stained with Giemsa for 20 minutes. Anatomic uterine involution (means decreased size of pregravid horn) was completed on day 24 (range 12 - 30 days). Intrauterine fluid was seen by ultrasonography between day 6 and 18 post partum. Neutrophils and endometrial cells necrotic or not, constituted 80 % of the cell population. Neutrophils and cellular necrosis had a linear decrease beginning on day 9 post partum, in opposition, on this day the endometrial cell type pattern had a linear increase. The percentage of lymphocytes and eosinophils remained low and constant during the period of the study. A positive and significant correlation (r= 0. 83, P< 0, 01) was found between the accumulated uterine fluid observed by ultra <b>sonograph</b> and neutrophil cells analyzed in endometrial cytology. Based on this finding, it is suggested that the cellular component of the fluid encountered alters the echo pattern on uterine examination. Mares that did not show much intrauterine fluid accumulation and had low percentage of neutrophil counts (4 % or less) during first postpartum heat, had a better conception rate than mares with high neitrophils percentage. Foal heat was observed on day 7 ± 2. 8 (S. D.), second post partum heat was detected on day 24 ± 2. 8 (S. D). Conception rate was 30 % and 50 % respectively, on first and second post partum heat. It is concluded that endometrial cytology and ultra <b>sonograph</b> are helpful diagnostic methods to study uterine involution in post partum mares. These techniques help the reproductive technician to establish a valid criterion regarding when to mate a mare that has a calf...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- An {{adequate}} {{blood supply}} {{is required for}} the normal functioning of all organs in the body. However this flow can be impeded due to several reasons, thrombus or clot being a major one. Detection of such clots is done {{with the help of an}} imaging technique called “DOPPLER ULTRASONOGRAPHY ” by transmitting an ultrasound pulse and calculating the frequency of the received signal. If there is no clot the reception is always a homogenous signal, whereas if a certain part being <b>sonographed</b> has a clot the received signal shows a variance in frequency which depends upon the distance from the receiver. Hence blood clot detection in ultrasonography is based on obtaining the frequency variance and applying adaptive thresholding. In this work we propose a ZOOM FFT based technique followed by automated adaptive thresholding to detect the clot. Data files are synthesized by simulation in MATLAB. Also the entire system is developed in a Matlab environment for the system to be both simple and cost-effective. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the system is very high even under noisy conditions...|$|R

The experimental protocol involved real-time ultrasound scanning of the GM muscle, recording of the electrical activity of the muscle, measurement of knee- and ankle-joint rotations, and measurement of ground reaction forces in six men during walking at 3 km h(- 1) on a treadmill. Fascicular lengths were measured from the <b>sonographs</b> recorded. Musculotendon complex length changes were estimated from anatomical and joint kinematic data. Tendon length changes were obtained combining the musculotendon complex and fascicular length-change data. The fascicles followed a different length-change pattern {{from those of the}} musculotendon complex and tendon throughout the step cycle. Two important features emerged: (i) the muscle contracted near-isometrically in the stance phase, with the fascicles operating at ca. 50 mm; and (ii) the tendon stretched by ca. 7 mm during single support, and recoiled in push-off. The behaviour of the muscle in our experiment indicates consumption of minimal metabolic energy for eliciting the contractile forces required to support and displace the body.

40|$|Isolated tendons {{subjected}} to cyclic tensile loads {{higher than those}} experienced in the tendons' recent history exhibit 'conditioning', i. e. gradually increasing elongations upon loading and gradually increasing residual elongations after unloading {{in the first few}} loading-unloading cycles. The present study examines whether this behaviour is a measurement artefact or an actual time-dependent property. The gastrocnemius tendons of six men who refrained from rigorous physical activities prior to the experiment were loaded cyclically by 10 repeated isometric plantarflexion contractions at 80 % of the moment generated during plantarflexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). In each contraction, the elongation of the gastrocnemius tendon at 80 % of MVC and the residual tendon elongation after relaxation were obtained from the analysis of <b>sonographs</b> recorded during the test. The tendon elongation during activation and the residual tendon elongation after relaxation increased by ca. 5 mm from the first contraction to the tenth contraction, with no changes obtained after the fifth contraction. The behaviour of the tendon in the first five contractions indicates the presence of conditioning. It is therefore concluded that conditioning is a relevant property and not an artefact associated with in vitro testing. This has implications for joint kinematics and muscle excursion...|$|R

Aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the accuracy of lung ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis in infants. Methods: This was an observational cohort study of infants admitted to our Pediatric Unit with suspected bronchiolitis. A physical examination and lung ultrasound scans were performed on each patient. Diagnosis and grading of bronchiolitis was assessed according to a clinical and a ultrasound score. An exploratory analysis was used to assess correspondence between the lung ultrasound findings and the clinical evaluation and to evaluate the inter-observer concordance between the two different <b>sonographs.</b> Results: One hundred six infants were studied (average age 71 days). According to our clinical score, 74 infants had mild bronchiolitis, 30 had moderate bronchiolitis and two had severe bronchiolitis. 25 infants composed the control group. Agreement between the clinical and sonographic diagnosis was good (90. 6 %) with a statistically significant inter-observer ultrasound diagnosis concordance (89. 6 %). Lung ultrasound permits the identification of infants who are in need of supplementary oxygen with a specificity of 98. 7 %, a sensitivity of 96. 6 %, a positive predictive value of 96. 6 % and a negative predictive value of 98. 7 %.

40|$|Impact of bottom {{trawling}} on water turbidity and muddy sediment of an unfished continental shelf A. Palanques, 1 J. Guillén, and P. Puig Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), Passeig Joan de Borbo s/n, Barcelona 08039, Spain Two experiments {{were carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} trawling in the muddy prodeltaic deposit of the Llobregat River in the northwestern Mediterranean. Trawling was conducted in two experimental lines, and bottom morphol-ogy, sediment texture, and water turbidity were analyzed before trawling and at different time intervals afterward. The tracks of the trawl gears were still observed in <b>sonographs</b> of the bottom 1 yr after the first experiment. The vertical grain size distribution of bottom deposits indicated that the thickness of the sediment removed by the net between the gears was about 2 – 3 cm on average, though the erosion produced by the gears was deeper. Resuspended aggregates with a high silt content settled during the first hour after trawling, generating a temporary increase in the silt content of the surface sediment. One day after trawling, the surface sediment was mixed and already had a similar grain size distribution to that before trawling. After the beginning of trawling, water turbidity increased first near the bottom for a few hours and later also at shallower levels of the water column within a period of 2 – 5...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{results of}} marine geophysical {{surveys of the}} North Scotia Ridge (western South Atlantic) conducted by the Geoscience Division of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). These investigations were initiated {{as part of a}} wider programme of research into Scotia Sea tectonic evolution and palaeo-circulation (BAS project B 6153). The data which form the basis of this work were obtained on BAS scientific cruises between 1987 and 1993, and include bathymetric soundings, high-resolution sub-bottom profiles, multi-channel seismic reflection profiles, long-range side-scan <b>sonographs</b> and marine gravity measurements. F or clarity, interpretations have been arranged into three separate studies: (1) a long-range side-scan sonar survey of the southern Falkland Plateau, Falkland Trough and North Scotia Ridge between 40 and 58 °W; (2) a multi-channel seismic reflection survey of the North Scotia Ridge near 46 °W (Aurora Bank); and (3) a 3. 5 kHz sub-bottom profile and bathymetry survey of the Falkland Trough east of 50 oW. Essential background information describing the tectonic, sedimentary and oceanographic framework of the North Scotia Ridge region has been included, so that each study may be considered separately. Some of the work described in this thesis has been completed with the assistance of others, and these contributions have been acknowledged in the text. Published results are reproduced in Appendix A of this report...|$|R
