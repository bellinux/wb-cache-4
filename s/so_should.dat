5|$|While Trikoupis {{followed}} {{a policy of}} retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned a valuable lesson about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the Nationalist Party led by Theodoros Deligiannis, sought to inflame the anti-Turkish feelings of the Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose in 1885 when Bulgarians rose in revolt in Eastern Rumelia and united the province with Bulgaria. Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the Treaty of Berlin, <b>so</b> <b>should</b> the Greeks.|$|E

Studentized residuals are useful in making a statistical test for an outlier when a particular residual appears to be excessively large.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses can be {{mechanically}} cleaned of {{more substantial}} protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and {{the palm of}} a hand, using {{a small amount of}} cleaning fluid as a lubricant. However, this method does not sterilize the lenses and <b>so</b> <b>should</b> only be performed prior to a full sterilization cycle (e.g. when putting the contact lens away at night).|$|E

25|$|Another view of {{negotiation}} comprises four elements: strategy, process, tools, and tactics. Strategy comprises {{the top level}} goals – typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this persuasion and influence, asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and <b>so</b> <b>should</b> not be omitted.|$|E
25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, <b>so</b> <b>should</b> be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it virtually impossible to strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{cladistic}} analyses {{have revealed}} a phylogeny that Brown's arrangement fails to reflect. Dryandra {{is shown to}} have arisen from within the ranks of Banksia, <b>so</b> <b>should</b> not have been treated as a separate genus; and B.ilicifolia is a fairly derived species, contrary to the basal position suggested by Brown. The phyletic order of species is accurate in some cases but grossly inaccurate in others; for example B.brownii and B.nutans are closely related but are placed very far apart by Brown.|$|E

25|$|Hindus and Sikhs in Punjab and Bengal clamoured for the {{division}} of these two provinces, arguing that if India could be divided along religious lines then <b>so</b> <b>should</b> these provinces because the Muslim majorities in both provinces were small. Scholar Akbar Ahmed says that the basic unit of administration in India was the province and not the district and that the district level division reduced the principle of partition to absurdity. According to Ahmed, such a division should have meant that Muslim estates in the United Provinces be separated and given to Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Orchidaceae is {{the largest}} family of all {{angiosperms}} and hence {{by far the largest}} in the order. The Dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids, but DNA sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and <b>so</b> <b>should</b> be combined. Several studies suggest (with high bootstrap support) that Orchidaceae is the sister {{of the rest of the}} Asparagales. Other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree, generally among the Boryaceae-Hypoxidaceae clade. The position of Orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis, but cannot be taken as confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing <b>so</b> <b>should</b> be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E

25|$|Inexpensive small wax candles {{sold for}} Hanukkah burn for {{approximately}} {{half an hour}} <b>so</b> <b>should</b> be lit no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual, followed by the Shabbat candles. At {{the end of the}} Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the May reauthorization was that the CIA promised that {{improvements}} from Project RAINBOW would make the majority of U-2 flights undetected. On 2 April 1957, a RAINBOW test flight crashed in Nevada, killing the pilot. The U-2's large wingspan slowed its descent during crashes, often leaving its remains salvageable; Lockheed was able to rebuild the wreckage from the incident into a flyable airframe, but that it could do <b>so</b> <b>should</b> have been evidence to the CIA that its cover story might not be viable after a crash in hostile territory. The RAINBOW anti-radar modifications were not very successful, and their use ended in 1958.|$|E

Gilgamesh reveals that there is no ultimate power, but reminds Gladiolus that he must have been a capable warrior to defeat him and <b>so</b> <b>should</b> be reassured of his ability to defend Noctis. He offers Gladiolus his favourite sword, which is revealed to have been Cor's. Gladiolus and Cor leave the Tempering Grounds, with Gladiolus planning to reunite with the party while reflecting on the experience.|$|E
