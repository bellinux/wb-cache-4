25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hotel vs I would not let my dog <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.|$|E

25|$|A male finds {{prospective}} mates by olfaction. He then slips his cerci {{under the}} tip of the female's abdomen so that his and her ventral abdominal surfaces are in contact with each other, while both face in opposite directions. If not disturbed, pairs can <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> mating position for many hours. Matings occurred frequently among clustered individuals particularly in locations that allow both partners to cling to a surface. Under laboratory conditions, the mating season peaked during August and September, and a single mating event enabled females to lay fertilized eggs.|$|E
25|$|She {{continued}} her {{study at the}} Fukien Christian University, which was a top university {{at that time in}} China. She graduated at the age of 22 from this university and earned the bachelor's degree in Physics. Because she was the best one in her class and this university wanted to hire some women, she got the chance to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> university and work for 8 years. For the first four years, she worked as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanism. She taught so well that many students who were not in this class wanted to listen to her courses. After that she wrote a book named Course for Experiments in Optics and got the certification as a professor. Fukien Christian University had many exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could get the chance to study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, the person in charge of this program didn’t give her the chance. So she applied for Dickinson College and got a full scholarship by the help of her workmate named Lairong Li.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{considerable}} {{difference between the}} two Australian innings, six batsmen had lost their wicket hooking the ball in the first innings and this stroke was ignored in the second as Ian Chappell told his men to <b>stay</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> cost them the initiative as it took 150 minutes to reach 51/2, with only 8 runs scored off the last 12 8-ball overs. The batsmen to fall were Wally Edwards, was caught by Alan Knott off Bob Willis (3/45), and Ian Chappell who prodded a ball to Keith Fletcher off Derek Underwood (2/60). On the fourth day Ian Redpath was bowled again by Willis to leave Australia 59/3, but after this Greg Chappell (71), Ross Edwards (53), Doug Walters (63 not out) and Rod Marsh (46 not out) set about extending the lead. Chappell and Edwards added 114, without getting away from the tight bowling and defensive fields and Knott took his 174th Test catch off Willis to dismiss Edwards, thus breaking Godfrey Evans's 15-year-old record. It took some robust strokeplay from Walters and Marsh to bring the score to 288/5 in under 8 hours, Marsh hitting Underwood for a four and a six off successive balls before being dropped by the substitute Chris Old in the outfield and Walters hitting the 100,000th run for Australia against England on 199/5. Chappell declared 45 minutes before stumps to give England 335 minutes to make 333 runs to win, carefully timed to prevent a repeat of their shock win over the West Indies after a sporting declaration by Gary Sobers in 1967–68.|$|E
25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly {{tell you how}} this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E
25|$|The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, {{and local}} chiefs sought to gain European {{protection}} from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered {{was only a}} right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In {{the early years of}} the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a year at this time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to <b>stay.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> situation thangata came to mean forced labour.|$|E

500|$|Some {{individual}} scenes involved several jump cuts repeated {{several times}} in fast succession. Another unusual stylistic element used throughout the season involved sudden changes in jump-screen direction; a shot with an actor looking {{from left to right}} might immediately jump to another shot of the same actor looking from right to left. This process came from Levinson's insistence that the footage be edited together to include the actor's best performances. While editing [...] "Gone for Goode", Tony Black cut together two shots that did not match and began looking for a cutaway shot he could use to disguise the edit. Levinson liked the technique that came from cutting the two conflicting shots together and insisted it <b>stay</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> technique became commonly used throughout the series, although it was toned down in future seasons at the insistence of NBC executives who found it too unconventional.|$|E

He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E
