25|$|As for the Hellenes, it <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> to me {{that ever}} since they came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I {{do not think the}} Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta {{steps forward}} {{to take the}} {{revolver}} from her hand, but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against {{any of the other}} potential suspects. Lucy was the next suspect, as she kept a pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot's hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{that the}} {{existence}} of qualia <b>seems</b> <b>obvious,</b> Dennett nevertheless states that [...] "qualia" [...] is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. The eliminativist's claim with respect to qualia {{is that there is no}} unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes. In other words, they do not deny that pain exists, but that it exists independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia, even when other portions of the mental are accepted.|$|E

Jackson cited the Third Amendment as providing evidence of the Framers' intent to constrain executive power even during wartime:"hat military powers of the Commander in Chief were not to supersede representative government of internal affairs <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> from the Constitution and from elementary American history. Time out of mind, and even now {{in many parts of the}} world, a military commander can seize private housing to shelter his troops. Not so, however, in the United States, for the Third Amendment says...ven in war time, his seizure of needed military housing must be authorized by Congress." ...|$|E

In 25 years we have only found two betularia on the tree trunks or walls adjacent to our traps, and none elsewhere".

2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although it <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that [...] "we have just discovered that you are 'really' a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and we recommend that you change your sex to match your chromosomes and internal organs," [...] a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that one}} cannot both accept the {{hypothesis}} that all P's are Q and also reject the contrapositive, i.e. that all non-Q's are non-P. Yet {{it is easy to}} see that on the Neyman-Pearson theory of testing, a test of [...] "All P's are Q" [...] is not necessarily a test of [...] "All non-Q's are non-P" [...] or vice versa. A test of [...] "All P's are Q" [...] requires reference to some alternative statistical hypothesis of the form [...] of all P's are Q, , whereas a test of [...] "All non-Q's are non-P" [...] requires reference to some statistical alternative of the form [...] of all non-Q's are non-P, [...] But these two sets of possible alternatives are different ... Thus one could have a test of [...] without having a test of its contrapositive.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, the {{toponymy}} of Oldham <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> {{to imply}} [...] "old village or place" [...] from Eald (Old English) signifying oldness or antiquity, and Ham (Old English) a house, farm or hamlet. However, Oldham {{is known to}} be a derivative of Aldehulme; undoubtedly an Old Norse name. It is believed to be derived from the Old English ald combined with the Old Norse holmi or holmr, meaning [...] "old promontory or outcrop", possibly describing the town's hilltop position. Some have also likened the first element to Cumbric alt, 'slope'. However, it has also been theorised that it may mean [...] "holm or hulme of a farmer named Alda". The name is understood to date from 865 at the time of Danish Mercia, a time when the similarly named Hulme in nearby Manchester is believed to have origin.|$|E

60|$|It {{is curious}} {{that so much}} {{importance}} should be attached to this supplementary idea. It <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that {{the theory of the}} origin of species by natural selection necessarily involves the divergence of the forms selected. An individual which varies, ipso facto diverges from the type of its species; and its progeny, in which the variation becomes intensified by selection, must diverge still more, not only from the parent stock, but from any other race of that stock starting from, a variation of a different character. The selective process could not take place unless the selected variety was either better adapted to the conditions than the original stock, or adapted to other conditions than the original stock. In the first case, the original stock would be sooner or later extirpated; in the second, the type, as represented by the original stock and the variety, would occupy more diversified stations than it did before.|$|E
60|$|The {{conclusion}} {{from all}} these facts <b>seems</b> <b>obvious.</b> The bull-roarer is an instrument easily invented by savages, and easily adopted into the ritual of savage mysteries. If we find the bull-roarer used in {{the mysteries of the}} most civilised of ancient peoples, the most probable explanation is, that the Greeks retained both the mysteries, the bull-roarer, the habit of bedaubing the initiate, the torturing of boys, the sacred obscenities, the antics with serpents, the dances, and the like, from the time when their ancestors were in the savage condition. That more refined and religious ideas were afterwards introduced into the mysteries seems certain, but the rites were, in many cases, simply savage. Unintelligible (except as survivals) when found among Hellenes, they become intelligible enough among savages, because they correspond to the intellectual condition and magical fancies of the lower barbarism. The same sort of comparison, the same kind of explanation, will account, as we shall see, for the savage myths {{as well as for the}} savage customs which survived among the Greeks.|$|E

60|$|It {{might be}} {{objected to the}} theory that many things which we {{certainly}} believe do not call for any bodily movements. I believe that Great Britain is an island, that whales are mammals, that Charles I was executed, and so on; and at first sight it <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that such beliefs, as a rule, do not call for any action on my part. But when we investigate the matter more closely, it becomes more doubtful. To begin with, we must distinguish belief as a mere DISPOSITION from actual active belief. We speak as if we always believed that Charles I was executed, but that only means that we are always ready to believe it when the subject comes up. The phenomenon we are concerned to analyse is the active belief, not the permanent disposition. Now, what are the occasions when, we actively believe that Charles I was executed? Primarily: examinations, when we perform the bodily movement of writing it down; conversation, when we assert it to display our historical erudition; and political discourses, when we are engaged in showing what Soviet government leads to. In all these cases bodily movements (writing or speaking) result from our belief.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not easy}} for the lay mind to realise the {{importance}} of symbolism in discussing the foundations of mathematics, and the explanation may perhaps seem strangely paradoxical. The fact is that symbolism is useful because it makes things difficult. (This is not true of the advanced parts of mathematics, but only of the beginnings.) What we wish to know is, what can be deduced from what. Now, in the beginnings, everything is self-evident; {{and it is very}} hard to see whether one self-evident proposition follows from another or not. Obviousness is always the enemy to correctness. Hence we invent some new and difficult symbolism, in which nothing <b>seems</b> <b>obvious.</b> Then we set up certain rules for operating on the symbols, and the whole thing becomes mechanical. In this way we find out what must be taken as premiss and what can be demonstrated or defined. For instance, the whole of Arithmetic and Algebra has been shown to require three indefinable notions and five indemonstrable propositions. But without a symbolism it would have been very hard to find this out. It is so obvious that two and two are four, that we can hardly make ourselves sufficiently sceptical to doubt whether it can be proved. And the same holds in other cases where self-evident things are to be proved.|$|E
6000|$|The {{writer of}} the books of Samuel takes it quite {{as a matter of}} course that Michal, {{daughter}} of one royal Jahveh worshipper and wife of the servant of Jahveh par excellence, the pious David, should have her teraphim handy, in her and David's chamber, when she dresses them up in their bed into a simulation of her husband, for the purpose of deceiving her father's messengers. Even one of the early prophets, Hosea, when he threatens that the children of Israel shall abide many days without [...] "ephod or teraphim" [...] (iii. 4), appears to regard both as equally proper appurtenances of the suspended worship of Jahveh, and equally certain to be restored when that is resumed. {152} When we further take into consideration that only in the reign of Hezekiah was the brazen serpent, preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of Moses, destroyed, and the practice of offering incense to it, that is, worshipping it, abolished--that Jeroboam could set up [...] "calves of gold" [...] for Israel to worship, with apparently none but a political object, and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of Jahveh, or of repelling the men of Judah from his standard--it <b>seems</b> <b>obvious,</b> either that the Israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries B.C. knew not the second commandment, or that they construed it merely as part of the prohibition to worship any supreme god other than Jahveh, which precedes it.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} believe that the {{dominant}} source of Christian understanding is the Bible, it may <b>seem</b> <b>obvious</b> that expository preaching should be essential (though {{this is not the case}} with the seeker movement).
