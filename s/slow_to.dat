5|$|<b>Slow</b> <b>to</b> fast {{skeletal}} TnI isoform switch {{occurs as}} an indicator for <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> fast fiber type transition in muscle adaptations. Slow skeletal TnI has been proposed as a sensitive and muscle fiber type-specific marker for skeletal muscle injuries. In patients with skeletal muscle disorders, intact ssTnI or its degraded products may be detected in peripheral blood as a diagnostic indicator for slow fiber damages.|$|E

Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> replenish them.|$|E

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) is {{a severe}} {{developmental}} disability characterized by impairments in social interaction and communicative skills. Despite a growing research {{interest in the}} field, the causes of these impairments remain unknown. Two lines of research, Theory of Mind (ToM) and Central Coherence (CC), using experimental tasks such as visuo-spatial perspective Taking (VPT) and the local and global levels have suggested that visuo-spatial attention and spatial variables in the self-versus other recognition, may {{be the basis of}} the cognitive processes underlying social interaction. According to spatial attention, such as observed in the Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) may contribute to explain the differences in the spatial attention and the brain activation of autistic children in these two tasks. Participants with ASD in the CC experiment were <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the global level. In the VPT experiment the participants with ASD were <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the interaction first personal perspective (1 PP) and condition Common ground (CG), meanwhile was <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> response to the right hemifield in the interaction Third personal perspective (3 PP) and condition Common Ground (CG). However in the interaction Privileged ground (PG) and 1 PP the ASD group was <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> response to the right hemifield...|$|R

Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|Britain was {{initially}} {{involved in the}} development of the metric system, and the US was among the 17 initial signatories of the Metre Convention in 1875. Yet in spite of enthusiastic support for the new system by intellectuals such as Charles Dickens, these two countries were particularly <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> implement it.|$|E

5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} {{the first version of}} Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but were <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E

5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is too <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> {{cope with a}} human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 {{there have been a}} total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of September, a strong {{tropical}} wave began to emerge off the coast of Africa. It was well-organized from the start, and on September 11, even before it emerged off the coast, the National Hurricane Center predicted that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression. That is indeed what happened, and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12. The enormous size of the depression made it fairly <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> develop, combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the Saharan Air Layer to the north as it tracked south of the Cape Verde islands. Convection was also <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> build in, with little banding at first. The initial strengthening was delayed as a result. However, on September 13, the organization improved as banding became better defined, and that evening, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene.|$|E
