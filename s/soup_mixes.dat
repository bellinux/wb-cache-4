By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The First World War created demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts, and, by the end of the war, Nestlé's production had more than doubled.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} of chips and dip significantly {{increased in the}} United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant dehydrated onion <b>soup</b> <b>mix</b> to prepare dip.

5000|$|In 1942, Eugen Propper and {{his partner}} merged Hadagan with two other {{factories}} - Assisit and Itrit - to create Osem.

Seven years later, in 1953, upon a request by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, the company added its staple [...] "rice-substitute" [...] product ptitim. In 1964, Osem's snack factory was founded in Holon, and the company's main product was created - the peanut butter-flavoured Bamba. In 1970, the company started producing baked food in addition to introducing the Bissli snacks, which come in several flavours such as falafel, mesquite, BBQ, pizza, and onion.

50|$|Freeze drying is {{a recent}} {{dehydration}} breakthrough-method that is restricted to high-value foods due to the high cost associated with the process. Despite its cost, freeze-drying is very effective in retaining the overall quality and nutritional value of the food through a process called sublimation, where water is removed (evaporated) from food in its frozen state without the transition through the liquid state. Removing water from food prevents spoilage as it does not give an environment that favors the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, mould, and yeast. Freeze-drying also reduces the total weight of the food, especially fruit and vegetables that are mostly water, thus making the transportation of these products more efficient. Vegetables used in instant <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> often undergo freeze-drying that helps them retain their nutritional value, texture, and flavor. Furthermore, as the food remains rigid during dehydration, subliming water creates holes where the evaporated ice crystals used to be. This allows freeze-dried foods such as vegetables to retain their shape without shrinkage, and these foods rehydrate completely when water {{is added to the}} mix that fills the voids left by the subliming water. Due to the reduced water content of the freeze-dried foods that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and prevents enzymatic chemical reactions, these foods are considered shelf-stable and can be kept safe from spoilage for years by preventing the reabsorption of moisture. Freeze-dried foods can be stored in room temperature without the need for refrigeration.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{investigation was to}} formulate low sodium <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> based on vegetables and evaluate their acceptability. Four different <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> (tomato, onion, onion + tomato and mix vegetable) were prepared. In each soup five different variations varying in levels of salt and with or without added monosodium glutamate (MSG) were prepared. One of soup with normal salt level of 1 % (based on preference) served as control (I). Other samples were prepared with 0. 7 % salt (II), 0. 7 % salt with 40 mg MSG (III), 0. 5 % salt (IV) and 0. 5 % salt with 80 mg MSG (V). Samples were presented to panel members with a score card for determining acceptability. Results revealed that in all products, 0. 7 % salt with MSG was accepted well and in both soup II and IV, taste and acceptability improved after addition of MSG. Addition of MSG improved flavour profile of soups and assisted in salt reduction. Hence, MSG {{can be used to}} lower the sodium content of processed products due to its flavour potentiating effect...|$|E
40|$|Background. Average salt intake in South African (SA) adults, 8. 1 g/day, {{is higher}} than the 4 - 6 g/day {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization. Much salt consumption arises from non-discretionary intake (the highest proportion from bread, with contributions from margarine, <b>soup</b> <b>mixes</b> and gravies). This contributes to an increasing burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objectives. To provide SA-specific information on the number of fatal CVD events (stroke, ischaemic heart disease and hypertensive heart disease) and non-fatal strokes that would be prevented each year following a reduction in the sodium content of bread, soup mix, seasoning and margarine. Methods. Based on the potential sodium reduction in selected products, we calculated the expected change in population-level systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality due to CVD and stroke. Results. Proposed reductions would decrease the average salt intake by 0. 85 g/person/day. This would result in 7 400 fewer CVD deaths and 4 300 less non-fatal strokes per year compared with 2008. Cost savings of up to R 300 million would also occur. Conclusion. Population-wide strategies have great potential to achieve public health gains as they do not rely on individual behaviour or a well-functioning health system. This is the first study to show the potential effect of a salt reduction policy on health in SA...|$|E

40|$|Ninety {{percent of}} palm oil and its {{products}} {{are used for}} edible purposes. Palm oil is obtained from the mesocarp of the palm fruit while palm kernel oil {{is derived from the}} flesh of the kernel. Although they come from the same fruit, palm oil and palm kernel oil differ in their physical and chemical characteristics. Palm oil is about 50 % saturated and contains mainly palmitic (Ci 6 : 0) and oleic (Ci 8 :i) acids. Palm kernel oil is more than 80 % saturated and contains mainly lauric acid (C 12 : 0). Fractionation process separates palm oil into palm olein (liquid) and palm stearin (solid). A second fractionation gives superolein, palm mid fraction and hard stearin. Similarly fractionation separates palm kernel oil into palm kernel olein and palm kernel stearin. Palm oil and palm olein are widely used for industrial frying of snack foods due to their excellent oxidative stability. They have a long shelf life due to the presence of vitamin E, a powerful natural antioxi­dant. Palm olein produces less smoking, spattering, foaming and gums compared to polyunsaturated oils such as soyabean and sunflower oils. Palm stearin is used as an ingredient (hard feed stock) in the manufacture of shortenings, margarines and vanaspati. Being naturally semi-solid, it is an excellent choice for the manufacture of semi-solid products such as shortenings, margarines and vanaspati since it can reduce cost and is free form trans fatty acids. Palm oil stabilizes the product in β' form, which is required for good creaming and baking performances. Palm kernel oil and its products, either on its own or in combination with palm oil products are widely used in the manufacture of specialty fats, margarines and spreads. Incorporation of palm kernel oil or its derivatives, particularly in table margarine and spreads improves melting characteristic of the products. Palm kernel oil can be used to some extent in shortenings and vanaspati. Palm oil and palm kernel oil are also used in the manufacture of imitation dairy products. They can replace milkfat in production of ice cream, coffee creamer/whitener, whipping cream, milk, cheese and yogurt. Other food which contain palm oil and palm kernel oil include <b>soup</b> <b>mixes,</b> sardines, baked beans, breakfast cereals, shrimp-paste powder, bouillon, peanut butter and beverages. Palm oil products are also used as a spray opil on biscuits and cream crackers to give a richer taste and an attractive glossy appearance. Future outlook sees new applications of palm oil in pourable margarines, burgers, frankfurters and sausage/bologna. Substitution of animal fat with palm oil will give a low cholesterol meat product. With advances in fractionation technology, it is possible to produce superolein which shows potential for application as a salad oil...|$|E
