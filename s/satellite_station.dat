5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station,</b> which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> in 2007.|$|E
5|$|TSS did not became {{operational}} {{again until}} 1982, when the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme {{made use of}} the station. The Ministry of Trade and Industry took {{a renewed interest in}} the <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> in the early in 1980s and proposed in 1982 that Norway join ESA's European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) program. This started the process of Norway becoming a full member of ESA in 1987. The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> in 1988. Part of the goal of the project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994. By then it had become a global manufacturer of Earth observation ground stations.|$|E
5|$|Shaft {{produced}} a Popotan anime, featuring Shinichiro Kimura's directing and storyboards, Jukki Hanada's writing, Haruka Sakurai's character designs (based on Akio Watanabe's original concept), and Rondo Mizukami's animation oversight. Under17 composed the opening theme {{song in the}} same style used for the game; Funta wrote the ending theme song. Tokyo Broadcasting System's <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> BS-i and the Bandai Channel aired the anime from July 17, 2003 through October 3, 2003.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, KOTA-TV and its <b>satellite</b> <b>stations</b> {{added the}} Retro Television Network and This TV on their digital subchannels. In 2011, Retro Television was {{replaced}} by MeTV on KOTA-TV and its <b>satellite</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since {{the closing}} of the mines in 1963, the mining company Kings Bay had been working to {{establish}} Ny-Ålesund as a research town. The telemetry station acted as an important stepping stone for research activity, and the plans for development of Ny-Ålesund as a permanent research community continued past 1974. In 1997, Svalbard <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> opened in Longyearbyen, which is among other stations used by ESTRACK.|$|E
5|$|Twelve episodes were produced. They {{originally}} {{aired on}} Tokyo Broadcasting System's <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> BS-i, from July 17, 2003 through October 2, 2003, and were also made {{available at the}} same time on the Bandai Channel. On August 27 and 28, 2003, an event with the first volume Japanese DVD of Popotan was shown Animate Ikebukuro in Japan. The event featured guest appearances by the anime's voice actress for the three sisters.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, NSC {{operated}} Tromsø <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> (TSS), {{which was}} used as a ground station for a limited number of satellites. After Rolf Skår was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden.

50|$|The Vault {{was one of}} {{the early}} <b>satellite</b> <b>stations</b> to {{broadcast}} in Dolby matrix surround sound.|$|R
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing telemetry for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits. The two telemetry stations used {{a large portion of}} the Norwegian space budget, but became platforms which allowed for development of technology. Tromsø <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> worked well in tandem with Andøya Rocket Range and became an international center for study of the auroral zone. The University of Tromsø was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972. The same year, it took over the geophysical observatory and cosmic geophysics became one of the university's fields of excellence.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{the rise of a}} number of {{scientific}} establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984. The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
5|$|No. 11 Group was {{relocated}} to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command {{and the entire}} site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November. Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960. On 1 November, the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. The station had been home {{since the end of}} the war to the London Area Control Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton, which operated as a <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> of RAF Uxbridge. HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (HQ MATO) moved into Hillingdon House in January 1965.|$|E

5|$|Personnel paraded through Uxbridge {{town centre}} on 28 November 2007, exercising {{the freedom of}} the borough granted to the station in 1960. RAF Uxbridge became a <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> of RAF Northolt on 1 April 2008, in {{preparation}} for the eventual closure. In the final years of RAF ownership, the Service Prosecuting Authority and Civil Aviation Authority's UK Airprox Board (investigating air proximity incidents) was based in Hillingdon House. The final of the national Carnegie Champions schools rugby tournament was held at the station in August 2008. The link between RAF Uxbridge and the Royal Observer Corps was renewed in 2008 with the closure of RAF Bentley Priory and the relocation to Uxbridge of ROC memorabilia from the Priory Officers' Mess for safekeeping and display. The Royal Observer Corps had been stood down from operational duties in December 1995.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> {{was built}} because of Longyearbyen's {{excellent}} location to download data from satellites in polar orbit. Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset, {{it was built}} as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre, but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services. EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds. The facility {{has been designed to}} protect against natural and human disasters, including global warming, floods and fires and nuclear holocaust. The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness, sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost.|$|E

Shortly before that a suicide bomber attacked the security headquarters in the Southern Sinai capital of El-Tor, killing three and injuring at least 55. In addition, two rocket-propelled grenades hit a major <b>satellite</b> <b>station</b> in the affluent Cairo suburb of Maadi, causing some damage, but no casualties.|$|E
25|$|Planning of {{the cables}} started in 2002 by the Norwegian Space Centre (NSC), who wanted {{increased}} bandwidth {{to expand their}} business at Svalbard <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station</b> (SvalSat). At the time all telecommunications from Svalbard were relayed via communications satellite. Financing was secured through {{a deal with the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The cable system was supplied by Tyco Communications and laying of the cable was carried out by Global Marine Systems in July and August 2003.|$|E
25|$|Initially NOR VTS {{only had}} access to AIS data from coastal stations. This changed in 2010 when AISSat-1 was launched. Built as a {{demonstration}} project, it quickly proved reliable to monitor the high sees within NOR VTS's area of responsibility. Initially telemetry operated out of Svalbard <b>Satellite</b> <b>Station,</b> but in 2015 a ground station opened in Vardø next to the VTS, allowing for a greater period of online operations. The give the constallation redundancy, AISSat-2 was launched in 2014 and AISSat-3 the following year.|$|E
