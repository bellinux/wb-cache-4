50|$|The 9th Annual Tour de Kingston {{was held}} on June 22, 2014. The same rides were held and an {{additional}} ride was added. The new <b>ride</b> was a <b>Road</b> and Rail <b>ride</b> that used the expanding rail trails to develop the first local recreational off <b>road</b> <b>ride.</b> Participant chose between the 5,10,25 and 50 mile <b>road</b> <b>rides</b> and 10, 17, and 25 mile road and rail trail rides. The recently opened Rosendale Trestle was included. Local news coverage from the Kingston Daily Freeman, Kingston Times and the Lincoln Eagle newspapers plus the YNN Television Network helped publicize the event. The 2014 participant numbers rose to 450-500. The new higher numbers were handled through the support of community agencies and businesses. Primary among them were the YMCA of Ulster County, HealthAlliance Foundation and Walgreens. In addition many other local businesses set up vending tables or offered donations. Bicycle clubs from a large area attended as well as bicycle shops making it a very inclusive event.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{operation of}} a country’s economy depends, among other things, on an efficient logistical system to ensure that goods can be transported efficiently between producers and users. The costs of logistics include aspects such as transport, storage, inventory, and management. Of these, the transport costs are directly influenced by {{the condition of the}} transport infrastructure. The effects of <b>road</b> <b>riding</b> quality on the costs of logistics were evaluated through analysis of data on actual truck costs (specifically, vehicle damage and maintenance) obtained from a logistics service provider as well as data on <b>road</b> <b>riding</b> quality for the routes used by the company. Analysis of the data indicated that the vehicle operating costs increased with decreasing riding quality (as would be expected). Spending adequate resources on the maintenance of routes in a country decreased vehicle fleet operating costs and ultimately the logistics costs of the country. It is recommended that the study be broadened to incorporate a larger sample of vehicles and road conditions. Imperial Logistics[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{rationality}} (its {{presence or}} its absence) of the business, be it producer or consumer, {{has been a}} constant preoccupation of all those who dedicated their energy and talent on the <b>sinuous</b> <b>road</b> of the history of economic thinking. Without rational behaviour it was inconceivable to determine a development path. From this point of view the position of the great schools of thought is based, essentially, on two main approaches. The classics and the neoclassics had in mind the perfectly rational and well-informed individual. In reply, the institutional economy, in its old or new form (NIE), opposes to homo oeconomicus rationalis a narrow-minded and insufficiently informed homo contractualis. The consequences of this re-evaluation of the basics of the business’s potencies on the physiognomy of the theoretical approach and also on the results of practical actions are significant. Those linked to the bounded rationality hypothesis, an important operating concept in the analytical structures of NIE, may trigger debates on the theoretical basis of standard economics...|$|R
5000|$|The Mount Vernon Avenue Association disbanded {{some time}} during World War I, {{but the concept}} of a Mount Vernon roadway was now championed by the federal Bureau of Public Roads (BPR). The BPR seized on the idea in the 1920s as a means of demonstrating the latest highway {{construction}} technology. Its first proposals were merely to upgrade the existing roads in the area and perhaps add a tree-lined boulevard, with formal, uninspired masonry bridges. But the BPR's proposals quickly evolved into much more. The agency hired Gilmore David Clarke and Jay Downer, who had designed the highly celebrated Central Westchester Parkway in New York, as consultants. They quickly proposed a more elaborate system of plantings, historic roadside pullouts, and scenic overlooks, and a more <b>sinuous</b> <b>road</b> design. The BPR began calling the road a [...] "highway" [...] rather than a parkway to de-emphasize its commemorative nature in the hope that Congress would fund its construction.|$|R

60|$|On a sharp, {{sunlight}} morning, {{when the}} white clouds are drifting swiftly across the luminous blue sky, there is no finer walk about London than the Highgate ridge.

The Waterlow Park is a pleasant place, full of children and aged persons in perambulators during the middle hours of the day, and in the summer evening time a haunt of young lovers; but your early wanderer finds it solitary save for Vertumnus, who, with L.C.C. on the front of him, is putting in crocuses. So we wander down to the little red lodge, whence a <b>sinuous</b> <b>road</b> runs to Hampstead, and presently into the close groves of monuments that whiten the opposite slope.|$|R
