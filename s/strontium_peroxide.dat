50|$|The M276 is a violet-tipped 7.62×51mm NATO dim tracer {{that uses}} {{composition}} R 440, which is barium peroxide, <b>strontium</b> <b>peroxide,</b> calcium resinate for example calcium abietate, and magnesium carbonate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strontium</b> <b>peroxide</b> is {{produced}} by passing oxygen over heated strontium oxide. Upon heating {{in the absence of}} O2, it degrades to SrO and O2. It is more thermally labile than BaO2.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strontium</b> <b>peroxide</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula SrO2 {{that exists in}} both anhydrous and octahydrate form, {{both of which are}} white solids. The anhydrous form adopts a structure similar to that of calcium carbide.|$|E
50|$|A tracer {{projectile}} {{is constructed}} with a hollow base {{filled with a}} pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic fuel, oxidizer, and {{a small amount of}} organic fuel. Metallic fuels include magnesium, aluminum, and occasionally zirconium. The oxidizer is a salt molecule which contains oxygen combined with a specific atom responsible for the desired color output. Upon ignition, the heated salt releases its oxygen to sustain combustion of the fuel in the mixture. The color-emitting atom in the salt is also released and reacts chemically with excess oxygen providing the source of the colored flame. In NATO standard ammunition (including US), the oxidizer salt is usually a mixture of <b>strontium</b> compounds (nitrate, <b>peroxide,</b> etc.) and the metallic fuel is magnesium. Burning strontium yields a bright red light. Russian and Chinese tracer ammunition generates green light using barium salts. An oxidizer and metallic fuel alone, however, do not make a practical pyrotechnic for the purposes of producing colored light. The reaction is too energetic, consuming all materials in one big flash of white lightwhite light being the characteristic output of magnesium-oxide (MgO), for example. Therefore, in the case of using Strontium Nitrate and Magnesium, to produce a red colored flame that is not over-powered by the white light from the burning fuel, a chlorine donor is provided in the pyrotechnic mixture, so that Strontium Chloride can also form in the flame, cooling it so that the white light of MgO is greatly reduced. Cooling the flame in this manner also lengthens the reaction rate so that the mixture has an appreciable burn time. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a typical organic fuel in colored light for this purpose. Some modern designs use compositions that produce little to no visible light and radiate mainly in infrared, being visible only on night vision equipment.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} synthesis and {{a discussion}} of some chemical properties of pure <b>strontium</b> <b>peroxide</b> and calcium peroxide are presented. The general synthesis of these peroxides involves precipitation of their octahydrates by addition of H 2 O 2 to aqueous ammoniacal Sr(NO 3) 2 or CaCl 2. The octahydrates are converted to the anhydrous peroxides by various dehydration techniques. A new x-ray diffraction powder pattern for CaO 2 x 8 H 2 O is given from which lattice parameters a= 6. 212830 and c= 11. 0090 were calculated {{on the basis of}} the tetragonal crystal system...|$|E
40|$|A major {{industrial}} use of pyrotechnic compositions is as delay fuses in electric detonators. Suitable delay times may {{be achieved through}} (i) choice of chemical components (ii) adjustment of composition of the system chosen and, finally, (iii) adjustment {{of the length of}} fuse used. This study forms part of a survey of binary fuel/oxidant combinations in an attempt to provide some fundamental information on the first step above: (i) choice of chemical components. The complete survey has included studies of a single fuel in combination with one of a variety of oxidants, and studies of the oxidation of one of several different fuels separately by barium peroxide and <b>strontium</b> <b>peroxide.</b> This study is part of this second approach and the fuels chosen were iron and zinc powders, mainly for chemical reasons (including the potential for use of thermomagnetometry on the iron systems), but also for possible environmental advantages. The mixed oxide products of pyrotechnic combustion could also have some scientific and/or commercial value. The techniques used included thermal analyses of mixtures and their individual components, and measurements of temperature-time profiles during combustion. Thermodynamic and kinetic information was obtained under a variety of conditions and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and microprobe analyses provided additional information. Possible mechanisms of reactions are discussed in detail. The practical conclusions were that any potential use which the Fe/peroxide systems may have as delay compositions, with burning-rates of from 3 - 30 mm s⁻¹, is offset by the susceptibility of the oxidants to reaction with water and CO₂ in the atmosphere. The Zn/BaO₂ and Zn/SrO₂ systems did not burn under compaction, and combustion of uncompacted powders was erratic. Zinc liquid (and probably zinc vapour) take part in the reaction and the gaseous nature of the combustion makes zinc-fuelled pyrotechnic systems unsuitable for delay applications. All the techniques used showed the heterogeneity of the solid residues of combustion. If these residues were to be of any value, they would need further conventional treatment involving grinding of the residue, possible adjustment of compositions, and calcining to produce uniform materials. ...|$|E
40|$|Barium {{peroxide}} {{was selected}} as oxidant in a fundamental physico-chemical stndy of binary pyrotechnic systems on account of its apparently simple decomposition stoichiometry. With this selection, the choice of fuel was governed by the requirements of a self-sustaining reaction at combustion temperatures below the melting point of the platinum/rhodium thermocouples (- 1760 °C) used for recording temperature-time profIles during burning, and at burning rates not exceeding {{the response of the}} sensors used to monitor combustion. Both manganese and molybdenum metal powders satisfied the above requirements. <b>Strontium</b> <b>peroxide</b> was also available as an oxidant and so the combustion of binary metal/oxidant systems using both fuels and both Ba 0 ₂ and Sr 0 ₂ oxidants was investigated. The Mn/Ba 0 ₂, MoBa 0 ₂ and Mn/Sr 0 ₂ systems burnt over a wide range of compositions, but tbe range of ignitable compositions for the Mo/Sr 0 ₂ system was very limited. The linear burning rates, for all these systems, ranged from 2 to 12 mm s⁻¹ and burning rates were increased by the use of smaller particle-sizes of fuel and greater loading pressures. Inert additives generally decreased the burning rate. Temperature-time profIles were recorded for all the compositions which sustained combustion. Kinetic parameters were estimated from the shapes of these profiles using procedures developed by Hill et at and Boddington and Laye. Activation energies derived from the profiles were low (3 to 40 kJ mol⁻¹) and support suggestions that reactions at high temperatures are controlled by diffusion processes. Thermal analysis was used to identify the processes occurring in the four systems. The main exothermic events were observed to correspond approximately with the onset of oxidant decomposition. A pre-ignition reaction was tentatively identified in the Mn/Ba 0 ₂ system. Oxidation of the metal fuels was generally incomplete, probably because of the formation of protective layers of product. Activation energies, derived from thermal analysis results, were in the range of from 70 to 720 kJ mol⁻¹ Ternary systems containing either mixed fuels or mixed oxidants were also examined. No interactions hetween the fuels or between the oxidants were observed. Other techniques used included bomb calorimetry, measurement of thermal conductivity, X-ray powder diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. ...|$|E
