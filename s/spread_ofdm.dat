40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} support the diverse Quality of Service (QoS) {{requirements}} for differentiated data applications in broadband wireless networks, advanced techniques such as space-time coding (STC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are implemented at the physical layer. However, the employment of such techniques evidently affects the subchannelallocation algorithms at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose the QoS-driven cross-layer subchannelallocation algorithms for data transmissions over asynchronous uplink space-time OFDM-CDMA systems. We mainly focus on QoS requirements of maximizing the best-effort throughput and proportional bandwidth fairness, while minimizing the upperbound of scheduling delay. Our extensive simulations show that the proposed infrastructure and algorithms can achieve high bandwidth fairness and system throughput while reducing scheduling delay over wireless networks.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s world, {{wireless}} communications {{has become an}} essential part of every day life. An example of this is the exchange and transmission of data in many forms. Multi-user access systems provide a method to allow multiple users to transmit and exchange this type of information concurrently. Due to its orthogonality, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been used in Ultra Wide Band (e. g. MB-OFDM), WLAN (such as IEEE 802 : 11 a and IEEE 802 : 11 g) and mobile broadband systems (such as 3 GPP LTE) as an e±cient scheme to achieve the expected outcomes for today 2 ̆ 7 s society needs for communications. Although OFDM achieves an excellent transmission rate and its application can be seen in everyday life, it still su®ered from corruption especially in indoor wireless environments in applications such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANS) in business o±ces, universities and shopping centers as an example. In these types of environments OFDM su®ers the greatest in degradation of performance. This degradation is due to multipath and fast frequency channels. Many solutions for this performance degradation have been proposed and the application of di®erent types of diversity has been used. This thesis proposes three applications of three di®erent types of diversity to improve the OFDM system performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). Firstly, a new spreading matrix called the Rotation Spreading matrix used to introduce frequency diversity to OFDM is proposed. This new spreading ma- trix employs the use of a rotation angle to increase the correlation between the transmitted symbols to ensure in an indoor environment the system maintains an excellent performance. This thesis provides many studies through experi- ments and simulations of this new spreading matrix against other well known matrices such as the Hadamard and the Rotated Hadamard. This includes the introduction of methods to increase the size of this new matrix to ensure it is scalable to higher order matrices.

40|$|The {{discrete}} Fourier transmission <b>spread</b> <b>OFDM</b> DFTS-OFDM) based single-carrier {{frequency division}} multiple access (SC-FDMA) has been widely adopted due to its lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of transmit signals compared with OFDM. However, the offset modulation, which has lower PAPR than general modulation, cannot be directly applied into the existing SC-FDMA. When pulse-shaping filters are employed to further reduce the envelope fluctuation of transmit signals of SC-FDMA, the spectral efficiency degrades as well. In order to overcome such limitations of conventional SC-FDMA, this paper {{for the first time}} investigated cyclic prefixed OQAMOFDM (CP-OQAM-OFDM) based SC-FDMA transmission with adjustable user bandwidth and space-time coding. Firstly, we propose CP-OQAM-OFDM transmission with unequally-spaced subbands. We then apply it to SC-FDMA transmission and propose a SC-FDMA scheme with the following features: a) the transmit signal of each user is offset modulated single-carrier with frequency-domain pulse-shaping; b) the bandwidth of each user is adjustable; c) the spectral efficiency does not decrease with increasing roll-off factors. To combat both inter-symbolinterference and multiple access interference in frequencyselective fading channels, a joint linear minimum mean square error frequency domain equalization using a prior information with low complexity is developed.
