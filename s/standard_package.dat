The Automobile Association questioned many of Sinclair's claims {{in a report}} published {{at the start of}} May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about 10 miles (16km) rather than the [...] promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5's battery ran flat after only [...] on a cold day. The C5's running speed was more usually around [...] than the claimed , while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped.

The longest run between battery charges was only , and a more realistic achievable range was 5–10 miles (8–16km).

The PlayStation 2 version featured two standard and collector's bundles from pre-orders. The <b>standard</b> <b>package</b> included the game and a T-shirt, while the collector's bundle included the game, a T-shirt, a figurine of Leon, and the soundtrack Biohazard Sound Chronicle Best Track Box.

Another, called the Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition, was packaged in a SteelBook media case, along with the art book, a documentary DVD, and a cel art of Ada.|$|E
