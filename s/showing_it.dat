5|$|After {{producing}} an English-dub for the series, Funimation Entertainment promoted {{it in the}} United States by combining the first four episodes into a ninety-minute film named Trinity Blood: Genesis and <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> in select theaters starting May 5, 2006. The series then premiered in English-language on the Canadian digital station Razer from July 6 through December 14, 2006. On DVD, Funimation's English adaptation was first made available in North America from September 26, 2006 through April 24, 2007, in Australia and New Zealand from December 6, 2006 to July 18, 2007, and in Europe from July 2, 2007 through May 26, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} the film {{from two years}} prior to its release, and after the film's release, some cast members spoke against, and even sued, its creators. It was banned in all Arab countries except Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (which released the film heavily censored), and the Russian government discouraged Russian cinemas from <b>showing</b> <b>it.</b> It was released on DVD 5 March 2007 (a day later in Region 1 countries).|$|E

Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and {{their relationship with the}} climate of the period.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this?

5|$|Squab pie is a {{traditional}} dish from South West England, with early records <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> was associated with Cornwall, Devon and Gloucestershire. Although the name suggests it contains squab (young domestic pigeon), in fact it contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten {{around the world in}} the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.|$|E

6000|$|... 70. I {{must begin}} a little {{apparently}} wide of the mark, {{and ask you}} to reflect {{if there is any}} way in which we waste money more in England than in building fine tombs? Our respect for the dead, when they are just dead, is something wonderful, and the way we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> more wonderful still. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black feathers and black horses; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black dresses and bright heraldries; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone, {{in the midst of the}} quiet grass; and last, and not least, we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in order that she may be respectably buried.|$|R

Of these three moons, only Methone has been photographed at close range, <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> to be egg-shaped with very few or no craters.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{companies}} with manufacturing plants in Arad are Arad Textile Industries, one of Israel's largest producers of towels, Flextronics Israel, A.M.S. Electronics who manufacture {{printed circuit boards}} and electronic products, El-Ran Timber Industries, Jordael who manufacture cosmetic products, and a Unilever Shefa Israel cereal plant. Since 1971, Arad has been producing phosphoric acid, made from brine collected from the Dead Sea, and phosphates from the nearby Tzefa. Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years. In 2008, the Ministry of the Environment decided not to contest the company's bid, despite studies <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> may increase air pollution-related deaths in the area.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed by Peter's {{constant}} shocking, Brian professes his discomfort by referencing {{his anger}} after O. J. Simpson {{was acquitted of}} charges in the O. J. Simpson murder case. After Lois expresses her hope for the restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states {{that it will be}} just as successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but the length of the opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> to Lois in an attempt to make her understand his concern.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood Pictures {{gave the}} film a {{platform}} release, <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> {{in a few}} cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. Evita opened in limited release in New York and Los Angeles on December 25, 1996, before being released nationwide on January 10, 1997. The film was distributed by Buena Vista Pictures in North America and Latin America, Paramount Pictures (through United International Pictures) in Germany and Japan, and Summit Entertainment in other countries. A book detailing the film's production, The Making of Evita, was written by Parker and released on December 10, 1996, by Collins Publishers. In 2002, Evita became {{the first and only}} American film to be screened at the Pyongyang International Film Festival.|$|E

As a result, Tracy buys the rights to his new comedy movie, The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas, in order to block the distribution of the feature and improve his chances at winning the award. Later, Tracy decides to do a charity event by screening Hard To Watch—a story of an inner-city boy living in the ghetto—for a women's shelter. At the charity event, Tracy introduces the movie but decides against <b>showing</b> <b>it,</b> realizing that laughter is the best medicine and instead screens The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas. The people in the shelter find the movie hilarious thus making Tracy happy.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> to his editor.|$|E
5|$|The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, {{compiled}} in the 9th century, mentions cubeb as {{a remedy}} for infertility, <b>showing</b> <b>it</b> was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes. Cubeb was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century. The Travels of Marco Polo, written in late 13th century, describes Java as a producer of cubeb, along with other valuable spices. In the 14th century, cubeb was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, {{under the name of}} pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe. A 14th-century morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and cubeb after his baths, probably as an aphrodisiac.|$|E
