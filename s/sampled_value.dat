50|$|The Metropolis-Hastings {{algorithm}} {{works by}} generating {{a sequence of}} <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> {{in such a way}} that, as more and more <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution, P(x). These <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> are produced iteratively, with the distribution of the next sample being dependent only on the current <b>sample</b> <b>value</b> (thus making the sequence of samples into a Markov chain). Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next <b>sample</b> <b>value</b> based on the current <b>sample</b> <b>value.</b> Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)−the probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function f(x) of the current and candidate <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> with respect to the desired distribution P(x).|$|R

50|$|In statistics, a c+-{{probability}} is {{the probability}} that a contrast variable obtains a positive value.Using a replication probability, the c+-probability is defined as follows: if we get a random draw from each group (or factor level) and calculate the <b>sampled</b> <b>value</b> of the contrast variable based on the random draws, then the c+-probability is the chance that the sampled values of the contrast variable are greater than 0 when the random drawing process is repeated infinite times. The c+-probability is a probabilistic index accounting for distributions of compared groups (or factor levels).|$|E

50|$|As {{synchronization}} {{is done on}} the voted signal, small transmission errors during synchronization {{that affect}} the boundary bits may skew the synchronization no more than 1 cycle. As there are at most 88 cycles between synchronization (BSS1, 8 bits of the last byte, FES and TES - 11 bits of 8 cycles each), and the clock drift is no larger than 1 per 300 cycles, the drift may skew the clock no more than 1 cycle. Small transmission errors during the receiving may affect only the boundary bits. So in the worst case the two middle bits are correct, and thus the <b>sampled</b> <b>value</b> is correct.|$|E
30|$|Prediction schemes {{predict a}} certain <b>sample</b> <b>value</b> by a linear or {{non-linear}} combination of its spatial neighbours and encode {{the difference of}} the <b>sample</b> <b>value</b> and its prediction (prediction error). The more spatially correlated the <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> are, the smaller the resulting prediction error becomes. Highly correlated input <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> result in {{a high number of}} small prediction coefficients following a statistical distribution suitable to be efficiently encoded by entropy coders described before.

30|$|Another {{feature that}} {{has been added to}} Edition 2 is the possibility, to {{subscribe}} to GOOSE messages or <b>sampled</b> <b>value</b> messages from simulation or test equipment. The approach is explained in Fig.  3. GOOSE or <b>sampled</b> <b>value</b> messages have a flag indicating if the message is the original message or if it is a message produced by a simulation. On the other side, the IED has in the logical node LPHD (the logical node for the physical device or IED) a data object defining, if the IED shall receive the original GOOSE or <b>sampled</b> <b>value</b> messages or simulated ones. If the data object Sim is set to TRUE, the IED will receive for all GOOSE messages it is subscribing the ones with the simulation flag set to TRUE. If for a specific GOOSE message no simulated message exists, it will continue to receive the original message. That feature can only be activated for the whole IED, since the IED shall receive either the simulated message or the original message. Receiving both messages at the same time would create a different load situation and therefore create wrong test results.|$|E

Existing MC methods require the <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> at cell vertices {{to be different}} from the threshold or modify them otherwise. The modification may introduce topological changes to the constructed surface. The proposed Tricolor MC method allows cell vertices with <b>sample</b> <b>values</b> which equal the threshold to lie on the surface. It constructs the surface patches by exhausting the Eulerian circuits in the cells without changing <b>sample</b> <b>values.</b> The simulation results show that the TMC method better preserves the topology of the surfaces that pass through cell vertices and gives good results in other general cases. ...|$|R
