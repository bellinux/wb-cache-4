40|$|Fire risk {{assessment}} {{has always been}} a challenging issue. Furthermore, performance based approaches to fire engineering showed that risk based decisions and fire scenarios are a fundamental element of the fire safety strategy assurance. In particular, a correct assessment of the risk allows all the involved stakeholders to identify a specific strategy among a pool of possibilities. Risk assessment is the perfect tool to identify comparable fire protection strategies and to measure fire risk reduction associated to the single specific prevention and protection measures composing each different fire strategies. This approach implies the need to abandon a classic, not even conservative approach, that in many cases linked the total fire load to the fire risk level, despite specific dynamics, layouts, prevention measures and risk management issues during time. During the years, a number of different methodologies have been developed: for specific cases, for industrial or civil buildings, to adopt a method enforced by the local law and regulations acts, etc. Methods have been based on matrices, indexes, check-lists, etc. Present paper illustrates a method developed by the authors taking into account several international recognized methods; even coming back to methodologies developed in early seventies. The Method is named "FLAME" (Fire risk Assessment Method for Enterprises), {{it goes back to the}} fire <b>safety</b> <b>fundamentals</b> against a generalized approach to fire safety engineering based on complex and time-consuming methods like CFD that deals only with the ‘consequences' aspect of the fire risk (that is indeed characterized also by frequency estimation) using as reference scheme the "Fire Safety Concept Tree" explained in detail in the NFPA 550 Standard. In order to identify the most appropriate fire safety strategy it is important to identify the associated fire risk that the strategy is intended to mitigate to a certain level. Alternative solutions can be evaluated considering the risk reduction operated by different strategies and by different elements composing the fire strategies themselves and also costs with a modern ALARP approach. A clear advantage is the possibility to get an overview of the whole fire risk as the cumulative risk assessed by the model and not solely related with the consequences evaluation of a limited number of fire scenarios (usually the most obvious ones). Risk level assessment leads to the identification of the fire scenario (or a pool of) that governs and limits the specific situation, declined for both humans and structures (assets) considering that the two vulnerabilities could be linked to different fire risk scenarios. The method has been tested against different buildings occupancies. In the present case results of the FLAME method application to hospitals and health-care facilities are reported. A fire compartment-based risk estimation has been conducted on an overall of about 300 compartments (overall size of about 60000 m 2). Coherence has been found among risk estimation by FLAME parametric code and prescriptions of the Italian fire code. There is good agreement when assessing the RSET with the method proposed in FLAME, dealing with the occupants' behaviour and the actual characteristics of occupants in clinics or hospitals and difficulties due to poor mobility or incapacity to understand emergency cues...|$|E
40|$|One of the IAEA’s {{statutory}} objectives is to “seek {{to accelerate}} and enlarge {{the contribution of}} atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world”. One way this objective is achieved is through {{the publication of a}} range of technical series. Two of these are the IAEA Nuclear Energy Series and the IAEA Safety Standards Series. According to Article III. A. 6 of the IAEA Statute, the safety standards establish “standards of safety for protection of health and minimization of danger to life and property. ” The safety standards include the <b>Safety</b> <b>Fundamentals,</b> Safety Requirements and Safety Guides. These standards are written primarily in a regulatory style, and are binding on the IAEA for its own programmes. The principal users are the regulatory bodies in Member States and other national authorities. The IAEA Nuclear Energy Series comprises reports designed to encourage and assist R&D on, and application of, nuclear energy for peaceful uses. This includes practical examples to be used by owners and operators of utilities in Member States, implementing organizations, academia, and government officials, among others. This information is presented in guides, reports on technology status and advances, and best practices for peaceful uses of nuclear energy based on inputs from international experts. The IAEA Nuclear Energy Series complements the IAEA Safety Standards Series. To be competitive in anticipated markets, small and medium sized reactors (SMRs) rely on design and deployment approaches that are able to offset the adverse impacts of economy of scale. Such approaches include design simplification resulting from the application of safety design features that are the most appropriate for reactors of smaller capacity; the economy of mass production of multiple prefabricated modules; the option of incremental capacity increase, with possible benefits resulting from accelerated learning; sharing of common equipment and facilities; shorter construction periods, unit timing (spread of investments over time); and, possibly, greater involvement of local industry and local labour. The effectiveness of all of these approaches to SMR design and deployment depends on the application and on market variables, such as interest rates, and needs to be assessed and demonstrated for specific cases. Upon the advice and with the support of IAEA Member States, the IAEA provides a forum for the exchange of information by experts and policy makers from industrialized and developing countries on the technical, economic, environmental and social aspects of SMR development and implementation in the twenty-first century, and makes this information available to all interested Member States by producing status reports and other publications dedicated to advances in SMR design and technology development. This report was prepared to assist existing and potential stakeholders in Member States in understanding the economic competitiveness of SMR technologies compared to other energy sources and large reactors (LRs); to provide information on available approaches and frameworks to assess the economic competitiveness of advanced SMRs and LRs under specific conditions of their application; and to share knowledge on positive experiences of several Member States that are introducing SMRs into their energy mix. The report is intended for a variety of stakeholders including: design organizations involved in SMR development programmes; investors and potential users of innovative SMRs; and officers in the ministries or atomic energy commissions in Member States responsible for implementing nuclear technology development programmes or evaluating nuclear power deployment options in the near, medium and longer term. The main sections of this report highlight the experience with and future plans for SMRs in several Member States, and present the available methodological options to assist design organizations and guide potential users on the economic performance and investment attractiveness of SMRs. The report also provides recommendations on how to apply the available methodologies and define a framework for subsequent comparative assessment studies of different deployment strategies for different nuclear power plants under various possible conditions of their application. The annexes contributed by Member States provide in-depth descriptions of different assessment methods, give examples of their application, suggest further developments towards a consolidated methodology and also offer more details of the experience of Member States...|$|E

Johannesburg, 2013. In this study a dose assessment is used to demonstrate conformance to national and international dose limits for workers and meets the Necsa ALARA goals for a radiological repair task. The dose assessment methodology is based on international standards, principles and criteria and involves the process of determining radiological dose, {{through the use of}} exposure scenarios, bioassay results, monitoring data, source term information, and pathway analysis. The radiological task is the replacement of the leaking steam coil on the radioactive effluent evaporator facility at Necsa. The effluent treatment facility, its operation, the origin of the radioactive effluent and hazards associated with the leaking coil are discussed. The dose assessment is supported by measurement of actual radiological conditions in the area where the task will be performed using suitable and calibrated instrumentation. The assumptions were limited to the physical phenomena associated with the behaviour of materials and available from national and international studies. The importance of proper planning of all the tasks associated with the replacement task as well as sources of inaccuracy and uncertainty associated with the calculated doses are discussed. The results of the assessment are evaluated in terms of ALARA, namely the <b>safety</b> <b>fundamental</b> principles of justification, optimisation and limitation of facilities and activities. Other dose reduction options, such as personal protective clothing and equipment, were considered to show that the doses conform to the ALARA objectives of Necsa and other operation optimisation measures...|$|R
