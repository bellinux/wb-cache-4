5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one.
