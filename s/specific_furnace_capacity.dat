The immediate prior process to heat treatment is furnace-loading, where parts are loaded into baskets.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the fuel feeding mode (continuous or {{periodic}} with different stand-by/operation time ratios) on carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO, NOx) concentration values in the flue gas was analysed for coniferous wood pellet firing.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the heat treatment operation in a manufacturing plant. The heat treatment operation {{is characterized by}} process times ranging from 7 hours to 112 hours. The immediate prior operation to heat treatment is turning. Currently, the batches loaded in heat treatment, often do not use <b>furnace</b> <b>capacity</b> adequately. This paper describes the use of heuristics and simulation to model batch-loading and scheduling in the furnace operation. The batch-loading operation is complex and involves issues relating to geometry, and heterogeneity in the parts and their processing requirements. Currently, the batch-loading is accomplished by operator ingenuity; however, parts available from turning for loading onto the furnaces, limit the operator. The limitation on parts available for batchloading is due primarily {{to the use of}} a conventional "push" system used for scheduling. The model being proposed here has two facets to address the batch-loading and scheduling problems. A heuristic-based approach is proposed for the batch-loading task. This heuristic forms batches for heat treatment based on anticipated production from turning; in addition, the heuristic provides feedback to turning for adjustments to its production plan. Results from a solution to the batch-loading problem are integrated into a discrete-event simulation model for the heat treatment and turning operations...|$|R

40|$|Three {{electric}} arc furnaces (EAFs) were constructed by Union Carbide at Tubatse Ferrochrome (TFC) in 1975. This plant was expanded to four furnaces at the East Plant in 1985 {{and the gas}} cleaning system was enlarged without taking flow dynamics into consideration. In order to improve competitiveness, TFC has increased <b>furnace</b> <b>capacity,</b> partially substituted coal for coke, and changed the charge mix. These changes increase the heat and dust load into the air pollution con-trol (APC) system. TFC embarked on a project to improve the APC capacity by: • Quantifying the required off-gas capacity • Optimising the aerodynamic flow through the system by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) • Converting the old Brandt Koyo top entry baghouses to bottom entry • Upgrading the cleaning system • Installing Gore-tex ® ePTFE membrane filter bags The estimation of required off-gas capacity is traditionally done by rule-of-thumb methods such as specific extraction.
