They differ from these, in the sense that <b>S-parameters</b> do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, matched loads are used. These terminations are much easier to use at high signal frequencies than open-circuit and short-circuit terminations. Moreover, the quantities are measured in terms of power.|$|E

25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using <b>S-parameters,</b> such as gain, return loss, voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), reflection coefficient and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of <b>S-parameters,</b> scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.|$|E

25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the <b>S-parameters</b> of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E

We also show that the non-trivial dependence on the number of flavors merges naturally with the non-perturbative estimate of the <b>S-parameter</b> close to the lower end of the conformal window obtained using gauge duality (Sannino, 2010) [2].
