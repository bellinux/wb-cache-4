In May 2008, Coca Cola and Cargill announced the availability of Truvia, a consumer brand stevia sweetener containing erythritol and Rebiana, which the FDA permitted as a food additive in December 2008. Coca-Cola announced intentions to release stevia-sweetened beverages in late December 2008. From 2013 onwards, Coca-Cola Life, containing stevia as a sweetener, was launched in various countries around the world.|$|E

One of the food additives is sweetener. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>sweetener</b> that commonly used in food and beverage industry is cyclamate. Cyclamate excessive consumption will cause tumors and cancer. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) established that the maximum levels of cyclamate that could be consumed by the body is 500 – 3000 mg/kg body weight. Therefore, this study aims to determine levels of cyclamate in red syrup that sold in Banjarmasin Utara. Identification of cyclamate used precipitation method with HCl 10 %, BaCl 2 10 % and NaNO 2 10 % as reagents, and determination of cyclamate levels performed by gravimetric method.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of nonnutritive sweeteners and {{the widely}} publicized 1969 ban on cyclamate led to additional investigations in rodents of the carcinogenic potential of saccharin. Preliminary results of a long-term feeding study indicated formation of bladder tumors in rodents, and collective experimental evidence has demonstrated that high doses of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweetener</b> saccharin can cause bladder cancer in rodents. Based {{on the results of}} that and other rodent studies indicating an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with saccharin, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration announced the agency's intention to propose a ban on saccharin.

40|$|Gastrointestinal barrier {{dysfunction}} is {{now recognized}} as an early event in the pathogenesis of several problematic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Parkinson’s disease, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease and type 1, 2 diabetes mellitus. Gastrointestinal permeability can be assessed noninvasively by analyzing saccharide markers in urine such as sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, and the <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweetener</b> sucralose. Current methods for analyzing these markers require expensive and time-consuming instrumentation such as high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). An alternative approach has been taken by assembling a two-component fluorescent probe that comprises a boronic acid substituted bipyridinium salt (BBV) as the receptor and a fluorescent reporter dye (HPTS) in which the system operates at physiological pH. We have shown that using our two component probe small intestinal permeability can be determined by rapidly measuring the lactulose and riboflavin ratios. To improve the current system, we pursued an array based system containing a triad of the boronic acid sugar receptors. Through this array, {{it was possible to}} discriminate between low and increased small intestinal permeability by analyzing various lactulose and mannitol mixtures. Additionally, an assay to measuring sucralose for colonic permeability was developed. Since sucralose can survive the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome, it is deemed as an excellent marker to use for measuring permeability in the colon. We have shown a proof of concept that using our chemical assay, sucralose can be measured with sensitivity in the range it is expected to appear in actual samples...|$|E

40|$|Low- and no-calorie sugar subtistutes are {{compounds}} that provide food with its sweet taste. As the term suggests, they have lower or no food energy and usually {{are characterized by}} higher sweetness than sucrose. For that reason, these substances are especially used during the treatment of diabetes mellitus, to reduce the energy content of food or in prevention of dental caries. Natural sweeteners were discovered a long time ago, during the search for sustenance. For example Stevia was used by South American Natives even before the European conquest of the territory. However, the history of artificial sweeteners is not too significant, because it relates to breaking the laboratory rules. That is how saccharin was invented in 1878. Sugar substitutes are added to food on purpose, adjusting the taste or extending the shelf life of foods. In the EU, every approved sweetener has got an E-code, which is displayed on the label. Sugar substitutes can be grouped according to their origin, their nutrition value or their chemical structure. This thesis discusses low- and no-calorie sugar substitutes that can be synthetic or natural. Mentioned <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweeteners</b> typically contain less then 21 kJ per portion. These intensive food additives possess many times the sweetness of sucrose. The main representatives of this group are saccharin, cyclamate, acesulfame K, sucralose and aspartame with its derivatives. The group of natural sugar substitutes constits of substances like erythritol, D-tagatose, trehalose, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, stevioside and thaumatin. There are some limitations confirmed by expert studies. For example, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus should mainly use <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> because of their low nutritional value. Even though in some states certain sweeteners are forbidden, safety studies {{say that there are}} no adverse effects, if the recommended daily intake is respected. Sugar substitutes, therefore, can be considered safe...|$|R

These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals. Taste detection thresholds for sweet substances are rated relative to sucrose, which has an index of 1. The average human detection threshold for sucrose is 10 millimoles per liter. For lactose it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3, and 5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as saccharides activate the GPCR, which releases gustducin.

Here we investigated the expression of adenosine receptors in mouse taste buds at both the nucleotide and protein expression levels. Of the adenosine receptors, only A 2 B receptor (A 2 BR) is expressed specifically in taste epithelia. Further, A 2 BR is expressed abundantly only in a subset of taste bud cells of posterior (circumvallate, foliate), but not anterior (fungiform, palate) taste fields in mice. Analysis of double-labeled tissue indicates that A 2 BR occurs on Type II taste bud cells that also express Gα 14, which is present only in sweet-sensitive taste cells of the foliate and circumvallate papillae. Glossopharyngeal nerve recordings from A 2 BR knockout mice show significantly reduced responses to both sucrose and <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> but normal responses to tastants representing other qualities.

Sweet proteins {{have the potential to}} substitute the sugars, by acting as natural, good and low calorie sweeteners. They also do not trigger a demand for insulin in diabetic patients unlike sucrose. In humans, the sweet taste perception is mainly due to taste-specific G protein-coupled heterodimeric receptors T 1 R 2 -T 1 R 3. These receptors recognize diverse natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as monelin, brazzein, thaumatin, curculin, mabinlin, miraculin and pentadin. Structural modeling of new sweetener proteins will be a great leap in further advancement of knowledge and their utility as sweeteners. We have explored the fingerprints of sweetness by studying the aminoacid composition and structure properties of the above proteins. The structural analysis of monellin revealed that the individual A or B chains of monellin are not contributing to its sweetness. However, the native conformation and ionic interaction between AspB 7 of monellin with active site of T 1 R 2 -T 1 R 3 receptor, along with hydrogen bonding stability of IleB 6 and IleB 8 are responsible for the sweet taste. Based on structural similarity search, we found a new hypothetical protein from Shewanella loihica, which has the presence of Asp 32 with adjacent isoleucine residues. Further, we examined the lead protein by two-step docking for the study of interaction of functionally conserved residues with receptors. The identified protein showed similar ionic and hydrophobic interactions with monelin. This gives a promising opportunity to explore this protein for potential health application in the low calorie sweetener industry viz., soft drinks, snacks, food, chocolate industries etc...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidents}} {{and levels of}} several food additives (colours, preservatives, <b>synthetic</b> <b>sweeteners</b> etc) in locally produced and imported foodstuffs are monitored and controlled since 1980 s by the State General Laboratory, which is the official control laboratory in Cyprus The control is performed according to the relevant national multiannual control plan, {{the requirements of the}} new EU Regulation 1333 / 2008 for food additives and within the spirit of the European Commission reports (SCOOP tusk 4. 2 & COM 2001) for the monitoring and assessment of the dietary intake of additives by Member States. The aim of the control is to cover basic and frequently consumed foodstuffs in high quantities with emphasis to the food consumed by children. The mandate of this report is the dietary intake assessment of aspartame, benzoates and sulphites/ bisulphites, which are characterized as allergens as well. For the risk assessment of the dietary intake, data from two data bases were used. One for the levels of these additives in the several food groups/items and one for the food consumption data of these food groups in Cyprus. The more representative and valid are the data for these two data bases, the most accurate will be the quantitative risk assessment, after comparison with the values of Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADI) given for the examined substances and lower the relevant uncertainties will be. In Cyprus, for the first data base, the analytical results of the multiyear (2002 - 2009) monitoring and control of these additives were used. For the second data base, the data for the Household Budget Survey for foodstuffs (for the years 2003 - 04) were used. The estimated mean dietary intake of aspartame is 2, 1 % of the ADI for aspartame (ADI = 40 mg/kg), for benzoates is 3, 6 % of the ADI for benzoic acid (ADI = 5 mg/kg) and for sulphites/ bisulphites is 35, 8 % of the ADI for sulfur dioxide (ADI = 0, 7 mg/kg). All the calculations were done for 60 kg body weight (b. w.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research were {{to find out the}} sellers' characteristic (age, lenght of selling, education grade), knowledge degree, their opinion about food additive and type of synthetic color and the contents (type and dose) of sweeteners from street food (beverage). The research was done in Dukuh Menanggal II/ 425 Goverment Elementary School, Gayungan District, Surabaya, by involving four sellers and 18 taste of street food (beverage). The information about knowledge degree of sellers and their opinion about food additive was collected by using questionnaire. The sellers' knowledge degree was measured with scoring system. The types and dose of food additive (<b>synthetic</b> colors and <b>sweeteners)</b> were obtained by chemical analysis in laboratory. The result of the research showed that 75 % of the sellers were in 60 - 65 years old, had been selling for more than 20 years, elementary school graduated, and had less degree of knowledge about food additive. There were 75 % of the sellers stated that students strongly like street food (beverage) that were sold. All of permanent seller sold syrup. Es potong was sold by non permanent seller. From 18 types of street food (beverage) that were examined in laboratory, 7 1. 1 % contained the dangerous synthetic colors (Rhodamin B) and 61. 1 % contained sweeteners (saccharine and syclamate) that excess the maximum limit of use. The conclusions are the most sellers have less degree of knowledge about food additive. There are a lot of street food (beverage) contains sweeteners that excess the maximum limit of use and dangerous synthetic colors. Based on the result, the control of street food distribution and counseling to the sellers about food additive should be done to prevent the bad effect.   Key words: <b>Synthetic</b> colors, <b>Sweeteners,</b> Street food (beverage) </p...|$|R

40|$|What do Juicy Juice fruit punch, SunChips, Nature Valley granola bars, and Skinny Girl Margaritas have in common? These {{products}} are all branded {{with the term}} “natural. ” From canned vegetables to cereals to soft drinks, the term “natural” {{has become one of}} the most common claims on food, drugs, dietary supplements, and personal care products. The word “natural on the label or in advertising brings to mind nature, and things that are pure, clean, healthy, free of artificial additives, and therefore safe, harmless, and beneficial to overall health. In 2011, “all-natural” was the second-most-used claim on the new American food products. The food industry’s marketing of such products has been extremely successful. In 2009, sales of products with a “natural” claim reached $ 22 billion, and a recent study found that the “natural” claim is the most popular among consumers. When asked “which is the best description to read on a food label,” 31 % of the consumers selected “ 100 % natural” and 25 % selected “all natural ingredients. ” Although both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U. S. Department of Agriculture (USA) are statutorily mandated to protect consumer interest by prohibiting false and misleading labeling, both agencies define the term. As a result, food manufacturers have been free to use the term as they see fit. As the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) explains, the term “natural” “applies broadly to foods that are minimally processed and free of <b>synthetic</b> preservatives; artificial <b>sweeteners,</b> colors, flavors, and other artificial additives; hydrogenated oils; stabilizers; and emulsifiers. ” However, this restrictive definition is merely aspirational. As a wave of recent lawsuits demonstrates, some food manufacturers have taken great liberties with their use of the term. Although the FDA has indicated that the issue is not a priority for the Agency because of the limited resources and because there was not enough evidence that consumers are willing to pay for “natural” foods, recent polls demonstrating consumer concern and confusion over such claims, and an influx of recent lawsuits alleging that “natural” claims do not meet consumer expectations of natural ingredients or minimum processing...|$|R
