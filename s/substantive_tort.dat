This fairly complex body of legislation contains 16 separate sections dealing with procedure, evidence and <b>substantive</b> <b>tort</b> issues. Shortly after it was signed into law, five Georgia Law professors sat down with alumni and students to describe parts of the new legislation, to identify some issues that are likely to arise as the new laws go into effect and to speculate about what they think the likely impact will be on litigation...|$|E
40|$|With the {{adoption}} and subsequent national {{implementation of the}} E-Commerce Directive’s safe harbour regime, the architecture set up in Europe for the civil liability of internet intermediaries for the copyright infringements of others has become two-tiered: at a first stage, {{it is necessary to}} examine whether a given intermediary attracts, in its pursuit of a certain activity, liability according to the standards ensconced in the Member States’ legislation. If so, in the second instance, the applicability of a safe harbour must be considered. As a result, although it provides a veneer of approximation by immunising intermediaries under certain circumscribed conditions, the Directive does not harmonise the underlying substantive liability norms which determine whether the safe harbours will be necessary or redundant. This leaves ample room for national divergences beyond the safe harbours. The resultant fragmentation strikes a discordant note in the otherwise highly harmonised area of copyright. This book seeks to explore the possibilities for moving EU law forward towards a fully harmonised intermediary liability system in copyright. To this end, after a detailed dissection of the current European rules, it undertakes a comparative analysis of the national regimes in place in three EU Member States, those of England, France and Germany. Subsequently, the relationship between these rules and the national <b>substantive</b> <b>tort</b> principles that underlie them is examined. Ultimately, the book works its way towards proposing a model harmonised framework to govern the area: a truly substantive, truly European comprehensive, cogent, stable and effective analytical structure for intermediary accessory copyright liability...|$|E
40|$|Whenever a listed company {{seeks to}} enter into a {{significant}} business transaction, independent professional advisers such as corporate lawyers, sponsors or financial advisers are auditors are retained by its board of directors and the company is required to publicly disclose the transaction to the securities market. The conduct of corporate lawyers arising from the deficiencies in the disclosure documents has come under intense scrutiny in the last decade in the wake of financial scandals and global financial crisis. In theory, corporate lawyers not only provide independent advice to, but are also in the position to monitor and control the disclosure decisions of, their clients, and thereby deterring their clients from making false or misleading statements or withholding material disclosures. The question arises as to whether they should be regarded as gatekeepers in respect of these disclosures and should be liable for the wrongs of their corporate clients. In the UK, while there have been proposals to increase the role and regulation of sponsors, there is little recognition that corporate lawyers play a gatekeeping role and their responsibilities in securities fraud have not been the subject of intense public debate or scrutiny. In contrast, in US, following Enron and Worldcom debacles, section 307 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted and pursuant to the legislation, Securities and Exchange Commission has prescribed certain minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys who practise before it, including an obligation to report up the ladder within the client company. The American Bar Association addressed these matters in its Model Rules and Formal Opinions. This paper examines the role of corporate lawyers as gatekeepers in respect of the ongoing disclosures made by their listed corporate clients. The paper makes the following observations. First, corporate lawyers conduct verification and due diligence exercises for their issuers’ disclosure documents which are designed to ensure that their clients, their directors and the sponsor or financial adviser discharge their duties of care. However, there is no independent duty of care imposed on the corporate lawyers by legislation or regulators. Second, there is a very limited obligation at common law to report fraud or wrongdoing up the ladder within a client company. Third, short of outright assistance of fraud, due to a combination of <b>substantive</b> <b>tort</b> rules and securities regulation, the risk of corporate lawyers being held liable to third parties in respect of advice rendered to their corporate clients and which caused externalities is extremely low. Fourth, lawyers are seldom required to account under professional responsibility rules even when they fall short of their duty of care or diligence. These current arrangements have continued to be the case notwithstanding the fact that the advice of corporate lawyers in UK has been found wanting in various governmental investigations since the 1990 s. A comparison is made to the positions in US, which has a sophisticated capital market and relatively similar legal institution as the UK. This paper explains the differences. Extrapolating the analysis, the framework also reviews the role of lawyers in the current gatekeeping framework in the securities markets in Singapore, particularly {{in the wake of a}} number of recent disclosure failures by issuers listed on the Singapore Exchange post-financial crisis. This paper then considers the implication of the analysis and argues that while it is perhaps not essential for a well functioning capital markets system to impose gate keeping responsibilities on corporate lawyers, they can be effective gatekeepers, alongside with sponsors or financial advisers. This paper suggests a more optimal arrangement to put in place incentives for the corporate lawyers to investigate thoroughly when their clients issue disclosure documents...|$|E

40|$|This article, {{written for}} the first annual Access to Justice {{symposium}} at Loyola Law School of Los Angeles, addresses the implications of due process for tort reform. In a line of relatively recent cases, the U. S. Supreme Court has held that a tort award of punitive damages must satisfy the procedural and substantive requirements of the Due Process Clause of the U. S. Constitution. So far, constitutional tort-reform has been limited to punitive damages, but such reform is not necessarily limited to this area of tort law. As the article argues, other important tort practices raise {{the same sort of}} due process concerns that the Court has relied upon to justify the constitutional tort-reform of punitive damages practice. The Court’s punitive damages jurisprudence may thus provide the foundation for a new type of broad-based tort reform. Regardless of what one may think about the Court’s foray into tort reform, constitutional tort-reform has desirable characteristics. Rather than addressing the <b>substantive</b> aims of <b>tort</b> liability, constitutional tort-reform is supposed to reduce or eliminate any unreasonable legal uncertainty generated by the tort practice in question. But as the article further argues, the neat distinction between substance and process cannot be attained in practice. Any reform designed to reduce legal uncertainty will depend upon a contestable conception of tort liability, a characteristic of constitutional tort-reform clearly present in the Court’s punitive damage jurisprudence. The Court, though, does not have to reach the correct substantive outcome in order to make constitutional tort-reform desirable. If the Court adopts a reform that depends upon the wrong <b>substantive</b> conception of <b>tort</b> law, the states retain the power to adopt a different substantive objective for the tort practice. Constitutional tort-reform therefore can serve the valuable role of forcing state courts and legislatures to identify more clearly the <b>substantive</b> objectives of <b>tort</b> law, an issue of critical importance that has not been adequately addressed by the reform movements of the last century...|$|R
40|$|Do we court {{disaster}} by {{stretching the}} bounds of judicial authority to address problems of massive scale and complexity? Or does disaster lie in refusing to engage the jurisgenerative potential of courts in a domain of such vast significance? This Article examines global climate change adjudication {{to shed light on}} these questions, focusing particularly on cases that seek to invoke the norm articulation and enforcement functions of courts. The attempt to configure climate-related harms within such <b>substantive</b> frameworks as <b>tort</b> and constitutional law is fraught with analytical and practical difficulties. Yet the exercise, we argue, is essential. Against the backdrop of a potentially existential threat, judges redeem the very possibility of law when they forthrightly confront the merits of climate lawsuits. Conversely, when they use weak preliminary and procedural maneuvers to avoid such confrontation, judges reinforce a sense of law’s disappearance into the maw of normative rupture...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{questions}} {{how well}} standard economic analysis justifies the land-use torts that Ronald Coase popularized in The Problem of Social Cost. The Article compares standard economic analyses of these torts against an interpretation that {{follows from the}} natural-rights morality that informed the content of these torts in their formative years. The “feffersonian” natural-rights morality predicts the contours of tort doctrine more determinately and accurately than “Coasian” economic analysis. The comparison teaches at least three important lessons. First, a significant swath of doctrine, Jeffersonian natural-rights morality explains and justifies important tort doctrine quite determinately. Second, this natural-rights morality complements corrective justice theory by the <b>substantive</b> rights that <b>tort</b> 2 ̆ 7 s corrective-justice features seek to rectify when wronged. Finally, standard economic tort analysis cannot prescribe determinate results without making simplifying assumptions more characteristic of moral philosophy than of social science.

40|$|The {{majority}} of current first year university students belong to Generation Y. Consequently, research suggests that, {{in order to}} more effectively engage them, their particular learning preferences should be acknowledged in the organisation of their learning environments and in the support provided. These preferences {{are reflected in the}} Torts Student Peer Mentor Program, which, as part of the undergraduate law degree at the Queensland University of Technology, utilises active learning, structured sessions and teamwork to supplement student understanding of the <b>substantive</b> law of <b>Torts</b> with the development of life-long skills. This article outlines the Program, and its relevance to the learning styles and experiences of Generation Y first year law students transitioning to university, in order to investigate student perceptions of its effectiveness – both generally and, more specifically, in terms of the Program’s capacity to assist students to develop academic and work-related skills...|$|R
50|$|The most {{challenging}} balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims {{which do not}} sound (give rise to a claim) in tort. The common law and constitutional law have developed in the United States to create a high <b>substantive</b> burden to <b>tort</b> and tort-like claims which seek redress for public speech, especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of libelous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence {{that there has been}} deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the bad faith SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.|$|R
40|$|Although {{it is not}} one of {{its main}} features, the Principles of European Tort Law (PETL) have devoted some {{attention}} to the rules regarding the burden of proof in tort cases, especially to the possibility of a reversal of that burden. Since such a reversal of the burden of proof will be highly relevant for the substantive outcome of a tort case, one {{needs to be able to}} justify such a reversal on normative grounds. However, that justification is not always advanced clearly enough in the PETL. At the same time the PETL focus largely on the possible exceptions to the general rule on the burden of proof. As a result, the underlying general rule as such has not been codified. This paper analyses the burden of proof rules in the PETL not only from a more technical point of view, but also from the perspective of the possible influence they might have on the <b>substantive</b> outcome of <b>tort</b> cases. To highlight their content, importance and possible inspirational force for a future ‘European tort law’, these Principles are contrasted with their counterparts under Dutch tort law. The aim is to answer the question whether the choices made in the PETL are justifiable and whether the Dutch tort system can – or maybe even should – seek inspiration from these Principles...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a curious}} {{circumstance}} that, although {{the sole purpose of}} a lawsuit is to obtain redress of some sort, the remedial aspects of cases are usually shunted {{to the back of the}} litigational bus from which they emerge belatedly, casually, and somewhat rumpled. Anyone searching for illuminating bits of remedial lore in California (or any other) advance sheets must be prepared to rummage about among tag-end paragraphs of literally hundreds of civil cases from which such interest as may originally have existed in parties, facts, controversy, strategy, or even style has long since been drained away. However, remedial considerations are sometimes so strong that they push to the forefront. This is particularly true of cases in which the claimant is afforded, or at least thinks the trend of judicial lawmaking is such that there is a chance he may be afforded, a choice of <b>substantive</b> law (contract, <b>tort</b> or restitutionary) causes of action based upon the facts stated. Since remedial problems range in appearance from tag-end paragraphs to main themes, a discussion of court decisions is forced to follow a similar pattern. It may be tempting at times to focus only upon the main themes, but remedial problems given lesser attention may be equally important, if only to the client 2 ̆ 7 s bank account. Accordingly, this review and analysis treats in varying length the remedial problems to which the courts gave varying attention...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the most}} recent draft of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Intentional Torts to Persons, the {{intentional}} torts protect the rightholder’s interests differently from negligence-based rules and strict liability, placing them into a distinct substantive category. This conceptualization, however, does not provide courts with adequate guidance on how to formulate the element of intent. Different formulations can protect the rightholder’s interests differently from negligence and strict liability, so something else must determine the appropriate way to formulate the element of intent. The draft Restatement’s reasoning can be easily extended to provide a more useful conceptualization of the intentional torts. The practice of tort law involves the enforcement of behavioral norms, and so the <b>substantive</b> categories of <b>tort</b> law should correspond to normatively distinguishable categories of behavior. For tort purposes, three different paradigmatic forms of social behavior are relevant: aggressive interactions; interactions of mutual advantage; and the remaining nonaggressive, risk-creating interactions that are not motivated by an expectation of mutual benefit. Within this normative framework, the category of intentional torts is defined by aggressive interactions, which involve intentional harms that are normatively different from accidental harms. The intentional torts accordingly protect different interests in a distinctive manner as per the rationale in the draft Restatement. This normative framework straightforwardly explains a number of established rules while also resolving two questions of intent that have vexed courts and commentators. Difficult issues of intent involve hard questions about how the conduct is best categorized for tort purposes. Once the categories have been conceptualized in behavioral terms, the element of intent has a clear substantive purpose: it determines whether or not an interaction is aggressive and properly governed by the intentional torts...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{routinely}} {{engage in}} positive analysis {{to identify the}} efficiency properties of a practice without expressly taking any position on the normative {{question of whether the}} practice should be conducted in an efficient manner. Unlike positive economic analysis, the positive economic analysis of tort law is tied to a particular form of normative judgment. Because there is no consensus about the normative purpose of tort law, one must engage in an interpretive exercise in order to figure out the <b>substantive</b> rationale for <b>tort</b> liability. There is widespread agreement that any viable legal interpretation must first offer a minimally plausible description of the important doctrines and practices comprising the body of law in question. This question of “fit” is addressed by the positive economic analysis of tort law, making it necessarily relevant to legal interpretation. A number of critics have questioned the descriptive power of efficiency analysis, arguing that positive economic analysis cannot persuasively explain the bilateral structure of <b>tort</b> liability, the <b>substantive</b> content of important liability rules, and the form of judicial reasoning in tort cases. In this book chapter I show that the structure of tort liability does not pose a challenge to the efficiency interpretation; that challenge instead resides in the substantive content of the negligence rule and the form of judicial reasoning in negligence cases. Economic analysts have been studying a version of the negligence rule that fundamentally differs from the rule actually applied by courts. A positive analysis of the correct rule strengthens the efficiency properties of negligence liability vis-à-vis strict liability, thereby tightening the fit between allocative efficiency and the practice of tort law, but a more complete analysis of the negligence rule substantially undermines the positive claim that tort law can be plausibly interpreted as furthering a norm of allocative efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} Australian Law Schools have {{implemented}} {{various forms of}} peer assisted learning or mentoring, including career mentoring by former students of final year students and orientation mentoring or tutoring by later year students of incoming first year students. The focus of these programs therefore is on the transition into or out of law school. There is not always as great an emphasis however, {{as part of this}} transition, on the use of law students belonging to the same unit cohort as a learning resource for each other within their degree. This is despite the claimed preference of Generation Y students for collaborative learning environments, authentic learning experiences and the development of marketable workplace skills. In the workplace, be it professional legal practice or otherwise, colleagues rely heavily on each other for information, support and guidance. In the undergraduate law degree at the Queensland University of Technology (‘QUT’) the Torts Student Peer Mentor Program aims to supplement a student’s understanding of the <b>substantive</b> law of <b>torts</b> with the development of life-long skills. As such it has the primary objective, albeit through discussion facilitated by more senior students, of encouraging first year students to develop for themselves the skills they need to be successful both as law students and as legal practitioners. Examples of such skills include those relevant to: preparation for assessment tasks; group work; problem solving, cognition and critical thinking; independent learning; and communication. Significantly, in this way, not only do the mentees benefit from involvement in the program, but the peer mentors, or program facilitators, themselves also benefit from their participation in the real world learning environment the program provides. This paper outlines {{the development and implementation of}} the above program, the pedagogy which influenced it, and its impact on student learning experiences...|$|R
