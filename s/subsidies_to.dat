5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E
5|$|As {{the energy}} and liquid fossil fuels were {{about to enter the}} NZ ETS in July 2010, Wright {{expressed}} her concern that although the NZ ETS was the right framework, the <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> big emitters would limit the incentives to reduce emissions and impose significant costs on the taxpayer.|$|E
5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} land, the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal of the tribes from the territory would have meant loss of this income.|$|E

5|$|A {{central part}} of Macdonald's case {{concerned}} the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument {{was based on the}} premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.|$|E
5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices at the pump are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E

5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; {{by the end of}} the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|After the {{transfer}} of Louisiana to the United States, the Spanish had ended <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic Church in St. Louis. As a result, Catholics in St. Louis had no resident priest until the arrival of Louis William Valentine Dubourg in early January 1818. Upon his arrival, he replaced the original log chapel with a brick church, recruited priests, and established a seminary. By 1826, a separate St. Louis diocese was created. Joseph Rosati became the first bishop in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E

Burke has helped line up millions of dollars in public <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> companies that later hired his firm for property tax assessment appeals.

5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. That spring, Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad. Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> the chiefs. These measures helped convince the frontier tribes that Britain's wartime position remained strong and that Indian defences were impregnable.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government <b>subsidies.</b> <b>To</b> compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} salient feature of the Spanish housing market, {{compared}} to other European economies, is its relatively low rental share. This may be partly attributed {{to the existence of}} fiscal distortions in Spain favoring ownership. In this paper, we simulate the potential efects of different policy measures aimed at homogenizing the fiscal treatment of ownership and renting and improving the efficiency of the rental market. We do so {{in the context of a}} DSGE model featuring a market for owner-occupied and rented housing, as well as collateral constraints in loan markets. We find that eliminating the existing <b>subsidy</b> <b>to</b> house purchases, introducing a comparable <b>subsidy</b> <b>to</b> rental payments or increasing the efficiency in the production of housing rental services raise the rental share by a similar amount. However, their implications in terms of the construction sector differ. Rental market share, <b>subsidy</b> <b>to</b> house purchases, <b>subsidy</b> <b>to</b> rents, rental market efficiency...|$|R

5|$|In January 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to {{encourage the use of}} public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> transit fares. The law went into effect in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|In March 1998, {{after the}} closure of Europe's last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and {{subsequently}} closed), the Cornish Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 toll in pennies. The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, the {{government}} laid {{a plan to}} cut utilities <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> higher income households. By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin, raising concerns that the economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, {{the government}} announced plans to expropriate YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF's Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done his duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, {{as well as being}} a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF's economic growth.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, 2007, the Conservative {{government}} announced it had finalized free trade {{negotiations with the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Under this agreement, Canada increased its trade ties with Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2006, the value of trade between these partners was $10.7 billion. Canada had originally begun negotiations with the EFTA on October 9, 1998, but talks broke down because of a disagreement over <b>subsidies</b> <b>to</b> shipyards in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
