The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had been exposed to different types of music that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E

However, a {{physical}} education teacher suggested that she try wheelchair basketball, a sport <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of. Although she is a wheelchair basketball player, Adermann does not require a wheelchair for everyday activities, and is classified as a 4.5 point player, the lowest level of disability. Being able to move her body fully gives the [...] tall center a height advantage, but she found that shooting from the free throw line in a chair requires as much force as shooting standing from the three-point line.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of the English version of the anime stated that Naruto {{was the most difficult}} character to cast, adding that Maile Flanagan [...] "has Naruto down, from the mischievous side, that precocious twelve-year-old we learn to love, to the serious side". Flanagan avoided listening to Junko Takeuchi's performance as {{she did not want to}} imitate it, stating she wanted to develop her own voice for the character. Her performance has been praised as showing Naruto's brashness and later growth in confidence. [...] In a 2014 interview, Flanagan claimed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Naruto before her audition. She looked the show up after being chosen and felt the release of the English dub would be popular. She is recognized more for her work voicing Naruto than from other roles she has done in her career, although some fans did not expect that Naruto would be voiced by a woman.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{has stated}} [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{is not a}} {{reflection}} of her musically, as she preferred songs with more of an edge. She said the track was [...] "an all-American song" [...] and claimed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> a Jay-Z song in November 2009, an artist which the lyrics refer to. However, she did state she enjoyed Britney Spears' music, also mentioned in the song. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{was chosen as the}} lead single from The Time of Our Lives, as Cyrus thought personnel were [...] "picking up on it", although she did not expect for it to be commercially successful. The song was first played on radio stations on July 29, 2009, following a leak of the track on the Internet on July 28, 2009. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was officially released for airplay on August 3, 2009, and as a digital download on August 11, 2009.|$|E
500|$|In March 2012, {{eleventh}} season contestant of American Idol, Hollie Cavanagh, {{covered the}} song. Her performance received mixed reviews from the judges of the show, {{who said that}} she was [...] "a little pitchy" [...] and added that she seemed to be [...] "overthinking" [...] the song. Amy Reiter of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "her clear, crisp tone, crashed and burned on 'Honesty,' missing notes and losing her way". Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post was mixed about her performance writing, [...] "She was occasionally pitchy on this song, and seemed to be overthinking it in parts and allowing the song to overwhelm her... Unusually, she seemed both nasal and pitchy in the early parts of the performance... her choice of a pantsuit was completely baffling, since it made her look nearer 40 than 20." [...] Later, during an interview, Cavanagh revealed that she had difficulties singing the song because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> it before.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of her own attorney.

[...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death.

500|$|While McDonald {{observed}} a predominant R element, Russell felt the xx's music evoked the early hip hop records {{he listened to}} when he was young, as they were often limited to vocals, samples, and beats. Music journalists, however, inferred from xx that their influences were alternative rock acts such as Portishead, Young Marble Giants, and Cocteau Twins, the last of which Croft said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before the album was released. The Scotsman described xx as a minimalist, melancholic indie pop record that draws on elements from electronica and R, as well as The Cure and other alternative groups. According to Sarah Boden of The Observer, the album's unadorned, dream pop love songs are reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star, because they feature low tempos, moody melodies, and rhythms influenced by R and dubstep. Their arrangements have what Neil McCormick called [...] "a very British, industrial aspect", somewhat similar to the dub-inflected post-punk sound of English producer Martin Hannett and his work with the band Joy Division. Both Croft and Sim said their combination of seemingly disparate influences could {{have been attributed to}} the variety in each band member's music collection.|$|E

2500|$|Questions {{regarding}} {{the number of}} female One Life to Live viewers who have been raped {{and what kind of}} message One Life to Live was sending to their tween-girl demographic, a demographic they ranked #1 in, was noted. Lynn Parrish, a RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network) spokesperson for America’s largest anti-sexual assault organization, said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of a rapist and his victim falling in love and that if people are to believe a medium watched primarily by women and written for women, it is [...] "as common as the winter cold". Parrish stated that One Life to Live did not contact RAINN before telling the 2008 Todd and Marty storyline, but that ABC agreed to air a rape-themed PSA in the near future. Parish spoke of her feelings about the pairing. [...] "There is nothing romantic about rape," [...] she said. [...] "Whoever writes a romance between a rapist and its victim under any circumstances clearly doesn’t understand rape nor violence — and probably shouldn’t be writing about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E
