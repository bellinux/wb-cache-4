The screen size was increased from 15.0" [...] to 15.6" [...] {{from the previous}} 15 inch Book 9 and the resolution was upgraded from HD to FHD as well. It was announced as the world's first laptop PC to have native lossless audio up to 24bit/192 kHz, such as FLAC and ALAC, playback feature. Due to 48 kHz audio playback limitation of Windows operating system, a dedicated lossless audio player <b>software,</b> <b>S</b> Player+, was also developed and shipped with the product. It also marketed as having the longest battery running time of 14 hours in 15-inch class laptop computers. [...] This model also was a final contender to the throne at the Best of CE Show laptop category. Although announced in January 2014, it had not yet marketed, till end of May 2014.|$|E

40|$|Materials {{and methods}} DNA {{sequence}} design. DNA sequences for 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -helix ribbon systems, and 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -helix tube systems were designed and optimized using the SEQUIN <b>software</b> (<b>S</b> 1) and the TileSoft <b>software</b> (<b>S</b> 2) to minimize sequence symmetry (S 1). The other systems were designed using an unpublished sequence design {{component of the}} NUPACK server (www. nupack. org) to maximize the affinity and specificity for the target structures (S 3). Sometimes, manual optimization was further performed on selected regions. Sample preparation. DNA strands were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology, Inc.

40|$|Data integration, {{also called}} {{sometimes}} object-oriented interoperability, aims at adapting existing data structures and data instances to achieve software systems (application programs, development tools, etc) interoperability. In this paper, data integration {{is viewed as}} a process that attempts to build a subtype relationship between two data structures: a source one and a target one. The source data structure is the actual representation of data a <b>software</b> system <b>S</b> 1 has created and the target one is the data representation admitted as input by a <b>software</b> system <b>S</b> 2. The objective of the data integration process is to make S 1 's outputs conform to S 2 's inputs, i. e. object-oriented interoperability, as opposed to process-oriented interoperability, adapts data rather than the software system's code. The proposed process rst compares both the data structures, then it tries to restructure the source one into the target one. If the process is successful, the source data occurrence [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Inter-process {{communication}} and scheduling are notorious problem {{areas in the}} design of real-time systems. Using CASE tools, the system design phase will in general result in a system description in the form of parallel processes. Manual allocation of these processes to processors may result in error prone and/or slow communication code. Scheduling of the processes, necessary to meet timing constraints, is also a tedious task that takes many iterations. The described design tools result in code that is comparable in quality and performance with expert manual realization. Many network layers have been implemented to relieve the user from the low-level programming of communication software. However, the increase in user-friendliness is usually paid with performance degradation. The proposed approach combines user-friendliness with high performance by generating communication software that is tailor-made for the application. A similar approach is followed with the scheduling <b>software.</b> <b>S</b> [...] ...|$|E
