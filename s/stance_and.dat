5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one.

When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, {{even though he}} was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him. The ACLU later reversed their <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Osbert {{was opposed}} to the {{election}} of William fitzHerbert as Archbishop of York and supported William's rival and successor Henry Murdac. Although he remained a supporter of Murdac after 1147, he did oppose Murdac's interventions in Selby Abbey, where Murdac had deposed one abbot and appointed another. In 1153, Osbert deposed Murdac's choice as abbot of Selby and appointed another abbot. Originally, Osbert had supported Elias Paynel, Murdac's choice for abbot, but then changed his <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> helped with the deposition.|$|E

5|$|The Christians were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested {{the death penalty for}} those Catholics who helped the British, because it was a fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned the Christians, rather than killing them.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{invented the}} single and double wing formations, the three-point <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> the modern body block technique.

He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.|$|E

5|$|A {{monument}} to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the Italian artist Ettore Ferrari, {{stands in front}} of the University building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the Romanian Academy has instituted the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award—in 1880, it was awarded to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, for his Cuvinte den bătrâni, and worth 5,000 gold lei. Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the National Liberal Party, including Hasdeu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> his association with Junimea, as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of didacticism, and alleged cosmopolitanism. They thus refused to grant him the prize.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1917, {{divisions}} {{had begun}} appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other. Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganisation, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organisation. The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation {{in the war in}} 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly. Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded.|$|E
5|$|In Parliament, a {{political}} crisis {{developed over the}} king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, {{as part of a}} proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E

This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} began in February 1944. In contrast to the other aspects of Bodyguard, Graffham was planned and executed by the British, with no American involvement. Graffham's aim was to convince German intelligence that the Allies were actively building political ties with Sweden, in preparation for an upcoming invasion of Norway. It involved meetings between several British and Swedish officials, {{as well as the}} purchase of Norwegian securities and the use of double agents to spread rumours. During the war, Sweden maintained a neutral <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> it was hoped that if the government were convinced of an imminent Allied invasion of Norway this would filter through to German intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E

50|$|A highly-dynamic and combat-oriented martial art, Duan Quan {{focuses on}} short and compact routines, low <b>stances,</b> <b>and</b> quick movements.

Low <b>stances</b> <b>and</b> small but quick movements are major features of this style. The arms and legs are bent slightly. They also use simple and sudden moves and the techniques are executed smartly, wasting no energy. By practicing Duan Quan, students improve their physique as well as sharpen their instincts and skills in close-range combat.|$|R
5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's <b>stance,</b> <b>and</b> a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication <b>stance</b> <b>and</b> the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E
