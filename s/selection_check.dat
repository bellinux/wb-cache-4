Here we model catch data from the blue ling fishery off the northwest coast of Scotland, using Generalized Additive Mixed Models with a space time interaction represented via a novel tensor product of a soap film smooth of space with a penalized regression spline of time. The use of soap film smoothers avoids imposing correspondences between spatially adjacent areas that are in fact separated by the stock boundary. The comparison {{of the performance of}} the soap film smooth for space-time with that of a thin plate regression spline (TPRS) based on root mean squared prediction errors and k-means cross-validation suggests that in this application the former is better overall and in particular for modelling local changes.

Being field experiments, we had to work with these predetermined groups in both experiments. So, there was no chance of randomizing or matching the two groups in either experiment. However, we did prior testing on a criterion that was crucial to our study, i.e., programming skills. The groups were tested for equivalence {{on the basis of a}} prior quiz. Assignment of the treatment (“Prediction” vs. “Viewing”) to the groups in each experiment was done on a random basis.

40|$|Abstract—Low power {{listening}} (LPL) {{has been}} widely adopted to save energy in wireless sensor networks. However, LPL is ineffective in adapting to dynamic networks with asymmetric traffic patterns, as it sets a network-wide check interval. As a result, nodes with low data traffic waste significant energy resources doing idle listening. This problem is particularly exacerbated in multi-radio networks where majority of data comes through the most reliable radio and the duty cycles of other radios could be reduced. We address this issue in AutoSync, a protocol that combines synchronous LPL with automatic <b>selection</b> of <b>check</b> intervals to reduce energy consumption in both single and multi-radio networks. We first present the justification for AutoSync’s design, and we then discuss our implementation of AutoSync in TinyOS. We compare AutoSync against existing protocols in both simulations and empirical experiments. Results show that AutoSync attains {{a substantial increase in}} the operational lifetime and mean power consumption over existing protocols in single radio networks and even more in dual radio networks.
