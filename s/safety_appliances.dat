25|$|After {{reading an}} account of a gas attack by the German Army on Canadian and French troops at the Battle of Gravenstafel near Ypres on April 22, 1915, Garner {{hypothesized}} that chlorine gas had been used. Based on research he had performed while at the University of Chicago he believed that activated charcoal would adsorb the gas. After performing a successful test using two of his associates {{who were exposed to}} gas in a sealed room while wearing Dr. Garner’s gas mask, the results were turned over to the British government. In America thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliances</b> was a chief producer. His mask was later used widely in industry.|$|E
25|$|American chemist and {{inventor}} James Bert Garner {{is credited}} by American sources with {{the invention of}} the gas mask in April 1915. Reading a newspaper article describing a gas attack on British forces which he thought had employed chlorine gas, Garner remembered experiments he had performed while teaching at the University of Chicago, thus he set about creating the first gas mask, which he tested on two of his associates in a gas filled chamber. Following the success of the test, he provided the results to the British government. Also in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of gas mask was developed that dogs were trained to wear. Other gas masks were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines. In America thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliances</b> was a chief producer. This mask was later used widely in industry.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliance</b> Act is a United States {{federal law}} that made air brakes and {{automatic}} couplers mandatory on all trains in the United States. It was enacted on March 2, 1893, and took effect in 1900, after a seven-year grace period. The act is credited with {{a sharp drop in}} accidents on American railroads in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Once Congress {{passed the}} <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliance</b> Act in 1893, mandating {{conversion}} from the link and pin coupler to the Janney coupler, railroads in the United States {{had only a}} few years to implement the change. The railroads in North America, except for mass transit, form one unitary system, and uniformity of couplers is important for smooth interchange of rolling stock.|$|R

50|$|In a suit {{based upon}} the <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliance</b> Act of March 2, 1893, as amended April 1, 1896, the {{plaintiff}} is not called upon to negative the proviso of § 6 of said act either in his pleadings or proofs.

50|$|The basic {{principle}} behind the track circuit lies in the connection of the two rails by the wheels and axle of locomotives and rolling stock to short out an electrical circuit. This circuit is monitored by electrical equipment to detect {{the absence of the}} trains. Since this is a <b>safety</b> <b>appliance,</b> fail-safe operation is crucial; therefore the circuit is designed to indicate the presence of a train when failures occur. On the other hand, false occupancy readings are disruptive to railway operations and are to be minimized.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{development}} of locomotive-actuated train braking systems in the late 19th century, designated railroad employees known as brakemen would move about the tops of cars, setting hand brakes {{in an effort to}} stop the train in a timely manner. This process was imprecise and extremely dangerous. Many brakemen lost life and limb as a result of falling from a moving train, icy and wet conditions often adding to the hazards involved in negotiating the top of a swaying boxcar. In the U.S., an 1893 federal law, the Railroad <b>Safety</b> <b>Appliance</b> Act, required automatic brakes on all railroads, effective in 1900.|$|R
