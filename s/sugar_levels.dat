5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> are too low.|$|E
25|$|Basal insulin {{requirements}} {{will vary}} between individuals and periods of the day. The basal rate {{for a particular}} time period is determined by fasting while periodically evaluating the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Neither food nor bolus insulin must be taken for 4 hours before or during the evaluation period. If the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> changes dramatically during evaluation, then the basal rate can be adjusted to increase or decrease insulin delivery to keep the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> approximately steady.|$|R
40|$|Chemical, {{microbiological}} and organoleptical {{of yogurt}} using the different of percentage lactobacillus casei and <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> ABSTRACT. The {{objective of this}} study is to know quality of yogurt with variant of percentage Lactobacillus casei and <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> The parameter of this study were the crude protein applying the Kjeldhal method, the crude fat applying the Gerber method, the sum of amount of alive of micro-organism applying the plate count method and the organoleptic applying the square of. The result of this study showed that the different of <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> is significant (P 0, 05) on all parameter. The interaction is only found between two factors on crude fat. The highest of the rate amount of alive microorganism, crude protein and acetic acid are found in yogurt using 10 % L. casei and 15 % <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> From organoleptic test, it’s found that yogurt using 10 % L. casei and 15 % <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> is the most prevered kind of yogurt...|$|R
50|$|Normal value ranges {{may vary}} {{slightly}} among different laboratories. Many factors affect a person's blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> A body's homeostatic mechanism, when operating normally, restores the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> {{to a narrow}} range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79.2 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test).|$|R
5|$|In Germany, <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> or liver toxicity tests.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, a low blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> or a low glycemic food {{might be}} best treated with a bolus after a meal is begun. The blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> the type of food eaten, and a person's {{individual}} response to food and insulin affect the ideal time to bolus with the pump.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the dogs with moderate to serious illness coming for treatment at the Dog Ward of West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences, West Bengal, India, to find out possible correlation between fasting blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> with breed, sex and age of dogs. The study result implicated that the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> was not having any general tendency to increase with advancement of age of ailing dogs. The blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> of ailing dogs was higher in small breeds of dogs, particularly in 0 to < 4 year age group. The large breeds showed highest <b>level</b> of <b>sugar</b> in blood in disease condition at above the age 12 years or more. The blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> of ailing dogs had a gender bias, as it was found more in females than males in all breeds and age groups...|$|R

5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and <b>sugar</b> <b>levels.</b> This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different water contents achieved by Annona emarginata (Schltdl.) H. Rainer seeds during immersion in GA 3 solutions, in variation of soluble <b>sugars</b> <b>levels</b> and germination. Seeds with 10 % of initial water content were submitted to imbibition in GA 3 solutions with concentrations of 0; 250; 500; 750 and 1000 mg L- 1 and when they reached the water content of 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 % and 35 %, the quantification of soluble <b>sugars</b> <b>levels</b> and germination test were performed. Seeds immersed up to they reach 15 % of water with GA 3 and immersed up to the water acquisition of 20 % without GA 3, presented higher soluble <b>sugars</b> <b>levels</b> and germination percentage, which were decreased when the seeds reached 30 % and 35 % of water, independently of the presence of the plant growth regulator. It was conclude that different water contents reached by the seeds in immersion treatments with GA 3 affect the soluble <b>sugars</b> <b>levels</b> and germination percentage of Annona emarginata seeds. Thus, in treatments with Annona emarginata, the seeds must remain immersed in water without GA 3 up to they reach 20 % of water, as higher water contents (35 %) reduce the soluble <b>sugars</b> <b>levels</b> and the seed germination percentage...|$|R
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{patients}} with diabetes mellitus (DM) in year 2001 was 5. 6 million. In the year 2020, {{it is expected to}} reach 8. 2 million. The diet of DM patients in Pulorejo village comprised low calorie, sugar free, and low fiber diet. Fiber consumed by these patients was taken from vegetables and banana. Unfortunately, the use of such diet keep the patient's blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> remains increasing. The content of water-soluble fiber (pectin) in apple is higher and is able to reduce blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of  apple consumption on blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Method: This study was used a quasy-experimental pre-post test purposive sampling design. Samples who met to the inclusion criteria were 14 persons divided into treatment and  control group. Data were analyzed by using Paired t-Test  (α= 0. 05) and Independent t-Test  (α= 0. 05). Result: The result showed that there was an effect of apple consumption on blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> with Paired t-Test (p= 0. 000) for blood glucose level before and after intervention in treatment group, and (p= 0. 100) for blood glucose level before and after intervention in control group. The results of Independent t-Test revealed p= 0. 000 for blood glucose level after intervention in treatment and control groups. Discussion:  It’s can be concluded that there was an effect of apple consumption on blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> in DM patients. The apple should be given in the best dose that can reduce blood <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> which is 2 x 150 g. The result of this study can be considered in as a material for diet promotion for the patients. Further studies should be developed to measure the variables of stress and sex of the patients...|$|R
