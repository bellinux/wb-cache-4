5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), {{it is believed}} to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's hydrosphere.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until {{the advent of the}} Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E

5|$|M. l. leucopterus is {{restricted}} to Dirk Hartog Island, off the western coast of Australia, and nuptial males display black-and-white plumage. This subspecies is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three and bears a proportionally longer tail. It was collected again in 1916 by Tom Carter, 98years after de Freycinet's expedition collected the type specimen.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E

5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and testing was farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service, the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western border {{surveillance}} organisations. Its personnel {{served as a}} liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. The BFS was disbanded in 1991 following Germany's reunification.|$|E

5|$|The {{south-eastern}} red-tailed black cockatoo subspecies C. b. graptogyne {{is listed}} as endangered on Schedule 7 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 of South Australia. and is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species. Though a June, 2012 count of approximately 1500 individuals is a notable increase from the 2007 count of just 1000, it remains in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The total {{capacity}} of Valley Parade is 25,136. The largest stand is the JCT600 Stand, which holds 9,004 supporters, {{followed by the}} Kop, which has a capacity of 7,492. The Midland Road Stand holds 4,500, and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five stands with a capacity of 1,840. The stadium includes 134seats for media representatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera.

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{wallabies}} in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise the <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E

Sōninkan had decorations {{only at the}} collar, sleeves, sides, and <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back. Hanninkan had decorations only at the collar and sleeves. Chokuninkan used embroidery in spiraling patterns resembling lightning (raimon) at <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ornamentation and <b>the</b> fringe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coat. Sōninkan and hanninkan used plain solid lines in these areas.|$|R

5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|Metis has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, {{which makes it}} the second <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E
