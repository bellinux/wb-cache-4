This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or <b>social</b> <b>construction.</b> Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> on political decision making. Ann Schneider and Helen Ingram argue that <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> affect policy design. For instance, they assert that powerful, positively constructed groups often receive policy benefits, while powerless, negatively constructed groups tend to receive fewer policy benefits and are more likely to face punitive measures with regard to public policy. In the present study, focusing on Schneider and Ingram 2 ̆ 7 s theory, media rhetoric and legislative discourse were examined to determine whether <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> played a role in the decision process of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (ADAA). Newspaper reports and legislative hearings on the ADAA yielded similar results in terms of how the 2 ̆ 2 crack cocaine problem 2 ̆ 2 was publicly constructed. Crack cocaine, the drug that receives the harshest penalties under the ADAA, was largely associated with a negatively constructed group, poor African Americans, in the press as well as in the legislature. These results are discussed in relation to media influence, the power of <b>social</b> <b>constructions,</b> and legislative decision making. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} with a {{group of}} male drink drivers how the <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> they held about themselves as drinkers, drivers or drinking drivers and the personal rules they developed to avoid offending contributed to or hindered their offending. Fifty male convicted drink drive offenders, who had attended a rehabilitation course, subsequently were interviewed on the basis of self-recorded drinking of at least 40 + units of alcohol per week. This study seeks to understand the sense people made of the events leading to their offending. The study did not confirm assumptions that drink drive offenders were all heavy consumers of alcohol, problem drinkers, persistent offenders or drivers who regularly drove when drunk. The majority claimed they had not wanted to offend and that they had actively developed personal rules to avoid drinking above the limit and then driving. The factors that led to the breakdown of these rules were explored. This raised questions about the intentions, expectancies and <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> that constituted these drivers' desire not to offend. The study tried to discern such <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> and the part they played in bringing about the offence. The study has shown that the person's understanding of his drinking patterns and styles is critical to not offending, as are some constructions that commonly define 'drinking' and 'driving'. In the absence of accurate information about alcohol or the law, people relied on these <b>social</b> <b>constructions,</b> but limited by their personal feelings. There were too many inaccurate factors in their constructions, understandings and behaviour to avoid offending. Public policy, as one shaper of <b>social</b> <b>constructions,</b> is discussed and some findings for future policy suggested. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

25|$|The Second Sex, first {{published}} in French as Le Deuxième Sexe, turns the existentialist mantra that existence precedes essence into a feminist one: “One is not born but becomes a woman.” With this famous phrase, Beauvoir first articulated {{what has come to}} be known as the sex-gender distinction, that is, the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes.

Differences in health status, health outcomes, life expectancy, and many other indicators of health in different racial and ethnic groups is well documented, referred to as health disparities.

Although this relationship can vary depending on the definitions used, race is generally used in the context of health research as a fluid concept to group populations of people according to various factors that include {{but are not limited to}} ancestry, social identity, visible phenotype, and genetic makeup. Determinants of health include environmental, social, and genetic factors, as well as the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.|$|E

25|$|The hypodescent <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> {{related to}} the racial caste that was {{associated}} with African slavery and {{the conditions of the}} slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790–1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supporters}} of PMS {{as a social}} construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD {{is a product of}} brain chemistry, and PMS is a product of a hypochondriatic culture. Most studies on PMS and PMDD rely solely on self-reporting. According to sociologist Carol Tavris, Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. The anthropologist Emily Martin argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop, and thus is a <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> that contributes to learned helplessness or convenient excuse. Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness. The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. In both cases, they are referring to the emotional aspects, not the normal physical symptoms that are subjectively present.|$|E
25|$|Sociology {{of law is}} {{a diverse}} field of study that {{examines}} the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as criminology. The institutions of <b>social</b> <b>construction,</b> social norms, dispute processing and legal culture are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called law and society studies; in Europe it is more {{often referred to as}} socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts. Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.|$|E
