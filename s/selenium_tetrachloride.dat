40|$|Prostaglandin (PG) D 2 {{has been}} {{proposed}} to be essential for the initiation and maintenance of the physiological sleep of rats because intracerebroventricular administration of <b>selenium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (SeCl 4), a selective inhibitor of PGD synthase (PGDS), was shown to reduce promptly and effectively the amounts of sleep {{during the period of}} infusion. However, gene knockout (KO) mice of PGDS and prostaglandin D receptor (DP 1 R) showed essentially the same circadian profiles and daily amounts of sleep as wild-type (WT) mice, raising questions about the involvement of PGD 2 in regulating physiological sleep. Here we examined the effect of SeCl 4 on the sleep of WT and KO mice for PGDS and DP 1 R and that of a DP 1 R antagonist, ONO- 4127 Na, on the sleep of rats. The i. p. injection of SeCl 4 into WT mice decreased the PGD 2 content in the brain without affecting the amounts of PGE 2 and PGF 2 α. It inhibited sleep dose-dependently and immediately after the administration during the light period when mice normally sleep, increasing the wake time; and the treatment with this compound resulted in a distinct sleep rebound during the following dark period. The SeCl 4 -induced insomnia was observed in hematopoietic PGDS KO mice but not at all in lipocalin-type PGDS KO, hematopoietic and lipocalin-type PGDS double KO or DP 1 R KO mice. Furthermore, the DP 1 R antagonist ONO- 4127 Na reduced sleep of rats by 30 % during infusion into the subarachnoid space under the rostral basal forebrain at 200 pmol/min. These results clearly show that the lipocalin-type PGDS/PGD 2 /DP 1 R system plays pivotal roles in the regulation of physiological sleep...|$|E
