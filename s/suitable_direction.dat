The fault just now, is perhaps to consult the books too rigidly, and to trust too little to invention; for no architecture, and especially no domestic architecture, can ever be above serious reproach, until climate, the uses of the edifice, and the situation, are respected as leading considerations. Nothing can be uglier, per se, than a Swiss cottage, or any thing more beautiful under its precise circumstances. As regards these mushroom temples, which are the offspring of Mammon, let them be dedicated to whom they may, I should exactly reverse the opinion, and say, that while nothing can be much more beautiful, per se, nothing can be in worse taste, than to put them where they are." ...|$|E

50|$|The IOR rule {{encouraged}} wide short boats {{with limited}} stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, {{combined with a}} high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided {{a significant proportion of}} stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard.

40|$|The {{problem of}} reconstructing finite subsets of the integer lattice from X-rays {{has been studied}} in {{discrete}} mathematics and applied in several fields like image processing, data security, electron microscopy. In this paper {{we focus on the}} stability of the reconstruction problem for some special lattice sets. First we prove that if the sets are additive, then a stability result holds for very small errors. Then, we study the stability of reconstructing convex sets from both an experimental and a theoretical point of view. Numerical experiments are conducted by using linear programming that support the conjecture that convex sets are additive with respect to a set of <b>suitable</b> <b>directions,</b> and consequently the reconstruction problem is stable. The theoretical investigation provides a stability result for lattice sets. It is used to prove the following property: if a sequence of lattice convex sets have X-rays in <b>suitable</b> <b>directions</b> which converge to X-rays of a convex body, then it converges to this convex body...|$|R

In the late 16th century, they were superseded by the [...] "lectern" [...] type, rectangular with a mono-pitched roof sloping fairly steeply in a <b>suitable</b> <b>direction.</b> Phantassie Doocot is an unusual example of the beehive type topped with a mono-pitched roof, and Finavon Doocot of the lectern type is the largest doocot in Scotland, with 2,400 nesting boxes. Doocots were built well into the 18th century in increasingly decorative forms, then the need for them died out though some continued to be incorporated into farm buildings as ornamental features. However, the 20th century saw a revival of doocot construction by pigeon fanciers, and dramatic towers clad in black or green painted corrugated iron can still be found on wasteland near housing estates in Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|E
5000|$|Moses Kellow, who {{was born}} in on 5 June 1862 at Delabole, Cornwall, close to one of the largest slate {{quarries}} in Britain. His parents moved to Caernarfon some three years later, and besides his school education, his father trained him in engineering and geology. By the age of 20, around 1882, he was managing Parc Quarry. Slate in the Blaenau Ffestiniog region is generally found in veins which slope downwards at an acute angle from the horizontal, resulting in the quarries being underground once the initial surface rock has been removed. The veins are separated by layers of harder rock, often granite or chert, which are called [...] "hards". The slate vein worked at Parc Quarry was about 121 ft thick, and sloped downwards at about 42 degrees. Unusually, the pillaring line, one of the planes in which rock can be split, was almost horizontal rather than vertical, and the foot joints did not run in a <b>suitable</b> <b>direction</b> to detach slate blocks from the floor of a chamber. Additionally, the rock above the vein was not hard enough to support the roof of large chambers. Because of this, Kellow's father, William, decided in 1880 to work the quarry from the bottom upwards, rather than adopting the more normal practice of working from the top downwards.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{reconstruction}} of special lattice sets from X-rays when some convexity constraints are imposed on the sets.

For this purpose we present the notion of Q-convex lattice sets for which there are unique determination by X-rays in <b>suitable</b> <b>directions,</b> and a polynomial-time reconstruction algorithm.
