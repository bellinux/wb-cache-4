5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E

25|$|A finite set of {{parameters}} {{that determine}} syntactic variability amongst languages; e.g., a binary parameter that determines {{whether or not the}} subject of a <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be overtly pronounced (this example is sometimes referred to as the Pro-drop parameter).|$|E

25|$|Acceptability {{is about}} the {{performance}} of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As stressed by Chomsky, acceptability does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be grammatical, a grammatical sentence {{does not need to}} be acceptable. For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be to a certain extent conventionalised.|$|E

If the legislative power of the Union can reach them, it must be for national purposes; it must be where the power is expressly given for a special purpose, or is clearly incidental to some power which is expressly given.|$|E
500|$|All the manuscripts {{described}} above share a chronological error between the years 756 and 845, {{but it is}} apparent that the composer of the Annals of St Neots was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them. Æthelweard's copy did have the chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885; all the surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence. [...] Hence the error and the missing <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> have been introduced in separate copying steps, implying that none of the surviving manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version.|$|E
50|$|The law {{specifies}} {{exactly what}} categories of crimes fall under it, mandates that offenders {{be sentenced to}} the law's maximum allowable extent for the committed felony, and states that the mandatory <b>sentences</b> <b>must</b> be completed consecutively to any additional <b>sentence</b> an offender <b>must</b> serve.|$|R
5000|$|Atomic <b>sentences</b> <b>must</b> be logically {{independent}} of each other. In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals. Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.|$|R

2500|$|On March 17, 2009, Hein's {{sentence}} was commuted by Governor Schwarzenegger, from life without {{possibility of parole}} plus four years, to 29 years to life {{with the possibility of}} parole.

2500|$|... {{sentences}} {{have the}} special property {{that if they}} are false, that fact will be provable in any of the usual formal systems. This is because the falsity amounts to the existence of a counter-example which can be verified by simple arithmetic. So if a [...] sentence is such that neither it nor its negation is provable in one of these systems, that <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be true.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} antipassive {{construction}} is often {{to make certain}} arguments available as pivots for relativization, coordination of sentences or similar constructions.

2500|$|Everett {{has also}} {{concluded}} that because Pirahã {{does not have}} number-words for counting, does not allow recursive adjective-lists like [...] "the green wealthy hunchbacked able golfer", and does not allow recursive possessives like [...] "The child's friend's mother's house", a Pirahã <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> have a length limit. This leads to the additional conclusion {{that there is a}} finite number of different possible sentences in Pirahã with any given vocabulary.|$|E
2500|$|Second, {{certain parts}} of the <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be {{replaced}} with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression [...] "all Ps are Qs" [...] shows the logical form common to the sentences [...] "all men are mortals", [...] "all cats are carnivores", [...] "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on. [...] The schema can further be condensed into the formula A(P,Q), where the letter A indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.|$|E
2500|$|Notice {{that truth}} never gets defined for {{sentences}} like This sentence is false, {{since it was}} not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are [...] "ungrounded." [...] Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the Principle of bivalence: every <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the Liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Scalia {{theorized that}} {{reasonableness}} review can be only procedural and not substantive. [...] This conclusion {{flows from the}} Sixth Amendment requirement that any fact legally necessary to support a <b>sentence</b> <b>must</b> be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury. [...] If a sentence is upheld as substantively reasonable, {{it could have been}} the product of judicial factfinding, even if those facts yielded a sentence within a guidelines range. [...] That holding would, in Scalia's view, violate the rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey. [...] Since the Sixth Amendment would curtail judicial factfinding in some cases, and Congress intended for a uniform standard of review to apply, there could be no substantive review of sentences for reasonableness.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{sentences}} that the Tunica language produces: simple, compound, and complex. Simple <b>sentences</b> <b>must</b> contain only one predicative word. Compound sentences have two or more main clauses. Complex sentences have a main clause and {{one or more of}} the different types of subordinate clauses that are mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|A complex {{sentence}} has {{one or more}} dependent clauses (also called subordinate clauses). Since a dependent clause cannot {{stand on its own}} as a <b>sentence,</b> complex <b>sentences</b> <b>must</b> also have at least one independent clause. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus one or more dependent clauses is called compound-complex or complex-compound.|$|R
