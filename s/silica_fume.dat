40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on {{the influence}} of different amounts of polyacrylic ester and <b>silica</b> <b>fumes</b> on the mechanical properties of mortar such as the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, bonding strength, and abrasion resistance are presented in this article. The results show that the compressive and splitting tensile strength of mortar can be improved with the addition of polyacrylic ester and <b>silica</b> <b>fumes.</b> Results obtained from both the direct tensile bond test and flexural bond test indicate that the addition of polyacrylic ester and <b>silica</b> <b>fumes</b> improves the bond strength significantly, and the enhancement is more obvious with polyacrylic ester paste as interfacial adhesives. Furthermore, mortar incorporation of polyacrylic ester and <b>silica</b> <b>fumes</b> shows superior abrasion resistance compared to the control mortar. Therefore, the correct combination of polyacrylic ester and <b>silica</b> <b>fumes</b> to produce mortars has been shown to have synergistic effects, which results in excellent properties including high bond strength and superior abrasion resistance.

25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated blast furnace slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, and <b>silica</b> <b>fume,</b> a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} multipurpose grease using red gypsum from titanium dioxide manufacturing wastes. Greases produced with different amount of <b>fume</b> <b>silica</b> (FS) and red gypsum in its compositions. The effect of red gypsum’s and <b>fumed</b> <b>silica’s</b> concentrations on the formulated greases has been studied. The grease mixture is formulated using silicone oil as base oil, <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> and red gypsum as thickener, molybdenum disulphide as additive and iron octoate as anti-oxidant agent. Amount of <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> involves 2 - 20 % wt (2 % wt, 7 % wt, 16 % wt and 20 % wt). All the <b>fume</b> <b>silica</b> proportions covered (70 % gypsum, 30 % FS), (60 % gypsum, 40 % FS) and (50 % gypsum, 50 % FS). The testing (penetration test, type of thickener, dropping point test, and amount of oil separated) have been done on the formulated greases to determine the properties. It was discovered that formulated grease has no dropping point until 260 o C which proves that the greases has stable structure at higher temperature. All the formulated greases proved to be composed of non-melt thickener type. As the amount of <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> and red gypsum increase oil separation decreases and {{the consistency of the}} greases increases. The penetration also significantly decreases as <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> addition increases. This is due to the larger strength and small size of <b>fumed</b> <b>silica.</b> The larger strength of <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> was thought to be due to the structure being knit together by means of primary valence bonds. It can be concluded that the formulated grease is multi purpose grease. Higher the amount of <b>fumed</b> <b>silica</b> and gypsum (thickener), better the grease’s quality. Therefore, the formulated greases has high potential to be used in wide range of industries such as the cars, ships, aircrafts and most of the industries that deals with heavy duty equipments...|$|R
