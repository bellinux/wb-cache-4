Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and greater horseshoe bat. Maintenance work is timed to fit in with hibernating and mating schedules, and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors may <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the property's bats on a closed-circuit television system.|$|E
5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|The site reopened to {{the public}} on 1 July 2010. As well as {{presenting}} {{a history of the}} V-weapons and of the site, the museum enables visitors to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels and a mock-up of the HDP gun. The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.|$|E

5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

It contains garden birds, a wren's nest and a tawny owl. This display plays birdsong recordings, which young children can learn quickly. This serves as an introduction to pishing.|$|E
25|$|It is in Quimper's cathedral {{that one}} can <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Dargent's {{greatest}} works. The cathedral's history goes back to 1424 {{and it was in}} 1887 that Mgr. Sergent decided to commission one artist to decorate the walls of the cathedral. He chose Dargent who painted frescoes for the nine principal chapels completing twenty murals spread over these nine chapels each having two paintings and two smaller chapels having just one painting.|$|E

The STE sported digital instruments and other electronics as well as a more powerful V-6 and retuned suspension. Later iterations would <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the first introductions on Pontiacs of anti-lock brakes, steering wheel mounted radio controls and other advanced features.|$|E
25|$|The {{future of}} life on earth depends on our ability to take action.

Surely {{we have a responsibility to}} leave for future generations a planet that is healthy, inhabitable by all species.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the trial, Adams resigned from the National Health Service and was convicted in Lewes Crown Court on 26 July 1957, on eight counts of forging prescriptions, four counts of making false statements on cremation forms, and three offences under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951 and fined £2,400 plus costs of £457. His licence to prescribe dangerous drugs was revoked on 4 September and on 27 November he was struck off the Medical Register by the GMC. Adams continued to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his more loyal patients, and prescribed over-the-counter medicine to them.|$|E

25|$|Historically, many {{military}} {{orders and}} other chivalric orders were founded {{in association with}} the Holy See. Most of them became extinct, were suppressed, or merged with contemporary chivalric orders. Some of them survived under the protection of the Holy See as in the list above. A few of them remained as patrimony of dynastic royal houses. Some of these dynastic orders of knighthood were recognised as Roman Catholic by Papal bulls of the Holy See, and although they are no more directly affiliated with or protected by the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them are still exclusively designated for Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Day/night cricket, {{also known}} as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under {{floodlights}} in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} situation in Singapore was stable. The PAP had a 15-year monopoly in parliament during 1966 to 1981, winning all seats in elections before J. B. Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won the Anson constituency in a 1981 by-election. The PAP rule is termed authoritarian by activists who <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the regulations of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights, perceiving them as authoritarian. This has been the greatest complaint about the PAP by the opposition parties so far, the Workers' Party of Singapore and the Singapore Democratic Party being two of the prominent opposition parties who accuse the PAP of authoritarianism.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the marble floor. (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.|$|E
25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park to <b>see</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On {{the way to the}} campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E
