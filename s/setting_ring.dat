5000|$|Prong <b>setting</b> {{engagement}} <b>rings</b> {{are sometimes}} referred to as Tiffany <b>setting</b> <b>rings,</b> although this is a trademarked term specifically used to describe prong <b>setting</b> <b>rings</b> sold by Tiffany & Co.

50|$|The {{cryptanalyst}} {{now knew}} the plugboard, the rotor order, and the absolute {{setting of the}} rotors for the doubled key, {{but he did not}} know the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> He also knew what the message key setting should be, but that setting was useless without knowing the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> could be anything, and that meant the Poles did know how to position the rotors for the message body. All the work up to this point had focussed on exploiting the doubled key. To determine the <b>ring</b> <b>setting,</b> the attention now shifted to the actual message.|$|R
50|$|Master and <b>setting</b> <b>ring</b> gauges {{includes}} gauge blocks, master {{or setting}} discs, and setting rings are types of master gauges used to calibrate or set micrometers, optical comparators, or other gauging systems. Working gauges {{are used in}} the shop for dimensional inspection and periodically checked against a master gauge.|$|E
50|$|The fuse {{is set for}} a {{predetermined}} time by rotation of a time ring in {{the lower part of}} the fuze. On firing, set-back causes the time-train firing pin to function. This initiates the powder in the time-train ring and ignites the safety powder pellet, freeing the impact firing pin. Thus the fuze will function on impact if impact occurs before expiration of the set time. The time-setting can be eliminated altogether by turning the <b>setting</b> <b>ring</b> off the scale. It should be noted that the fuze is not interchangeable with fuzes used in other 8 cm mortar ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|Lynx {{stayed at}} battle stations, with Japanese planes {{reported}} overhead and “suicide boats at {{large in the}} anchorage,” through the mid watch on 28 April 1945, her sailors noting “considerable rifle fire from nearby ships...presumed to be shots fired at possible suicide demolition boats.” With receipt of a Flash White at 04:16, the ship secured from general quarters and ceased making smoke, the continued discharging cargo into lighters alongside. Two more Flash Reds occurred during the day, 16:05-16:46 and beginning at 19:32, with a 3 in/50 caliber shell, identified afterwards by the fuse <b>setting</b> <b>ring</b> found on deck, exploding near Lynxs port beam at 21:40 “throwing shrapnel about the decks and causing a slight facial injury to one man.” ...|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} cameras {{have the}} match-needle instrument coupled directly to aperture and shutter speed <b>setting</b> <b>rings</b> on the lens tube instead {{to a separate}} analog calculator. This is the most convenient way of match-needle instrument usage, especially when the meter's scale is mirrored into the viewfinder.|$|R

50|$|Category theory formalizes {{mathematical}} {{structure and}} its concepts {{in terms of}} a collection of objects and of arrows (also called morphisms). A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object. The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as <b>sets,</b> <b>rings,</b> and groups.|$|R
5000|$|A single <b>set</b> of <b>ring</b> {{stations}} {{would result}} in a very intermittent flow. It is possible to smooth this flow out by using multiple <b>sets</b> of <b>ring</b> stations, with each set operating in a different stage of the Huff-n-Puff cycle at any given moment so that there is always one ring [...] "squeezing". This would also smooth out the power requirements of the system over time.|$|R

2500|$|Category theory formalizes {{mathematical}} {{structure and}} its concepts {{in terms of}} a labeled directed graph called a category, whose nodes are called [...] objects, and whose labelled directed edges are called [...] arrows (or morphisms).

25|$|Herivel's great insight {{came to him}} {{one evening}} in February 1940 while he was {{relaxing}} {{in front of his}} landlady's fire. Stressed or lazy operators who had <b>set</b> the <b>rings</b> when the rotors were in the machine might then have left <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> at or near the top and used those three letters for the first message of the day.|$|R
5000|$|Molecular Borromean {{rings are}} the {{molecular}} counterparts of Borromean rings, which are mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures. In 1997, biologists Chengde Mao and coworkers of New York University succeeded in constructing a <b>set</b> of <b>rings</b> from DNA. In 2003, chemist Fraser Stoddart and coworkers at UCLA utilised coordination chemistry {{to construct a}} <b>set</b> of <b>rings</b> in one step from 18 components.

Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942. In 1944, Commander William Bateman Leeds, Jr., millionaire son of the inventor of a tin plating process and friend of George Mauboussin, purchased the diamond for his wife, Reflexion Olive Leeds (born Olive Hamilton), {{and gave it to}} her in a <b>set</b> <b>ring</b> as a sixth anniversary present.|$|R

On which occasion the bells were <b>set</b> <b>ringing</b> at Skipton; there were also bonfires, illuminations, and other demonstrations of joy." ...|$|R
25|$|The ground setting (GKX in {{the above}} example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel {{reasoned}} that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they might simply use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine. If {{that was the first}} message of the day and the operator had <b>set</b> the <b>ring</b> settings with the rotors already inside the machine, the rotor position currently showing on the machine could well be the <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> itself or be very close to it. (If that situation occurred {{in the above}} example, GKX would be the <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> or close to it).|$|R

50|$|Henri {{has fallen}} in love with Germaine, {{although}} she is only a servant in his household. He orders Grenicheux to confess his deception, but not to reveal the name of the actual rescuer. Germaine overhears their conversation. Henri asks Germaine to be his wife, but she demurs, believing that a servant cannot marry a Marquis. Gaspard, recovering his senses, remorsefully declares that his pretended niece is the rightful Vicomtesse de Lucenay (and Serpolette only a gypsy orphan), and so the Marquis may wed Germaine. Henri forgives Gaspard, Serpolette takes Grenicheux, and all ends happily, as the bells of Corneville are <b>set</b> <b>ringing.</b>|$|R
