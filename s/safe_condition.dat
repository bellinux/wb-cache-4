60|$|Nevertheless, {{inconvenient}} {{though the}} condition was, our friend Disco Lillihammer was so afflicted with astonishment {{at what he}} heard and saw in this new land, that he was constantly engaged in swallowing flies and running his canoe among shallows and rushes, insomuch that he at last resigned the steering-oar until familiarity with present circumstances should tone him down to a <b>safe</b> <b>condition</b> of equanimity.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Enderton seemed endeavoring {{to satisfy}} himself that {{everything}} about the running-gear of the coach was in a <b>safe</b> <b>condition.</b> He examined the wheels, the axles, and the whiffletrees, much to the amusement of the driver, who remarked {{to me that the}} old chap probably knew as much now as he did before. I was rather surprised that my father-in-law subjected the driver to no further condemnation. On the contrary, he said nothing except that {{for the rest of this}} down-hill drive he should take his place on the driver's unoccupied seat. Nobody offered any objection to this, and up he climbed.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this leads}} me to another thing, and that is, to tell thee, O thou blind Pharisee that thou canst not be in a <b>safe</b> <b>condition,</b> because thou hast thy {{confidence}} in the flesh, that is, in the righteousness of the flesh. For [...] "all flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field": and the flesh and the glory of that being as weak as the grass, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, is but a weak business {{for a man to}} venture his eternal salvation upon. Wherefore, as I also hinted before, the godly-wise have been afraid to be found in their righteousness, I mean their own personal righteousness, though that is far better, than can be the righteousness of any carnal man: for the godly man's righteousness is wrought in the spirit and faith of Christ; but the ungodly man's righteousness is of the flesh, and of the law. Yet I say, this godly man is afraid to stand by his righteousness before the tribunal of God, as is manifest in these following particulars.|$|E
