The dissociative recombination occurred in a sustained discharge {{in the presence of}} a variable magnetic field and discharge voltage, at pressures of 5 - 15 mTorr. Under different conditions various excited states were observed ranging from the lowest 3 s metastable states to higher Rydbcrg states within 0. 000 54 eV of the dissociation limit. From their narrow widths, it is deduced that these higher states arose from Ne 2 + ions with <b>subthermal</b> <b>energies.</b> From two of these narrow distributions, we obtain an improved value for the dissociation limit D 0 (Ne 2 +) = 1. 26 ± 0. 02 eV...|$|R
