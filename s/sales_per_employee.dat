30|$|Lastly, the {{independent}} variable Demand Structure represents expectations of demand for skilled workers in the future. The skills demand is a derived demand resulting from the market demand for goods produced and services performed. We use the industry volatility, i.e., the <b>sales</b> fluctuations <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> for a specific industry in either West or East Germany, {{as a proxy for}} a firm’s production strategy and competitive situation. A high volatility thereby shows that industry sales can continuously vary on a large scale. To permanently meet the unpredictable demand for skills, workers need to be functionally flexibly employable with correspondingly high and broad qualifications. 14 Because it is difficult to replace highly specialized skills with temporary work, firms build a large inventory of skilled workers in advance by training apprentices. 15 In contrast, in case of stable market conditions (as present e.g. in the public service sector), the risk for lost business opportunities is lower since sales and underlying demand for skilled workers are comparably predictable. Therefore, these firms build a smaller inventory of skills.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT All seed rms in six EU {{countries}} were surveyed in May 1999 {{to determine how}} seed development budgets were distributed across three crop development technologies and the eÚects {{of the type of}} technology in use on employment, sales and exports. The results indicate that an evaluation of the economic consequences of an emergent technology such as genetic engineering should both consider the eÚect of competitive alternative technologies and survey all rms within the sector, rather than focusing on a subset of high technology rms. Only about 10 % of the combined 1999 research budget of European seed rms was spent on genetic engineering, although this should increase to about 15 % by 2002. Alternative technologies to develop new plant varieties, such as conventional plant breeding and conventional breeding combined with techniques that were developed for genetic engineering, are considerably more important economically. In fact, there is no diÚerence in expected employment and <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> development <b>employee</b> by the type of technology in use, while export rates are highest among rms that combine conventional plant breeding with advanced techniques...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the direct and}} interaction effects of IT investments and IS department efficiency on different facets of firm performance. Specifically, measures for financial, sales, and intermediate firm performance are considered. IS budget {{is used as a}} measure of IT investment; asset turnover and labor productivity are used as intermediate performance measures; and <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> IS <b>employee</b> and income <b>per</b> IS <b>employee</b> are used as measures of IS department efficiency. Secondary sources were used to construct a database of 210 firms, which was used for statistical analysis. Our results suggest that; (i) IS budget is not related to financial firm performance, but is positively related to sales performance; (ii) The results for intermediate performance were mixed; (iii) IS efficiency had no impact on the relationship between IS budget and firm performance measures, except market share. Analysis of the results suggest that the effect of IT investments should be assessed simultaneously on both aggregate and intermediate performance. Furthermore, IS departments with 'high' efficiency may be unable to better leverage each additional dollar spent on IT. This has significant implications for organizations considering radical downsizing and elimination of their IS departments, as in the process they could reduce their conversion effectiveness. information systems technology productivity cost benefit analysis investment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence on how German multinational firms have restructured their service activities around the recent crisis. Making {{use of new}} micro-level data on service imports of German multinationals from 2002 - 2008, we assess the determinants of service offshoring along the extensive and intensive margins. In particular, we evaluate how internal frictions {{in terms of a}} sharp drop in the <b>sales</b> level (<b>per</b> <b>employee)</b> and external frictions in terms of a reduced availability of credit co-determine the likelihood and the extent of sourcing services from abroad. First, we find that firms are less likely to start to import services from abroad if they are under cost pressure. By contrast, firms intensify existing service imports linkages in times of a sales drop. Second, financial constraints, which played a major role for the goods trade during the crisis, did not have any significant effect on service imports. These results are in line with the argument that the generally observed crisis-resilience of service trade stems from increased pressures to save on variable costs through offshoring and from its lower dependence on external finance. Furthermore, and in line with our argument, we find that a decline in sales and labor productivity induces firms to sort into intra-firm rather than arm's-length trading...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} in examining job security and job stability {{has been driven}} {{in part by the}} phenomenon of downsizing. The distinctiveness of downsizing, as opposed to more traditional layoffs, is that the job cuts do not necessarily appear to be driven by shortfalls in demand but instead appear to be driven by the search for operating efficiencies. Despite the {{interest in}} downsizing, there has been essentially no serious investigation into its causes. I distinguish downsizing from job cuts associated with shortfalls in demand and find that employment and management practices over which employers have control, such as severance pay and profit sharing, are important predictors of subsequent downsizing and more general job losses. Surprisingly, excess operating capacity is not necessarily related to more general job losses at the establishment level. I also examine the relationship between both job losses associated with shortfalls in demand and downsizing and subsequent financial performance. The results suggest, among other things, that downsizing reduces labor costs per employee but also <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> Job cuts associated with excess capacity appear to be somewhat more successful at improving <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> than is downsizing. ...|$|E

The study was undertaken {{to learn more about the}} resource dependency role performed by directors of publicly traded companies and how board members representing important environmental dimensions can affect firm performance. ^ This study sought to answer four research questions: (1) Does greater coverage of the general environment factors by outside board members affect firm performance? (2) Does the number of industry representatives on the board affect firm performance? (3) Does the number of affiliated directors on the board affect firm performance? and (4) Is there a relationship between board size and firm performance? ^ The study included four independent variables: (1) coverage of the general environment by outside board members, (2) number of industry representatives on the board, (3) the number of affiliated directors on the board, and (4) board size. The dependent variables for the study were four balanced scorecard-related corporate performance indicators: (1) return on equity, (2) market share, (3) <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> and (4) profit margin. The dependent variables lagged the independent variables by one, two, and three years. ^ The results of data gathered on fifty firms in the computer industry suggest that boards do perform a resource dependency role, serving as an interface between the firm and its environment. First, coverage of the general environment by outside board members has some significant positive effects on profit margin. Second, the number of industry representatives is unrelated to the performance indicators studied. Third, the number of affiliated directors is significantly related to market share, <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> and profit margin. Lastly, board size is significantly and positively related to <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> ^ This study indicates that corporate boards can have an impact on corporate performance beyond serving as a control on management hegemony.

The independent variable in this study was employment security and the dependent variables were <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> net income as a percentage of sales, assets and equity, employee absenteeism, and employee length of service. Two data sources were used: financial data was collected from the Fortune 500 listings of U.

The statistical techniques used to test the hypotheses included t tests and regression analysis. ^ Many of the results were inconclusive and mixed. There {{was no significant difference in}} employee productivity, as measured by <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> when comparing companies that practice employment security with those that do not.
