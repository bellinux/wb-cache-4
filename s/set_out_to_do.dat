5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|The Occurian {{with the}} {{greatest}} influence on the story is , {{one of the primary}} antagonists of Final Fantasy XII, who rebels against the other Occuria and tries to give the people of Ivalice the power to not be manipulated by the Occuria; for its defiance it is labeled a heretic. Venat taught Doctor Cid the secrets of nethicite, allowing them to manufacture it themselves; it also convinced Cid and Vayne to seek out the nethicite shards originally cut from the Sun-Cryst by Raithwall. In the game, Venat is seen talking to Cid both while visible and not. Venat's ambitions were ultimately fulfilled when Ashe resisted the Occurians' plans and Reddas destroyed the Sun-Cryst, later sacrificing itself to give Vayne his power while proclaiming they will die together, as it has accomplished everything it <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It was voiced by Anita Carey and Narumi Tsunoda for the English and Japanese versions of the game.|$|E

50|$|The plot {{centers around}} {{the murder of a}} prostitute in a crime-ridden low-income city neighborhood. Dismayed by the general {{indifference}} the police and neighbors show toward the murder, a resident who knew the prostitute <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his own investigation of the case.|$|R
25|$|In If I'm Lucky (1946), her {{follow-up}} {{film for}} Fox {{when she was}} no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily-accented English, comic malapropisms, and bizarre hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox expired on January 1, 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda's ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which she <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Copacabana (1947, an independent production for United Artists with Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her new image.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that {{he went on the}} mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name. They accomplished everything they <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with great success, which indicates {{that the two of them}} worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{said that}} he {{originally}} planned to stay at Syracuse {{for two to three}} seasons, but having already accomplished everything he <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft. Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team.|$|E

Imagine an industry that consistently fails <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what it <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> a factory where this year's product is invariably sleazier than last year's but, nevertheless, better than next year's." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Good Schools Guide {{called it}} [...] "an {{impressive}} school which <b>does</b> what it <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well", also noting {{that it was}} [...] "likely to increase in popularity because of its location and increasingly sparkly achievements", while The Times described it as [...] "an elite boys' boarding school".|$|R
5000|$|Star Trek creator Gene Roddenbery {{insisted that}} the two shows could not be compared. He {{was more of a}} philosopher, while {{understanding}} that Irwin Allen was a storyteller. When asked about Lost in Space, Roddenberry acknowledged: [...] "That show accomplishes what it <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Star Trek is not the same thing." ...|$|R
25|$|Their second {{film was}} Dead Presidents in 1995. Dealing {{with the black}} {{underclass}} society like their feature film debut, and also starring Larenz Tate, the film centered on war veterans during the racially charged Vietnam War era. The film, which was released at the New York Critics Film Festival, failed to make {{as much of a}} profit as their first film. They followed Dead Presidents with American Pimp, a feature-length documentary about the underground pimp culture and exploitation of women. It premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. They had originally <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an adaptation of Iceberg Slim's novel Pimp, but someone else acquired the rights. The brothers have stated that the film's perspective was partially shaped by being raised by their mother, who is a feminist. In between projects, they filmed several anti-handgun public service announcements.|$|E
25|$|Husserl never {{claimed that}} {{mathematics}} could {{or should be}} grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology {{as an alternative to}} set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his Selected Logic Papers. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

In the film, Anton tells Patty that his mother died when she was visiting Dresden.|$|R

500|$|In 2005, he <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a sequel, Ultimate Chicken Story, {{which he}} {{intended}} to be [...] "the most hysterically ridiculous story about chickens ever written." [...] He {{spent more than a}} year researching chickens before he began writing, and the idea became more serious as he explored it, developing into [...] "an opportunity to tell a story that isn't really about chickens, but of humanity in general, and how we treat each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Clark {{recalls that}} [...] "Paul Fox {{gave us a}} tiny budget ... and we <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a full-blooded drama on location. Budgets were really tiny, and we shot for ten days and brought the film in for about 8,000 pounds." [...] Unusually for a BBC {{television}} drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film. As a result, the cameraman John McGlashan, who filmed the first five adaptations, {{was able to make}} use of night shoots and dark, shadowy interiors, which {{would not have been possible}} with the then-standard video-based studio interiors.|$|E
500|$|On April 10, 2014 it was {{announced}} that the real-life Colbert would be replacing David Letterman as the host of CBS's The Late Show in 2015. It was also announced that The Colbert Report would be ending and Colbert would not be using the character on CBS show. Following the announcement, the character made a special surprise appearance on the April 23, 2014 episode of The Daily Show to report that it has become clear to him that he has [...] "won television" [...] and changed the world, the goal he originally <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and thus no longer feels the need to continue. He expressed interest in taking over The Late Show after Letterman retired but could not because [...] "they already gave it to some fat guy".|$|E
50|$|In this largely fictionalized film, agent Melvin Purvis {{is placed}} in charge of running down notorious killer Machine Gun Kelly, and <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just that. The film script is loosely based on Kelly's 1933 actual {{kidnapping}} of an Oklahoma petroleum executive, but the names and places are changed. The film does accurately depict Kelly as a weak man who is dominated by his ambitious wife.|$|R

500|$|On the game's community, Adams said, [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's {{one of the things we}} <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|Rice's {{novels are}} popular among {{many members of}} the LGBT community, some of whom have {{perceived}} her vampire characters as allegorical symbols of isolation and social alienation. Similarly, a reviewer writing for The Boston Globe observed that the vampires of her novels represent [...] "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe." [...] On the subject, Rice herself commented, [...] "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood." ...|$|E

It was decided that for the opening, the dignitaries and guests would assemble in Liverpool, and eight of the L's locomotives would haul them in special trains to Liverpool Road railway station, the railway's Manchester terminus. A number of covered railway carriages [...] "resembling the most luxurious of road coaches", with cushioned seating and cloth linings and each capable of carrying between 12 and 24 passengers, were provided for the more important persons among those attending. More basic open carriages, described by an observer as [...] "plain homely unadorned butter-and-egg sort of market carts", each carried 60 passengers. Cabinetmaker James Edmondson was commissioned to design a special carriage for the Duke of Wellington and his companions, described by Egerton Smith as: ...|$|E

5000|$|After epigraphs from William Blake and Peter Porter, Kermode begins: [...] "It is not {{expected}} of critics as it is of poets that they should help us {{to make sense of}} our lives; they are bound only to attempt the lesser feat of making sense {{of the ways in which}} we try to make sense of our lives." [...] This is what he then <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the book.|$|R

They know that once he gets on their trail, they will be fortunate indeed if they escape him.|$|R
500|$|According to twelfth-century monk Guibert of Nogent, William was [...] "powerful in words, {{but less}} so in action...a man who <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things too great for him." [...] William {{was a member}} of the French {{contingent}} which marched into Spain in 1087 to assist Alfonso VI of Castile with the siege of Tudela against the Almoravids. He may have been one of the leaders, along with Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy, who was the nephew of Alfonso's wife Constance. The French army never made it to Tudela and withdrew with little success. Guibert says that William [...] "retreated like a wretch, leaving countless men stranded by his flight." [...] William's actions in Spain may have been the inspiration for the character of Ganelon in the Chanson de Roland, which was possibly written in the early twelfth-century, based on similar events that had occurred during the reign of Charlemagne centuries earlier.|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although {{he comes from a}} typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs, Andrew Grant Jackson {{considers}} that with [...] "Give Me Love", Harrison [...] "captured {{the essence of}} what he had <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the [...] concerts – and what the Beatles had tried to do in their more idealistic moments". Describing it as Harrison's [...] "finest plea to God", with a vocal that [...] "perfectly suits the yearning" [...] implicit in the lyrics, Jackson adds: [...] "'Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)' stands alongside 'All You Need Is Love,' 'Let It Be,' and 'Imagine' as the purest expression of the Aquarian Age dream." [...] In his Harrison obituary for The Guardian in December 2001, former Melody Maker critic Chris Welch concluded with a reference to the track, saying that the ex-Beatle's [...] "feelings and needs were best expressed in one of his simplest songs – 'Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)'".|$|E
