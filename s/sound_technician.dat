5|$|Mega Mendoeng was {{directed}} by Boen Kin Nam for Union Films, a production house based out of Batavia (now Jakarta) which was run by Tjoa Ma Tjoen and financed by Ang Hock Liem. A <b>sound</b> <b>technician</b> by training, Mega Mendoeng was Boen's only full directorial credit. Liem served as producer. The film was announced in September 1941 and produced concurrently with Soeara Berbisa (Venomous Voice), a film on which Boen acted as assistant director. Mega Mendoeng was completed by December 1941, after Soeara Berbisa.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{production}} of Union Films, Soeara Berbisa {{was produced by}} Ang Hock Liem and directed by R Hu, an ethnic Chinese director {{who had worked for}} the company since 1940; the <b>sound</b> <b>technician</b> Boen Kin Nam served as assistant director. The screenplay was written by Djojopranoto, who replaced Union's former screenwriter Saeroen after the latter left for rival company Star Film following Wanita dan Satria (1941). The film began production by September 1941, and by October it was nearly complete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Music is {{ever present}} {{in our daily}} lives, {{establishing}} a link between humans and the arts through the senses and pleasure. <b>Sound</b> <b>technicians</b> are the link between musicians and audiences or consumers. Recently, general concern has arisen regarding occurrences of hearing loss induced by noise from excessively amplified sound-producing activities within leisure and professional environments. Sound technicians' activities expose them {{to the risk of}} hearing loss, and consequently put at risk their quality of life, the quality of the musical product and consumers' hearing. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure among <b>sound</b> <b>technicians</b> in Brazil and compare this with a control group without occupational noise exposure. Methods This was a cross-sectional study comparing 177 participants in two groups: 82 <b>sound</b> <b>technicians</b> and 95 controls (non-sound technicians). A questionnaire on music listening habits and associated complaints was applied, and data were gathered regarding the professionals' numbers of working hours per day and both groups' hearing complaint and presence of tinnitus. The participants' ear canals were visually inspected using an otoscope. Hearing assessments were performed (tonal and speech audiometry) using a portable digital AD 229 E audiometer funded by FAPESP. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the <b>sound</b> <b>technicians</b> and controls regarding age and gender. Thus, the study sample was homogenous and would be unlikely to lead to bias in the results. A statistically significant difference in hearing loss was observed between the groups: 50 % among the <b>sound</b> <b>technicians</b> and 10. 5 % among the controls. The difference could be addressed to high sound levels. Conclusion The <b>sound</b> <b>technicians</b> presented a higher prevalence of high frequency hearing loss consistent with noise exposure than did the general population, although the possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured factors such as socioeconomic status cannot be ruled out. </p...|$|R

5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan <b>sound</b> <b>technician</b> Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete {{for the love of}} a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after shooting for Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.|$|E
5|$|The project {{presented}} {{a variety of}} specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional <b>sound</b> <b>technician</b> was hired to design the interior. He proposed a shoebox auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Opéra designed by Charles Garnier.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, {{who handled}} the {{cinematography}} for nearly all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as <b>sound</b> <b>technician,</b> Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E

500|$|Gaven {{has had a}} {{prominent}} career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told TheaterWeek in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that [...] "the nature {{of rock and roll}} is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and do it at the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, {{you run the risk of}} losing the impact." [...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano." [...] Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a <b>sound</b> <b>technician</b> at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that [...] "We always turn off the mikes when you sing" [...] because she did not need amplification.|$|E

He learns a means for disrupting Hundred's powers and utilizes it in pursuit of his cause of extremist animal rights. He goes on to draw out Hundred; however, Hundred turns his powers against him, resulting in his death by mauling by a pack of dogs, followed by an explosion which brings part of a building down on him. Despite this, Kremlin asserts that Pherson is still alive.
