Two types of heat exchanger designed to preheat the <b>suction</b> <b>air</b> and the heating is accomplished by both engine cooling water and exhaust gases.

Although the image quality, <b>suction,</b> <b>air</b> insufflation, and lens washing in UT-EGD {{have been reported to}} be inferior to those in conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD), the former procedure is associated with reduced gag reflex and is better tolerated than the latter. Several large studies have shown that transnasal endoscopy is safe, well tolerated, and less risky than P-EGD, which requires sedation in most western countries. Moreover, UT-EGD induces less sympathetic stimulation and less oxygen desaturation compared with P-EGD. Use of an ultrathin endoscopy, an alternative choice to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, is helpful in patients with gastrointestinal stenosis and is a convenient method for postpyloric feeding tube placement. However, nasal anesthetic methods, techniques of scope insertion and withdrawal from the delicate nasal cavity, and therapeutic applications may be difficult to learn without proper training, even for an experienced endoscopist...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{experimentally}} verified the partial-fill effect in a multi-cycle pulse detonation rocket engine (PDRE). Intermittent thrust of a PDRE {{was measured by}} using a spring-damper mechanism that smoothes this intermittent thrust in the time direction. The intermittent mass flow rates were assessed by gas cylinder pressure or mass difference measurement. The maximum specific impulse was 305 Â± 9 seconds at an ethylene and oxygen propellant fill fraction of 0. 130 Â± 0. 004. When the fill fraction was greater than 0. 130, the specific impulse was increased as the partial fill fraction was decreased. When the fill fraction was less than 0. 130, the specific impulse was sharply decreased as the partial fill fraction was decreased. This decrease was due to diffusion between propellant and purge gases and for the short length of the transition from deflagration to detonation. The multi-cycle pulse detonation rocket engine has a partial-fill effect that may be mainly due to the <b>suctioned</b> <b>air</b> and {{is consistent with the}} single-cycle partial-fill model of Endo et al.

The effect of the suction ratio and the angle of attack (AOA) of wind also were investigated. The result showed that the aerodynamic drag force was influenced by the uniform suction through either upper surface or lower surface of the box girder.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and impact}} of implementing a laminar flow control system on a supersonic transport configuration were investigated. A hybrid laminar flow control scheme consisting of suction controlled and natural laminar flow was developed for a double-delta type wing planform. The required suction flow rates were determined from boundary layer stability analyses using representative wing pressure distributions. A preliminary design of structural modifications needed to accommodate suction through a perforated titanium skin was carried out together with the ducting and systems needed to collect, compress and discharge the <b>suction</b> <b>air.</b> The benefits of reduced aerodynamic drag were weighed against the weight, volume and power requirement penalties of suction system installation in a mission performance and sizing program to assess the net benefits. The study showed a feasibility of achieving significant laminarization of the wing surface by use of a hybrid scheme, leading to an 8. 2 percent reduction in the cruise drag.

40|$|At high altitudes, {{power of}} an {{internal}} combustion engine reduces due to air density reduction. In turbocharged diesel engine this issue affects {{the performance of the}} compressor and can result in unstable operation of the turbocharger if the power is not decreased by engine actuator. Mainly for testing the effects of altitude in the test room, air throttle valve and combustion air handling unit were used to reduce the <b>suction</b> <b>air</b> pressure. Easier and cheaper solution to consider effect of altitude on engine performance is to mask part of the air filter to reduce the suction pressure. In this paper, pressure drop against 0 %, 26 %, 52 %, 66 % and 74 % of air filter holeâ€™s masking for different mass flow rates has been studied by computational fluid dynamics. The analysis output mass flow rate-pressure diagram for the air filter, will be used as input data in the GT-Power software which is a one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics software and the effect of masking on altitude and performance at different revolutions per minute of the engine is investigated. Also, an experimental and computational fluid dynamics study was carried out to predict altitude against different proportions of air filter holeâ€™s masking at 1000 rpm.

40|$|The {{key issues}} {{addressed}} this quarter {{were related to}} operational problems in the coal feed system, namely, the inability to accurately measure all of air entering the system, and plugging of coal in the feed lines due to poor entrainment. Both of these problems caused unacceptable uncertainty and/or fluctuations in the operating conditions and therefore required solutions. The coal entrainment problem was solved by installing a new educator designed for entraining solids in gas streams. All of the air entering the reactor now flows through the educator, either as motive air or through the <b>suction</b> <b>air</b> inlet. This ensures that the coal is entrained at relatively high velocity, {{so that it will}} flow to the reactor without forming slugs in the lines. A new feeder shroud was also installed with an air jet directed towards the auger to sweep off the tip in order to reduce pulsations when feeding coal. The problems associated with accurately metering the air have been somewhat more difficult to resolve. New strategies for completely closing the system have been tested and look promising. A new flowmeter was also purchased with cost sharing funds to directly measure the air flow rate of the two phase stream (after the coal injection point). If the system can be operated without leaks, then the changes will provide two independent measurements of the air flow to ensure accuracy. If the system cannot be sealed, the new flowmeter will still provide reliable measurement of the air flow and permit proper operation of the combustor. Consequently, we feel that the problems have been resolved {{and we look forward to}} a productive next quarter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> occurs at <b>air</b> vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R
