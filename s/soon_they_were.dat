5|$|Estimated {{numbers of}} Calusa at the {{beginning}} of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the Yamasee to the north. They asked the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. <b>Soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> relocated again to the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> exchanged at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{first arrived}} in Southern Italy in 1015 from {{northern}} France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As they were paid with lands, <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.|$|E

5|$|Preece {{moved to}} push his other {{companies}} around each flank of D Company, and towards the battalion's original blocking position. <b>Soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also in contact with small groups of Viet Cong from positions behind trees and in bunkers, while others popped up from spider holes and tunnel entrances; it became apparent to the Australians that they had stumbled across a significant Viet Cong force in extensive fortifications, sufficient to hold a battalion. B Company, {{under the command of}} Major Ian McFarlane, also uncovered a small dug-in hospital with simple transfusion equipment, documents and bandages. Meanwhile, the remaining battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade had also been inserted. The 1st Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment flew into LZ April at 12:00, while US 2/503rd Battalion arrived at LZ May at 14:30. With the insertion going largely according to plan, the brigades began their advance eastwards. Converging on the suspected location of the communist headquarters, a thorough search of the area yielded little, and it was believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn earlier in response to the initial Australian advance.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals, or Grits, {{maintained}} {{power in}} the 1851 election, but <b>soon,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did {{much of the work}} of putting the government together and served as Attorney General. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Though {{the most powerful man in}} the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché as premier.|$|E
5|$|Trautloft noticed {{three of}} {{a flight of}} six intercepting Hurricanes of No. 32 {{squadron}} higher than the escorts, attempting to intercept the bombers. <b>Soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> joined by four squadrons of British fighters: No. 56 Squadron, No. 111 Squadron, No. 64 Squadron and No. 74 Squadron. Oesau was able to claim three Spitfires. Two 7./JG 51 aircraft crash landed in France. British losses show that no Spitfire was lost or destroyed in the ensuing battle. Only one No. 32 Hurricane, piloted by Pilot Officer Higgs, was destroyed in a collision {{with one of the}} Do 17s and only one other Hurricane was damaged. It is possible Oesau was responsible for damaging Higgs' Hurricane, causing him to lose control. Two Spitfires landed with light damage while a third was also slightly damaged and force-landed at RAF Manston. Over claiming of enemy losses was rife on both sides during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. <b>Soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

25|$|The Arab Aghlabid emirate in Ifriqiya {{remained}} the dominant {{state in the}} region, and the Rustamid's neighbors. Nonetheless the Aghlabids proved unable to dislodge these remnant Kharijites. <b>Soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> obliged to recognize Rustamid rule in the pre-Sahara region of the eastern Maghrib.

25|$|Although {{the threat}} was over {{by the end of}} the year, the Guards {{remained}} a feature of the country's communist structure. They became a permanent addition to the regular military, and compulsory training was introduced for young men and women.

The Congolese called this new music rumba, although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted {{in the establishment of}} several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.|$|E
25|$|In November 1856 Barnet Burns and {{his wife}} went to Leicester to deliver a course of lectures on New Zealand.

By January 1857 Barnet Burns had recovered sufficiently to be able to lecture accompanied, as usual, by Rosina on the musical glasses. Further funds were raised from an edition of Burns' booklet published at Leicester.|$|E

Huizenga and associate John Melk utilized techniques from their waste business to rapidly expand Blockbuster, and <b>soon</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> opening a new store every 24 hours.
