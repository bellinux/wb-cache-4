5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human <b>schistosoma,</b> Fairley investigated bovine <b>schistosoma,</b> which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck is host {{to several}} parasites. The most notable helminths {{found in the}} bohor reedbuck are Carmyerius papillatus (in the rumen), Stilesia globipunctata (in the small intestine), Trichuris globulosa (in the caecum), Setaria species (in the {{abdominal}} cavity), Dictyocaulus species (in the lungs) and Taenia cysts (in the muscles). Other parasites include <b>Schistosoma</b> bovis, Cooperia rotundispiculum, Haemonchus contortus, species of Oesophagostomum, Amphistoma and Stilesia. The common ticks found on the bohor reedbuck are Amblyomma species and Rhipicephalus evertsi.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus <b>Schistosoma,</b> which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schistosoma</b> species (the organisms causing Schistosomiasis) is {{associated}} with bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{parasite}} <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni (which these snails {{and other}} Biomphalaria snails carry) infects about 83.31 million people worldwide.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{speculation}} {{into what}} physiological benefits IgE contributes, and, so far, circumstantial evidence in animal models and statistical population trends have hinted that IgE {{may be beneficial}} in fighting gut parasites such as <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni, but {{this has not been}} conclusively proven in humans. Epidemiological research shows that IgE level is increased when infected by <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni, Necator americanus, and nematodes in humans. It is most likely beneficial in removal of hookworms from the lung.|$|E
25|$|Another agent, mefloquine, {{which has}} {{previously}} been used to treat and prevent malaria, was recognised in 2008–2009 to be effective against <b>Schistosoma.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{parasite}} <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni the whole mir-71/mir-2 cluster has been duplicated, {{and one of}} the copies is in the sexual chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{encounter}} larvae of the <b>Schistosoma</b> parasite {{when they}} enter contaminated water while bathing, playing, swimming, washing, fishing or walking through the water.|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis is {{the unique}} {{intermediate}} host of <b>Schistosoma</b> japonicum, which causes schistosomiasis endemic in the Far East, {{and especially in}} mainland China. Oncomelania hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range.|$|E
25|$|Biomphalaria glabrata is an {{intermediate}} snail host for the trematode <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni, {{which is one}} of the main schistosomes that infect humans. This snail is a medically important pest, because of transferring the disease intestinal schistosomiasis, the most widespread of all types of schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|Male {{menstruation}} is a {{term used}} colloquially for a type of bleeding in the urine or faeces of males, reported in some tropical countries. It is actually caused by parasite infestation of the urinary tract or intestines by <b>Schistosoma</b> haematobium, and cases of it are actually schistosomiasis, formerly known as bilharziasis.|$|E
25|$|At CDC, a {{combination}} of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for antibody detection. All serum specimens are tested by FAST-ELISA using S. mansoni adult microsomal antigen (MAMA). A positive reaction (greater than 9 units/µl serum) indicates infection with <b>Schistosoma</b> species. Sensitivity for S. mansoni infection is 99 percent, 95 percent for S. haematobium infection, and less than 50 percent for S. japonicum infection. Specificity of this assay for detecting schistosome infection is 99 percent. Because test sensitivity with the FAST-ELISA is reduced for species other than S. mansoni, immunoblots of the species appropriate to the patient's travel history are also tested to ensure detection of S. haematobium and S. japonicum infections. Immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific and so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species. The presence of antibody is indicative only of schistosome infection at some time and cannot be correlated with clinical status, worm burden, egg production, or prognosis. Where a person has traveled can help determine what <b>Schistosoma</b> species to test for by immunoblot.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Dr. Iain McInnes et al. {{found that}} arthritic-induced mice {{experienced}} less inflammation and other arthritic effects when infected with ES-62, a protein derived from filarial nematodes, {{a kind of}} parasitic worm. Similarly, in the International Journal for Parasitology, Dr. Osada et al. published their experimental findings that arthritis-induced mice infected with the parasitic worm <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni had down-regulated immune systems. This led to resistance to arthritis.|$|E
25|$|A serendipitous {{discovery}} {{was made in}} China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against a wide range of trematodes, including <b>Schistosoma</b> japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|Haemozoin is a {{disposal}} product {{formed from}} the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites. These hematophagous organisms such as Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), Rhodnius and <b>Schistosoma</b> digest haemoglobin and release high quantities of free heme, {{which is the}} non-protein component of hemoglobin. A heme is a prosthetic group that consists of an iron atom contained {{in the center of}} a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. Free heme is toxic to cells, so the parasites convert it into an insoluble crystalline form called hemozoin. In malaria parasites, hemozoin is often called malaria pigment.|$|E
25|$|Swimmer’s itch {{probably}} {{has been around}} as long as humans. The condition was known to exist {{as early as the}} 1800s, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a biologist found that the dermatitis was caused by the larval stage of a group of flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae. The genera most commonly associated with swimmer’s itch in humans are Trichobilharzia and Gigantobilharzia. It can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as Schistosomatium douthitti, which infects snails and rodents. Other taxa reported to cause the reaction include Bilharziella polonica and <b>Schistosoma</b> bovis. In marine habitats, especially along the coasts, swimmer’s itch can occur as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of hemozoin in other blood-feeding organisms {{is not as}} well-studied as in Plasmodium. However, studies on <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni have revealed that this parasitic worm produces large amounts of hemozoin during its growth in the human bloodstream. Although {{the shapes of the}} crystals are different from those produced by malaria parasites, chemical analysis of the pigment showed that it is made of hemozoin. In a similar manner, the crystals formed in the gut of the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus during digestion of the blood meal also have a unique shape, but are composed of hemozoin. Hz formation in R. prolixus midgut occurs at physiologically relevant physico-chemical conditions and lipids {{play an important role in}} heme biocrystallization. Autocatalytic heme crystallization to Hz is revealed to be an inefficient process and this conversion is further reduced as the Hz concentration increases.|$|E
25|$|Infected {{individuals}} release <b>Schistosoma</b> {{eggs into}} water via their fecal material or urine. After larvae hatch from these eggs, the larvae infect {{a very specific}} type of freshwater snail. These larvae undergo {{the next phase of}} their lifecycle in these snails, spending their time reproducing and developing. Once this step has been completed, the parasite leaves the snail and enters the water column. The parasite can live in the water for only 48 hours without a human host. Once a host has been found, the worm enters its blood vessels. For several weeks, the worm will remain in the vessels, continuing its development into its adult phase. When maturity is reached, mating occurs and eggs are produced. Eggs enter the bladder/intestine and are excreted through urine and feces and the process repeats. If the eggs do not get excreted, they can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions and organ damage.|$|E
25|$|Microscopic {{identification}} of eggs in stool or urine {{is the most}} practical method for diagnosis. Stool examination should be performed when infection with S. mansoni or S. japonicum is suspected, and urine examination should be performed if S. haematobium is suspected. Eggs can {{be present in the}} stool in infections with all <b>Schistosoma</b> species. The examination can be performed on a simple smear (1 to 2mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed intermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by repeated examinations and/or concentration procedures. In addition, for field surveys and investigational purposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the Kato-Katz technique (20 to 50mg of fecal material) or the Ritchie technique. Eggs {{can be found in the}} urine in infections with S. haematobium (recommended time for collection: between noon and 3 PM) and with S. japonicum. Quantification is possible by using filtration through a nucleopore filter membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane. Tissue biopsy (rectal biopsy for all species and biopsy of the bladder for S. haematobium) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative.|$|E
500|$|Schistosomiasis (also {{known as}} bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever), a disease {{caused by the}} fluke worm <b>Schistosoma,</b> is [...] "second only to malaria as the most devastating {{parasitic}} disease in tropical countries. An estimated 200 million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease– 100 million in Africa alone." [...] The parasite has 13 known species, two of which infect humans. The parasite itself is not a mollusc, but all the species have freshwater snails as intermediate hosts.|$|E

2500|$|Socially monogamous {{species are}} {{scattered}} throughout the animal kingdom: A few insects, a few fish, about nine-tenths of birds, and a few mammals are socially monogamous. There is even a parasitic worm, <b>Schistosoma</b> mansoni, that in its female-male pairings {{in the human body}} is monogamous. [...] The diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species.|$|E

2500|$|Immunoglobulin E (IgE) {{is a type}} of {{antibody}} (or immunoglobulin (Ig) [...] "isotype") {{that has}} only been found in mammals. IgE is synthesised by plasma cells. Monomers of IgE consist of two heavy chains (ε chain) and two light chains, with the ε chain containing 4 Ig-like constant domains (Cε1-Cε4).

[...] Parasitic effects of Hepatitis B virus, however, are contested—some studies show little association, while others show exacerbation of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{that leaves}} {{the body of a}} healthy person is close to being sterile and {{requires}} much less treatment for pathogen removal than feces or fecal sludge. However, a contamination of urine with fecal pathogens is possible if the UDDT is not used correctly, i.e. when some fecal matter finds its way into the urine compartment. Also, for a few specific diseases, the relevant pathogens may be found in the urine; for example: Leptospira interrogans, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, <b>Schistosoma</b> haematobium, BK virus or Simian virus. The Ebola virus may also be found in urine from an infected person.
