500|$|When Sarah Waters was 19 years old, {{she joined}} a student house in Whitstable, Kent, sharing {{a bed and}} then {{falling in love with}} another young woman. They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, [...] "It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense—quite special." [...] In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD {{dissertation}} on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women's suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read. Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. She said to herself at the time, [...] "there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> lesbian history than that".|$|E
500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise than you would have with a nice princess or a prince ... where you have to be ever so careful with the draftsmanship".|$|E
500|$|When Lavigne first gained publicity, she {{was known}} for her tomboyish style, in {{particular}} her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing [...] "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing [...] "old, crumpled T's". In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the [...] "pop punk princess" [...] and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the [...] "anti-Britney", {{in part because of}} her less commercial and [...] "real" [...] image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. [...] "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [...] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was [...] "wearing a costume". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. [...] "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Good Evening Europe, Nissen explained the EP has songs that {{mean a lot to}} her [...] "with personal feelings attached to them and they are uplifting and feel good". She said, [...] "All songs I've written... I have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> music <b>to</b> give and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> music <b>to</b> share. I'm sure all the Eurovision fans are going to love it." ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was well}} known she disliked large parties. Peter Townsend said of her [...] "She possessed classic, serene good looks and sincerity shone from her mild face. But she was painfully shy, so that {{conversation}} with her was sometimes halting and unrewarding, for you felt that she had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say, but could not bring herself to say it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{made more}} of an impact in the List A {{campaign}} where he played 12 matches and took 9 wickets at 45.77 regularly bowling in tandem with fellow left handed fast bowler, Chris Liddle. In November 2011, Sussex announced that Naved Arif had signed a new one-year contract with Sussex. Naved stated, [...] "I want {{to say thank you}} to Sussex for keeping faith in me. I know I have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> give the team in 2012 and I aim to establish myself as a regular". Cricket manager, Mark Robinson said, [...] "I’m delighted that Naveed has agreed to come back for another year. Despite his age, he is still in many ways inexperienced. He is still learning and has got lots more to give." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to this, members of certain deathcore bands {{do not take}} a liking to being labeled [...] "deathcore". In an interview with vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain about the deathcore label, he said [...] "Deathcore is the new nu-metal. [...] It sucks. And if anyone calls us 'deathcore' then I might do something very bad to them." [...] While {{in an interview with}} Justin Longshore from Through the Eyes of the Dead about the deathcore label, he said [...] "You know, I really hate that term. I know we've been labeled as that but I think there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> our music than just a mixture of death metal and hardcore (sic) even though we incorporate those elements in our music. To me it seems that is just the new and fresh thing that kids are following." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would have}} made your company <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{valuable}} <b>to</b> us, for we are terribly badly off for listeners. Perhaps you don't like music?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I to understand," [...] {{she said}} with cold disdain, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{effective}} <b>to</b> wound than hot passion, [...] "that you are offering me your love? Your--love?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! My {{dear old}} man, nobody minds {{a little thing}} like that. We can't be stilted and formal. It's ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{friendly}} <b>to</b> relax and be chummy." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 6 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Turner would return to the soap to reprise her role as Stacey, and would begin filming in January 2014. Turner was quoted as saying: [...] "I may have left EastEnders over three years ago but the show has always been in my heart, as has Stacey, and she has never really left my side. I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's been a while since I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl. It was confirmed that Stacey will return to EastEnders once filming has finished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I will, Louise," [...] said Suzette. They kissed {{each other}} as if in formal {{ratification}} of their compact, which meant <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> one of them than it could to the other.|$|E
6000|$|She considers, for {{she is so}} {{sure that}} she must know the answer better than he. 'I suppose {{it is just that}} a son is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> a mother than to a father.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; Mr. Finn {{is one of}} them. Is it not awful? <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> dreadful <b>to</b> me {{than the}} other poor man's death! One oughtn't to say so, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really think}} Miss Robarts has managed very well," [...] said the dean. [...] "Mrs. Crawley must be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{comfortable}} <b>to</b> {{think that they}} are out of danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} could you do, Mark?" [...] said his wife. [...] "Men on such {{occasions}} are almost worse than useless; {{and then they}} are <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> liable <b>to</b> infection." ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel's brow had {{contracted}} to a frown; {{her lips were}} parted in pale, vague wonder. She was trying to follow; there seemed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> follow than she could see. [...] "Pansy's not my husband's child then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you do, my love," [...] {{said the}} skeleton, {{with a world}} of pride in his voice; [...] "but you mustn't feel bad about it, for every pound you gain makes you worth just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the show." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{wondered}} if {{the man who had}} given her the beautiful bauble, that had meant <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> him than the intrinsic value which he had not even known could ever have meant to him, was back in his savage forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, if you {{can catch}} her. She will be ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> good <b>to</b> you than I; and I only hope she will warn you what a Tartar I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a bit," [...] he said, [...] "except that it {{will make}} all you people <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> decent <b>to</b> Virginia. Come along round to Claridge's and be introduced. There's just time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, anyway, {{the colonel}} has got old Lacy to wait another day," [...] whispered Randy. [...] "That {{will give us}} just <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> time <b>to</b> get on the track of what Martell and Brown have been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I don't {{mean to be}} {{troublesome}} to you,' said she, earnestly; 'I {{shall have}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do in our own house, that I shall not miss you so much when you are out; besides, we can have Annette to stay with us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} there's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> come?" [...] Strether laughed. [...] "All {{the more reason}} then that I should gird myself." [...] And as if to mark what he felt he could by this time count on he was already on his feet.|$|E
6000|$|But Lucy was {{resolved}} {{that she would}} not tell anything. [...] "I am so wretched!" [...] That would have been all; but she would not tell her wretchedness. [...] "We are so quiet in Kingsbury Crescent," [...] she said; [...] "you have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> talk of." ...|$|E
60|$|Elsa sighed heavily. She felt so oppressed {{that she}} thought her heart must burst. Andor's happiness, his {{confidence}} made the hideous truth itself <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> terrible <b>to</b> reveal. And now he {{went on in the}} same merry, voluble way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Mrs. Trevennack {{answered}} low, {{with tears}} standing in her eyes. [...] "I'm--I'm so glad you've SEEN him. It makes your opinion <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> valuable <b>to</b> me. But you thought his delusion wholly {{due to the}} accident, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course--given {{the right}} {{temperament}} {{for such a}} career--it must be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> comfortable <b>to</b> spend one's life in making money--buying and selling things and so on--rather than to risk it {{every day for the}} barren honour of serving one's king and country." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{made her}} laugh again. She could not {{understand}} it, for, with all her tenderness and womanly sweetness, {{she was still a}} Martian, and to a Martian the only good enemy is a dead enemy; for every dead foeman means <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> divide between those who live.|$|E
6000|$|How is childlike wonder {{expressed}} {{in the first two}} stanzas? How is the difference between the speaker and his friend indicated? Why does the name of Shelley mean <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> one than to the other? In the figure that follows, what do the moor and the eagle's feather stand for? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know I am stupid, {{and seem}} tame and cold," [...] said Richard, [...] "and {{you are the}} only one that does not care about it. That is what makes me wish Norman was the eldest. If I were as clever as he, I could do so much with Ethel, and be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now that's sweet of you," [...] she said. [...] "Of course, I don't {{see why you}} shouldn't be. We {{were always}} good friends, weren't we? {{and it makes me}} feel <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{comfortable}} <b>to</b> remember that we never went in for the other sort of thing." ...|$|R
60|$|Sam {{knew that}} the men were in no humor to be trifled with, and there was little doubt but the {{strangling}} would follow unless he obeyed. It was possible to delay the explanations for a few seconds, and thus give Fred <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> time <b>to</b> reach the lower level.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] {{replied the}} Prince; [...] "how could I deceive you? You {{see it is}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{flattering}} <b>to</b> my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by a simple princess. But, even if I am dying of love for her, I shall pretend to hate her until I am set free." ...|$|R
