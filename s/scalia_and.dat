50|$|Roberts {{has been}} {{compared}} and contrasted to other court members by commentators.

Roberts' judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin <b>Scalia's</b> <b>and</b> Clarence Thomas'. He wishes more consensus from the Court. Roberts' voting pattern is most closely aligned to Samuel Alito's.|$|R
