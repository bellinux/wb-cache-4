500|$|The {{improved}} {{results of}} the 1990s prompted higher expectations from the Australian Winter Olympic hierarchy. At {{the start of the}} 2002 Olympics, the Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman addressed the team, saying [...] "historically our winter teams have been the child racked by self-doubt, shy in nature as we <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> big brother, our summer Games team, take on and conquer the world." [...] He added, [...] "but over time we have developed a belief in ourselves".|$|E

"After {{the moment}} of his escape from these revellers, we lose all trace of Oliver' but we can prove that the maskers went to Sir John Ramorny's, where they were admitted, after some show of delay.

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the family, except for Marge, {{watching}} a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims [...] "It's like they <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> lives and put it right on screen," [...] and points at the television screen. Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something [...] "disturbing" [...] about him, which results in Lisa imagining him as being The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is {{a reference to the}} soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the [...] "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" [...] category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.|$|E

2500|$|Although, {{for many}} of the {{original}} founders of the Kibbutz, the arrival of children was a sobering experience: [...] "When we <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> first children in the playpen, hitting one another, or grabbing toys just for themselves, we were overcome with anxiety. What did it mean that even an education in communal life couldn't uproot these egotistical tendencies? The utopia of our initial social conception was slowly, slowly destroyed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Health Ministry {{advised the}} {{producers}} {{to have the}} lead character talk about the negative health consequences of smoking, demanding that smoking scenes in the film be scrolled down or blurred. Sidhwani and Javed Akhtar met Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni to resolve the matter, saying: [...] "We all agree that smoking is a major health issue {{and there is no}} intention of glorifying it in the film. It is shown as a weakness or a trait of the character. We reasoned with them and they <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> point of view. So the film will only have a disclaimer in the beginning. No blurring of scenes or scrolls during the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, {{the state}} celebrated its centennial of {{statehood}} (albeit one year late) {{with a great}} exposition in Nashville. The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was the ultimate expression of the Gilded Age in the Upper South—a showcase of industrial technology and exotic papier-mâché versions of the world's wonders. The Nashville Parthenon, a full-scale replica of Athens' Parthenon, was built in plaster, wood and brick. Rebuilt of concrete in the 1920s, it {{remains one of the}} city's attractions. During its six-month run at Centennial Park, the Exposition drew nearly two million visitors to see its dazzling monuments to the South's recovery. Governor Robert Taylor observed, [...] "Some of them who <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> ruined country thirty years ago will certainly appreciate {{the fact that we have}} wrought miracles." ...|$|E

[...] The Haggadah quotes [...] for {{the proposition that}} the Israelites cried to God. The Haggadah quotes [...] for the proposition that God heard the Israelites' voice. The Haggadah quotes [...] for the proposition that God saw the Israelites' affliction, interpreting that affliction as the suspension of family life. The Haggadah quotes [...] to explain the Israelites' travail, interpreting that travail as the loss of the baby boys. And the Haggadah quotes [...] to explain the Israelites' oppression, interpreting that oppression as pressure or persecution.|$|E
2500|$|Four verses in Deuteronomy (26:5-8) {{are then}} expounded, with an elaborate, {{traditional}} commentary. ("5.

And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. 7. And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our parents, and the Lord heard our voice, and <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. 8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Díaz relates, [...] "...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again,...we <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> comrades who {{had been}} {{captured}} in Cortés' defeat being dragged {{up the steps to}} be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes."

2500|$|I'm 27 {{years old}} today, the entire trip I pondered upon the words [...] "Longing for {{home is a}} terrible thing, I know". Yes, only now do I know and understand. And this [...] "homesickness" [...] of Božena Němcová, which I never understood, is nothing {{compared}} to my longing for home. I'm willing to suffer through, and do whatever it takes, but only home and home and to honestly work, work for something... How can some speak of beauty, when they've never seen Rešice and the fields from Kordula to Rešice, who never strolled through the warm dirt there, who never felt the warm air and over the grain fields, who never <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> chapel in the milk of white cherries, Husák's garden, which always reminded me of Sholokhov, especially the dirt lumps under the [...] "vortex" [...] and the [...] "Bare Hill" [...] and all the other places on all of which I am.

2500|$|At {{last they}} reached {{the base of the}} final tower. [...] "We stood," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, we gave it all kinds of {{pleasant}} names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, , [...] " [...] They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock couloir, which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: [...] "Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we <b>saw</b> <b>our</b> flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn." ...|$|E
