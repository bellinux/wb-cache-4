The nest site may be up to [...] above the ground, although [...] is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the finch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush's nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside {{with a layer of}} mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.|$|R

5|$|Common {{starlings}} in the <b>south</b> and <b>west</b> of <b>Europe</b> and <b>south</b> of latitude 40°N {{are mainly}} resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage {{across the country}} and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter in the southwest of the US.|$|R

Here we present time-series of Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, As, Cd and Pb deposition sampled in the Central Pyrenees at 2240 m a. s. l, representative of the fluxes of these elements over <b>South</b> <b>West</b> <b>Europe.</b> Trace element deposition did not show a simple trend. Rather, there was statistical evidence of several underlying factors governing the variability of the time-series recorded: seasonal cycles, trends, {{the effects of the}} amount of precipitation, climate-controlled export of dust, and changes in anthropogenic emissions. Overall, there were three main modes of variation in deposition. The first mode was related to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and affected Al, Fe, Ti, Mn and Pb. We interpret this as changes in the dust export from Northern Africa under the different meteorological conditions that the NAO index indicates. The second mode was an upward trend related to a rise in the frequency of precipitation events (that also lead to an increase in the amount). More frequent events might cause a higher efficiency in the scavenging of aerosols. As, Cu and Ni responded to this. And finally, the third mode of variation was related to changes in anthropogenic emissions of Pb and ZnPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an UV-polarization Lidar is used {{to study}} the optical {{properties}} of volcanic aerosol in the troposphere. The particles were released by the mid-April 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano (63. 63 °N, 19. 62 °W, Iceland) and passed in the troposphere above Lyon (45. 76 °N, 4. 83 °E, France) after advection over 2600 km. The FLEXPART particle dispersion model was applied to simulate the volcanic ash transport from Iceland to <b>South</b> <b>West</b> <b>Europe,</b> at {{the border of the}} air traffic closure area. Time-altitude plots of FLEXPART ash concentrations as well as of aerosol backscattering are presented, showing the arrival of volcanic particles in the troposphere above Lyon and their mixing into the planetary boundary layer. The particle UV-backscattering coefficient was typically 4 Mm− 1 sr− 1 and highly sensitive and accurate particle UV-depolarization measurements were performed, with depolarization ranging from a few to 44 %. After few days long-range transport, observed ash particles are still non spherical. The observed variations of the backscattering and depolarization coefficients can be attributed to variations in the volcanic particles content. Ash mass concentrations are then retrieved. Moreover, a partitioning into spherical and non spherical particles is evaluated from number concentration ratios between solid ash particles and spherical hydrated sulfate particles. The microphysical properties of volcanic particles can thus be studied by associating an UV-polarization remote sensing instrument with a numerical volcanic ash dispersion model. Highlights - Volcanic ash particles concentration is measured by ground-based Lidar in troposphere. - Coupling with FLEXPART ash transport model allows to identify volcanic ash particles. - Precise UV-depolarization data allows to discern spherical/non spherical particles. - Phase partitioning between non spherical ash and spherical sulfates is thus evaluated. - After long-range advection, PBL ash particles are low concentrated and still aspheric...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{above the}} critical load causes eutrophication with adverse impacts on biodiversity. Average Accumulated critical load Exceedance (AAE) {{is a measure}} of the amount of critical load exceedance and the area of habitat which is affected, and has been adopted in Europe as a pressure indicator for biodiversity. In Europe, AAE is calculated by the Coordination Centre for Effects (CCE) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe based on modelled nitrogen deposition and country-level reporting of critical load thresholds and ecosystem area. Due to differences in country-level reporting, AAE values for semi-natural habitats may show large differences across Europe. This paper therefore describes the development of a simpler approach to the modelling of habitat eutrophication. The eutrophication indicator model is applicable to all habitats for which empirical critical loads for nutrient nitrogen have been defined and is easily configured to assess impacts of modelled policies or scenarios on AAE. Outputs from the model showed a high correlation with published AAE data (R 2 = 0. 80) and replicated broad spatial patterns in AAE, but under-estimated actual values by a factor of 2. 5. This variation was traced primarily to the use of habitat-specific nitrogen deposition by the CCE which calculates higher nitrogen deposition to forest areas, but also to differences between countries in the critical load thresholds used and the areas of sensitive ecosystems reported. Sensitivity testing showed that exceedance calculations were particularly sensitive to the critical load threshold used, since nitrogen deposition across Europe lies in the middle of most critical load ranges. The indicator model was used to forecast AAE under two scenarios: socio-economic changes under a business as usual scenario to 2025, and the additional effect of agricultural reform where both direct support to farmers and market support were removed. Ammonia emissions showed a net decrease by 2025, with strong regional differentiation. Emissions increased in former Soviet bloc countries and decreased mainly in <b>south</b> <b>west</b> <b>Europe</b> and Finland. Agricultural reform had little additional impact on ammonia emissions. AAE was forecast to decrease by 49 % by 2025, due mainly to reductions in emissions of oxidised N from industry and transport, independent of agricultural reform. However, as oxidised N decreases, the relative contribution of N from agricultural sources will increase, and policy measures which reduce ammonia emissions will have increasing relevance for reducing AAE...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} trophic level is {{particularly}} relevant {{in order to}} improve knowledge of the structure and the functioning of an ecosystem. A precise estimation of fish trophic levels based on nitrogen isotopic signatures in environments as complex and fluctuant as estuaries requires a good description of the pelagic and benthic trophic chains and a knowledge of organic matter sources at the bottom. In this study these points are considered {{in the case of the}} Gironde estuary (<b>south</b> <b>west</b> France, <b>Europe).</b> To obtain a good picture of the food web, fish stomach content analyses and a bibliographic synthesis of the prey feeding ecology were carried out. Fish trophic levels were calculated from these results and d 15 N data. The feeding link investigation enabled us to identify qualitatively and quantitatively the different preys consumed by each fish group studied, to distinguish the prey feeding on benthos from those feeding on pelagos and to characterize the different nutritive pools at the base of the system. Among the species studied, only Liza ramada and the flatfish (Platichthys flesus and Solea solea) depend mainly on benthic trophic compartments. All the other fish groups depend on several trophic (benthic and/or pelagic) sources. These results enabled us to correct the calculation of fish trophic levels which are coherent with their feeding ecology data obtained from the nitrogen isotopic integrative period. The present work shows that trophic positions are linked with the feeding ecology of fish species and vary according to individual size. Ecological data also allow the correction of the isotopic data by eliminating absurd results and showing the complementarity of the two methods. This work is the first to consider source variability in the fish food web. This is an indispensable step for trophic studies in a dynamic environment. The investigation of matter fluxes and recycling processes at the food web base would provide a useful improvement in future estuarine food web research...|$|R
