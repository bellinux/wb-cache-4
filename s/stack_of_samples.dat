The phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) method has been widely used for estimating airborne asbestos concentrations {{because it does not}} require complicated processes or high-priced equipment. However, the PCM method is time-consuming and laborious as it is manually performed off-site by an expert. We have developed a high-throughput microscopy (HTM) method that can detect fibers distinguishable from other spherical particles in a sample slide by image processing both automatically and quantitatively. A set of parameters for processing and analysis of asbestos fiber images was adjusted for standard asbestos samples with known concentrations. We analyzed sample slides containing airborne asbestos fibers collected at 11 different workplaces following PCM and HTM methods, and found a reasonably good agreement in the asbestos concentration. Image acquisition synchronized with the movement <b>of</b> the robotic <b>sample</b> stages followed by an automated batch processing <b>of</b> a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> images enabled us to count asbestos fibers with greatly reduced time and labors.

40|$|Sample surface {{charging}} and {{electron beam}} damage are common problems in scanning electron microscopy. In {{the case of}} serial block‐face electron microscopy (SBEM), sample charging prevents or restricts <b>stack</b> acquisition <b>of</b> non-conducting <b>samples</b> in high vacuum; beam damage imposes a lower limit on the cutting thickness (z-resolution). In this dissertation, I present three approaches that aim to overcome these limitations. To solve the charging problem, I implemented and evaluated two charge elimination techniques for SBEM: surface charge neutralization with an ion gun and automated in-chamber specimen coating with an electron beam evaporator. The ion gun method provides only partial charge neutralization in many cases, although high positive ion current densities are achieved. The automated in-chamber coating method, on the other hand, provides reliable charge elimination in all cases and allows the acquisition <b>of</b> SBEM <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> non-conducting <b>samples</b> in high vacuum. Thin metallic films provide charge elimination for large sample surfaces and high beam currents, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio less than the widely-used low-vacuum method. To reduce the effects of beam damage – {{with the aim of}} allowing thin cutting at higher electron doses – I have explored imaging and cutting at low temperatures (~ 100 K) using a closed-loop cooling system and a custom-built cryo-microtome. Further experiments will be necessary to quantify potential improvements of 'Cryo-SBEM' over room-temperature SBEM operation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position- and scale-invariant representations {{of objects in}} the visual world. The model relies {{on a set of}} control neurons to dynamically modify the synaptic strengths of intra-cortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (Vl) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial relationships (i. e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex, thus enabling attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. The representation in V 1 is modeled as a multiscale <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> nodes with progressively lower resolution at higher eccentricities. Large changes {{in the size of the}} attentional window are accomplished by switching between different levels <b>of</b> the multiscale <b>stack,</b> while positional shifts and small changes in scale are accomplished by translating and rescaling the window within a single level <b>of</b> the <b>stack.</b> The control signals for setting the position and size of the attentional window are hypothesized to originate from neurons in the pulvinar and in the deep layers of visual cortex. The dynamics of these control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that can be realized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In pre-attentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level "saliency map" representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions. ...|$|R

" This class <b>of</b> <b>stacks</b> includes the <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> perverse sheaves (of any perversity, constructible {{with respect to}} a fixed stratification), and is singled out by fairly innocuous axioms. We show that some basic structure theory for perverse sheaves holds for a general <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> type P: such a stack is locally equivalent to a MacPherson-Vilonen construction, and under certain connectedness conditions its category of global objects is equivalent to the category of modules over a finite-dimensional algebra. To prove these results we develop a rudimentary tilting formalism for <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> type P [...] another sense in which these stacks are "similar to <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> perverse sheaves. ...|$|R
