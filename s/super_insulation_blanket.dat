40|$|Fast track {{concrete}} {{has proven}} to be successful in obtaining high early strengths. This benefit does not come without cost. Type III cement and <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> to accelerate the cure add to its expense when compared to conventional paving. This research was intended to determine the increase in time required to obtain opening strength when a fast track mix utilized conventional Type I cement and also used a conventional cure. Standard concrete mixes also were tested to determine the acceleration of strength gain when cured with <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets.</b> The goal was to determine mixes and procedures which would result in a range of opening times. This would allow the most economical design for a particular project and tailor it to that projects time restraint. Three mixes were tested: Class F, Class C, and Class B. Each mix was tested with one section being cured with <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> and another section without. All used Type I cement. Iowa Department of Transportation specifications required 500 psi of flexural strength before a pavement can be opened to traffic. The Class F mix with Type I cement and using <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> reached that strength in approximately 36 hours, the Class C mix using the blankets in approximately 48 hours, and the Class F mix without covers in about 60 hours. (Note: Class F concrete pavement is opened at 400 psi minimum and Class F bonded overlay pavement at 350 psi.) The results showed a significant improvement in early strength gain by the use of <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets.</b> The Type I cement could be used in mixes intended for early opening with sacrifices in time when compared to fast track but are still much sooner than conventional pavement. It appears a range of design alternatives is possible using Type I cement both with and without insulating blankets...|$|R

40|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{recently}} developed new fire test criteria for aircraft thermal acoustical insulation. Aircraft insulation {{is attached to}} the fuselage structure to provide a noise and thermal barrier. Generally, the lightweight <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> are comprised of fiberglass encased in a film bagging material. The new fire test criteria provide improvements in both postcrash fuel fire resistance and in-flight fire protection. Full-scale fire tests have shown that available fire-resistant blanket materials or fire barriers can significantly prolong the time for fuselage burnthrough and thereby provide additional time for passengers to survive a postcrash fuel fire. A new small-scale fire test method and criteria for <b>insulation</b> <b>blanket</b> burnthrough resistance has been developed and finalized. Similarly, intermediate- and full-scale fire tests were conducted to evaluate the behavior of the thin bagging material films during a hidden in-flight fire. It was observed that the films exhibit a range in fire behavior, depending on the chemical composition, thickness, and type of scrim (tear stopper).

40|$|The {{market share}} for fibre {{reinforced}} aerogel insulation materials {{is expected to}} increase as production costs are lowered, and in this context, the development of layered products with integrated aerogel is highly interesting. The effect of uniaxial compression and humidity on the thermal conductivity of commercially available aerogel <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> were measured in order to assess the feasibility of integrating aerogel blankets with other building components. The thermal performance under uniaxial compression was measured by compressing commercially available aerogel blanket materials in a heat flow meter apparatus.

The thermal insulation properties of the aerogel <b>insulation</b> <b>blankets</b> remained excellent within the range of compressive stress investigated in this study (up to about 40 kPa), making aerogel integration highly interesting for building components that will be used under compression.
