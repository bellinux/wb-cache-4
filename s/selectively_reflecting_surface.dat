40|$|Systems {{and method}} are {{disclosed}} for measuring small angular deflections {{of a target}} using weak value amplification. A system includes a beam source, a beam splitter, a target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> a photodetector, and a processor. The beam source generates an input beam that is split into first and second beams by the beam splitter. The first and second beams are propagated to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> at least partially superimposed at the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> and incident to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> normal to the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> The first beam is reflected an additional even number of times during propagation to the photodetector. The second beam is reflected an additional odd number of times during propagation to the photodetector. The first and second beams interfere at the photodetector so as to produce interference patterns. The interference patterns are interpreted to measure angular deflections of the target <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Pseudo-steady flows, {{the triple}} point {{moves away from}} the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> and the {{reflection}} is a direct-Mach reflection. In unsteady flows, {{it is also possible that}} the triple point remains stationary relative to the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> (stationary-Mach reflection), or moves toward the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> (inverse-Mach reflection). In inverse Mach reflection, the Mach stem is convex toward the oncoming flow, and the slip plane curves away from the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> Each one of these configurations can assume one of the following three possibilities: single-Mach reflection, transitional-Mach reflection and double-Mach reflection.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} the {{photoswitch}} that the reflecting efficiency of the reflecting member may be drastically lowered due to dewing and clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> due {{to a change in}} the ambient temperature. The dew on the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface</b> causes a random reflection. In order to avoid the clouding of the <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface,</b> it has been proposed to apply silicon or the like to the <b>surface</b> of the <b>reflecting</b> member. This countermeasure, however, cannot prevent condensing of dew onto {{the lower part of the}} <b>reflecting</b> <b>surface.</b> Thus, there are many problems in the prior art.|$|R
40|$|Cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} with helicoidal molecular architecture {{are known}} for their ability to <b>selectively</b> <b>reflect</b> light with the wavelength that is determined by the periodicity of molecular orientations. Here we demonstrate that by using a cholesteric with oblique helicoidal(heliconical) structure, as opposed to the classic right-angle helicoid, one can vary the wavelength of <b>selectively</b> <b>reflected</b> light in a broad spectral range, from ultraviolet to visible and infrared (360 - 1520 nm for the same chemical composition) by simply adjusting the electric field applied parallel to the helicoidal axis. The effect exists in a wide temperature range (including the room temperatures) and thus can enable many applications that require dynamically controlled transmission and reflection of electromagnetic waves, from energy-saving smart windows to tunable organic lasers, reflective color display, and transparent see-through displays.

40|$|In {{previous}} work [1 - 4] we found, {{for the first}} time, that the <b>selectively</b> <b>reflected</b> light band from cholesteric liquid crystals depends on the physical sorption properties of their supports, and we now use them to differentiate nickel electrodeposits with different grained texture and NixOy with various thicknesses. The different nickel oxide thicknesses were prepared by dipping the nickel electrodeposit samples into H 2 O 2 solution for different time intervals. The <b>selectively</b> <b>reflected</b> light measurements from using the above samples were compared to each other, {{as well as to}} those from samples not dipped in H 2 O 2 solution. All the experimental results were correlated with the properties of the deposits, {{as well as with the}} results derived from SEM. It is concluded that cholesteric liquid crystals can provide an efficient technique to identify surfaces with different grained texture and thickness of formed oxide...|$|R

Single crystals of ice are birefringent not only at optical frequencies but also at radar ones, so in an ice sheet the average crystal orientation fabric determines the overall level of birefringence.
