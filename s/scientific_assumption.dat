40|$|We {{consider}} private value auctions where bidders ’ {{types are}} dependent, a case usually treated by assuming affiliation. As any <b>scientific</b> <b>assumption,</b> affiliation has limitations {{and it is}} important to know them. We show that affiliation is a restrictive condition, that is, the set of affiliated distributions is small both in topological and measure-theoretical senses. The economic cases where affiliation holds do not correspond to the intuition usually given for affiliation. Affiliation’s implications do not generalize to other definitions of positive dependence and may be frequently false. Nevertheless, some of these implications are true in a weaker sense and there are cases where affiliation can be well justified and used in theoretical models. Since these cases do not cover all economically relevant cases, it is desirable to seek a more general approach to dependence in auctions. We propose a new approach that allow both theoretical and numerical characterization of pure strategy equilibrium of first-price auctions. We treat mainly symmetric auctions, but the approach can be extended to asymmetric auctions with dependence. New results about equilibrium existence and revenue ranking of auctions are provided...|$|E

40|$|Consilience {{offers a}} {{powerful}} mechanism for borrowing from other disciplines, thereby extending {{the scope of}} what can be known. This paper looks at the foundations of the activity of design as a means of providing IT systems that cater for diverse needs. Developing systems that are expected to satisfy needs continuously (i. e., systems that are expected to evolve) calls for a dynamic activity of design that is responsive to changes in the environment. The contrast with the <b>scientific</b> <b>assumption</b> of ordered development invokes a new classification, supported by insights from other disciplines that place the range of approaches in context. Design is neither orderly nor linear; it implies a continuous and active search to resolve trade-offs and satisfy changing constraints. The paper concludes by making a case for design as an alternative culture that borrows from, and supports, both the scientific and the literary cultures. Acceptance of the role of practice as an interface alongside the more traditional cultures enables researchers and practitioners to access and adopt a larger variety of methods and general approaches underpinning an even larger corpus of insights. Consilience can occur at different levels and offer a variety of benefits. Balancing scientific enquiry with artistic flair and creativity through careful sensemaking that supports sharing across cultures provides the greatest benefit from learning to look across rather than blindly focusing in...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} of this {{research}} has been to apply the <b>scientific</b> <b>assumption</b> that the alkalization is able to make inhospitable the larval reproductive sites in the identified area (Sant’Antioco). Moreover several studies about the reproductive behaviour of BT vectors has been conducted. First every data about BT history in Italy and especially in Sardinia had been gathered, then a epidemiologic retrospective view of {{the events in the}} whole island has been issued to study the disease prevalence and how environmental and geo-pedological factors have been able to change this prevalence. The research has been conducted in the pilot farm into the selected area of Sant’Antioco where the first hypothesis has been tested and every information about larval development has been collected. During the whole experimental period have been collected all the data about captures in the light traps and captures in the traps where midges were emerging from the larval case in both areas, alkalized and not. Furthermore have been performed the epidemiologic model taking into account the local epidemiological data and the several variables that were involved in the damage registered in every farm of the island of Sant’Antioco. Experimental data first of all have been emphasize the possibility of cut down the larval reproduction extremely in the alkalized sites then have allowed to study the BT vectors density closely and its relation with the disease prevalence in the heads presents in the near farms. The results revealed the different distribution of the disease prevalence in the several farms, referable to minute variation of the farm location. In the end it seems essential to improve the farm management through the widespread action of awakening to farmers...|$|E

40|$|The {{work here}} {{presented}} wishes {{to propose a}} critical and reasoned reflection {{about the relationship between}} labor law and economics in a continuously changing international scenario. The theme can certainly be inserted among the “classic” ones, because it faces one of the most fascinating issues labor law – as a subject – places when it projects itself outside its natural conceptual perimeter. The research object is in fact based on a critical reflection around the vexata quaestio {{of the relationship between the}} juridical-labor law sphere and the economic dimension of reference. More in detail, in this general framework, we carry out a research which thrusts down its roots in an organic analysis of the theoretical positions of law and labor economics, in order to develop a synergic argument which can possibly be advantageous in both research ambits. With the present work, we wish therefore to test the holding of the relationship between the two spheres of knowledge considered, also in the perspective of the elaboration of hermeneutic contributions useful for a possible re-conceptualization of labor law, partially imposed by the morphological change of the socio-economic contexts of reference. Following a logical sequence, the present work is structured in five conceptually autonomous chapters, which however permeate each other and are conceived in a indissoluble unitary dimension in order to guarantee systematic coherence to the research. In detail, moving from a careful reflection about the “crisis” of labor law considered by itself and in its interaction with economics, attention is placed on the intrinsically conflictual and dualistic nature of the subject, in its being a projection of the pair “capital/work”. After some unavoidable methodological considerations, useful for an analytical-conceptual reflection, we then highlight the elements of interest deriving from the comparison between and the balancing of economic and social rationality, economic factuality and juridical “evaluation”. From a methodological point of view, the logical and <b>scientific</b> <b>assumption</b> of the research is the firm conviction that only through a systemic approach, characterized by a strong comparative and multidisciplinary framework, it is possible to carefully analyze the current structure and configuration of the relationship between labor law and economics in order to outline in particular the boundaries of future perspectives of development. A clear reconstruction of a suitable method to rationalize the dialectic process between cognitive openness and juridical reconceptualization is indeed inescapable. The use of the comparison – contextualized and teleologically addressed to give the work an appreciable hermeneutic contribution – is thus considered the privileged, functional research method. The labor law systems compared – as shown in the body of the present work – are those of Italy and Spain, because of the proximity of the regulatory paths explored from time to time and of the convergence resulting also from recent reforms. Hence, looking at the paradigmatic institutes of the impact of the economic sphere on juridical regulations, the concrete relationship between economics and labor law is in particular considered with specific reference to the worker’s tasks (and demotion/deskilling), also as a consequence of the recent legislative reforms, which have been introduced in the two legal systems object of comparison. In addition, special consideration is reserved to the concept of “flexibility”, to the specular notion of “security”, and to the boundaries of the concept of “flexicurity”, in the scenario of a European labor law undergoing a deep change in the search of a possible new balance. Exactly the search of a new adjustment between the different interests involved in present-day labor law relationships finds in an axiological framework of values the natural landing of the research path here briefly presented. In the conclusions of the present work, we propose some targeted reflections about the urgent need to “return” to the principles and the values which have represented the essence of the subject, yesterday as today. Labor regulation, in relation to economic efficiency and to the requests of deregulation coming from the market, cannot leave aside the rediscovery of the table of values of reference and the balancing of the different interests involved.
