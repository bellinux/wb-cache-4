40|$|Energy {{consumption}} and heat dissipation have become key considerations for modern {{high performance computer}} sys-tems. In this paper, we focus on non-clairvoyant speed scal-ing to minimize flow time plus energy for batched paral-lel jobs on multiprocessors. We consider a common sce-nario where the total power consumption cannot exceed a given budget and the power consumed on each processor is sα when running at speed s. Extending the Equi proces-sor allocation policy, we propose two algorithms: U-Equi and N-Equi, which use respectively a uniform-speed and a non-uniform speed <b>scaling</b> function <b>for</b> the <b>allocated</b> pro-cessors. Using competitive analysis, we show that U-Equi is O(P (α− 1) /α 2) -competitive for flow time plus energy, and N-Equi is O (α lnP) -competitive for the same metric when given sufficient power, where P is {{the total number of}} pro-cessors. Our simulation results confirm that U-Equi and N-Equi achieve better performance than a straightforward fixed-speed Equi strategy. Moreover, moderate power con-straint does not significantly affect the performance of our algorithms...|$|R

When calculating a production through the production order system there always seems to appear the same dilemma; which key or keys should be chosen <b>for</b> <b>allocating</b> indirect costs. As a result, in addition to the well-known classical methods <b>for</b> <b>allocating</b> indirect costs, a new method is developed {{in the form of a}} Model <b>for</b> <b>allocating</b> indirect costs. By applying the above-mentioned model, the classical methods are omitted from the process of allocation indirect costs, which contributes to an easier and faster planning, monitoring, comparing, and reducing costs. direct costs, indirect costs, allocation of costs...|$|R

In software testing one of the important issues is how to allocate the limited resources so that we finish our testing on time and will deliver quality software. Number of Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM) has been developed <b>for</b> <b>allocating</b> the testing resource in the past three decades but majority of models are developed in static environment. In this paper we developed model in a dynamic environment and also the software is divided into different modules. We also used Pontryagin Maximum principle for solving the model.
