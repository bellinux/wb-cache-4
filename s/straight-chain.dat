50|$|Heating a lactone with a base (sodium hydroxide) will {{hydrolyse}} the lactone to {{its parent}} compound, the straight chained bifunctional compound. Like <b>straight-chained</b> esters, the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of lactones is a reversible reaction, with an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis {{reaction of the}} lactone is {{lower than that of}} the <b>straight-chained</b> ester i.e. the products (hydroxyacids) are less favored {{in the case of the}} lactones. This is because although the enthalpies of the hydrolysis of esters and lactones are about the same, the entropy of the hydrolysis of lactones is less than the entropy of <b>straight-chained</b> esters. <b>Straight-chained</b> esters give two products upon hydrolysis, making the entropy change more favorable than in the case of lactones which give only a single product.|$|R

To examine whether degrees of water penetration and molecular motions in Mal 3 (Phyt) 2 membranes can account for the lower permeability, nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to various membranes of branch-chained lipids (Mal 3 (Phyt) 2, DPhPC, and a tetraether lipid from an extremely thermoacidophilic archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum), as well as <b>straight-chained</b> lipids (EPC, 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG)) using several fluorescent lipids. Degrees of hydration of glycolipids, Mal 3 (Phyt) 2, and DGDG were lower than those of phospholipids, EPC, POPC, and DPhPC at the membrane-water interfaces. DPhPC showed the highest hydration among the lipids examined. Meanwhile, rotational and lateral diffusive motions of the fluorescent phospholipid in branch-chained lipid membranes were more restricted than those in <b>straight-chained</b> ones. The results suggest that the restricted motion of chain segments rather than the lower hydration accounts for the lower proton permeability of branch-chained lipid membranes...|$|R

25|$|The melting {{points of}} {{branched-chain}} alkanes {{can be either}} higher or {{lower than those of}} the corresponding <b>straight-chain</b> alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.|$|E
25|$|Tributylphosphine finds some {{industrial}} {{use as a}} catalyst modifier in the cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, where it greatly increases the ratio of <b>straight-chain</b> aldehydes to branched-chain aldehydes in the product mixture. However, tricyclohexylphosphine is even more effective for this purpose (although more expensive) and, in any case, rhodium catalysts are usually preferred to cobalt catalysts for the hydroformylation of alkenes.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, a {{homologous}} series {{is a series}} of compounds with the same general formula, usually varying by a single parameter—such as the length of a carbon chain. Examples of such series are the <b>straight-chained</b> alkanes (paraffins), and some of their derivatives (such as the primary alcohols, aldehydes, and (mono)carboxylic acid). The single-ring unbranched cycloalkanes form another such series.|$|R
5000|$|The {{homologous}} series of <b>straight-chained</b> alkanes begins methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), and pentane (C5H12).

Adjacent members in such a series, such as methane and ethane, are known as [...] "adjacent homologues." ...|$|R

It is {{structurally}} a hexane molecule with a methyl group attached to its second carbon atom.

25|$|Oils and fats can be {{hydrogenated}} to give {{a diesel}} substitute. The resulting product is a <b>straight-chain</b> hydrocarbon with a high cetane number, low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen.

They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.|$|E
25|$|During the {{conversion}} from <b>straight-chain</b> {{form to the}} cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the anomeric carbon, becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below {{the plane of the}} ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers. In the α anomer, the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side (trans) of the ring from the CH2OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the β anomer.|$|E
25|$|The BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is {{composed}} of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (A2B2) and {{is essential for the}} synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the transamination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with branched-chain α-keto acid substrates than with <b>straight-chain</b> substrates, and in Bacillus species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme’s high affinity toward branched-chain α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for branched-chain fatty acid synthetase.|$|E
5000|$|Compounds {{within a}} {{homologous}} series typically have a fixed set of functional groups {{that gives them}} similar chemical and physical properties.

40|$|Abstract Males of five {{species of}} three tribes in the long-horned beetle {{subfamily}} Cerambycinae produce volatile pheromones that share a structural motif (hydroxyl or carbonyl groups at carbons {{two and three}} in <b>straight-chains</b> of six, eight, or ten carbons). Pheromone gland pores are present on the prothoraces of males, but are absent in females, suggesting that male-specific gland pores could provide a convenient morphological indication that a species uses volatile pheromones. In this article, we assess the taxonomic distribution of gland pores within the Cerambycinae by examining males and females of 65 species in 24 tribes using scanning electron microscopy. Gland pores were present in males and absent in females of 49 species, but absent in both sexes of the remaining 16 species. Pores were confined to indentations in the cuticle. Among the species that had male-specific gland pores were four species already known to produce volatile compounds consistent with the structural motif. These findings support the initial assumption that gland pores {{are associated with the}} production of pheromones by males. There were apparently no taxonomic patterns in the presence of gland pores. These findings suggest that volatile pheromones {{play an important role in}} reproduction for many species of the Cerambycinae, and that the trait is evolutionarily labile...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} into whether Mars contains signatures of {{past or present}} life is {{of great interest to}} science and society. Amino acids and nucleobases are compounds that are essential for all known life on Earth and are excellent target molecules in the search for potential Martian biomarkers or prebiotic chemistry. Martian meteorites represent the only samples from Mars that can be studied directly in the laboratory on Earth. Here, we analyzed the amino acid and nucleobase content of the shergottite Roberts Massif (RBT) 04262 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We did not detect any nucleobases above our detection limit in formic acid extracts; however, we did measure a suite of protein and nonprotein amino acids in hot-water extracts with high relative abundances of beta-alanine and gamma-amino-eta-butyric acid. The presence of only low (to absent) levels of several proteinogenic amino acids and a lack of nucleobases suggest that this meteorite fragment is fairly uncontaminated with respect to these common biological compounds. The distribution of <b>straight-chained</b> amine-terminal eta-omega-amino acids in RBT 04262 resembled those previously measured in thermally altered carbonaceous meteorites. A carbon isotope ratio of - 24 (0 / 00) +/- 6 (0 / 00) for beta-alanine in RBT 04262 is in the range of reduced organic carbon previously measured in Martian meteorites (Steele et al. 2012). The presence of eta-omega-amino acids may be due to a high temperature Fischer-Tropschtype synthesis during igneous processing on Mars or impact ejection of the meteorites from Mars, but more experimental data are needed to support these hypotheses...|$|R
25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their <b>straight-chain</b> homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|Acetyl-CoA {{is formed}} into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, {{at which point}} malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid {{synthesis}} pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase {{is the point of}} regulation in saturated <b>straight-chain</b> fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system {{is distinct from}} the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce <b>straight-chain</b> fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.|$|E

In the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform CDC groups A- 3, A- 4, and A- 5; some strains of B- 1 and B- 3; "Corynebacterium aquaticum"; Brevibacterium liquefaciens; Rothia dentocariosa; and Listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (Ca 15 : 0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (Ca 17 : 0) acids. Other species with these types of CFA included B. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (Ci 13 : 0) and anteisotridecanoic (Ca 13 : 0) acids. CFAs useful for distinguishing among Jonesia denitrificans, Oerskovia spp., some strains of CDC groups B- 1 and B- 3, Kurthia spp., and Propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (C 16 : 0) acid, isopentadecanoic (Ci 15 : 0) acid, and Ca 15 : 0).

40|$|Stemming from a {{continuing}} demand for fuel surrogates, composed {{of only a}} few species, combustion of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (>C 5) is of scientific interest due to their abundance in petroleum-based fuels, which contain hundreds of different hydrocarbon species, used for military, aviation, and transportation applications. Fuel surrogate development involves the use of a few hydrocarbon species to replicate the physical, chemical, combustion, and ignition properties of multi-component petroleum-based fuels, enabling fundamental studies to be performed in a more controlled manner. Of particular interest are <b>straight-chained,</b> saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) due to the high concentration of these species in diesel and jet fuels. Prior to integrating a particular hydrocarbon into a surrogate fuel formulation, its individual properties are to be precisely known. n-Nonane (n-C 9 H 20) is found in diesel and aviation fuels, and its combustion properties have received only minimal consideration. The present work involves first measurements of n-C 9 H 20 oxidation in oxygen (O 2) and argon (Ar), which were performed under dilute conditions at three levels of equivalence ratio (phi = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0) and fixed pressure near 1. 5 atm using a shock tube. Utilizing shock waves, high-temperature, fixed-pressure conditions are created within which the fuel reacts, where temperature and pressure are calculated using 1 D shock theory and measurement of shock velocity. Of interest were measurements of ignition times and species time-histories of the hydroxyl (OH*) radical intermediate. A salient pre-ignition feature was observed in fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and fuel-rich OH* species profiles. The feature at each equivalence ratio was observed above 1400 K with the time-of-initiation (post reflected-shock) showing dependence on phi as the initiation time shortened with increasing phi. Relative percentage calculations reveal that the fuel-rich condition produces the largest quantity of pre-ignition OH*. Ignition delay time measurements and corresponding activation energy calculations show that the phi = 1. 0 mixture was the most reactive, while the phi = 0. 5 condition was least reactive...|$|R
30|$|Compound 7 {{possessed a}} {{molecular}} formula of C 22 H 32 O 3 from its HREIMS, which displayed a molecular ion peak at m/z 344.2348. A {{comparison of the}} 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 7 with those of 1 revealed {{the presence of the}} 1 -(2 -methyl- 4, 6 -dihydroxyl)-phenyl group. Combined with MS spectral data, compound 7 was determined to be a neogrifolin derivative unambiguously. Unlike the other neogrifolin analogues (1 – 6) which had <b>straight-chains</b> as “tails”, compound 7 had a cyclohexane moiety—by C- 8 connecting to C- 13 —in its tail. It was supported by COSY correlations of H- 9 /H- 8 /H- 13 /H- 12 /H- 11, and HMBC cross peaks from Me- 22 to C- 9, C- 10 and C- 11 (Fig.  2). The remaining part of the “tail” was a 2 -(6 -methyl)- 1, 5 -heptadiene residue. This residue was connected with C- 13, because COSY correlations of H- 15 /H- 16 /H- 17, and HMBC correlations from H- 21 to C- 13 and C- 15, and from Me- 19 and - 20 to C- 18 and C- 17 (Fig.  2) were observed. In order to determine the relative stereochemistry of C- 8, C- 10 and C- 13, a ROESY experiment was performed, combined with further analysis of the coupling constants of several signals in 1 H NMR spectrum. The observed broad singlet (br. s) signal of H- 8 (δH =  3.22) in its 1 H NMR spectrum indicated that H- 8 existed as an equatorial bond in the stable boat conformation of the cyclohexane moiety, as shown in Fig.  2. Likewise, H- 13 was proposed to be in an axial position because of the doublet of triplets at δH 3.22 with coupling constants of 12.5 and 2.7  Hz, respectively. Furthermore, The ROESY correlations of H- 13 /Hax- 9 and Me- 22 /Hax- 9 revealed the same orientation of H- 13 and Me- 22. Therefore, H- 8, H- 13 and Me- 22 were deduced to be α-, α-, α- orientated. In compound 7, a ring was formed by new C–C bond connection between C- 8 and C- 13 in side chain.|$|R

40|$|Carbonaceous meteorites {{contain a}} diverse suite of soluble organic {{compounds}}. Studies of these compounds reveal the Solar System's earliest organic chemistry. Among the classes of organic compounds found in meteorites are keto acids (pyruvic acid, etc.), hydroxy tricarboxylic acids (1), amino acids, amides, purines and pyrimidines. The Murchison and Murray meteorites {{are the most}} studied for soluble and insoluble organic compounds and organic carbon phases. The majority of (indigenous) meteoritic compounds are racemic, (i. e., their D/L enantiomer ratios are 50 : 50). However, {{some of the more}} unusual (non-protein) amino acids contain slightly more of one enantiomer (usually the L) than the other. This presentation focuses on the enantiomer analyses of three to six-carbon (3 C to 6 C) meteoritic sugar acids. The molecular and enantiomer analysis of corresponding sugar alcohols will also be discussed. Detailed analytical procedures for sugar-acid enantiomers have been described. Results of several meteorite analyses show that glyceric acid is consistently racemic (or nearly so) as expected of non-biological mechanisms of synthesis. Also racemic are 4 -C deoxy sugar acids: 2 -methyl glyceric acid; 2, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid; 2, 3 -dihydroxybutyric acid (two diastereomers); and 3, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid. However, a 4 C acid, threonic acid, has never been observed as racemic, i. e., it possesses a large D excess. In several samples of Murchison and one of GRA 95229 (possibly the most pristine carbonaceous meteorite yet analyzed) threonic acid has nearly the same D enrichment. In Murchison, preliminary isotopic measurements of individual threonic acid enantiomers point towards extraterrestrial sources of the D enrichment. Enantiomer analyses of the 5 C mono-sugar acids, ribonic, arabinonic, xylonic, and lyxonic also show large D excesses. It is worth noting that all four of these acids (all of the possible <b>straight-chained</b> 5 C sugar acids) are present in meteorites, including the rare lyxonic acid, and their relative abundances are in equilibrium proportions. In addition (in contrast to the above D-only excesses), some of the above acids are found in biology as the L enantiomer. Whether rare are common, all of the 6 C sugar acids that are present in sufficient amounts to allow enantiomer analysis (Mannonic, gluconic, altronic, talonic, idonic, gulonic, and galactonic) also, apparently, possess significant D excesses...|$|R

Fish in the North Sea experience exposure to xenobiotic compounds from historic pollution and releases from industry and other human activities. A number of adverse biological effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been shown, including alterations in the cell membrane. This study is a follow-up of a previously published study from IMR that showed that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that were exposed to short-chained alkylphenols had altered lipid composition and fatty acid distribution in the liver and brain compared to un-exposed fish. The study in this thesis consists of two exposure experiments where Atlantic cod were given pollutants in the diet through 4 weeks. In experiment 1 Atlantic cod were exposed to para-substituted nonylphenols (NPs), either the <b>straight-chained</b> isomer 4 -n-NP, or a mixture of branched isomers, 4 - T-NP. In experiment 2 Atlantic cod were given crude oil and/or a mixture of halogenated POPs. The POPs included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chlorinated pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The fish were given doses corresponding to chronic pollution or higher doses analogous to acute spill accidents. The main focus of the thesis has been detailed studies of lipid composition, with emphasis on the phospholipids in the membranes, and fatty acid distribution in membrane lipids. Toxicogenomic studies have also been performed on the transcriptional levels, as well as biophysical studies of model lipid membranes as Langmuir monolayers and their interactions with selected POPs. The treatments with NPs or oil/POPs did not induce large changes in membrane composition (lipid class composition and fatty acid distribution) in the liver and brain of male Atlantic cod. However, the transcriptional data suggest that the fish were affected by the treatment at the molecular level. Differential expression in selected genes in phase I and II metabolism of xenobiotic compounds, PL biosynthesis and antioxidant responses were shown. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} 18 oils from the Barrow Island oilfield, Australia, and a non-biodegraded {{reference}} oil have been analysed compositionally {{in order to}} detail the effect of minor to moderate biodegradation on C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons. Carbon isotopic data for individual low molecular weight hydrocarbons were also obtained for six of the oils. The Barrow Island oils came from different production wells, reservoir horizons, and compartments, but have a common source (the Upper Jurassic Dingo Claystone Formation), with some organo-facies differences. Hydrocarbon ratios based on hopanes, steranes, alkylnaphthalenes and alkylphenanthrenes indicate thermal maturities of about 0. 8 % Rc {{for most of the}} oils. The co-occurrence in all the oils of relatively high amounts of 25 -norhopanes with C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and cyclic alkanes implies that the oils are the result of multiple charging, with a heavily biodegraded charge being overprinted by fresher and more pristine oil. The later oil charge was itself variably biodegraded, leading to significant compositional variations across the oilfield, which help delineate compartmentalisation. Biodegradation resulted in strong depletion of n-alkanes (> 95 %) from most of the oils. Benzene and toluene were partially or completely removed from the Barrow Island oils by water washing. However, hydrocarbons with lower water solubility were either not affected by water washing, or water washing had only a minor effect. There are three main controls on the susceptibility to biodegradation of cyclic, branched and aromatic low molecular weight hydrocarbons: carbon skeleton, degree of alkylation, and position of alkylation. Firstly, ring preference ratios at C₆ and C₇ show that isoalkanes are retained preferentially relative to alkylcyclohexanes, and to some extent alkylcyclopentanes. Dimethylpentanes are substantially more resistant to biodegradation than most dimethylcyclopentanes, but methylhexanes are depleted faster than methylpentanes and dimethylcyclopentanes. For C₈ and C₉ hydrocarbons, alkylcyclohexanes are more resistant to biodegradation than linear alkanes. Secondly, there is a trend of lower susceptibility to biodegradation with greater alkyl substitution for isoalkanes, alkylcyclohexanes, alkylcyclopentanes and alkylbenzenes. Thirdly, the position of alkylation has a strong control, with adjacent methyl groups reducing the susceptibility of an isomer to biodegradation. 1, 2, 3 -Trimethylbenzene is the most resistant of the C₃ alkylbenzene isomers during moderate biodegradation. 2 -Methylalkanes are the most susceptible branched alkanes to biodegradation, 3 -methylalkanes are the most resistant and 4 -methylalkanes have intermediate resistance. Therefore, terminal methyl groups are more prone to bacterial attack compared to mid-chain isomers, and C₃ carbon chains are more readily utilised than C₂ carbon chains. 1, 1 -Dimethylcyclopentane and 1, 1 -dimethylcyclohexane are the most resistant of the alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes to biodegradation. The <b>straight-chained</b> and branched C₅–C₉ alkanes are isotopically light (depleted in ¹³C) relative to cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of biodegradation consistently lead to enrichment in ¹³C for each remaining hydrocarbon, due to preferential removal of ¹²C. Differences in the rates of biodegradation of low molecular weight hydrocarbons shown by compositional data are also reflected in the level of enrichment in ¹³C. The carbon isotopic effects of biodegradation show a decreasing level of isotopic enrichments in ¹³C with increasing molecular weight. This suggests that the kinetic isotope effect associated with biodegradation is site-specific and often related to a terminal carbon, where its impact on the isotopic composition becomes progressively ‘diluted’ with increasing carbon number. 25 page(s...|$|R
