More recently, new types of Baandha depicting portrait, landscape and flower pods are being designed.Baandha fabric is created using a tie-dye technique. The yarns are tied according to the desired patterns to prevent absorption of dyes, and then dyed. The yarns or <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> so produced is called 'Baandha'. The unique feature of this form of designing is that the designs are reflected almost identically on both side of the fabric.Once the frabic is dyed it can never be belached in to other colour. This versatile technique enables a craftsman to weave colourful designs, patterns and images into a fabric capable of inspiring a thought or conveying a message. Thus Baandha {{can be defined as}} [...] "A length of systematically arranged yarn, dyed according to a preconceived design in such a manner so as to enable a weaver to portray the design when the yarn is converted to a fabric through the process of weaving". It is believed that this art migrated to Western Odisha along with the Bhulia community who fled Northern India in the year 1192 AD {{after the fall of the}} Chouhan empire at the hands of the Mughals. Since then and up to the year 1925 it flourished in Western Odisha in a limited number of designs and in vegetable colours and consisted mostly of saris used by the womenfolk of the Odisha. These saris were known as 'Bhulia-Kapta'. The demand was limited, distress sale was common and the craftsmen lived in penury.|$|E

Specific boundary conditions including both traction and displacement boundary conditions are applied on the structure boundaries. The effective classical and nonclassical mechanical moduli are deduced by an equivalent strain energy method. The characteristic bending lengths are identified from the resulting homogenized moduli.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study performed at E. S. A. -ESTEC {{was to create a}} faithfull finite element model of Triaxial Woven Fabric and to investigate the mechanical behavior of it. Triaxial Woven Fabric (TWF) is composed of three <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> that interlace at 00 – 60 + 60 degrees. The ability of TWF to maintain structural integrity even with a very open construction is unique among textile structures; a particular attraction of this material is that it is almost mechanically quasi-isotropic on a macroscopic scale, and so {{it can be used to}} construct ultra-thin structural elements from a single ply. This feature makes it particularly attractive to designers of spacecraft antennas and the next generation of low cost deployable structures. However the strong influence of the geometrical parameters on the mechanical behavior and the difficulties one has to implement this material in analysis codes is a drawback. The starting finite element model considered as starting point is a detailed one; it accounts for all the geometrical parameters of the yarn but it is made up of straight elements so it does not account for the real curved slopes that characterize the free parts of the yarn because of the cross regions of the fabric. Moreover the material definition is linked to Coordinate Systems whose orientation is fixed, so the material properties cannot follow the shape of the yarn itself. Starting from this, a new finite element model was created introducing improvements in the definition of the yarn geometry, the material properties and the number of Solid elements used for meshing the surfaces of the yarn. It will be shown in detail how the model is built. Validation was performed by comparing the prediction of the homogenized E 1 modulus of the fabric using different models and test results available from literature. A comparison between old and new results showed an unclear behavior which needed to be explained through additional tests. It was concluded that solid element model could have to be even more refined to obtain accurate results. Since such a refinement was not possible in the scope of this work, a new Shell element model was introduced instead. Simulation of mechanical test showed good agreement with models and test results found in literature. Finally an attempt was made to reduce the degrees of freedom of a complex TWF model with the use of superelement theory. Mechanical tests were simulated using the superelement TWF models in order to verify this technique. The results will be shown in detail and suggestions for future work will be made...|$|E

A pattern results from vertical and horizontal translations of the defining grid. Any such grid defines a tiling pattern.

40|$|TEXTILE-based {{composite}} materials are the rapidly developing light-weight engineering materials. Fabrics constitute the reinforcement {{component of the}} composite material. The fabrics used in composites manufacture {{are referred to as}} preforms and are especially engineered as a single-fabric system to impart reliability and performance. Preforms constituting continuous-fibres are producible through fabric manufacturing methods of weaving, knitting, braiding and certain nonwoven techniques. A number of novel techniques have evolved, particularly in the last three decades, to engineer 3 D fabrics. However, these new indispensable 3 D fabric manufacturing methods, which have been primarily devised to organize and assemble essentially three orthogonal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> (in the fabric-length, -width and thickness directions), have not been a matter of examination from the point of textile technology. A consequence of this has been the misrepresentation of a unique nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming principle and process as 3 D-weaving. The lack of proper technical information, terms and definitions have led to the mistaken classification of the patents of the various nonwoven 3 D fabric manufacturing developments in the weaving category over the years. To represent the nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming processes as 3 D-weaving is technically not correct even if they bear certain similarities with the weaving process design. This is because in these new processes, the foremost operation of shedding, which is central to the weaving principle and without which the weaving process cannot technically progress, is totally dispensed with. Consequently the obtaining process ceases to comply with the principle of weaving and the resulting 3 D fabric is a non-interlaced construction. Clearly this non-interlacing process happens to be fundamentally different from the firmly established interlacing characteristics of the weaving process. The nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming process is now recognized by the term 'noobing' and it is designed essentially to assemble three orthogonal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn,</b> without interlacing them, into a 3 D fabric. With this, the constituent <b>yarns</b> <b>of</b> the fabric are free of any crimp. In the absence of any interlacement, the fabric integrity has to be realized through a compulsory binding operation. Because the fabric integrity results from the outermost opposite `interconnected yarns', there is the risk of the fabric splitting up if cut at the surface or internally. The development of an experimental noobing device has upheld these integral characteristics. The noobing process can be classified into uniaxial and multiaxial types, of which the former is comprehensively analysed here as this process type has been mistaken for the 3 D-weaving process. The newly gained understanding shows this process could be utilized in the production of certain technical textiles other than preforms as it has a limited near-net shaping capability to produce few `simple' solid cross-sectional profiles. This process can also be employed to produce thick-walled tubular fabrics. The multiaxial noobing process, which has been regarded as multiaxial warp `knitting' process, does not figure in the main focus of the present study. To characterize the practically unknown 3 D-weaving process, the concept of 'dual-directional shedding' operation is introduced. The shedding operation of the conventional 2 D-weaving process is limited in its design to form a shed in only the fabric-width direction to enable interlacement <b>of</b> two orthogonal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> (a weft and either a single or a multiple layer warp). In the 3 D-weaving process, the dual-directional shedding operation forms multiple sheds in the fabric-width and also the fabric-thickness direction to effect interlacement <b>of</b> three orthogonal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> (two orthogonal <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> weft and a multilayer warp). Two distinct dual-directional shedding methods have been developed to demonstrate the practicability of the new concept. These methods have been specifically developed to provide `yarn-to-yarn interconnectivity' for producing a network-like 3 D woven 3 D fabric block. From such a block, preforms of any desired shape, not only cross-sectional profile, could be cut without the risk of its splitting. Such a course of preform manufacture, referred to as universal preforming, could be a new approach to produce preforms for certain composite material applications...|$|R
5000|$|Weaving is {{a method}} of textile {{production}} in which two distinct <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> or threads are interlaced {{at right angles to}} form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning [...] "that which is woven".) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.|$|R

It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface. The first question can be if hairiness is really important and why? The reason is obtaining deeper information about yarn structure and its changes during processing. Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post spinning operation and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand). The main factors influencing hairiness are: type <b>of</b> fibres, <b>yarn</b> twist, yarn count, blending ratio, yarn technology production, approach to yarn hairiness observation and measurement condition.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{rotor spinning}} unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter {{were found to}} be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer channel inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer channel inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer channel inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests.

40|$|Weaving {{is one of}} mankind’s oldest crafts. The process <b>of</b> {{interlacing}} two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> in an orthogonal way according a predefined {{pattern is}} a technology which {{is as old as}} human civilization. Over the centuries, the textile industry evolved into a high-tech industry, characterized by highly sophisticated production machines which operate mostly autonomously and are uncoupled from any human interaction. Built into safety relevant products like airbags, safety belts, fire resistant clothing, bullet-proof cloth or artificial vascular grafts, technical woven fabrics impose highest production quality standards. Reliable and fast quality assurance is thus crucial. The industrial standard approach for quality assurance is still based on human, manual inspection. In order to augment the production throughput, to achieve lower labor costs and to guarantee stable product quality, the development of reliable methods for fully automatic fabric quality control has become a vital topic for research around the world. Within this thesis, the development of a novel, loom-integrated automated visual inspection system for high resolution woven fabric defect detection is described. Accordingly, this work is divided into three major parts. Part I investigates a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 14 selected state-of-the-art fabric defect detection algorithms to assess the current detection performance of existing methods. The study is conducted with unified fabric image databases and assessment metrics and therefore represents the first fabric defect detection benchmark of this kind published in literature. Motivated by the benchmark results, Part II discusses the design of a novel, high-resolution traversing camera inspection system for locating and classifying potential defects in woven fabrics. The implemented prototype can track single yarns in real-time during production and measures fabrics with regards to geometry, extent, orientation and shape for the first time. This is a major improvement compared to hither to approaches that treat fabrics as near regular texture and apply pattern analysis algorithms to detect defects. The detailed description of the image processing pipeline is complemented by a comprehensive on-line evaluation and in-depth discussions about mechanical system integration, vibration damping, imaging strategies and product costs. The proposed image processing framework is finally extended in Part III by two additional algorithmic features. First, a method is discussed that allows an automatic classification of fabric weave patterns without any prior knowledge about the investigated material. Furthermore, an algorithm for adaptive measurement <b>of</b> changing <b>yarn</b> densities is presented.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computerized}} method {{has been proposed}} for automatic measurement and recognition <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> wet snarls from an image <b>of</b> snarled <b>yarn</b> samples captured in a water bath. After image acquisition, image conversion and individual snarled sample extraction, the yarn profile function was extracted from the separated binary image. Fast Fourier Transform and Adaptive Orientated Orthogonal Projective Decomposition were then incorporated into a pattern recognition algorithm <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl features by treating the yarn profile function as a one-dimensional signal. In addition to the number <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl turns, the method was also accurate and efficient for the detection <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> snarl height and width, which are unobtainable by the untwisting method. The effects of various factors on the yarn profile function were numerically examined, including distributions <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> diameter and snarl, {{and the level of}} random noise.

40|$|Aiming at {{hairiness}} measurement, {{a digital}} image acquisition system is constructed, based {{on which a}} novel algorithm is proposed {{in order to measure}} the number and length <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairiness. The algorithm {{can be used to make}} feature analysis <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> images captured continuously, and yarn hairiness features for quality evaluation <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairiness are determined. With pretreatment <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> image, including gray-scale transformation, background subtraction, image enhancement, dynamic threshold segmentation, tilt correction, image denoising and image segmentation, yarn hairiness image is obtained. Then the yarn hairiness image is treated by using thinning algorithm, so the thinned yarn hairiness image is obtained. With yarn axis and the margin of trunk as reference, and with proper baseline, yarn hairiness image skeleton is extracted at the pixel level, and the number <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairiness <b>of</b> different length is determined by statistics. Experimental results show that the precision of the new method is consistent with the visual observation method, and its deviation is within 5 %. The method can improve the efficiency and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairiness feature extraction...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the relationship between the internal defects <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> structures and the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>yarn,</b> we developed a yarn model which consists of mass and three types of springs for expression and construction, and bending. The yarn model can express the Euler buckling phenomenon depending on its bending stiffness. Using the yarn model, the tension relaxation simulations <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> package structures were performed, and it was found that our yarn model has a suffcient ability to express the influence of the bending property <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> on the internal defects like the circular buckling <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> package structures. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Photoshop {{software}} {{was used to}} do image analysis on the photos <b>of</b> spun <b>yarns.</b> The result showed that yarn could {{be divided into two}} parts: the surface hairs and the stem. Based on this finding, a mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> unevenness was built to analyze the relationship between yarn unevenness and surface hairiness. The relationships among the coefficients of mass variance <b>of</b> the <b>yarn,</b> the stem and the surface hairs, expressed as CVt, CVs and CVh, respectively, were investigated in detail. Results indicate that the CVs <b>of</b> an uneven <b>yarn</b> always coincides with the irregularity <b>of</b> the <b>yarn</b> hairiness. More specifically, the CVt <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> cannot be better than those <b>of</b> both <b>yarn</b> hairiness and stem (CVh and CVs), even if one of them is excessive. It is rare for CVt to be higher than CVs after removal <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairs. In particular, it is irrational for the CVt value to be higher than both CVs and CVh, which prompts a rethinking of the exact distribution <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> hairs on the yarn bod...|$|R
