5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E

500|$|In Sanskrit, {{the word}} yoga {{comes from the}} root [...] which means [...] "to add", [...] "to join", [...] "to unite", or [...] "to attach" [...] in its most common senses. By figurative {{extension}} from the yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses, the word took on broader meanings such as [...] "employment, use, application, performance" [...] (compare the figurative uses of [...] "to [...] " [...] as in [...] "to put something to some use"). All further developments of the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> word are post-Vedic. More prosaic moods such as [...] "exertion", [...] "endeavour", [...] "zeal", and [...] "diligence" [...] are also found in Indian epic poetry.|$|E

Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating [...] "we were looking for quality". Speaking of the novel itself, Greig called it [...] "a rich and evocative historical novel which engrosses with its vivid portrait of pre-revolutionary France", stating [...] "The qualities of Pure stood out for its memorable gothic tale of morality and mortality." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn.

40|$|There are {{different}} ways {{we use the}} expressions “extension” and “intension”. I specify {{in the first part}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper two basic <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> distinction, and try to show that the old metaphysical <b>sense,</b> by means <b>of</b> particular instance vs. universal, is more fundamental than the contemporary <b>sense</b> by means <b>of</b> substitutivity. In the second part, I argue that logic in general is essentially intensional, not only because logic is a rule-guided activity, but because even the extensional definition of a logic system presupposes an intensional notion of logical consequence...|$|R

2500|$|Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire {{based on}} the Boeke Prize-winning and Commonwealth Writers' Prize-nominated novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup.

The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: [...] "I wanted to get (across) the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums.

In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental.

The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
2500|$|Noted logician and philosopher Arthur Prior (originator of tense logic) {{has also}} drawn a {{distinction}} between what he calls A-facts and B-facts. The latter are facts about tenseless relations, such {{as the fact that}} the year 2025 is 25 years later than the year 2000. The former are tensed facts, such as the Jurassic age being in the past, or the end of the universe being in the future. Prior asks the reader to imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, saying [...] "thank goodness that's over." [...] Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sentence. It seems bizarre to be thankful that a headache is earlier than one's utterance, anymore than being thankful that the headache is later than one's utterance. Indeed, most people who say [...] "thank goodness that's over" [...] are not even thinking of their own utterance. Therefore, when people say [...] "thank goodness that's over," [...] they are thankful for an A-fact, and not a B-fact. Yet, A-facts are only possible on the A-theory of time.|$|E
