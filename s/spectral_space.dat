In the end although the <b>Spectral</b> <b>Space</b> Pirates manage to catch all seven Cosmos Stones, Seth and the Pterosaur defeat the Black Pterosaur.

In 1937 Stone [7] extended this to the dual equivalence of the category DLat of bounded distributive lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms and the category Spec of what later became known as <b>spectral</b> <b>spaces</b> and <b>spectral</b> maps. <b>Spectral</b> <b>spaces</b> provide a generalization of Stone spaces.

The general setting is {{the space of}} the semistar operations (of finite type), endowed with a Zariski-like topology, which {{turns out to be a}} natural topological extension of {{the space of the}} overrings of an integral domain, endowed with a topology introduced by Zariski. One of the key tool is a recent characterization of <b>spectral</b> <b>spaces,</b> based on the ultrafilter topology, given in Finocchiaro, Commun Algebra, 42 : 1496 - 1508, 2014, [15].

However, modern radio-astronomical observatories such as VLA, LOFAR and ALMA have a very large bandwidth over which they can observe. Because of the limited <b>spectral</b> <b>space</b> at radio frequencies, these frequency bands cannot be completely allocated to radio astronomy.

As the usually used visualization programs do not support the EAS3 file format directly, it is often necessary to covert the data to the corresponding file format. Commands in the EAS3 program are given by a text interface, a graphical user interface does not exist. Completion of the commands in the EAS3 command line provides support for interactive usage but for an extensive help, the descriptions on the webpage are necessary.|$|E
50|$|Though most of {{the pattern}} is removed from PAL and NTSC-encoded signals with a comb filter (designed to {{segregate}} the two signals where the luma spectrum may overlap into the <b>spectral</b> <b>space</b> used by the chroma) by modern displays, some can still be left {{in certain parts of}} the picture. Such parts are usually sharp edges on the picture, sudden color or brightness changes along the picture or certain repeating patterns, such as a checker board on clothing. Dot crawl patterns can be completely removed by connecting the display to the signal source through a cable or signal format different from composite video (yellow RCA cable) or a coaxial cable, such as S-Video, which carries the chroma signal in a separate band all its own, leaving the luma to use its entire band, including the usually empty parts when they are needed. FM SECAM is a continuous spectrum, so unlike PAL and NTSC even a perfect digital comb filter could not entirely separate SECAM Colour and Luminance.|$|E
