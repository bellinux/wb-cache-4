The saturation deficit (D 0) estimated within the canopies explored by Idso is then less than 1 kPa even when the deficit in ambient air approaches 30 kPa.

B. 115 (2011) 10509 - 10517), {{is applied to}} study: (1) vapour-liquid equilibria and (2) vapour-solid equilibria. Using bins in the simulation, {{we are able to}} sample space very efficiently, with larger displacements of particles in regions where densities are low and smaller displacements in regions where densities are very high. Furthermore, by exchanging particles between bins within the simulation box, we can take full advantage of the creation/destruction feature of a grand canonical simulation (built within a canonical ensemble) which enables the system to achieve equilibrium more rapidly. To illustrate the application of the new technique, we simulate the phase equilibria of argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide to obtain thermodynamic properties of the fluid phases including: saturation densities of the gas and condensed phases, the <b>saturation</b> <b>vapour</b> or sublimation <b>pressure,</b> the enthalpy of vapourization or sublimation, and the surface tension at the interface. The new scheme is superior to the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method because the latter suffers from the extremely low probability of exchanging particles when one box is very dense, which makes it unsuitable for the study of vapour-solid equilibria and of vapour-liquid equilibria at low temperatures.

40|$|A {{foam film}} made of pure liquid can be {{stabilized}} by evaporation. This is demonstrated experimentally {{for water and}} alkane films formed in a Scheludko cell at controlled saturation of the ambient air. A mechanism of the stabilization is proposed: evaporation leads to a local decrease of {{the temperature in the}} centre of the film; the meniscus acts as a thermostat and maintains a higher temperature at the film periphery. The resulting temperature gradient brings about a surface tension gradient causing a stabilizing thermal Marangoni flow that carries fluid from the meniscus to the interior of the film. The film thickness is quasi-stationary and gradually decreases as the meniscus cools due to the evaporation. At a certain critical meniscus temperature, the film reaches a critical thickness at which the Marangoni effect can no longer counteract the combined action of the capillary pressure and the van der Waals attraction, and thefilm breaks. The lifetime of the film is estimated {{as a function of the}} film size and the experimental conditions (temperature, <b>saturation,</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure,</b> capillary pressure).

The newborn cavity grows and splits releasing many minute bubbles to downstream, as the flowrate increases. To see if this phenomenonoccurs inwater too,water flows through rect-angular and cylindrical constrictions have beenmeticulously observed with very high resolution in terms of both time and space. As a result it has been confirmed that the same phenomenon does occur in separating water flows as well, although the developing process of a newborn cav-ity in water flows is different from that in oil flows probably depending on a large difference in Reynolds numbers between both flows. When the flowrate is substantially increased from that for the cavity inception, a large attached cavity is formed on the wall just downstream of the separation point, as it occurred in corresponding oil flows. The pressure inside the cavity has proved to be almost equal to the <b>saturation</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of water...|$|E

We also examined leaves of these species for anatomical differences to determine whether this could explain differences in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Finally, we conducted a split-root experiment {{with one of those}} species to look for interactions between xylem abscisic acid concentration, predawn water potential, leaf area to root mass ratio and stomatal responses to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in all species. Leaves that expanded in the ‘dry’ season were more sensitive to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences than those that had expanded in the ‘wet’ season. The value of leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference where 50 % of extrapolated maximum stomatal conductance would occur was 5. 5 kPa for wet season but only 3. 4 kPa for dry season leaves. In the wet season, transpiration rate increased with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in most example species. However, in the dry season, transpiration was constant as leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences increased in most cases. There were significant changes in the proportion of cell wall exposed to air space in leaves, between wet and dry seasons, in three of four species examined. In the split-root experiment, a very mild water stress increased stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences, and stomatal conductivity declined linearly with decreasing predawn water potential. However, levels of ABA in the xylem did not change, and stomatal sensitivity to exogenous ABA did not change. The ratio of leaf area to root mass declined during water stress and was correlated to changes in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences...|$|R
