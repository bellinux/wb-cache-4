There {{he received a}} traditional education, including mastery of fanorona, a local board game believed to develop intelligence {{and the ability to}} think strategically. Young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform kabary (a <b>stylized</b> <b>form</b> of public address), including the judicious use of ohabolana (proverbs) to persuasively make a point. Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha, a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles. Around the age of 12, Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under the supervision of his grandfather, King Andriambelomasina, at Amboatany and the royal court in Ambohimanga.|$|E

25|$|The {{presentation}} of each result {{is given in}} a <b>stylized</b> <b>form,</b> which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the 'enunciation', which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). Then comes the 'setting-out', which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the 'definition' or 'specification', which restates the enunciation {{in terms of the}} particular figure. Then the 'construction' or 'machinery' follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the 'proof' itself follows. Finally, the 'conclusion' connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female {{pubic hair}} is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, pubic hair was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in <b>stylized</b> <b>form,</b> {{as was the case with}} Greek graphic art. The same was true in much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair. In Renaissance northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{snow leopard}} in {{heraldry}} is sometimes known in English as the ounce. The cat {{has long been}} used as a political symbol, the Aq Bars ('White Leopard'), by Tatars, Kazakhs, and Bulgars, among others. A snow leopard is found on the official seal of the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the former 10,000 Kazakhstani tenge banknote also featured one on the reverse. A mythical winged Aq Bars is found in the national coat of arms of Tatarstan, the seal of the city of Samarqand, Uzbekistan, and (also with a crown) the old coat of arms of the Kazakh capital, Astana. In Kyrgyzstan, it has been used in highly <b>stylized</b> <b>form</b> in the modern emblem of the capital, Bishkek, and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association. A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of Shushensky District, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. This is all the more surprising because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later evocation of the associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only graphic representations of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a <b>stylized</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

[...] While {{the origins of the}} hira gasy are uncertain, oral history attributes its modern form to 18th century Merina king Andrianampoinimerina, who reportedly employed musicians to gather the public together for royal speeches and announcements (kabary) and to entertain them as they labored on public works projects such as building dikes to irrigate the rice paddies surrounding Antananarivo. [...] Over time, these musicians formed independent troupes who used and continue to use the non-threatening performance format to explore sensitive social and political themes in the public arena.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was what}} Wolfe called New Journalism, {{in which some}} journalists and essayists experimented {{with a variety of}} {{literary}} techniques, mixing them with the traditional ideal of dispassionate, even-handed reporting. Wolfe experimented with four literary devices not normally associated with feature writing: scene-by-scene construction, extensive dialogue, multiple points of view, and detailed description of individuals' status-life symbols (the material choices people make) in writing this <b>stylized</b> <b>form</b> of journalism. He later referred to this style as literary journalism. Of the use of status symbols, Wolfe has said, [...] "I think every living moment of a human being’s life, unless the person is starving or in immediate danger of death in some other way, is controlled by a concern for status." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of kabary in Madagascar, which predates Merina King Andrianampoinimerina (17871810), nonetheless owes {{much of its}} modern form, usage and meaning to standards set at his court.

50|$|Another way to {{categorize}} the palos is {{with respect to}} their musical origin.

2500|$|The Hebrew {{alphabet}} ( [...] , [...] ), known variously {{by scholars}} as the Jewish script, square script and block script, is an abjad script {{used in the}} writing of the Hebrew language, also adapted as an alphabet script {{in the writing of}} other Jewish languages, most notably in Yiddish (lit.

At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances.
