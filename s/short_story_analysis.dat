40|$|Since {{short story}} theory {{describes}} the genre as centered around particular individuals, and its concept {{of time as}} defined by the moment, it seems rather impossible for a short story to do anything with history, which is a long term narrative of larger groups of people. This somewhat disinterestedness of literary critics in historical short narratives is surprising, because the rise of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> <b>analysis</b> goes back to {{the same time as the}} postmodern concepts of history. Problematization of history, the most important achievement of postmodern metafiction, might be performed by a short story too. This paper analyzes Kálmán Mikszáth's historical short fiction in this theoretical frame, first of all because he always makes his readers realize the story's epistemological frames, which in historical plots may hint at the doubts concerning the notion of history...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the narrative techniques in <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> by Stig Dagerman, {{one of the}} leading Swedish writers of the 1940 s. I focus on the auctorial narrative situation, in which the narrator exposes his presence in the literary text, taking a position between fiction and reality outside the literature. My observation is that this phenomenon is characteristic for Dagerman’s <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> and that it can be further examined through the perspective of skaz, the oral form of narration. In the first part of my article I briefly discuss different concepts of skaz presented by different scholars, e. g., Eikhenbaum, Vinogradov and Bakhtin, and I point out their limitations. In my analysis I use Titunik’s model of skaz, which makes it possible for me to describe this narrative device in the most complex way with different kinds of determinants, namely grammatical, situative, expressive, allocutive, dialectical and semantic ones. In the second part of my article I show how these determinants manifest themselves in Dagerman’s <b>short</b> <b>stories.</b> The third section of the article includes my conclusions from the analysis. Dagerman uses the technique of skaz in his <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> frequently and intentionally, both in homodiegetic and in the heterodiegetic narration. He applies all determinants of skaz from Titunik’s model, a number of different ones at the same time. He uses dialectical determinants of skaz at the lowest pitch, he rather concentrates on expressive and allocutive ones. The narrator does not only mark his position in the literary text, but he also draws the attention to the presence of the narratee. In this way the very act of communication is stressed in Dagerman’s <b>short</b> <b>stories.</b> The <b>analysis</b> of skaz can therefore make an interesting contribution to the studies of communication strategies in Dagerman’s <b>short</b> <b>stories...</b>|$|R

The Correlation {{between the}} Ability of Reading Comprehension, Language Attitude and the Ability of <b>Short</b> <b>Story</b> Appreciation at Elementary School Students In Gugus Yudistira, Selogiri Wonogiri. Thesis: Surakarta: Indonesian Education Study Program, Post Graduate Program, Sebelas Maret University. June 2009. This {{research}} aimed {{to determine the}} correlation between (1) the ability of reading comprehension {{and the ability of}} <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation, (2) language attitude and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation, and (3) both the ability of reading comprehension and language attitude together and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation. The research was carried out at elementary schools in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri, from January to June 2009. The research method used was descriptive of correlational. The population of the research were the elementary school students in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri. The sample consisted of 120 students who were taken by using simple random sampling. The instruments used for data collection were: test for the ability of reading comprehension, test for the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation; and questionary for language attitude. The technique used for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study shows that: (1) there is a positive correlation between the ability of reading comprehension and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation (r y 1 =. 87 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18); (2) there is a positive correlation between language attitude and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation (r y 2 =. 78 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18; (3) there is a positive correlation between both the ability of reading comprehension and language attitude together and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation (R y. 12 =. 86 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18). The above results show that both the ability of reading comprehension and language attitude simultaneously give significant contribution to the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation. It means that both variables could be good predictors for the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation. The <b>analysis</b> also indicates that the correlation between the ability of reading comprehension and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation is stronger than that language attitude and the ability of <b>short</b> <b>story</b> appreciation.

For my thesis I chose to translate one of the <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> of Agatha Christie. I made a lot of research on literary translation, on its problems, techniques and theories.

30|$|There is {{empirical}} research {{evidence that the}} way learners conceive assessment determines their final achievement (Brown and Hirschfeld 2008). Thus, {{it is important to}} explore learners’ conception of assessment. In the current study, a group of postgraduate students’ conception of language assessment was investigated via the analysis of their metaphors and <b>short</b> <b>stories.</b> As the <b>analysis</b> of the metaphors showed, the participants in the current study covered all the purposes outlined by Fulcher (2010). Therefore, it seems logical to conclude that these participants are well aware of the purposes of language assessment. One possible reason could be these participants’ relatively high assessment literacy as postgraduate candidates in Applied Linguistics. Another explanation for the participants’ relatively high level of language assessment literacy could be attributed to the fact that apart from being postgraduate students most of them were or had been language teachers and had experienced teaching and assessing English as a second or foreign language.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this text is {{to show how the}} mother motif is portrayed in four {{selected}} novels by Alfred Kämpe, but the thesis also serves the purpose of emphasizing the fact that the mother motif can be seen interacting with the class motif. This text will account for a new insight into the motifs in Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar. Known {{as one of the first}} authors to write in the genre of working-class literature in Sweden Kämpe’s texts provide motifs common for this genre such as class, identity and solidarity. As this thesis shows there is yet another motif that should be included among these typical Swedish working class literature motifs: the mother motive. Based on Nina Lykke’s theory of intersectionality, this text will show how the mother motif is portrayed in four of the <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> in Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar (1907) (“Valle”, ”Svinsjukan”, ”Mamsell Johansson”, ”Hjälpareflickorna”) and further more show how the mother motif, by interacting with the class motif, contributes to the construction of gender and class in the <b>short</b> <b>stories.</b> The <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> have been chosen due to the simple fact that they are the novels in Trälar that portray the mother motif in its clearest. The analysis demonstrates that Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar shows a positive approach to the normalized conceptions about the mother. This positive approaching shows how the mother motif helps constructing both gender and class in this iconic Swedish working-class collection of <b>short</b> <b>stories</b> Furthermore the <b>analysis</b> also shows that it is in the context of the class motif that the mother motif appears. Due to the fact that the mother motif can be seen interacting with this, for the genre, important motif I would argue that the mother motif is of the same importance when we, as literature scholars, talk about Alfred Kämpe’s Trälar...|$|R

40|$|Problem Statement: The Internet as a {{tool that}} {{presents}} many challenges has drawn the attention of researchers {{in the field of}} education and especially foreign language teaching. However, there has been a lack of information about the true nature of these environments. In recent years, determination of the patterns of negotiation of meaning as a way to delve in these environments has grown in popularity. Purpose of the Study: The current study was an effort to determine the types and frequencies of negotiation of meaning in the interaction of Malaysian students as English as a second language learners and, furthermore, to compare findings of this study with correspondent previous studies.   To this end, two research questions were posed for this study: (a) what types of negotiation of meaning emerge in text-based synchronous CMC environments? and (b) Are there any differences between findings of this study and previous studies in terms of negotiation of meaning functions in this environment?  Method: Participants of this study were fourteen English as second language learners at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). They were involved in a series of discussions over selected <b>short</b> <b>stories.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of students’ chat logs was carried out through computer - mediated discourse analysis (CMDA). Findings and Results: This study yielded 10 types of functions in negotiation of meaning, which are clarification request, confirmation, confirmation check, correction or self correction, elaboration, elaboration request, reply clarification or definition, reply confirmation, reply elaboration, and vocabulary check.   Furthermore, findings of this study indicated that students negotiated with an average of 2. 10 per 100 words. According to the findings of this study, the most - frequently used functions were confirmation, elaboration, and elaboration request and the least frequently used functions were vocabulary check, reply confirmation, and reply clarification. The findings of this study were in line with the findings of previous studies in that the proficiency of the participants influences the amount of negotiation for meaning strategies that occur. Conclusions and Recommendations:  Findings of this study will give insight to teachers, learners, and researchers in the field of SLA and will help to sustain their liveliness and curiosity. Taking into account the current situation of Malaysia as the country that host so many international students from all over the world, future studies of these kinds can focus on examining the factor of proficiency in different dyads and its effect on students’ interactions in terms of negotiation of meaning.
