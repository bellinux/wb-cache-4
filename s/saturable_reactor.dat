50|$|Because the {{required}} inductance to achieve dimming {{varies with the}} size of the load, <b>saturable</b> <b>reactors</b> often have multiple taps, allowing a small inductance to be used with a large load or a larger inductance to be used with a smaller load.

50|$|During turn on, {{the device}} has a maximum dI/dt rating {{limiting}} {{the rise of}} current. This is to allow the entire bulk of the device to reach turn on before full current is reached. If this rating is exceeded, {{the area of the}} device nearest the gate contacts will overheat and melt from over current. The rate of dI/dt is usually controlled by adding a <b>saturable</b> <b>reactor</b> (turn-on snubber), although turn-on dI/dt is a less serious constraint with GTO thyristors than it is with normal thyristors, {{because of the way the}} GTO is constructed from many small thyristor cells in parallel.

In addition, because of the particular arrangement of the power windings, the control winding, and the core, the control winding is well isolated from the AC power. The AC power windings are also usually configured so that they cancel out AC voltages {{that would otherwise be}} induced into the control winding.|$|R
50|$|Visually a mag amp device may {{resemble}} a transformer, but {{the operating principle}} {{is quite different from}} a transformer - essentially the mag amp is a <b>saturable</b> <b>reactor.</b> It makes use of magnetic saturation of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transformer cores. For controlled saturation characteristics, the magnetic amplifier employs core materials that have been designed to have a specific B-H curve shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are often used in normal transformers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of the <b>saturable</b> <b>reactor</b> on the reverse recovery process. This was done by PSPICE (MicroSim Inc.) simulation of an equivalent circuit that represents the problem on hand including a qualitative account of all major losses. The simulation results that were verified by experimental results. point out to the merit of connecting a bypass resistor in parallel with the <b>saturable</b> <b>reactor.</b> The simulation methodology developed in the paper could be helpful in studying other reverse recovery problems. I. INTRODUCI 10 N Auxiliary-switch assisted soft switchers were shown to retain the desirable characteristics of PWM converters with relatively minor penalty for the soft commutations gained. The soft switching strategy (Fig. 1) proposed in [1] offers an optimal design of the auxiliary switch circuitry by decoupling the extra capacitance (Cr 1), needed to achieve ZVS at turn off, from the turn on snubber (Lr and Q 2). Consequently, the energy stored in Cr 2 does not funnel into the resonance inductor (Lr), averting thereby the problem of large peak currents through the auxiliary switch. A thorough analysis of the switcher of Fig. 1 [2] shows that this strategy ensures soft switching of all power devices leaving but one problem: the reverse recovery of diodes D 2 and D 3. The problem arises at the end of the discharge cycle of Lr (Fig. 2 a) due the snapping of the reverse current through these diodes. This difficulty could be alleviated by introducing a <b>saturable</b> <b>reactor</b> (SR) in series with Lr to block the reverse current of the diodes (Fig. 2 b). However, the design of the SR is far from being simple since it has to accommodate conflicting objectives: low overall losses, low SR losses (to prevent overheating of the small device), and fast discharge of the Lr- Ls assembly...|$|E

40|$|The {{misalignment}} and {{displacement of}} inductively coupled coils in a {{wireless power transfer}} system (WPT) can degrade the power efﬁciency and limit the amount of power that can be transferred. Coil misalignment leads the primary coil driver to operate in an untuned state which causes non-optimum switching operation and results in an increase in switching losses. This paper presents a novel method to electronically tune a Class E inverter used as a primary coil driver in an inductive WPT system to minimize the detrimental effects of misalignment between the inductively coupled coils which may occur during operation. The tuning method uses current controlled inductors (<b>saturable</b> <b>reactors)</b> and a variable switching frequency to achieve optimum switching conditions regardless of the misalignment.

40|$|Recently, a {{remarkable}} advance {{is seen in}} the application on the laser equipment, particle beam accelerator, and pulsed X-ray equipment. These apparatus requires an intermittent high voltage or large current power source to do work, and those power sources are required to have a high reliability and a durability. For this reason, a power supply using passive circuit elements is often used for these apparatus.

40|$|Ergon Energy {{operates}} tens {{of thousands}} of kilometers of Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) distribution feeders in remote parts of Queensland to deliver electrical energy to small customer loads, scattered sparsely over vast areas. Ergon Energy has identified voltage regulation as one of the key issues being faced in this area, as loads continue to grow in rural distribution networks. These voltage regulation issues cause capacity limitations on the SWER feeders. Voltage drop during peak load periods is one issue, but high voltages during low load periods caused by the Ferranti effect is another key factor on long SWER feeders. Currently, Ergon uses fixed shunt reactors to control line overvoltages during low load periods, but these reactors add to the line load during peak load conditions. At AUPEC 2005, Central Queensland University presented a thyristor controlled reactor option as a potential solution to this problem. This paper follows on from that and presents two lower technology solutions, namely switched <b>reactors</b> and <b>saturable</b> <b>reactors.</b> Both options aim to reduce the steady state voltage range between peak load and low load, thus freeing up additional capacity on the SWER feeder for growing load.

40|$|The preponderant {{application}} of rectifier circuits is the powering of dc loads from the ac utility line. Ordinary rectifier circuits present a nonlinear load impedance to the utility line, thereby generating harmonic currents, {{and contributing to}} the harmonic current problem. There are many active and passive rectifier circuits offering reduced harmonic currents, and in this work a methodology is developed by which these circuits may be analyzed and compared. Rectifier circuits can be classified as either active or passive. A passive rectifier circuit contains passive components (inductors, capacitors, <b>saturable</b> <b>reactors,</b> etc.), and passive switches (rectifier diodes) only. Active rectifier circuits use at least one controllable active switch (power transistor), in addition to passive switches and passive components. The performance characteristics of these circuits can be assessed {{with respect to a}} fictional device called the ideal rectifier. This assessment allows direct comparison of various approaches, passive or active, using the ideal rectifier as the common reference. Rectifier circuit performance may also be compared against specified requirements. The next topic considered is the analysis of active rectifier circuits employing a pwm (pulse width modulation) converter as a means to control power flow within the rectifier circuit. The pwm converter is modeled using the pwm switch method. A large-signal nonlinear pwm switch model is used for modeling large-signal rectifier circuit behavior, and models are developed for operation in either the continuous or discontinuous conduction mode. Similarly, a small-signal model is developed for small-signal considerations. In addition, for pwm converters operating in the continuous conduction mode, the effect of lossy resistive elements inside the converter are accounted for in the pwm switch model, and this modeling technique is shown to give results identical to those obtained via the state-space averaging method. The methods developed are then applied to the analysis of the boost rectifier operating in the discontinuous conduction mode. Three control schemes are compared, each offering a different compromise between circuit complexity and performance. Finally, a design example is given, and experimental results are provided...|$|R
