Slicing is an important decomposition technique for program understanding[3].

Different <b>slice</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been used in}} the design of soil nails for stabilising substandard cut slopes, with Janbu's simplified and Morgenstern-Price methods being the most popular ones in Hong Kong. This paper investigates the effects of the two different <b>slice</b> <b>methods</b> on the soil nail design. A number of actual cut slopes involving soil nail design are studied in the paper. For each case, the two different <b>slice</b> <b>methods</b> are used to calculate the factors of safety before and after the stabilisation works. Soil nails are designed according to the current design practice. The corresponding costs of the proposed soil nailing works are then estimated. The two <b>slice</b> <b>methods</b> are compared on the basis of both slope safety and construction cost. It is found that the construction cost of soil nailing stabilisation works adopting Janbu's simplified method could be 10 % to 90 % higher than that adopting the Morgenstern-Price method under the same safety standards.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, {{the problem}} of {{determining}} pseudo-dynamic pressure and its associated forces on a rigid vertical retaining wall is solved analytically using the horizontal <b>slices</b> <b>method</b> for both reinforced and unreinforced walls. The use of this method {{in conjunction with the}} suggested equations and unknowns offers a pseudo-dynamic method that is then compared with the results of an available software. In the proposed method, different seismic accelera-tions have been modeled at different soil structure heights. Reinforced soil pressure on a retaining wall and the angle of the critical failure wedge are calculated using the new formulation. It is shown that as the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient increases the angle of the critical failure wedge is reduced and that the maximum extension force can be increased for each layer by using stronger and longer reinforcements. The results of the pseudo-dynamic method show that both vertical and horizontal seismic accelerations are essential coefficients for calculation of the required length and extension force of the reinforcements and that their importance increases as the vertical and horizontal seismic accelerations increase. Also, the location of the application point of the resultant pressure rises as the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient increases...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of real-time 3 D ultrasound (US) {{makes it possible}} to consider image-based tracking of subcutaneous soft tissue targets for computer guided diagnosis and therapy. We propose a 3 D transrectal US based tracking system for precise prostate biopsy sample localisation. The aim is to improve sample distribution, to enable targeting of unsampled regions for repeated biopsies, and to make post-interventional quality controls possible. Since the patient is not immobilized, since the prostate is mobile and {{due to the fact that}} probe movements are only constrained by the rectum during biopsy acquisition, the tracking system must be able to estimate rigid transformations that are beyond the capture range of common image similarity measures. We propose a fast and robust multi-resolution attribute-vector registration approach that combines global and local optimization methods to solve this problem. Global optimization is performed on a probe movement model that reduces the dimensionality of the search space and thus renders optimization efficient.

40|$|Passive {{resistance}} is a significantly important factor for successful design {{and performance of}} various structures like anchors, bulkheads, retaining walls etc. Several analytical methods have been introduced {{time to time to}} predict the passive resistance for retaining walls supporting soil as the backfill. Most of these methods for the analysis are based on linear failure criterion. Whereas; experimental investigations, theoretical analysis and failed structures have indicated that the rupture surface is supposed to be nonlinear for the most practical environment. Thus, the assumption of planar sliding surface is supposed to underestimate the lateral earth pressure on the active side, which may make retaining walls unsatisfactorily designed at the passive side for support depending on earth pressures. For this reason, the nonlinear analyses were introduced in the earth pressure theories. The methodologies for nonlinear analysis under seismic loading conditions are mostly based on the assumption of log spiral failure surface. Eminent researchers have predicted the failure surface to be a combination of log spiral and straight line. In this paper an effort has been made to derive the analytical expression of passive earth pressure coefficient on the retaining wall from the c-Ф backfill subjected to both horizontal and vertical seismic coefficients. The solution has been carried out by using Horizontal <b>Slices</b> <b>Method</b> (HSM) and limit equilibrium principles to generate a non-linear failure surface.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{echocardiography}} (3 DE) calculates {{left ventricular}} volumes (LVV) and ejection fraction (EF) without geometric assumptions, but prolonged analysis time limits its routine use. This {{study was designed}} to validate a modified 3 DE method for rapid and accurate LVV and EF calculation compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Forty subjects included 15 normal volunteers (group A) and 25 patients with segmental wall motion abnormalities and global hypokinesis caused by ischemic heart disease (group B) who underwent 3 DE with precordial rotational acquisition technique (2 -degree interval with electrocardiographic and respiratory gating) and MRI at 0. 5 T, electrocardiogram (ECG) -triggered multislice multiphase T 1 -weighted fast field echo. End-diastolic and end-systolic LVV and EF were calculated from both techniques with Simpson's rule by manual endocardial tracing of equidistant parallel left ventricular short-axis slices. Slicing from the 3 DE data sets were done by both 2. 9 -mm slice thickness (method 3 DE-A) and by 8 equidistant short-axis <b>slices</b> (<b>method</b> 3 DE-B); for MRI analysis, 9 -mm slice thickness was used. Analysis time required for manual endocardial tracing of end-diastolic and end-systolic short-axis slices was 10 minutes for the 3 DE-B method compared with 40 minutes by the 3 DE-A method. For all 40 subjects the mean +/- SD of end-diastolic LVV (mL) were 181 +/- 76, 179 +/- 73, and 182 +/- 76; for end-systolic LVV (mL), 120 +/- 76, 120 +/- 75, and 122 +/- 77; and for EF (%), 39 +/- 18, 38 +/- 18, and 38 +/- 18 for MRI, 3 DE-A, and 3 DE-B methods, respectively. The differences between 3 DE-A and 3 DE-B with MRI for calculating end-diastolic and end-systolic LVV and EF were not significant for the whole group of subjects {{as well as for the}} subgroups. The 3 DE-B method had excellent correlation and close limits of agreement with MRI for calculating end-diastolic and end-systolic LVV and EF: r = 0. 98 (- 1. 3 +/- 26. 6), 0. 99 (- 1. 6 +/- 21. 2), and 0. 99 (0. 2 +/- 5. 2), respectively. The correlation between 3 DE-A and MRI were r = 0. 97, 0. 98, and 0. 98, and the limits of agreement were - 1. 4 +/- 36, - 0. 6 +/- 26, and 0. 6 +/- 8 for calculating end-diastolic and end-systolic LVV and EF, respectively. In addition, excellent correlation and close limits of agreement between 3 DE-A and 3 DE-B with MRI for LVV and EF calculation was also found for the subgroups. Intraobserver and interobserver variability (SEE) of MRI for calculating end-diastolic and end-systolic LVV and EF were 6. 3, 4. 7, and 2. 1; and 13. 6, 11. 5, and 4. 7; respectively, whereas that for 3 DE-B were 3. 1, 4. 4, and 2. 2; and 6. 2, 3. 8, and 3. 6; respectively.

The lack of existing solutions is really hard to understand since the application domain for slicing binaries {{is similar to that}} for slicing high-level languages. In this paper we present a method for the interprocedural static slicing of binary executables. We applied our <b>slicing</b> <b>method</b> to real size binaries and achieved an interprocedural slice size of between 56 %- 68 %. We used conservative approaches to handle unresolved function calls and branching instructions. Our current implementation contains an imprecise (but safe) memory dependence model as well. However, this conservative <b>slicing</b> <b>method</b> might still be useful in analysing large binary programs. In the paper we suggest some improvements to eliminate useless edges from dependence graphs as well. 1...|$|R
40|$|The STL {{model has}} become a {{standard}} in rapid prototyping (RP) technology, but slice errors are high because of tessellation. To improve the precision of slice contours, a novel <b>slicing</b> <b>method</b> is presented to compute accurate contour curves based on an STL model. First, the normal vector of a triangle facet to be sliced is calculated. An interpolation curve between two vertices is constructed in a normal section to approximate the original curve in the normal section {{in terms of the}} position of the two vertices and the tangent vector at the two vertices. The exact points of the slice contour are obtained by calculating the intersection points between the interpolation curve and the slice plane. Finally, accurate smooth contours are achieved by fitting the intersection points with a cubic B- spline curve. The experimental results indicate that the presented <b>slicing</b> <b>method</b> improves the precision of cross contours...|$|R
