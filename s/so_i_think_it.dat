500|$|Astrophysicist Adam Frank {{served as}} a {{scientific}} consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood. Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E
500|$|The rating did {{not come}} without its share of controversy. Reginald Dennis {{described}} to the reaction that followed Minya Oh's review: [...] "I was happy, Jon was happy, Nas was happy, everybody was happy — except {{for all of the}} people who felt that The Chronic should have also gotten a 5." [...] Only two years prior, Dr. Dre's groundbreaking The Chronic failed to earn the coveted rating, despite redefining the musical landscape of hip hop. It was later revealed that while everybody at the magazine knew it was an instant classic, they decided to comply with the strict policy of staying away from a perfect rating. Subsequently, when Nas's album was exempted from this moratorium, many fans pointed to this decision as a confirmation of journalistic bias towards East Coast hip hop. Despite receiving criticism over his staff's earlier review of The Chronic, Reginald Dennis continues to defend the decision to award Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating: [...] "I’m just happy that Illmatic is universally acclaimed as a classic, so no one can accuse me of dropping the ball... And if I hadn’t gone through what I did with The Chronic, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to allow for the bending of my policy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> all worked out well.” ...|$|E

It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be hard to get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done.

In a 2015 interview, former president Chuck Beames (2014–2016) explained, [...] "SpaceX was a partner, {{and like a}} lot of partnerships, it was just determined that it was best we went our separate ways – different ambitions. We were interested in their engines, but Elon and his team, they’re about going to Mars, and we’re just in a different place, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a parting of the ways that was amicable".|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte Gainsbourg as [...] "She": French actress Eva Green was {{initially}} approached {{for the female}} lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: [...] "Charlotte came in and said, 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a decision she made very early and she stuck to it.

2500|$|Conan Smith, a businessperson {{quoted in}} a 2012 article by The Ann Arbor News, stated the most {{significant}} reason Washtenaw County, including Ann Arbor, is not often included in definitions of Metro Detroit {{is that there is}} a [...] "lack of affinity that Washtenaw County as a whole has with Wayne County and Detroit or Oakland County and Macomb". Ann Arbor is nearly 43 miles by car from downtown Detroit, and developed separately as a university city, with its own character. Smith said that county residents [...] "just don't yet see ourselves as a natural part of that [...] region, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> feels a little forced to a lot of people, and they're scared about it." ...|$|E

He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices.

[...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a hard place for people to accept as I came in.
