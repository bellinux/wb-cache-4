50|$|Triple-selection {{machines}} {{have had}} some success in office settings, where the target customers are adults. An advantage of triple-selection machines over stands with separate heads {{is that they are}} quicker to service because one key opens the whole machine. Moreover, most triple selection machines have a <b>spill</b> <b>tray,</b> which can help prevent store owners from becoming annoyed at having to sweep up spilled candy. A disadvantage is that the presentation area is smaller than with a globe or panel head, and customers cannot see all products from all angles. In addition, three choices of candy are not always necessary, and may result in spoilage if one product moves slowly.|$|E
40|$|An animal feeder {{for use in}} a {{metabolic}} cage is introduced. The feeder includes a confined passageway and an adjustable notched gate proceeding a food cup. The gate is adjusted so that the entry area to the food cup approximates the cross sectional head area of the animal. Food ejected from the food cup by a caged animal is dropped through a grate into a <b>spill</b> <b>tray...</b>|$|E
50|$|All systems {{should be}} placed on a raised or sealed platform, not in direct contact with the earth. Each system should also be fitted with {{chemical}} <b>spill</b> <b>trays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{involves}} controlling {{a waiter}} {{from one side}} of the screen to the other and back again, hopping in and out of lifts, and trying not to <b>spill</b> the drinks <b>tray</b> he is carrying to the beckoning customer on the opposite side of the screen.|$|R
50|$|Rally Fries are a {{baseball}} tradition started by Mariners broadcaster Mike Blowers in 2007. During {{a game against}} the Cincinnati Reds, a fan tried to catch a foul ball along the right-field line but in turn <b>spilled</b> his <b>tray</b> of french fries along the track. While chatting on the air and seeing the mishap, Blowers' partner, Dave Sims, suggested that he should send a new tray of fries to the fan. Blowers agreed, and sent his intern to deliver a plate of fries to the man.|$|R

When it is time to remove the roasted turkey from the oven, she is drunk and out-of-control. She <b>spills</b> the roasting <b>tray</b> and the perfectly roasted turkey lands heavily on the kitchen floor. Most of the family is horrified and tries to help Krisha up from the floor and salvage the meal. Doyle only looks on and laughs.|$|R
5000|$|... "A black waiter accidentally <b>spilled</b> a <b>tray</b> {{of glasses}} on the floor. Nikki Blair, the {{restaurant}} owner, fired {{the man on the}} spot for having disturbed Mr. Sinatra. Frank, however, had other ideas. He called Blair over to the poker table, grabbed him by the shirt and asked Blair, [...] "Nikki, how much is one of those glasses worth?" [...] "About 5 dollars," [...] replied Blair. Sinatra then told the waiter to break every glass he could find in the kitchen.After several hundred glasses were broken, Sinatra motioned one of his bodyguards to give him (Sinatra) a thick roll of $100 bills. Frank then handed the roll to Blair and gave the now terrified restaurauteur some chilling advice: [...] "Nikki, this guy can now break as many glasses as he wants {{for the rest of his}} life. And every time I come here, I want to see that he's still working for you. Is that clear?" [...] -Anecdote on Frank Sinatra and Nicky Blair's.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in South Africa, Mahree Bok (Lindsey Haun) {{is a white}} South African {{who lives}} in a manor house with her parents and little brother. They comfortably benefit from the system of {{apartheid}} without questioning its morality; Mahree's father, Pieter Bok, is a South African policeman who cannot hide his joy when Steve Biko (a black South African man fighting against apartheid) has just been captured. They also have a black maid, Flora (Melanie Nicholls-King), whom Mahree, in her racial blindness, considers her best friend, not realizing that Flora is not satisfied with her life under apartheid. However, Mahree's observation is not entirely wrong, as Flora is a kindly woman who is indeed friendly with the Bok children, believing that gentleness and persuasion work better than agitation. Flora tells Mahree that {{when she was a little}} girl she would observe the weaver bird, which has many different styles of plumage, and its communal nest-building, which is used as a metaphor for the possibility of racial harmony that Mahree does not understand at the time. Mahree also asks her parents for permission to study in America, which is granted by her father, who believes she will either get homesick or realize that America is not a paradise. However, Mahree is slightly aware of some of the injustices of her society, as a black busboy gets slugged for <b>spilling</b> a <b>tray,</b> which she finds revolting.|$|R
