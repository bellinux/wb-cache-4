5000|$|<b>Subacute</b> <b>myelo-optic</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (SMON) is an {{iatrogenic}} {{disease of the}} nervous system leading to a disabling paralysis, blindness and even death. Its defining manifestation was as an epidemic in Japan during the 1960s, affecting an estimated 30,000 people. On August 3, 1978, the Tokyo District Court ruled that the cause of SMON is Clioquinol. Its manufacturer, Ciba-Geigy, has publicly stated that [...] "Medical products manufactured and sold by us have been responsible for the occurrence of SMON in Japan, we extend our apologies." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{chelating}} {{activities of}} nitroxoline {{have also been}} used in an anticancer setting. Nitroxoline {{has been shown to}} be more cytotoxic to HL60, DHL-4, Panc-1, and A2780 cells lines than clioquinol and other 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives. [...] It also demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu2+ was added. The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl2. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl2, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator. Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with <b>subacute</b> <b>myelo-optic</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and in vivo trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.|$|E
5000|$|Clioquinol's {{use as an}} {{antiprotozoal}} drug {{has been}} restricted or discontinued in some countries due to an event in Japan where over 10,000 people developed <b>subacute</b> <b>myelo-optic</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (SMON) between 1957 and 1970. The drug was used widely in many countries {{before and after the}} SMON event without similar reports. [...] As yet, no explanation exists as to why it produced this reaction, and some researchers have questioned whether clioquinol was the causative agent in the disease, noting that the drug had been used for 20 years prior to the epidemic without incident, and that the SMON cases began to reduce in number prior to the discontinuation of the drug. [...] Theories suggested have included improper dosing, the permitted use of the drug for extended periods of time, and dosing which did not consider the smaller average stature of Japanese; however a dose dependant relationship between SMON development and clioquinol use was never found, suggesting the interaction of another compound. Researchers have also suggested the SMON epidemic could have been due to a viral infection with an Inoue-Melnick virus.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information {{was available for}} adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, {{many of whom had}} received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects. The full syndrome of <b>subacute</b> <b>myelo-optic</b> <b>neuropathy</b> was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: 5 -chloro- 7 -iodo- 8 -hydroxyquinoline (clioquinol) {{was used}} {{clinically}} {{three decades ago}} as an oral antiparasitic agent and to increase intestinal absorption of zinc in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder of zinc absorption. Use of clioquinol was epidemiologically linked to <b>subacute</b> <b>myelo-optic</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (SMON), characterized by peripheral neuropathy and blindness, which affected 10, 000 patients in Japan. Discontinuation of oral clioquinol use led to elimination of SMON, however, the mechanism of how clioquinol induces neurotoxicity is unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the effect of clioquinol-metal chelates on neural crest-derived melanoma cells. The effect of clioquinol chelates on cells was further studied by electron microscopy and by a mitochondrial potential-sensitive fluorescent dye. RESULTS: Of the ions tested, only clioquinol-zinc chelate demonstrated cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of clioquinol-zinc chelate was extremely rapid, suggesting that its primary effect was on the mitochondria. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that clioquinol-zinc chelate caused mitochondrial damage. This finding was further confirmed by the observation that clioquinol-zinc chelate caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that clioquinol, {{in the presence of}} zinc, is converted to a potent mitochondrial toxin. The phenomenon of clioquinol mediated toxicity appears to be specific to zinc and is not seen with other metals tested. Since clioquinol has been shown to cause increased systemic absorption of zinc in humans, it is likely that clioquinol-zinc chelate was present in appreciable levels in patients with SMON and may be the ultimate causative toxin of SMON...|$|E
