40|$|A {{new design}} of <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> with segment-shaped outer rotor is {{presented}} and investigated in this paper. In {{order to obtain}} correct recommendations for optimal design of the studied <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor,</b> analytical relations of motor electromagnetic parameters and geometrical dimensions (also known as metamodels) have been synthesized. Electromagnetic parameters, which {{have been used for}} metamodels synthesis, are obtained by means of magnetostatic field numerical calculations with finite element method using software QuickField. The paper includes the analysis of the studied <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> geometrical parameters (stator outer diameter, height and overlap angle of rotor’s segment-shaped packages) influence on the electromagnetic torque per unit volume. Testing of synthesized metamodels shows that relative difference between the results obtained by numerical calculations and those obtained with the help of synthesized metamodels does not exceed eight percent at experimental points and intermediate points as well. The proposed optimal design of the segment-shaped outerrotor <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> obtained with the help of synthesized metamodels has been compared with a salient-pole outer-rotor <b>synchronous</b> <b>reluctance</b> <b>motor</b> having ferromagnetic yoke with the same value of the electromagnetic torque.

The backstepping controller can achieve good performance and reject any bounded {{of the external}} disturbance and parameter variations in SynRM drive system. In general, the conventional backstepping control design method is assumed that the upper boundary of parameter variations and external disturbances are known and the sign function is used. Therefore, it causes high frequency chattering and high gain phenomenon. In {{order to avoid the}} drawbacks, first, we use the grey backstepping control to reduce the high gain phenomenon.
