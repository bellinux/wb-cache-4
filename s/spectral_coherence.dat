50|$|The <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence</b> is a {{statistic}} {{that can be}} used to examine the relation between two signals or data sets.

50|$|The length {{over which}} the phase in {{a beam of light}} is correlated, is called the {{coherence}} length.

50|$|In physics, {{monochromatic}} light is electromagnetic radiation {{of a single}} frequency. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic, since that would require a wave of infinite duration {{as a consequence of}} the Fourier transform's localization property (cf. <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence).</b> Even very controlled sources such as lasers operate in a range of frequencies (known as the spectral linewidth). In practice, filtered light, diffraction grating separated light and laser light are all routinely referred to as monochromatic. Often light sources can be compared and one be labeled as “more monochromatic” (in a similar usage as monodispersity). A device which isolates a narrow band of frequencies from a broader-bandwidth source is called a monochromator, even though the bandwidth is often explicitly specified, and thus a collection of frequencies is understood.|$|E

40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) {{has been proven}} useful for suppression of artifacts in EEG recordings. It involves separation of measured signals into statistically independent components or sources, followed by rejection of those deemed artificial. We show that a "leak" of cerebral activity of interest into components marked as artificial means that {{one is going to}} lost that activity. To overcome this problem we propose a novel wavelet enhanced ICA method (wICA) that applies a wavelet thresholding not to the observed raw EEG but to the demixed independent components as an intermediate step. It allows recovering the neural activity present in "artificial" components. Employing semi-simulated and real EEG recordings we quantify the distortions of the cerebral part of EEGs introduced by the ICA and wICA artifact suppressions in the time and frequency domains. In the context of studying cortical circuitry we also evaluate spectral and partial <b>spectral</b> <b>coherences</b> over ICA/wICA-corrected EEGs. Our results suggest that ICA may lead to an underestimation of the neural power spectrum and to an overestimation of the coherence between different cortical sites. wICA artifact suppression preserves both <b>spectral</b> (amplitude) and <b>coherence</b> (phase) characteristics of the underlying neural activity.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} {{morphology}} of microaneurysms {{before and after}} direct photocoagulation using <b>spectral</b> domain optical <b>coherence</b> tomography. METHODS: In 13 eyes of diabetic patients who underwent focal photocoagulation for clinically significant macular edema, microaneurysms were evaluated before, immediately after, 1 month after, and 2 months after photocoagulation with <b>spectral</b> domain optical <b>coherence</b> tomography. The microaneurysms were also evaluated by fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography. The patients underwent focal photocoagulation for microaneurysm. RESULTS: The microaneurysms before photocoagulation in <b>spectral</b> domain optical <b>coherence</b> tomography were observed as circular or elliptical structures with hyperreflective foci within vessel walls. Immediately after photocoagulation, the microaneurysms were changed to indistinct lesions with hyperreflectivity around the microaneurysms. Acoustic shadows developed on the choroidal side of the microaneurysms. If photocoagulation for microaneurysms was appropriately done, retinal changes were limited to within the inner retina around the microaneurysms and no changes were observed in retinal pigment epithelium. Within 2 months after photocoagulation, the microaneurysms changed into fine scars and the retinal structure normalized. Average retinal thickness of the fovea was 432 ± 70 μm before the procedure but reduced to 373 ± 84 μm at 2 months post surgery. CONCLUSION: Focal photocoagulation may be a less invasive method for treating microaneurysms, and <b>spectral</b> domain optical <b>coherence</b> tomography is useful for evaluating the efficacy of photocoagulation...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinearly {{generated}} broadband ultrafast laser {{have been}} increasingly utilized in many applications. However, traditional techniques of characterizing these sources lack {{the ability to}} observe the instantaneous features and transitory behaviours of both amplitude and phase. With {{the advent of the}} optical time stretch techniques, the instantaneous shotto- shot spectral intensity can be directly measured continuously at an unprecedentedly high speed. Meanwhile, the information of the real-time phase variation, which is carried by the frequency-time mapped spectral signal has yet been fully explored. We present a technique of experimentally measuring the <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence</b> dynamics of broadband pulsed sources. Our method relies on a delayed Young's type interferometer combined with optical time-stretch. We perform the proof-of-principle demonstrations of <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence</b> dynamics measurement on two sources: a supercontinuum source and a fiber ring buffered cavity source, both with a repetition rate of MHz. By employing the optical time stretch with a dispersive fiber, we directly map the spectral interference fringes of the delayed neighbouring pulses and obtain a sufficiently large ensemble of spectral interferograms with a real-time oscilloscope (80 Gb/s sampling rate). This enables us to directly quantify the <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence</b> dynamics of the ultrafast sources with a temporal resolution down to microseconds. Having the ensemble of single-shot interferograms, we also further calculate the cross <b>spectral</b> <b>coherence</b> correlation matrices of these ultrafast sources.
