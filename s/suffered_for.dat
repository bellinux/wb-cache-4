5|$|Brezhnev {{lived at}} 26 Kutuzovsky Prospekt, Moscow. During vacations, {{he lived in}} his Gosdacha in Zavidovo. He was married to Viktoria Brezhneva (1908–1995). During her final four years she lived {{virtually}} alone, abandoned by everybody. She had <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> a long time from diabetes and was nearly blind in her last years.

60|$|In {{order to}} a right {{handling}} of this matter, I shall divide this head into these two parts--A. Show {{you what it}} is to <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> well-doing, or for righteousness. B. Show {{you what it is}} to <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness' sake. I put this distinction, because I find that {{it is one thing to}} <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness, and another to <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness' sake.|$|R
6000|$|So again, [...] "For it is better, if {{the will}} of God be so, that ye <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> well-doing, than for evil-doing" [...] (1 Peter 3:17). Here it is plainly {{supposed}} that a Christian man may <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> evil-doing, yea, that {{the will of}} God may be, that he should <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> evil-doing. For God, if Christians do not well, will vindicate himself by punishing of them for their doing ill. Yea, and will not count them worthy, though they be his own, to be put among {{the number of those}} that <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> doing well.|$|R

5|$|His son {{was also}} {{executed}} {{a few months}} later, and his daughter-in-law <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> several months in prison before she was released {{in the summer of}} 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. While much of the state has <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E
60|$|To <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness' sake must {{be either}} with the {{intention}} of the persecutor or else of the persecuted. The persecutor, whatever the person's suffering is, if he afflicteth this person for a supposed good that he thinketh he hath or professeth, he make him <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness' sake. So that, in this sense, a man that hath no grace may not only <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> righteousness, but also for righteousness' sake. But this I intend not, because the text is not concerned with it.|$|R

5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|He re-embarked for England in June 1916, and re-joined his {{battalion}} on the Western Front in October. Once {{back with}} his battalion, he was accidentally wounded and then gassed, and was also promoted {{to the rank of}} lance corporal. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, which involved rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was then promoted to corporal. During the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to be discharged, and was employed by the South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medal set is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E

A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrow II, {{raising his}} son Kavadh II, {{also known as}} Siroes, in his stead. Khosrow was shut in a dungeon, where he <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> five days on bare sustenancehe {{was shot to death}} slowly with arrows on the fifth day. Kavadh {{immediately}} sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, and most importantly for them, the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's fame {{reached its}} first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I, {{helped by the}} {{publication}} of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist Irving Stone wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled Lust for Life, based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the 1956 film further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.|$|E

5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late for school, and mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle, {{reversing}} the British defeat of 6 July, inflicting severe losses on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and trapping Linois in Cadiz proved decisive in confirming British control of the Mediterranean Sea. With the French plan to reinforce the army stranded in Egypt in ruins, the British invasion fleet was free to operate without interference, succeeding in capturing the country in September 1801. In a wider sense too, it emphasized {{the degree to which}} the Royal Navy dominated European waters, destroying any attempt by the navies of France and its allies to conduct operations at sea. In Spain the government, furious at the losses <b>suffered</b> <b>for</b> so little gain, began to distance themselves from the alliance with France, which was a contributing factor in the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 that ended the French Revolutionary Wars. For the remainder of the war the British maintained undisputed control of the Mediterranean Sea and the Spanish coast, the Cadiz blockade preventing the French and Spanish forces there from putting to sea.|$|E

A malefactor that suffereth for his evil deeds the due punishment thereof, suffereth, as other texts declare, according to the will of God. But, I say, this text doth not concern itself with them; for both this text and this epistle is writ for the counsel and comfort of those that <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> keeping the law and testament of God; that <b>suffer</b> <b>for</b> well-doing (1 Peter 3:13,14,17; 4:13,14).|$|R
