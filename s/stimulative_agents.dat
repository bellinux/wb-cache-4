40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was focused on}} clonal development of Slender speedwell (Veronica filiformis Sm.) from small cutting stems without using of <b>stimulative</b> <b>agents.</b> Short stems from four various part of aboveground body were cultivated: main terminal part, secondary terminal part, small nodes, and big nodes. All different vegetative parts were able to produce roots, take roots in soil substrate and in semi-natural meadow, survive winter, and make flower. The species was more successful in company with these meadow plants: Lotus corniculatus, Medicago lupulina, Achillea millefolium, Plantago lanceolata, Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia, Trifolium repens and Crepis biennis. The best growth was confirmed for both of main and lateral terminal parts. These terminal segments had {{the greatest number of}} survived individuals, flowering stem, and weigh of dried parts...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{samples in}} {{disturbed}} state {{were taken in}} order to control fertility and monitor contents of harmful and hazardous substances in Vojvodina soils and possibilities of soil degradation in general. Moderately contaminated soils were selected for examination. Microbial activity in contaminated soil and the impact of harmful and hazardous substances (pesticides) on soil microorganisms were observed and most resistant microorganisms were isolated. Vegetation experiments were organized to study the effect of chelating agents EDTA and EDDS on copper adoption and translocation in rapeseed and sunflower. Importance of some ions in the complexation of copper chelators and their undesirable effects on copper uptake were established. Field trials were organized to study the effect of hydrogel on water uptakes by plants, increase in rate and the increase in rate of removal of hazardous and harmful substances from soil solution. At all phases of the project, we monitored the effectiveness of soil bioremediation soils by means of the application of chelating <b>agents,</b> <b>stimulative</b> preparations such as hydrogel and certain microorganisms. It effectiveness was measured in terms of plant growth rate and intensity in removal of hazardous and harmful substances from contaminated soil...|$|R
