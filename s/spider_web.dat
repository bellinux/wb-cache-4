5|$|Spiders {{have been}} present for many decades both in film and on television, {{predominantly}} in the horror genre. Those who suffer from arachnophobia, an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. The <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> {{is used as a}} motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the recesses of the unknown.|$|E
5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> tattoo.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or <b>spider</b> <b>web.</b>|$|E

5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a <b>spider</b> <b>web,</b> either unable to move or dead).|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Jake begins {{performing}} acrobatic moves. Finn attempts to follow, and eventually the two get trapped in a massive <b>spider</b> <b>web.</b> The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) and Barb (voiced by Susie Essman) return, bickering amongst themselves. The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away. While Ed wraps Jake in a cocoon, Finn tries to offer relationship advice to Ed; Finn tells the spider to get a gift for his wife, and Ed runs {{off into the woods}} to find something.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with <b>spider</b> <b>web.</b> By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

50|$|Stenolemus bituberus is {{a species}} of thread-legged insect (Emesinae) found across much of Australia. This species spends nearly its entire life (moulting, feeding, mating) in <b>spider</b> <b>webs.</b> It preys upon a variety of <b>spiders,</b> {{including}} <b>webs</b> and nests of spiders of Achaearanea, Badumna, Pholcus, and Stiphidion, and the families Salticidae and Uloboridae.

25|$|When {{artificial}} light affects organisms and ecosystems {{it is called}} ecological light pollution. While light at night can be beneficial, neutral, or damaging for individual species, its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> directly on a lamp post. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light, gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it. This is a simple example {{of the way in}} which species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed by the introduction of light at night.|$|E
25|$|Theridiidae is {{probably}} the only family with a large diversity of <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> forms: {{there is a high}} within-taxon diversity (e.g. in Latrodectus), as well as convergence in different taxa. Theridiid gumfoot-webs consist of frame lines that anchor them to surroundings and of support threads, which possess viscid silk. Four main web types are currently recognized: among webs with gumfooted lines, there are webs with a central retreat (Achaearanea-type) and those with a peripheral retreat (Latrodectus-type). Among webs without gumfooted lines, there are those that contain viscid silk (Theridion-type) and those with a sheet-like structure, which do not contain visible viscid silk (Coleosoma-type). However, there are many undescribed web forms.|$|E

500|$|The spider has symbolized {{patience}} and persistence {{due to its}} hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for its prey to become ensnared. Numerous cultures attribute the spider's ability to spin webs with the origin of spinning, textile weaving, basketry, knotwork and net making. Spiders are associated with creation myths because they seem to weave their own artistic worlds. [...] Philosophers often use the spider's web as a metaphor or analogy; and today, terms such as the Internet or World Wide Web evoke the inter-connectivity of a <b>spider</b> <b>web.</b>|$|E
500|$|There are few {{scientific}} {{reports on}} the breeding behaviour of the red-headed myzomela, and little detail {{is available on the}} breeding season. A study of populations in the western Kimberley reported that the birds hold territories through much of the dry season and then disperse. The nest is built in the foliage of the mangroves, suspended by a rim from a small horizontal fork about [...] above the ground or water. The nest is small and cup-shaped, and built from small pieces of bark, leaves, plant fibre and sometimes seaweed, bound together with <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> and lined with finer material. It is, on average, [...] in diameter and [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} season varies markedly across the brown honeyeater’s range, with breeding recorded in one location {{or another in}} every month of the year. Breeding can occur two or more times a year if conditions are favourable. The nest is built {{in a variety of}} vegetation types, usually in dense foliage in the fork of a horizontal branch, often near water, and rarely more than [...] above ground. The nest is a small, deep, round cup, woven from small pieces of grass and soft bark, especially Melaleuca bark, bound with <b>spider</b> <b>web</b> and lined with plant down, such as from Banksias, or cow hair or wool. Both sexes contribute to the nest building, though the male also stands guard while the female is building the nest.|$|E
