60|$|One {{circumstance}} troubled Mr Swiveller's mind very much, {{and that}} was that the small servant always remained somewhere {{in the bowels of the}} earth under Bevis Marks, and never came to the surface unless the <b>single</b> gentleman <b>rang</b> his <b>bell,</b> when she would answer it and immediately disappear again. She never went out, or came into the office, or had a clean face, or took off the coarse apron, or looked out of any one of the windows, or stood at the street-door for a breath of air, or had any rest or enjoyment whatever. Nobody ever came to see her, nobody spoke of her, nobody cared about her. Mr Brass had said once, that he believed she was a 'love-child' (which means anything but a child of love), {{and that was}} all the information Richard Swiveller could obtain.|$|R

In vain Miss Charlecote still lingered; Mrs. Parsons, in despair, called Phoebe on with her as the <b>single</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> and Honor and Robert presently started with heads turned over their shoulders, and lips laying all blame on Charteris' delays of breakfast. A last wistful look, and the church porch engulfed them; but even when enclosed in the polished square pew, they could not resign hope at every tread on the matted floor, and finally subsided into a trust that the truants might after service emerge from a seat near the door. There were only too many to choose from.|$|R

Miss Reed stopped {{a little to}} take breath before climbing the hill, {{at the top of}} which, {{in the middle of the}} churchyard, was Blackstable Church. Miss Reed panted, and the sultriness made her loosen her jacket. She stood at the junction of the two roads which led to the church, one from the harbour end of the town and the other from the station. Behind her lay the houses of Blackstable, the wind-beaten houses with slate roofs of the old fishing village and the red brick villas of the seaside resort which Blackstable was fast becoming; in the harbour were the masts of the ships, colliers that brought coal from the north; and beyond, the grey sea, very motionless, mingling in the distance with the sky.... The peal of the church bells ceased, and was replaced by a <b>single</b> <b>bell,</b> <b>ringing</b> a little hurriedly, querulously, which denoted that there were only ten minutes before the beginning of the service.
