5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It {{is hard to see how}} natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

25|$|The last {{record of}} a living Domhnall comes from 1297, and the {{earliest}} record of his son Gartnait as Mormaer is from 1305, creating the range of Domhnall's possible year of death to <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> these two points. However, a document dating to 1302, containing terms of reconciliation between Edward I and Robert, stipulates that Robert should act as warden of Gartnait, implying that Domhnall had just died.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparable}} terms, earlier primitivist movements, {{including the}} Hussites, Anabaptists, Landmarkists, Puritans, and Waldensians {{have been described}} as examples of restorationism, as have many seventh-day Sabbatarians. Landmarkism (often identified with Baptist Successionism) is more properly a theory of the continuation of the pure Church through the centuries, recognizable by certain key doctrines, primarily believer's baptism. Many groups have attempted a history of their movement and an ecclesiology that falls <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> the two ideas of Restorationism and Successionism.|$|E

25|$|The 13Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule {{of thumb}} rather than {{something}} of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13Jupiter mass value is <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.|$|E
25|$|The Martian Chronicles is a 1950 {{science fiction}} short story {{collection}} by Ray Bradbury that chronicles the colonization of Mars by humans fleeing from a troubled and eventually atomically devastated Earth, and {{the conflict between}} aboriginal Martians and the new colonists. The book lies <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between</b> a short story collection and an episodic novel, containing stories Bradbury originally published in the late 1940s in science fiction magazines. The stories were loosely woven together {{with a series of}} short, interstitial vignettes for publication.|$|E

As with another track he wrote for <b>Somewhere</b> <b>in</b> England, [...] "Tears of the World", the song instead reflects his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world during the early 1980s.|$|R

25|$|There {{were three}} consonants, the voiced dental fricative, voiced palato-alveolar affricate, and voiceless palato-alveolar affricate, which Genie did not spontaneously {{pronounce}} until 1973 and only inconsistently pronounced after that time. Until 1973, instead of pronouncing alveolar lateral approximants and retroflex approximants as separate sounds she articulated both {{in a manner}} that Curtiss described as a sound <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> Genie would also typically, although not always, simplify or delete consonant clusters. The one regular exception was that a rhotic approximant almost always remained intact because Genie seemed to interpret it {{as a part of the}} preceding vowel.|$|E

25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are {{interested}} in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither foraging or farming, but <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>between.</b> As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to domesticate plants in Africa.|$|E
