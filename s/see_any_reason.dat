5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said {{that it is important to}} know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E
25|$|Qazi Muhammad's {{internal}} support eventually declined, {{especially among the}} Kurdish tribes who had supported him initially. Their crops and supplies were dwindling, and {{their way of life}} was becoming hard {{as a result of the}} isolation. Economic aid and military assistance from the Soviet Union was gone, and the tribes saw no reason to support him. The townspeople and the tribes had a large divide between them, and their alliance for Mahabad was crumbling. The tribes and their leaders had only supported Qazi Muhammad for his economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Once that was gone, many did not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to support him. Other tribes resented the Barzanis, since they did not like sharing their already dwindling resources with them. Some Kurds deserted Mahabad, including one of Mahabad's own marshals, Amir Khan. Mahabad was economically bankrupt, and it would have been nearly impossible for Mahabad to have been economically sound without harmony with Iran.|$|E

500|$|In December 2008, Tom Morello {{revealed}} that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility, although {{plans for the}} band to record a new studio album were very unlikely. When asked by Billboard.com whether they planned {{to head to the}} studio in 2009, Morello stated: [...] "we've had a wonderful {{year and a half of}} playing shows, and I don't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to not play more shows. The thing is there's only so many hours in the musical day, and mine are very occupied right now".|$|E
500|$|Kosterman, who {{has played}} law {{enforcement}} officials before, initially turned down the role. After his agent informed him {{it would be a}} recurring role, and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show, Kosterman decided to take the job. To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why his character would suddenly become evil. The actor believes his character fell into the established theme of [...] "good people being pushed to do the wrong thing by bad people like Lionel Luthor".|$|E

500|$|The show's website {{released}} a motion comic {{based on the}} first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary, and other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed pleasure that the show is faithful to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that [...] " [...] really are doing six one-hour movies", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. [...] "The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{re-election}} of the Syriza-ANEL coalition, Tsakalotos was tipped {{to resume}} the role of Minister of Finance, however the state media reported that {{he was reluctant to}} do so. Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E

60|$|So, {{instead of}} bemoaning the {{position}} of the playwright, it were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards restoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not allowing him to be built over by the property man, or hammered to death by the carpenter. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> myself why such artists as Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled to become Academicians. They have certainly as good a claim as have many of those R.A.'s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a shilling.|$|R

Most of the councillors wanted to declare the site a National Park. They wanted it to be titled [...] "the Birthplace of Australian History and Gateway to Captain Cooks Landing Place." [...] The dunes at Towra Point were to be included in this park. The Council was evenly split, but Joe Monro, the Council's President , argued that because the site [...] "was nothing but sand it was completely useless". He decided to vote against the purchase.

He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not going to agree with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it."

Furthermore, Hull made it clear to Morgenthau that the issue at hand was between the Cuban government and the passengers. The U.S., in effect, had no role. In the second conversation at 3:54 PM on June 6, 1939, Morgenthau said they did not know where the ship was and he inquired whether it was [...] "proper to have the Coast Guard look for it". Hull responded by saying that he didn't <b>see</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why it could not. Hull then informed him that he did not think that Morgenthau would want the search for the ship to get into the newspapers. Morgenthau said. [...] "Oh no. No, no.

40|$|INTRODUCTION At the 1996 SEG Annual Meeting in Denver, three papers first {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} velocity-independent imaging with common-focus-point (CFP) gathers.
