5|$|Washington State House Speaker Frank Chopp spearheaded {{a plan to}} use {{government}} funding to move community college health programs into the building. In August 2013, the PHPDA announced a 30-year lease with the Washington State Department of Commerce for 13 stories of Pacific Tower. Six of the stories will be subleased to Seattle Central Community College for its healthcare training programs. Multiple nonprofits are prospective tenants. Chopp and other <b>state</b> <b>lawmakers</b> planned on consolidating several district offices into the location. The state capital budget allocated $20 million for the tower's renovation, but the cost increased to $54.3 million {{by the time it}} was completed in 2016 due to unexpected water damage and new city energy-use regulations.|$|E
5|$|Southern Whigs in the Congress, {{including}} Representative Milton Brown and Senator Ephraim Foster, both of Tennessee, and Representative Alexander Stephens of Georgia collaborated {{to introduce}} a House amendment on January 13, 1845 {{that was designed to}} enhance slaveowner gains in Texas beyond those offered by the Democratic-sponsored Tyler-Calhoun treaty bill. The legislation proposed to recognize Texas as a slave state which would retain all its vast public lands, as well as its bonded debt accrued since 1836. Furthermore, the Brown amendment would delegate to the U.S. government responsibility for negotiating the disputed Texas-Mexico boundary. The issue was a critical one, as the size of Texas would be immensely increased if the international border were set at the Rio Grande River, with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains, rather than the traditionally recognized boundary at the Nueces River, 100 miles to the north. While the Tyler-Calhoun treaty provided for the organization of a total of four states from the Texas lands – three likely to qualify as slave states – Brown's plan would permit Texas <b>state</b> <b>lawmakers</b> to configure a total of five states from its western region, south of the 36°30' Missouri Compromise line, each pre-authorized to permit slavery upon statehood, if Texas designated them as such.|$|E

25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put more pressure on cities such as Burbank. <b>State</b> <b>lawmakers</b> have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects.

But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E

25|$|MBTA Boat {{services}} {{have the highest}} farebox recovery ratio of any MBTA service type, at 55% by a 2012 report. However, the service still operates at a $5 million annual loss to the MBTA and carries a relatively small percentage of passengers, which has resulted in calls for its discontinuance or modification. In 2012, facing a substantial budget gap, the MBTA proposed substantial service cuts and fare increases. All ferry routes were to be cut, resulting in $3.7 million savings for the agency. Temporary measures were found to avoid some service cuts including the ferries; however, weekend Quincy service was eliminated and fares raised 35% {{in an attempt to}} eliminate the subsidy required. <b>State</b> <b>lawmakers</b> also then proposed that Massport take over the ferries from the MBTA.|$|E

Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, the state's First Minister, also hinted at the possibility of another three <b>state</b> <b>lawmakers</b> from Barisan Nasional defecting over to Pakatan Rakyat. Nasarudin Hashim's defection angered the then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who chided Nasarudin for being weak and claimed that Nasarudin's defection was because Nasarudin was disappointed in not being offered any senior party posts. Nasarudin rebutted the Prime Minister's statement and claimed his decision was due to the mood of his constituents. On 29 January 2009 then Finance Minister Najib Razak took over from Mohammad Tajol Rosli Ghazali as the Perak UMNO chief, as Tajol Rosli resigned over Nasaruddin's party shift.|$|E
25|$|The pilot {{episode was}} filmed in February 2011 in Maryland, and filming {{for the series}} began in October 2011 in Baltimore, after several months of {{rehearsal}} designed to get the actors comfortable improvising with one another.

Season 2 production began shooting in November 2012, continuing to film in Baltimore and other areas of Maryland. Veep primarily filmed on a sound stage constructed from a Columbia, Maryland industrial warehouse, where replicas of places such as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and West Wing are also built.

Later filming locations included Annapolis and the Physical Sciences Complex in the University of Maryland, College Park campus.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled that}} this method {{violated}} the federal constitution, as {{it resulted in}} districts having wildly different populations. <b>State</b> <b>lawmakers</b> implemented a new method that continues to be used today. The Oklahoma House of Representatives must draw new district boundaries within 90 days of the latest Federal Decennial Census. Under the holding of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) districts must be apportioned within a five percent margin of the average target size district {{as determined by the}} U.S. Census population figures divided by the one hundred and one districts. This allows for certain districts to be slightly smaller or larger than others. The Oklahoma House of Representatives draws its own maps of its district lines, which are subject to the approval of both the state senate and the governor. Should the redistricting not occur in the time limits prescribed by law, the lines are determined by a panel of five statewide elected officials.|$|E
