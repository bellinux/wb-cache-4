5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 1974, García {{was visiting}} {{with some friends}} in her apartment. Medrano also had a guest, with whom he was smoking marijuana. Louie Castillo and Miguel Jimenez, Soledad locals and acquaintances of Medrano, arrived {{in a state of}} {{inebriation}} to purchase heroin from Medrano. They began harassing García and her friends, who left García and the others at the apartment. Soon an argument arose between Medrano and Castillo, who was envious of Medrano's status as the primary drug connection in Soledad and was resentful that an [...] "outsider" [...] had become so successful. The argument became physical, and Medrano was winning the fight (Castillo was a wiry seventeen-year-old) until the 300-pound Jimenez intervened, beating Medrano and threatening him with a knife. Jimenez and Castillo took García to an alley behind the building where Jimenez restrained and Castillo raped her, according to García's testimony, [...] "to <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> a hometown boy was." [...] The two men left the scene for a neighbor's house. Shortly after arriving, they (or someone else) called the García-Medrano residence, laughing, taunting, and threatening García's life if she did not leave town. García armed herself with her son's [...]22 rifle and she and Medrano drove the six blocks to the residence where Castillo and Jimenez were located. Accounts vary as to precisely what occurred next, but by most of them, Jimenez again brandished his knife and García shot him. Castillo, meanwhile, escaped into a nearby park. Medrano and García continued to the home of the two friends that had visited her earlier, and when police arrived, she surrendered to them without incident.|$|E

'I thought not,' he returned; {{and then}} he began to <b>show</b> <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> needed little proof, how {{absolutely}} inexpedient it was for his honour or for hers, that he should accept anything from her, and how much more fitting it was that they should be absolutely out of reach of all intercourse with one another during her year of mourning, or until he could fitly address her.|$|E
