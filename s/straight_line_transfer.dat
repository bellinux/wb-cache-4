40|$|Due to the {{discrete}} distribution computing errors {{and lack of}} adaptability are ubiquitous in the current <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> extraction for TLS data methods. A 3 D <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> segment extraction method is proposed based on spherical projection for single station terrestrial laser point clouds.
