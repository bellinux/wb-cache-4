5000|$|In 1916, Edward Kleinschmidt filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for a typebar page printer. In 1919, shortly after the Morkrum company obtained their patent for a start-stop synchronizing method for code telegraph systems, which made possible the practical teleprinter, Kleinschmidt filed an application titled [...] "Method of and Apparatus for Operating Printing Telegraphs" [...] which included an improved start-stop method. The basic <b>start-stop</b> <b>procedure,</b> however is much older than the Kleinschmidt and Morkrum inventions. It was already proposed by D'Arlincourt in 1870.|$|E
40|$|The {{articulation}} subsystem actuators were rigorously {{tested in}} severe environments. They were operated through temperature ranges from - 73 C to + 121 C. In each case the temperature {{rate of change}} was at maximum. The actuator under test at room temperature was put into a pre-chilled or preheated chamber. Satisfactory performance was obtained throughout this full temperature range and under the temperature shock conditions above. However, at temperatures below - 78 C some leakage was experienced through the O-ring seal around the shaft. The actuators were subjected to severe vibration and 500 g shock test with a time duration of 0. 0007 seconds. The scan actuator was life tested by operating it from stop to stop through 2, 000 cycles with 20, 000 <b>start-stop</b> <b>procedures</b> randomly distributed through the 2, 000 cycles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRankine-cycle {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} systems for automotive applications have {{been the focus of}} intensive research in recent years, as they seem to off er considerable potential for fuel consumption reduction. Because of the highly transient conditions they are subject to, control plays a fundamental role to enable viability and efficiency of those systems. Yet, surprising little research has been devoted to this topic. This paper illustrates the design of a practical supervision and control system for a pilot Rankine steam process for exhaust gas heat recovery from a spark-ignition engine. The proposed control strategy for power production focuses more on ensuring continuity of operation than on the pursuit of optimality. The resulting decentralized control system is implemented via two anti-wind up PI controllers with feedforward action. Performance has been assessed in simulation on a motorway driving cycle using real engine exhaust data. Despite very transient exhaust gas conditions, we show that the expander can produce power throughout the cycle, avoiding <b>start-stop</b> <b>procedures,</b> which would greatly reduce the global e fficiency...|$|R
