[...] Operation ASHA specializes in last-mile connectivity, bridging the gap between government medicine distribution centers and the communities of patients to deliver treatment at the doorsteps of the under-served. In addition to detecting and curing TB, Opasha's community health workers also educate the community about TB and its symptoms thereby helping to reduce the stigma there is regarding the disease even in today's day and age. In addition to TB, Operation ASHA's model and technology {{has been used in}} many other diseases such as diabetes, haemophilia and mental health.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{treatment}} of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{in young children}} is supported by universal policy based on strong rationale and evidence of effectiveness, but has rarely been implemented in tuberculosis endemic countries. Areas covered: This review highlights {{a number of important}} recent developments that provide an unprecedented opportunity to close the policy-practice gap, as well as ongoing needs to facilitate implementation under programmatic conditions and scale-up. Expert commentary: The WHO's End <b>TB</b> Strategy and <b>Stop</b> <b>TB</b> <b>Partnership's</b> Plan to End TB provide ambitious targets for prevention at a time when National Tuberculosis Programs in tuberculosis endemic countries are increasing attention to the challenges of management and prevention of tuberculosis disease in children. This opportunity is greatly enhanced by recent evidence of the effectiveness of shorter, simpler and safer regimens to treat tuberculosis infection. The scale of the challenge for implementation will require a decentralized, integrated, community-based approach. An accurate and low-cost point-of-care test for tuberculous infection would be a major advance to support such implementation. Specific guidance for the {{treatment of}} infection in young child contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases is a major current need while awaiting further evidence.

Results A cross-sectional study among 112 PPs selected from private health facilities (PHF) in the region was conducted. The study was carried out between May and August 2008 and data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Group differences were analyzed using one-way Anova test and a p-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. In this study, PPs saw a median of 12 TB suspects and 1. 5 patients a week. The mean number of TB suspects and patients seen varied significantly among the different professions with p < 0. 009 and p < 0. 004, respectively. Pulmonary TB patients referred by PPs were delayed up to one week before starting treatment at government health facilities. A 22 % increase in the detection of smear-positive TB cases may be achieved by involving all PHFs in the TB control program in the region. Nineteen percent of the PPs indicated that TB patients' prior attendance to non medical health providers resulted in complication of disease and increased treatment delay for TB. Conclusion PPs manage a substantial number of TB suspects and patients in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The GHF delay observed among TB patients referred by PPs to GHF is unnecessary. Expanding PPM-DOTS in the region and improving the quality of TB care at both government and private health facilities reduces treatment delay and increases TB case detection...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} part, we presented the {{standard operating procedure}} (SOP) of the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present SOP is devoted to another non-commercial culture and DST method known as nitrate reductase assay (NRA). As the name implies, the NRA detects the ability of M. tuberculosis to reduce nitrate to nitrite. In the assay, the presence of nitrite is detected {{by the addition of}} p-nitrobenzoate into the growth yield. The reaction is detected by the naked eye. The incorporation of drugs in the medium allows to use the test for DST, which can be interpreted with naked eyes. The identification and drug susceptibility results can be obtained in 2 - 3 weeks. This SOP document has been developed through the culture and DST subgroup of the <b>STOP</b> tuberculosis (<b>TB)</b> <b>Partnership</b> New Diagnostic Working Group. It is intended for laboratories that would want to use or already using this rapid non-commercial method for culture identification and DST of M. tuberculosis, notably in resource-constraint settings in Asia and Africa...|$|R
