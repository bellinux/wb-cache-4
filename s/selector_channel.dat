25|$|Channels {{differ in}} the number and type of {{concurrent}} I/O operations they support. In IBM terminology, a multiplexer channel supports a number of concurrent interleaved slow-speed operations, each transferring one byte from a device at a time. A <b>selector</b> <b>channel</b> supports one high-speed operation, transferring a block of data at a time. A block multiplexer supportes a number of concurrent high-speed operations.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{for larger}} IBM System/360 computers, {{and even for}} early System/370 models, the {{selector}} channels and the multiplexor channels still were bulky and expensive separate processors, such as the IBM 2860 <b>Selector</b> <b>channel</b> (one to three selector channels in a single box), the IBM 2870 Byte multiplexor channel (one multiplexer channel, and, optionally, one selector subchannel in a single box) and the IBM 2880 Block multiplexor channel (one or two block multiplexor channels in a single box).|$|E

50|$|<b>Selector</b> <b>channels</b> enabled I/O to {{high speed}} devices. These storage devices were {{attached}} to a control unit {{and then to the}} channel. The control unit let clusters of devices be attached to the channels. On higher speed models, multiple <b>selector</b> <b>channels,</b> which could operate simultaneously or in parallel, improved overall performance.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{initially}} {{two types of}} channels; byte-multiplexer channels (known at the time simply as [...] "multiplexor channels"), for connecting [...] "slow speed" [...] devices such as card readers and punches, line printers, and communications controllers, and <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> for connecting high speed devices, such as disk drives, tape drives, data cells and drums. Every System/360 (except for the Model 20, which was not a standard 360) had a byte-multiplexer channel and 1 or more <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b> The smaller models (up to the model 50) had integrated channels, while for the larger models (model 65 and above) the channels were large separate units in separate cabinets, such as the IBM 2860 and 2870. (The 60, 62, and 70 had allowed only for 2860 <b>selector</b> <b>channels,</b> {{on the assumption that}} they would all have smaller 360s attached, which would do the slow-speed work.) ...|$|R

5000|$|A byte {{multiplexer}} channel is capable of executing multiple CCWs concurrently; it is normally used to attach slow device such as card readers and telecommunications lines. A byte {{multiplexer channel}} could {{have a number of}} selector subchannels, each with only a single subchannel, which behave like low-speed <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} ASP {{configuration}} a small mainframe {{such as a}} 360/40 (the support or global system) controlled one or more 360/65 or larger processors (main or local systems). The computers were connected through <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> on each host attached to channel-to-channel adapters, for an early form of short distance, point-to-point computer networking.|$|R
50|$|These components, {{together}} with the 2365 Processor Storage Model 2, 2860 <b>Selector</b> <b>Channel,</b> 2870 Multiplexer Channel, and other System/360 control units and devices were available for use with the S/360-67.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>selector</b> <b>channel</b> {{has only}} a single subchannel, and hence is only capable of {{executing}} one channel command at a time. It is normally used to attach fast devices that are not capable of exploiting a block multiplexer channel to suspend the connection, such as magnetic tape drives.|$|E

IBM quickly replaced the 7320 with the faster and larger 2303.|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneous {{input and}} output was {{accomplished}} {{by the use of}} intelligent communication channels. Like the IBM 360, two types of channel were available (on all but the 70/15): <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> which could address up to 256 devices (one at a time), and multiplexer channels (not on the 70/15) which could simultaneously address up to 256 channels by time-sharing the channel.|$|R
5000|$|The block {{multiplexor}} channel {{was introduced}} beginning in 1971 on some high end System/360 systems {{along with the}} 2835 Control Unit and associated 2305 DASD, [...] This channel was then standard on IBM System/370 and subsequent mainframes; when contrasted to the prior <b>Selector</b> <b>channel</b> it offered performance improvements for high speed devices such as DASD, including: ...|$|E

[...] Sometimes described as disconnected command chaining, the control unit could disconnect at various times during a chained set of CCWs, for example, disconnection for a Seek CCW, freeing the channel for another subchannel.|$|E

50|$|An IBM 1052 printer/keyboard {{for use as}} an operator's console is optional. The I/O {{options include}} one channel-to-channel adapter (CTCA) and up to three <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b> A {{multiplexer}} channel for attachment of slow-speed devices is standard on all models. The F50 has 64 subchannels, so it can attach up to 64 slow-speed devices on its multiplexer channel. The other models have 128 subchannels. This can optionally increase to 256 subchannels on the H50 and I50.|$|R
50|$|The RCA Model 70/25 was a small-to-medium scale {{computer}} system that supported {{a wider variety}} of applications, including use as a free standing system. In large installations, the 70/25 might also be used as a subsystem in a multi-processor complex. High throughput was facilitated by the use of fast memory and multiple simultaneous input/output streams. Equipped with <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> and a multiplexer channel, the 70/25 could concurrently operate eight low-speed devices in addition to eight high-speed devices.|$|R
5000|$|Low-end: (90/30, 90/25, 90/40): Separately {{from the}} {{high-end}} series, Sperry Univac introduced the Univac 90/30 in about 1975 {{to provide an}} upgrade path for 9x00 users and to compete with IBM's System 3. It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console (Uniscope 100), attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1600 or 6250 BpI tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals (later 32) The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29MB and [...] "double-density" [...] 58MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA (Integrated Disk Adapter). There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100MB capacity that operated on a separate high speed <b>selector</b> <b>channel.</b> Available tape drives were the Uniservo 10 (Mux Channel) and Uniservo 14 (<b>Selector</b> <b>channel).</b> The optional <b>Selector</b> <b>Channel</b> also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2000 lpm 0770 printer. The machine had either 4K or 16K memory chips, and typical machines had between 128 to 512 KiB memory. It ran an OS called OS/3, and could run up to 7 jobs at one time, not counting various OS extensions such as the print spooler and telecommunications access (ICAM). It was an upgrade path for users who had outgrown the IBM System/3. It ran Cobol-74, RPG2, Fortran, and Assembler. The instruction set of the 90/xx series was implemented in microcode and was loaded into control storage {{as part of the}} boot up process, before loading the operating system.|$|E

50|$|The Model 25 had a {{standard}} attachment for connection of a 1052 Model 7 console printer-keyboard, {{which was used}} as the operator console.Optionally, the Model 25 could have {{a standard}} System/360 I/O channel, that could be either a byte-multiplexor or a <b>selector</b> <b>channel.</b> For the most commonly used peripherals, such as a 2540 or 2560 card reader-punch, a 1403 printer, or 2311 or 2314 disk drives, optional internal attachments were provided. These attachments connected directly to their respective peripherals, and would appear to the operating system as if the peripherals were channel-attached.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{processor}} was configured identically to a [...] "stand-alone processor operating under OS/360, except that thechannel-to-channel adapter replaces the normal system inputand output devices." [...] The support processor was {{a minimum of}} a Model 40 G (G indicates memory size of 128KB) with two <b>selector</b> <b>channels,</b> a 1052 console typewriter, a 2540 card read/punch, a 1403 printer, and three 2311 disk drives. It was recommended that the support processor have access to one 2400-series tape drive for support.|$|R
5000|$|A block {{multiplexer}} channel {{is capable of}} concurrently running multiple channel programs, but only {{one at a time}} can be active. The control unit can request suspension {{at the end of a}} channel command and can later request resumption. This is intended for devices in which there is a mechanical delay after completion of data transfer, e.g., for seeks on moving-head DASD. The {{block multiplexer}} channel was a late addition to the System/360 architecture; early machines had only byte multiplexer <b>channels</b> and <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b> The block multiplexer channel was an optional feature only on the models 85 and 195. The block multiplexor channel was also available on the later System/370 computers.|$|R
