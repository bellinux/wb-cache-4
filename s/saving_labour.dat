Of the artistic {{value of each}} material; of the {{correspondence}} between material or method and the imaginative faculty seeking to find expression; of the capacities for realism and idealism that reside in each material; of the historical and human side of the art--he said nothing. He showed the various instruments {{and how they are}} used, but he treated them entirely as instruments for the hand. He never once brought his subject into any relation either with art or with life. He explained forms of labour and forms of <b>saving</b> <b>labour.</b> He showed the various methods as they might be used by an artisan. Mr. Morris, last week, while explaining the technical processes of weaving, never forgot that he was lecturing on an art. He not merely taught his audience, but he charmed them. However, the audience gathered together last night at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition seemed very much interested; at least, they were very attentive; and Mr. Walter Crane made a short speech at the conclusion, in which he expressed his satisfaction that in spite of modern machinery sculpture had hardly altered one of its tools. For our own part we cannot help regretting the extremely commonplace character of the lecture. If a man lectures on poets he should not confine his remarks purely to grammar.|$|E

In his book Can we afford to grow older: A perspective on the economics of ageing (MIT Press, 1996), he took a relatively optimistic view of the gradual ageing of Western societies, arguing against fashionable views that such societies would inevitably be less productive and face lower living standards. He highlighted that many of the 'stylised facts' of household behaviour in response to ageing could be characterised in the 'life cycle' model of consumer spending, <b>saving,</b> <b>labour</b> supply, skill acquisition and bequests. Nevertheless, he highlighted some of the problems of public choice that arose in trying to curtail excessive public spending on state pensions and the need for reform of health care provision.|$|E

5000|$|The {{production}} of a relative surplus-population, or the setting free of labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution {{of the process of}} production that accompanies, and is accelerated by, the advances of accumulation; and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant. If the means of production, as they increase in extent and effective power, become to a less extent means of employment of labourers, this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers. The over-work of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to over-work and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one part of the working-class to enforced idleness by the over-work of the other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists,17 and accelerates {{at the same time the}} {{production of}} the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this element in the formation of the relative surplus-population, is shown by the example of England. Her technical means for <b>saving</b> <b>labour</b> are colossal. Nevertheless, if to-morrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount, and proportioned to the different sections of the working-class according to age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale. The great majority of the labourers now [...] "unproductive" [...] would have to be turned into [...] "productive" [...] ones.|$|E

The most difficult aspect of the empirical analysis is the approximation of labour income risk as a proxy variable for future labour income uncertainty. Individual disposable income is interacted with the probability of being unemployed and with the probability of job-loss in the next period to generate the labour income risk variables. The econometric results support the precautionary saving hypothesis and labour income risk emerges {{as one of the}} main determinants of household saving decisions. Moreover, households implement alternative strategies to smooth their income streams such as holding a second job and increasing the number of income earners in the family. However, it is observed that they are still vulnerable against labour income risk, which underlines the need for a satisfactory social security system.

40|$|SUMMARY: Details {{are given}} of the ‘auxanographic ’ method for {{identifying}} growth-factor requirements of micro-organisms, and particularly of mutant strains differing from a parent strain in having additional growth-factor requirements. Cells are distributed in a nutritionally deficient agar medium which {{is allowed to}} set in a Petri dish. Possible required nutrients are then spotted on the agar surface, thus enabling the corresponding exacting mutants to grow at those localities. The technique is only a labour-saving device which can be extremely efficient in shortening the pre-liminary steps in the work. It can also be applied to other uses, such as the identification of competitive interactions between nutrilites. Sixty years ago, in 1889, Beyerinck (Beijerinck) described a technique, simple and efficient, {{for the study of}} the nutritional requirements of micro-organisms. The ‘auxanographic ’ technique, as he called it, has gone almost unnoticed; the present author became aware of Beyerinck’s paper only after having redevised the technique, developed it for biochemical genetics, and used it for several years (Pontecorvo, 1947).

The modification was aimed to optimize the number of offsprings per AI dose. Methods Ninety Charolais cows and heifers were entered into the program an average of 1. 8 times. Thus, 164 animal cases were included. Animals were administered 10 - 12 μg of buserelin. Seven days later animals without a corpus luteum (CL) were rejected (20. 7 %) while the remaining 130 cases with a CL were administered prostaglandin F 2 α, followed 48 h later with a second injection of buserelin (8 - 10 μg). Fixed-AI was performed 16 - 20 hours after the last injection. Results The pregnancy rate was 51. 5 % (67 / 130). The pregnancy rate after a short interval (50 - 70 d) from calving to entering the program was significantly higher than that after a long interval (> 70 d).

We measure the bias {{with respect to the}} inputs capital, energy, non-energy materials and three types of labour (low-, medium- and high-skilled). For this purpose, the factor cost share approach based on the duality of production theory is applied. Estimating the system of cost share equations derived from a translog cost function, we find that technological change was low- and medium-skilled labour-saving, high-skilled labour-using, and energy- and materials-using. Second, the paper addresses the question how technological change could be redirected towards saving more energy and less labour. Patent applications in energy- and labour-saving technology fields are used to model the direction of technological change. We construct stocks of patents in these fields and integrate them into the system of cost share equations as proxies for the level of technology. Upon finding that they were indeed energy and labour saving over our sample period, we regress them on policy variables to identify instruments for shifting the bias away from <b>saving</b> <b>labour</b> towards saving energy. We conclude that one way to achieve this, at least partly, would be an increase in the energy tax rate coupled with a matching reduction in the social security contributions paid by employers for low-skilled workers...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. {{thesis is}} to {{contribute}} to the understanding of household consumption and saving behaviour under risk and uncertainty. The precautionary saving hypothesis proposes that households will postpone their consumption and increase their saving level to be protected against future labour income uncertainty. It is reasonable to interpret the additional rise in household saving due to future labour income uncertainty as precautionary saving. Moreover, it is expected that households will prefer to keep their precautionary saving in the form of financial assets because of their liquidity. I utilize several waves of household budget surveys, which are designed as repeated cross-sectional surveys that provide information about social, economic and demographic characteristics of households to reveal the empirical importance of precautionary saving in the Turkish economy. The empirical analysis confirms the predictions of the precautionary saving hypothesis. It is observed that households raise their saving level under risk and uncertainty and the amount of precautionary saving constitutes a significant fraction of total household <b>saving.</b> <b>Labour</b> income risk is the most important source of concern for households among the analysed risk types, since a job-opportunity in the registered economy creates a reliable source of income and social security coverage. Moreover, households implement alternative strategies in addition to precautionary saving such as holding a second job and to increase the number income earners in the family. The influence of risk and uncertainty on household consumption and saving behaviour is further intensified by the lack of a sufficient social security system, which meets the needs and the demands of society. However, a comprehensive social security reform starting with the introduction of universal health care is being implemented in Turkey. Thus, it is thought that the improvement of the social security system will diminish the significance of the precautionary motive for saving for households.

The latter through reductions in road and bridge asset rehabilitation costs through less wear-and tear from HVs with out-of-specification or deficient shock absorbers. HV tyre wear is used widely as an indicator that suspension dampers are worn. Blanksby et al., (2006) showed {{that this is not}} a good determinant of damper wear. Under the joint QUT/MR project Heavy vehicle suspensions – testing and analysis it is proposed to develop a low-cost shaker bed made from a modified roller-brake tester to impart a known vibration to the axle. Accordingly, a heavy vehicle brake-test roller machine will be instrumented and modified. It will be used to provide a sinusoidal loading into a HV suspension using eccentricity of the roller/s. This will be attempted for wheel loads varying from tare to full load and for shock absorber conditions from fully-functional to inoperative. Resonant peak force magnitudes should be able to be analysed for axle-hop and body-bounce. The results from this test programme will: •	be used to determine the threshold beyond which HV suspensions cause tyre wear and road damage compared with when they are new; •	augment the already-underway Main Roads programme being conduced to determine differences due to the "Haire suspension system" (Davis, 2006, 2007; Davis & Kel, 2007; Davis & Queensland Department of Main Roads, 2006 a, 2006 b) under the test conditions; and •	yield a "proof-of-concept" of moderate-cost testing machine to perform low-cost HV suspension testing...|$|E

Based on macro-trends and niche developments we argue that the food chain will become much more datadriven, based on up to date ICT. It will move away from a situation characterised by a low level of integration of data. This has a large potential impact on issues like sustainability, food safety, resource efficiency and waste reduction. The economic effects of such developments are still to be explored. At first sight it could lead to more closely integrated supply chains that makes the farmer act as a franchisee with limited freedom. But the opposite could be true as well, with more transparency and easier options for direct sales in consumer food webs, using social media and smart solutions for the ‘last mile’ delivery. Like with previous technological developments, not all farmers will invest in new skills and where technologies are <b>saving</b> <b>labour,</b> farms will get bigger. Some farms or regions will become less competitive if the basic infrastructure (e. g. in broad band internet or GPS systems) lacks. Competition between advisors could increase, if they are able to serve farmers digitally.
