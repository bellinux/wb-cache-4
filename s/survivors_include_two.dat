50|$|The Imperial prison barge Purge {{breaks down}} in a distant, {{uninhabited}} part of space. Its only hope appears to lie with the Star Destroyer Vector, drifting nearby, derelict and seemingly abandoned.

5|$|His {{final years}} {{were marked by}} poor health. Several weeks before his death, McAleer was {{admitted}} to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved.

5000|$|The {{ship was}} {{grounded}} {{so that the}} waves pummeled the bow section. [...] At about 6 am, the ship broke in two, with the stern grounded on the shore and the bow drifting off. [...] Many of the passengers and crew were swept away, but three people made it to shore (only 50 feet away) and another 11 remained in the bow section of the ship until the morning of November 8, when the storm abated. [...] The survivors all got to shore on November 8, and stayed that night with a party of fishermen. [...] On November 9, the Athabasca was intercepted and the survivors were taken on to Thunder Bay. Forty-six {{people died in the}} wreck of the Algoma; there were 14 <b>survivors,</b> <b>including</b> <b>two</b> passengers, 11 crewmen and the captain.

40|$|Traumatic {{injuries}} {{to the upper}} abdominal vasculature pose difficult management problems related to both exposure and associated injuries. Among those injuries that {{are more difficult to}} manage are those involving the portal vein. While occurring rarely, portal vein injuries require specific therapeutic considerations. Between January, 1968, and July, 1974, over 2000 patients were treated operatively for abdominal trauma at the Ben Taub General Hospital. Among these patients, 22 had injury to the portal vein. Seventeen portal vein injuries were secondary to gunshot wounds, 3 to stab wounds, and 2 to blunt trauma. Associated {{injuries to}} the inferior vena cava, pancreas, liver and bile ducts were common. Three patients had associated abdominal aortic injuries, two with acute aorto-caval fistulae. Nine patients died from from failure to control hemorrhage. Eleven were long-term <b>survivors,</b> <b>including</b> <b>two</b> who required pancreataico-duodenectomy as well as portal venorrhaphy. Late complications were rare. The operative approach to patients with traumatic injuries to multiple organs in the upper abdomen, including the portal vein, requires aggressive management and predetermined sequential methods of repair. In spite of innumerable associated injuries, portal vein injuries can be successfully managed in a significant number of patients using generally available surgical techniques and several adjunctive maneuvers...|$|R

Mary Lamar Leyendecker of Laredo, a long-term Cowl board member who was named the president of the association in 2015, told the Laredo Morning Times that Cowl was [...] "a true champion of the poor and people with physical disabilities. She was a true leader in the fight for human rights and fought for the rights of all people to live as dignified and independently as possible. She was an ageless and progressive thinker. ... She was always forward-thinking and kept up with what was good for patients. We're going to miss her so much." [...] Lillian Dickinson, a retired manager at the rehabilitation center who traveled to New York for Cowl's funeral services, {{in an interview with the}} Laredo Morning Times, called her [...] "a visionary for the community. ... she and I were idealistic and wanted to improve the quality of life for so many people. There were times I would make home visits and come into the center discouraged because of the poverty, and she would say, ‘No, no, let's sit down and talk about it.' So we would strategize and come up with ideas for solving problems." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{outcomes}} of 53 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia secondary to MDS, autografted in first complete remission. Five (9. 4 %) died from the procedure whereas hematological reconstitution occurred in all the remaining patients. Forty patients (75 %) relapsed, with 87. 5 % of the relapses occurring within 2 years of the autologous transplant. With a median follow-up of 6. 2 years, the median actuarial disease-free survival and overall survival were 8 and 17 months after autograft, respectively. Karyotype was the only prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. The eight <b>survivors</b> (15 %), <b>including</b> <b>two</b> patients with unfavorable or intermediate karyotype, remained in first complete remission 50 + to 119 + months after transplantation and are probably cured...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{systematic}} review sought evidence concerning {{the effectiveness of}} peer mentoring for people with traumatic brain injury. Data sources: Fourteen electronic databases were searched, including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, from inception to September 21 2016. Ten grey literature databases, PROSPERO, two trials registers, reference lists and author citations were also searched. Review methods: Studies which employed a model of one-to-one peer mentoring between traumatic brain injury <b>survivors</b> were <b>included.</b> <b>Two</b> reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts before screening full texts of shortlisted studies. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed studies for quality and risk of bias. Results: The search returned 753 records, including one identified through hand searching. 495 records remained after removal of duplicates and 459 were excluded after screening. Full texts were assessed for the remaining 36 studies and six met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in the United States between 1996 and 2012 and employed a variety of designs <b>including</b> <b>two</b> randomised controlled trials. A total of 288 people with traumatic brain injury participated in the studies. No significant improvements in social activity level or social network size were found, but significant improvements were shown in areas including behavioural control, mood, coping and quality of life. Conclusion: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of peer mentoring after traumatic brain injury. The available evidence comes from small-scale studies, of variable quality, without detailed information {{on the content of}} sessions or the ‘active ingredient’ of the interventions...|$|R
