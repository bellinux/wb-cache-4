40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes is a Gram-positive human {{pathogen}} that is recognized by yet unknown pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Engagement of these receptor molecules during infection with S. pyogenes, a largely extracellular bacterium with limited capacity for intracellular survival, causes innate immune cells to produce inflammatory {{mediators such as}} TNF, but also type I interferon (IFN). Here we show that signaling elicited by type I IFNs is required for successful defense of mice against lethal <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>cellulitis</b> caused by S. pyogenes. Type I IFN signaling was accompanied with reduced neutrophil recruitment {{to the site of}} infection. Mechanistic analysis revealed that macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) employ different signaling pathways leading to IFN-beta production. Macrophages required IRF 3, STING, TBK 1 and partially MyD 88, whereas in cDCs the IFN-beta production was fully dependent on IRF 5 and MyD 88. Furthermore, IFN-beta production by macrophages was dependent on the endosomal delivery of streptococcal DNA, while in cDCs streptococcal RNA was identified as the IFN-beta inducer. Despite a role of MyD 88 in both cell types, the known IFN-inducing TLRs were individually not required for generation of the IFN-beta response. These results demonstrate that the innate immune system employs several strategies to efficiently recognize S. pyogenes, a pathogenic bacterium tha...|$|E

40|$|Cutaneous metastases of bladder car-cinoma {{are very}} rare. The rate of cuta-neous {{metastasis}} in urologic malignan-cies is 1. 3 % and this rate {{was found to}} be 0. 84 % for bladder carcinomas. Cuta-neous metastasis of bladder carcinoma can be confused with cellulitis. This case report presents a 60 -year-old patient operated on for bladder carcinoma and undergoing treatment for cellulitis because of erythematous lesions appear-ing in the suprapubic region in the ear-ly postoperative period. As there was no response to antibiotic treatment, skin biopsy was performed and cutaneous metastasis was diagnosed. Subse-quently, chemotherapy with carboplatin and gemcitabine was started. The prog-nosis of bladder carcinoma with cuta-neous metastasis has been reported to be poor. Key words: bladder carcinoma, cutaneous and <b>subcutaneous</b> metastasis, <b>cellulitis...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} November 1967 to September 1968 Haemophilus influenzae type b was {{isolated}} from the blood of 11 young children. Only three of these presented with meningitis; others had septic arthritis, oesteomyelitis, <b>subcutaneous</b> abscesses, <b>cellulitis,</b> respiratory infections, and undifferentiated pyrexia. During the preceding five years H. influenzae type b was {{isolated from the}} blood cultures of 15 patients, and {{all but two of}} these were cases of meningitis. Blood culture has proved of value in establishing the role of H. influenzae type b in a broad spectrum of acute infections, and the suggestion is made that meningitis may represent only a minority of cases of haemophilus septicaemia. Because H. influenzae is resistant to some antibiotics bacteriological diagnosis of such cases is important if the correct treatment is to be given...|$|R
40|$|Natural killer/T-cell {{lymphoma}} is a rare, Epstein–Barr virus-associated type of cytotoxic lymphoma thatpresents {{mainly in}} the nasal cavity and its vicinity. Very few cases of primary cutaneous extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma have been reported till date. All the previously reported cases of primary cutaneous extranodalnatural killer/T-cell lymphoma presented as lesions resembling <b>cellulitis,</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> nodules or ulcers. We report a rare case which presented as erythematous and purpuric round patches on the arms and was finally diagnosed as primary cutaneous extranodalnatural killer/T-cell lymphoma, following a skin biopsy. The atypical patchy lesions presented a diagnostic challenge. We herein describe this clinically novel atypical patch-like presentation of primary cutaneous extranodalnatural killer/T-cell lymphoma together with the key histopathologic features and highlights of the previously reported cases...|$|R
50|$|The {{surgical}} and liposculpture contouring of {{the human}} body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological — unmet body image expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical — uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic — toxic reactions to the anaesthesic and the tumescent drugs; and the nervous — paresthesia, localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region. The medical complications possible to a surgical buttocks augmentation procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include infection, surgical-wound dehiscence that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, seroma (a pocket of clear serous fluid), capsular contracture, asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the sciatic nerve, and paresthesia (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a liposclupture buttocks augmentation include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, abscess (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), <b>cellulitis</b> (<b>subcutaneous</b> connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.|$|R
