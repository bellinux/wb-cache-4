40|$|Basically in the {{investment}} casting process development of thin ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is very crucial as this mould inherent brittle property and highly {{exposed to the}} cracking mechanism. The slurry composition produces green(unfired) ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> which low in strength and easily crack or fail during wax removal or handling processing.

In fact, through SEM observations showed that the addition of fibers to the ceramic body to form a composite <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> prevent the crack propagation mechanism due to the existence of the matrix-fibre bridging which create the resistance of fiber to pull-out.

The influence of the pattern removing method and temperature on the pattern removing were investigated. The <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> cracking mechanism was analyzed by using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and combining the temperature field and the volume change of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam pattern being tested. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was not easily cracked when the pattern removing process was carried out with the furnace being heated little by little because of the shell slowly shrinking with dehydration and shell strength gradually increasing. The <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was soon destroyed when it was set directly into the furnace at above 400 ℃ because of the thin <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> rapidly shrinking and the foam pattern hindering. However, the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> had no cracking when it had been preheated for a long time even if the furnace temperature was above 400 篊 and the shell was put into the furnace directly. Moreover, when the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was directly set into the furnace at lower temperatures, 250 to 300 ℃, the shell would shrink slowly and the foam pattern would stay at the maximum expansion stage temperature of 100 to 110 ℃ for a long time; and the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> would experience an expansion force from the foam pattern for a long time.

Due to this fact the strengthening mechanism of the brittle sllell mold using reinforcement method was studied and investigated in this work. Rice husk was chosen as a reinforcement material as it contains silica element which can withstand high temperature of molten metal.

40|$|Generally, {{production}} of metal component via investment casting process need a {{development of a}} very thin ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> that can withstand a higher molten metal temperature. Development of ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is very crucial as its involves several times of dipping process followed by the drying and firing stages. Typically, this ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is very brittle and easily prone to cracks {{that will lead to}} the casting defects and handling problem at early stage. Therefore, this work focuses on the development of brittle ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> via reinforcement method. Rice husk fibers and rice husk ash were selected as a reinforcement material due to the facts that its contains higher percentage of silica. The samples were prepared by three compositions which are untreated rice husk fiber, rice husk treated fiber by sodium hydroxide and rice husk ash. The mechanical and physical properties of ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> layering system were measured via Modulus of Rupture, density and porosity, permeability, shrinkage, thermal expansion and observation of metal casting. Experimental results show that the reinforced ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> with treated rice husk fiber achieved highest green strength (1. 34 MPa). However, ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> with rice husk ash shows the highest fired strength (4. 87 MPa). Indeed, rice husk fibers additions have greatly increased porosity after firing at 1000 ºC by values of 20. 06 % and hence promotes increments of permeability by value of 2. 46 x 10 - 11 cm 2. The present of silica also gives highest density, lowest shrinkage and thermal expansion by value of 1. 9516 g/cm 3, 0. 1258 mm and 0. 088 % respectively for ceramic shell with rice husk ash. Observation of metal casting shows that reinforced ceramic shell can withstand high molten metal temperature without cracking. Hence, reinforced ceramic shell has reduced production time and cost via avoiding failure to the mould and end cast product...|$|E
