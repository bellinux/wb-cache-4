40|$|Hybrid {{simulation}} combines numerical {{and experimental}} methods for cost-effective, large-scale testing of structures under simulated dynamic earthquake loads. Particularly for experimental seismic collapse simulation of structures, hybrid testing {{can be an}} attractive alternative to earthquake simulators due to the limited capacity of most facilities and the difficulties and risks associated with a collapsing structure on a shaking table. The benefits of hybrid simulation through collapse can be further enhanced through accurate and practical substructuring techniques {{that do not require}} testing the entire structure. An innovative <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> for hybrid simulation of structures subjected to large deformations is proposed to simplify the boundary conditions by overlapping the domains between the numerical and experimental subassemblies. The advantages of this <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> are the following: it requires only critical components of the structure to be tested experimentally; it reduces the number of actuators at the interface of the experimental subassemblies; and it can be implemented using typically available equipment in laboratories. Compared with previous overlapping methods that have been applied in hybrid simulation, this approach requires additional sensing in the hybrid simulation feedback loop to obtain internal member forces, but provides significantly better accuracy in the highly nonlinear range. The proposed <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> is verified numerically and validated experimentally, using the response of a four-story moment-resisting frame that was previously tested to collapse on an earthquake simulator...|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of two series of hybrid simulations that aim {{to trace the}} system-level seismic response of a four-story steel moment frame building structure through collapse is presented. In the first series of tests, a half-scale 1 &# 0189;-bay by 1 &# 0189;-story physical substructure of a special steel moment-resisting frame is considered, while in the second series the physical substructure corresponds to the gravity framing system with a similar-sized specimen. An objective of these tests is to demonstrate the potential of hybrid simulation with substructuring as a cost-effective alternative to earthquake simulators for large-scale system-level testing of structural frame subassemblies. The performance of a recently developed <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> and time-stepping integration method for hybrid simulation are evaluated when employed with large and complex numerical substructures exhibiting large levels of nonlinear response. The <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> simplifies the experimental setup by {{reducing the number of}} required actuators while adequately approximating the boundary conditions including lateral displacements and axial loads on columns.

40|$|This Letter {{applies the}} concept of `jets', as {{constructed}} from calorimeter cell four-vectors, to jets composed (primarily) of photons (or leptons).

40|$|International audienceA <b>substructuring</b> <b>technique</b> is {{proposed}} which enables fast computation of the acoustic response of arbitrary-shaped 2 D cavities subject to {{different kinds of}} excitations. It combines rectangular superelements which are modeled {{by means of the}} wave finite element (WFE) method, and arbitrary-shaped superelements modeled using component mode synthesis (CMS). Within the WFE framework, the so-called receptance matrices of rectangular superelements — which link the pressure vectors to the acoustic force vectors over the boundaries — can be derived in an efficient way in terms of wave modes, without the need of explicitly condensing the internal degrees of freedom of the systems. A model reduction strategy {{is proposed}} which aims at expressing the receptance matrices with a few wave modes only. The proposed strategy involves enclosing each rectangular superelement in a finite element (FE) layer with a small width. In this way, smoothed pressure fields are likely to occur over the WFE superelements, hence enabling these superelements to be described with a few wave modes only. By considering those WFE-based rectangular superelements surrounded by FE layers, this yields the so-called hybrid WFE/FE superelements whose dynamic stiffness matrices can be computed in a very fast way. Modeling a whole arbitrary-shaped acoustic cavity follows from conventional assembly procedure between hybrid WFE/FE superelements, CMS superelements and other FE components.

40|$|A new jet observable, dipolarity, is {{introduced}} that can distinguish whether {{a pair of}} subjets arises from a color singlet source. This observable is incorporated into the HEPTopTagger and is shown to improve discrimination between top jets and QCD jets for moderate to high p{sub T}. The impressive resolution of the ATLAS and CMS detectors means that a typical QCD jet at the LHC deposits energy in {Omicron}(10 - 100) calorimeter cells. Such fine-grained calorimetry allows for jets to be studied in much greater detail than previously, with sophisticated versions of current techniques {{making it possible to}} measure more than just the bulk properties of jets (e. g. event jet multiplicities or jet masses). One goal of the LHC is to employ these techniques to extend the amount of information available from each jet, allowing for a broader probe of the properties of QCD.
