5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not <b>significantly</b> <b>increase</b> the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can <b>significantly</b> <b>increase</b> the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb.

Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
40|$|Aims Plant {{growth and}} {{substance}} allocation are greatly affected by temperature change, {{and the response}} modes {{have been shown to}} vary for different functional groups (graminoids and forbs). Our main objective was to assess how experimental warming affects growth in different functional groups and how they adapt to experimental warming by different substance allocation and structural adjustment. Methods We selected three dominant plant species, graminoid Elymus nutans and forbs Rumex acetosa and Potentilla anserina, in an alpine meadow in Northwestern Sichuan, and adapted open-top chambers as passive warming devices to generate an artificially warmed environment. After three years of warming, we measured biomass accumulation and substance allocation of the three species. Important findings Compared to the control, experimental warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> SLA (specific leaf area) and biomass accumulation of E. nutans and R. acetosa and significantly decreased SLA and biomass accumulation of P. anserine. Warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> leaf biomass of R. acetosa, but its root biomass significantly decreased; however, warming significantly decreased leaf biomass and stem biomass of P. anserine and its root biomass <b>significantly</b> <b>increased.</b> Warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> root C concentration of R. acetosa, but decreased root N concentration. Warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the LMR (leaf mass ratio), RMR (root mass ratio) and R/S (shoot/root biomass ratio) of R. acetosa, but its SMR (stem mass ratio) significantly decreased. For P. anserina, warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> its RMR and R/S, but its SMR and LMR significantly decreased. Warming <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> C and N allocation in leaves of R. acetosa, and also <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> C allocation in its roots, but C and N allocations in its stem were significantly decreased. For P. anserina, warming significantly decreased C allocation in its leaves, but C and N allocations in its roots were <b>significantly</b> <b>increased...</b>|$|R

Increasing water application rate <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> CGR, but {{no significant differences were}} detected among the RGR values at the various water levels. Nitrogen fertilizer additions <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the CGR.

Water levels had a positive significant effect on the cotton reproductive growth. Increased N and water <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> total N-uptake by cotton plants. Nitrogen additions <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> N% of leaves, burrs and seed. However, N% of stem was significantly reduced with high N applications.

A total of 192 Arbor Acre broiler chickens (one-day-old) were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chickens. These 4 diets were formulated by adding 0, 500, 1, 000 and 2, 000  mg/kg AAE to the basal diet. The results showed as follows: 1) compared with the control, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in ileum for the 2, 000  mg/kg treatment group was <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> at 21 days of age (P <  0. 05); the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> in broilers supplemented with 500  mg/kg AAE at 42 days of age (P <  0. 05), and the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly improved in 1, 000  mg/kg treatment group (P <  0. 01). 2) At 21 days of age, supplementation of 500  mg/kg AAE <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the catalase (CAT) activity of small intestine, and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of jejunum was improved (P <  0. 01), meanwhile, the GSH-Px activity of duodenum and the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity of duodenum and jejunum were significantly higher than those of the control group (P <  0. 05); supplementation of 1, 000  mg/kg AAE <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the CAT activity of duodenum and ileum and the GSH-Px activity of duodenum and jejunum (P <  0. 05), and the ileum GSH-Px activity was <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> (P <  0. 01); supplementation of 2, 000  mg/kg AAE <b>significantly</b> <b>increased</b> the CAT activity of duodenum and ileum (P <  0. 05).

5|$|Stylidium {{species with}} glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been {{suggested}} to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous).
