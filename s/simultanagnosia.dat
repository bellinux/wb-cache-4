50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that <b>simultanagnosia</b> results from slowed attentional processing. According to this view, attention is seen as filter through which one percept at time passes, and {{the speed with which}} an individual's attention can filter percepts is much slower for a patient with <b>simultanagnosia</b> than a person without the disorder. People without <b>simultanagnosia</b> are able to perceive numerous objects at once because they can shift their attention rapidly enough between stimuli so that percepts are integrated before they decay from short-term memory. However, those with <b>simultanagnosia</b> are incapable of shifting their attention quickly enough from one object to another, and thus, they only perceive one object at a time.|$|E
50|$|A {{study which}} {{directly}} tested {{the relationship between}} the restriction of the attentional window in <b>simultanagnosia</b> compared with the vision of healthy participants with normal limits of visual processing confirmed the limitations of difficulties of patients with <b>simultanagnosia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{treatment}} available for patients with dorsal <b>simultanagnosia,</b> {{and it is likely}} that the bilateral lesions resulting in <b>simultanagnosia</b> will not heal. However, a recent study demonstrated that recovery may be related to finding ways to expand the restricted attentional window—their global gestalt perception—that characterizes the disorder. In another study a participant showed an improvement 18 months after stroke induced ventral <b>simultanagnosia,</b> this [...] "represents the usual partial recovery from an early ventral simultanagnosia/pure alexia".|$|E
50|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> {{results from}} {{bilateral}} lesions to the junction between the parietal and occipital lobes. These lesions could {{result from a}} stroke or traumatic brain injury. It is also possible for simultanagnosic symptoms to develop from degenerative disorders. For example, {{one study found that}} four patients with progressive dementia eventually developed symptoms of <b>simultanagnosia</b> as well as components of Gerstmann's syndrome and transcortical sensory aphasia. In addition, patients with Huntington's disease have been found to exhibit visual impairments similar to those of <b>simultanagnosia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Simultanagnosia,</b> hemivisual neglect: Dominant visual cortex, {{contralateral}} hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> can {{be divided}} into two {{different}} types: dorsal and ventral, with each taking its name from the dorsal and ventral circuits concerned with the perception of objects' shapes and locations, respectively. These two forms of <b>simultanagnosia</b> are associated with different symptoms as well as damage to separate areas of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theory to}} account for <b>simultanagnosia</b> states that {{patients}} have difficulty analyzing shapes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> is a {{profound}} visual deficit. It impairs the ability to perceive multiple items in a visual display, while preserving the ability to recognize single objects. One study suggests that <b>simultanagnosia</b> may result from an extreme form of competition between objects which {{makes it difficult for}} attention to be disengaged from an object once it has been selected. Patients with <b>simultanagnosia</b> have a restricted spatial window of visual attention and cannot see more than one object at a time. They see their world in a patchy, spotty manner. Therefore, they pick out a single object, or even components of an individual object, without being able to see the global [...] "big picture." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{theory to}} account for <b>simultanagnosia</b> {{involves}} deficits in [...] "attentional disengaging," [...] and this impairment affects shifts of attention in any direction. When confronted with several objects, the patient's attention becomes [...] "locked" [...] onto one object, and he has difficulty disengaging his attention from this object to another one. As {{a result of this}} [...] "sticky fixation," [...] patients with <b>simultanagnosia</b> can perceive only one object at a time.|$|E
50|$|The {{validity}} of Bálint's syndrome {{has been questioned}} by some. The components in the syndrome's triad of defects (<b>simultanagnosia,</b> oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia) each may represent a variety of combined defects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> can {{be divided}} into two {{different}} categories: dorsal and ventral. Ventral occipito-temporal lesions cause a mild form of the disorder, while dorsal occipito-parietal lesions cause a more severe form of the disorder.|$|E
5000|$|... figure/ground {{defects in}} which a patient can see either the {{background}} but not the object residing somewhere in the whole scene, or conversely can see the object but sees no background around it (<b>simultanagnosia)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> is the {{inability}} to perceive simultaneous events or objects in one's visual field. Victims of Bálint's syndrome perceive the world erratically, {{as a series of}} single objects rather than seeing the wholeness of a scene.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{evidence}} supporting {{the view that}} subitizing and counting may involve functionally and anatomically distinct brain areas comes from patients with <b>simultanagnosia,</b> {{one of the key}} components of Balint's syndrome. Patients with this disorder suffer from an inability to perceive visual scenes properly, being unable to localize objects in space, either by looking at the objects, pointing to them, or by verbally reporting their position. Despite these dramatic symptoms, such patients are able to correctly recognize individual objects. Crucially, people with <b>simultanagnosia</b> are unable to enumerate objects outside the subitizing range, either failing to count certain objects, or alternatively counting the same object several times.|$|E
5000|$|Bilateral lesions to the parieto-occipital {{junction}} {{may cause}} the ventral circuit to slow down; as a result, patients with <b>simultanagnosia</b> have difficulty discriminating among visual features. According to this theory, [...] "feature degradation" [...] or increased [...] "noise" [...] {{occurs in the}} perceptual system. One study analyzed how well patients could process targets based on a feature salient from the background; it found that processing of targets was significantly impaired even though the targets were markedly different from the background. The results suggest that impairments in parsing, such as {{the process by which}} important regions are extracted from the retinal image, or difficulty in discriminating elementary visual features led to <b>simultanagnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that damage to any of several {{cognitive}} mechanisms could result in <b>simultanagnosia.</b> Several theories have been proposed to account for simultanagnosic symptoms, and while some focus on the disruption of a specific process, such as the speed of attentional processing, others focus on the disruption of a representational structure.|$|E
50|$|Ventral <b>simultanagnosia</b> {{results from}} {{damage to the}} left {{inferior}} occipito-temporal junction. Ventral simultanagnosic patients are able to see several objects at once, but their recognition of objects is piecemeal, or limited to one object at a time. Thus, individuals with ventral simultanagnosic symptoms are capable of navigating through a room without bumping into furniture.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} that impairments in mechanisms that register spatial locations lead to <b>simultanagnosia.</b> According to the feature-integration theory of attention, features of the visual scene, such as color and orientation, are registered early and in parallel across the visual field. These features are represented by separate maps that are later integrated to form a master map of locations that specifies where things are but not what they are. In order to identify objects, focused attention is required to bind perceptual representations of objects being viewed with features in their proper locations. Parietal lesions damage the master map of locations, and as a result, a variety of deficits can occur, including <b>simultanagnosia.</b> If space is necessary to distinguish objects, then deficits in explicit access to spatial information located in the master map leads to the inability to perceive more than one object at a time.|$|E
50|$|Bálint's {{syndrome}} is an uncommon and incompletely understood triad of severe neuropsychological impairments: inability {{to perceive the}} visual field as a whole (<b>simultanagnosia),</b> difficulty in fixating the eyes (oculomotor apraxia), and inability to move the hand to a specific object by using vision (optic ataxia). It was named in 1909 for the Austro-Hungarian neurologist and psychiatrist Rezső Bálint who first identified it.|$|E
50|$|Bálint's {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} a complete lack of eye-hand coordination and has been demonstrated to occur in isolation to optic ataxia. It is a rare psychological condition resulting most often from damage bilaterally to the superior parieto-occipital cortex. One of the most common causes is from strokes, but tumours, trauma, and Alzheimer's disease can also cause damage. Balint's syndrome patients can suffer from 3 major components: optic apraxia, optic ataxia, and <b>simultanagnosia.</b> <b>Simultanagnosia</b> is when patients have difficulty perceiving more than one object at a time. There have been three different approaches for rehabilitation. The first approach is the adaptive or functional approach. It involves functional tasks that use a patient's strengths and abilities. The second approach is remedial approach and involves restoration of the damaged central nervous system by training perceptual skills. The last approach is multicontext approach and this approach involves practising a targeted strategy in a multiple environment with varied tasks and movement demands, along with self-awareness tasks.|$|E
50|$|Dorsal <b>simultanagnosia</b> {{results from}} {{bilateral}} lesions to the junction between the parietal and occipital lobes. Here, perception {{is limited to}} a single object without awareness of the presence of other stimuli. Thus, being able to see only one object at a time, a patient may collide with various objects in a room being unaware of them. Additionally, objects in motion appear more difficult to perceive.|$|E
50|$|However, {{people with}} <b>simultanagnosia</b> have no {{difficulty}} enumerating objects within the subitizing range. The disorder {{is associated with}} bilateral damage to the parietal lobe, {{an area of the}} brain linked with spatial shifts of attention. These neuropsychological results are consistent with the view that the process of counting, but not that of subitizing, requires active shifts of attention. However, recent research has questioned this conclusion by finding that attention also affects subitizing.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{currently}} no quantitative methods for diagnosing <b>simultanagnosia.</b> To establish {{the presence of}} simultanagnosic symptoms, patients are asked to describe complex visual displays, such as the commonly used [...] "Boston Cookie Theft" [...] picture, which is {{a component of the}} Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. In the picture, the sink in the kitchen is overflowing as {{a boy and a girl}} attempt to steal cookies from the cookie jar without their mother noticing.|$|E
5000|$|This spatial {{disorder}} of visual attention—the {{ability to identify}} local elements of a scene, but not the global whole—has {{been referred to as}} a constriction of the individual's global gestalt window—their visual [...] "window" [...] of attention. People fixate their eyes to specific images in social scenes because they are informative to the meaning of the scene. Any forthcoming recovery in <b>simultanagnosia</b> may be related to somehow expanding the restricted attentional window that characterizes this disorder.|$|E
50|$|Finally, <b>simultanagnosia</b> {{may result}} from deficits in spatial indexing. Several studies have noted that a pre-attentive stage of {{processing}} exists during which visual features are obtained from the visual field in parallel. Once these features have been extracted, they can be indexed, which allows them to function as anchor points for additional visual routines; visual routines are sequences of elemental operations, such as visual search or texture segregation, which define the spatial relationships among objects {{as well as their}} properties.|$|E
5000|$|Patients take {{a clearly}} {{piecemeal}} approach to interpreting the scene by reporting isolated {{items from the}} image. For instance, a patient may report seeing a [...] "boy," [...] "stool," [...] and a [...] "woman." [...] However, when asked to interpret the overall meaning of the picture, the patient fails to comprehend the global whole. Another picture used to assess visual impairments of patients with <b>simultanagnosia</b> is the [...] "Telegraph Boy" [...] picture. Upon examination of higher nervous system functions, patients display no general intellectual impairments.|$|E
50|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to recognize certain objects, persons or sounds. Agnosia is typically caused by damage to the brain (most commonly in the occipital or parietal lobes) or from a neurological disorder. Treatments {{vary depending on the}} location and cause of the damage. Recovery is possible depending on the severity of the disorder and the severity of the damage to the brain. Many more specific types of agnosia diagnoses exist, including: associative visual agnosia, astereognosis, auditory agnosia, auditory verbal agnosia, prosopagnosia, <b>simultanagnosia,</b> topographical disorientation, visual agnosia etc.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Simultanagnosia</b> (or simultagnosia) {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} disorder characterized by the inability of an individual to perceive {{more than a single}} object at a time. This type of visual attention problem is one of three major components (the others being optic ataxia and optic apraxia) of Bálint's syndrome, an uncommon and incompletely understood variety of severe neuropsychological impairments involving space representation (visuospatial processing). The term [...] "simultanagnosia" [...] was first coined in 1924 by Wolpert to describe a condition where the affected individual could see individual details of a complex scene but failed to grasp the overall meaning of the image.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, a 70-year-old man {{presented}} with akinetopsia. He had stopped driving two years prior {{because he could}} no longer [...] "see movement while driving". His wife noted that he could not judge the speed of another car or how far away it was. He had difficulty watching television with significant action or movement, such as sporting events or action-filled TV shows. He frequently commented to his wife that he could not [...] "see anything going on". When objects began to move they would disappear. He could, however, watch the news, because no significant action occurred. In addition he had signs of Balint's syndrome (mild <b>simultanagnosia,</b> optic ataxia, and optic apraxia).|$|E
5000|$|One study {{developed}} {{a computer model}} of high-level visual processing, which contrasts with low-level visual processing in that it {{involves the use of}} previously stored information to identify objects and navigate. When the spatiotopic mapping subsystem of the model was partially damaged, simultanagnosic symptoms resulted. In the model simulation of <b>simultanagnosia,</b> the same location was assigned to all stimuli, therefore preventing the model from identifying multiple objects at once. Either the model [...] "locked" [...] onto the first object and was unable to disengage attention, or once recognition of the first object was completed, it [...] "disappeared" [...] from sight to be replaced by the second object.|$|E
50|$|Patients with <b>simultanagnosia,</b> a {{component}} of Bálint's syndrome, have a restricted spatial window of visual attention and cannot see more than one object {{at a time in}} a scene that contains more than one object. For instance, if presented with an image of a table containing both food and various utensils, a patient will report seeing only one item, such as a spoon. If the patient's attention is redirected to another object in the scene, such as a glass, the patient will report that they see the glass but no longer see the spoon. As a result of this impairment, simultanagnosic patients often fail to comprehend the overall meaning of a scene.|$|E
5000|$|A Navon {{figure is}} made of a larger {{recognisable}} shape, such as a letter, composed of copies of a smaller different shape. Navon figures are used in tests of visual neglect. David Navon's research demonstrated that global features are perceived more quickly than local features. Jules Davidoff also performed research, but in a remote culture, finding opposite results; the participants more readily identified the local features. [...] Patients with <b>Simultanagnosia</b> have difficulty identifying global features, and when presented with a Navon figure will identify only the local features. [...] In a recent study comparing global-local processing in different races, {{it was found that}} East Asians demonstrated significantly stronger global processing than Caucasians.|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} {{patients}} {{were required to}} read one word and then read a second word that followed the first in rapid succession. While individuals could identify the first word relatively quickly, they had significantly greater difficulty identifying the second word. Furthermore, if the second word was shown after a long delay following the first word, identification of the second word was easier. These results indicate that patients with <b>simultanagnosia</b> have difficulty processing objects presented in rapid succession, and the patient is unable to shift his attention rapidly enough between successive stimuli since {{a certain amount of}} time is required for the patient to shift his attention from the first word in order to be able to identify the second word.|$|E
5000|$|Saliency of {{a feature}} {{facilitates}} {{the ease with}} which it can be indexed. For example, the greater the difference between a specific feature and surrounding ones, the more easily it can be indexed. The indexed features, or anchor points, can serve as a [...] "spotlight" [...] that directs focal attention to certain objects, which can then channel visual information to specialized systems for space and shape analysis. Deficits in the spatial indexing mechanism would result in symptoms of <b>simultanagnosia</b> because interpretation of a complex scene requires rapid shifting of attention to various elements, and impairments in spatial indexing lead to the inability to index multiple visual features rapidly. In addition, perception is slowed, and low-level visual processing is disrupted since the patient {{would not be able to}} extract and index salient features.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, Rezső Bálint {{published}} one of {{the earliest}} descriptions of <b>simultanagnosia.</b> He studied a patient who easily identified single objects, regardless of size, but claimed that he could only see one object when presented with a complex display of numerous items. This patient also exhibited ocular apraxia, an impairment of voluntary eye movements despite intact oculomotor reflexes, and optic ataxia, or the impairment of visually guided hand movements. This collection of symptoms would later be called Bálint's syndrome. Because the size of the object did not affect his patient's ability to perceive an item, Bálint argued that his patient did not have a narrowing of the sensory field. Therefore, Bálint concluded that the patient's attention would always be as narrow as the size of the item being observed. In other words, the attentional window of a simultanagnosic patient is limited to one object.|$|E
50|$|Bálint's {{syndrome}} symptoms can {{be quite}} debilitating since they impact visuospatial skills, visual scanning and attentional mechanisms. Since it represents impairment of both visual and language functions, it is a significant disability that can affect the patient's safety—even in one's own home environment, and can render the person incapable of maintaining employment. In many cases the complete trio of symptoms—inability to perceive the visual field as a whole (<b>simultanagnosia),</b> difficulty in fixating the eyes (oculomotor apraxia), and inability to move the hand to a specific object by using vision (optic ataxia)—may not be noticed until the patient is in rehabilitation. Therapists unfamiliar with Bálint's syndrome may misdiagnose a patient's inability to meet progress expectations {{in any of these}} symptom areas as simply indicating incapability of benefiting from further traditional therapy. The very nature of each Bálint symptom frustrates rehabilitation progress in each of the other symptoms. Much {{more research is needed to}} develop therapeutic protocols that address Bálint symptoms as a group since the disabilities are so intertwined.|$|E
