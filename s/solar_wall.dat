They spread themselves until the 80 ’s all over the world without any attention to the specific climate and the summer behavior; this caused the deactivation of the systems due to a series of problems connected to the summer overheating, the complex management and the rising of the dust. Until today the European regulation limits only the winter consumptions without any attention to the summer behavior but, the recent European EN 15251 underlines the relevance of the indoor comfort, and the necessity of the analytic studies validation by monitoring case studies. In the porpose paper we demonstrate that the <b>solar</b> <b>wall</b> is an efficient system both from thermal comfort and energy saving point of view and it is the most suitable for our temperate climates because it {{can be used as a}} passive cooling sistem too.

One wall consisting of 0. 25 m of timber framed insulation, and one wall consisting of 0. 2 m insulation and 0. 2 m concrete were tested. The U-value of both walls were 0. 17 W/m 2 K. The solar collectors were mounted on these wall elements as a replacement of the external weather barrier. The investigations were conducted in TRNSYS and in a dynamic model describing the thermal performance of the façade integrated solar collectors, created at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The complete solar collector system was designed according to recommended values from literature. A parametric study looking at the optimal design of the storage tank set point temperature, the ratio between the tank height and the diameter, the regulatory strategy, the flow rate, the water tank volume and {{the placement of the}} heat exchanger were conducted. Following was a heat pump installed in series with the solar collectors in the existing system. Different maximum evaporator inlet temperatures were tested to find the optimal system design. The initial results showed that the heavy <b>solar</b> <b>wall</b> performed better than the lightweight <b>solar</b> <b>wall.</b> During the winter days, the heavy <b>solar</b> <b>wall</b> lead to a substantial reduction in the negative transmission compared to the conventional heavy wall. During the summer days, both of the solar walls introduced a positive transmission contribution, which may lead to overheating the building. The contribution was lowest for the heavy <b>solar</b> <b>wall.</b> When installing 6. 68 m 2 collector area in the TEK- 10 building with the heavy wall configuration, the annual negative transmission was reduced by 84 % through the wall area with the installed collectors. A positive transmission of 39 kWh annually was also introduced. The parametric study revealed that the best design for system performance was not necessarily the optimal design for transmission energy savings. Related to transmission, lowering the flow rate showed the highest energy saving, of 1. 5 kWh/m 2 annually. In maximizing the collector performance, changing the regulatory strategy of the system led to an annual energy saving of 1. 05 kWh/m 2 floor area. This was also the efficiency measure that led to the biggest energy saving when accounting for both transmission and collector performance. The use of a series connected heat pump further improved the system performance.

In the proposed method a Test Shell with <b>Solar</b> Mass <b>Wall,</b> is used to service the heating needs of nursing sows while for the nurslings was created a special flooring (pad) with embodied heated pipes, throw a system of solar collectors and heating storage tank. The structural elements of this system are a <b>solar</b> mass <b>wall,</b> a specially designed heated flooring (shelter), a solar absorber, a solar collector, a heating storage tank and a heating supply tank. These elements are combined together using appropriate fluid circuits and digital controllers. The system provides a suitable environment for the nursling’ shelter {{as well as to the}} nursing sow through the <b>solar</b> mass <b>wall.</b> The system is composed of two main circuits. The first one includes the solar units and the storage (heating) tank (Circuit A) and the second one contains the supply (after-heating) tank and the pad (Circuit B). The first days are the most critical in a piglet’s life. Up to 80 % of piglet losses occur in the first 3 days of life and the majority of deaths are attributed to crushing. To reduce piglet losses by crushing by the sow the nest area must be warm. However, because of economic and hygienic disadvantages, straw is becoming less and the modern practice is to use either electric or gas infrared heaters, or underground heaters with solid plates. In the first 10 days of life, the young piglets require temperatures of at least 32 - 36 OC in the nest. Infrared heaters with IR-emitter have the highest temperature on the surface directly under the centre of the radiator, and outwards from the centre the temperature drops. An underground heater (warm water heat source) has a homogeneous surface temperature, therefore every piglet of the litter gets the same temperature in the nest area. The flooring in farrowing pens must satisfy a wide variety of criteria. The floor must be durable and easily to clean. The aim of this investigation was to test a new heating system for young piglets and to compare it with the conventional electric heating lamps and the warm water bed. This system incorporates all the benefits of the floor heating systems. In addition the controlled distribution of the solar energy, not only reduces the consumption of the electric energy to the 20 - 25 % of the consumption of the conventional system with infrared lamps, but also provides the specific thermal environment for the weaned piglets as well as to the nursing sown. Using a control system, the fluid temperature is kept close to the desired optimal temperature, in contrast with the conventional halogen and incandescent infrared lamps where the heating is regulated by the distance between the lamp and the piglets. Furthermore, the optimal temperature is regulated to decrease one degree centigrade per day and this means that the electric consumption is decreased as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{utilizing}} nanomaterial on {{the solar}} still productivity investigated experimentally. Cuprous oxides (CuO) chosen as a nanoparticles material. The nanoparticles {{added to the}} black paint of the <b>solar</b> still <b>walls</b> to enhance the solar still performance. Experiments conducted with cuprous oxide nanoparticles weight concentrations ranged from 10 % to 40 %. It is found that adding nanoparticles to paint increase heat transfer rate and saline water temperature. Solar still productivity of the proposed system is higher than that for the conventional still. Results acquired that utilizing CuO nanoparticles boosted the distillate by 16 % and 25 % {{as compared to the}} conventional solar still (CSS) at weight fraction concentration of 10 % and 40 %, respectively. Payback period of the distillation system for the modified still using CuO nanomaterials is about 96  days, at weight fraction 10 %, which is considerable as compared by 89  days for CSS.

40|$|Improvements in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) {{system design}} {{to ease the}} {{geometry}} and performance requirements are discussed. A TPV system usually consists of a receiver cavity lined with reflective materials and Si solar cells. A suspended central absorber/radiator converter absorbs solar energy and heats to an equilibrium temperature of 2000 - 23, 000 K. Radiant heat at that temperature is well matched to Si solar cell low energy excitation. An elliptical geometry cavity is described which bypasses normal cell mounting problems by having the cells fixed to a plate positioned between the loci of the cavity. Incoming concentrated solar flux is absorbed by the absorber/radiator, which emits the radiation for reflection from the cavity walls to eventually pass through the <b>solar</b> cell <b>wall.</b> Dielectric stack coatings {{can be used on}} the walls. A theoretical model was developed for the performance and verified with a laboratory apparatus. Efficiencies of nearly 30 % were found practical with existing materials and technologies...|$|R
