40|$|Southeast Ethiopia {{situated}} within latitude 07 ° 07 ’ N and longitude 40 ° 10 ’ E at altitude 2200 m to 2400 m {{above sea}} level. Twenty five farmers who are knowledgeable about soils {{of the area}} are purposively selected to provide insight into different soil fertility management practices. Local methods used to identify different soils and to assess the fertility status. Farmers used soil color, texture, water holding capacity, fertilizer requirement (inherent fertility) and workability as a criteria to identify different soil types. However, soil color and texture were commonly used by farmers to describe soil quality. Farmers preferred black and clay soils to white and sandy soils due to their high water holding capacity and inherent fertility. Besides, soil samples were randomly collected from the farmer’s field under continuous cereal production systems. The study made up thirty-two sites and each site covered 2 400 m sampling area. Composite samples of surface and subsurface soils were collected using <b>special</b> <b>auger</b> from three depths (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 cm). The laboratory analysis result indicated the soils are low in cation exchange capacity, low to medium in organic matter, slightly acidic to neutral, very high in base saturation, low to medium in exchangeable bases and moderate in both total nitrogen and available phosphorus. These soils are low to moderate in fertility that requires quite reasonable management. As a summary, the combined effect of both qualitative (local indicators of soil fertility) and quantitative (technical indicators of soil fertility) information would result in better assessment of soil fertility pattern and soil fertility management strategies to ensure food security program...|$|E

40|$|Background: In Chile, leukemia {{is one of}} the {{diseases}} whose treatment is guaranteed by a <b>special</b> law called <b>AUGE</b> (universal access and explicit guaranties). Therefore, the knowledge of its treatment costs is of utmost importance. Aim: To determine and to characterize the direct costs of pharmacotherapy for leukemia at a regional hospital in Chile. Material and methods: Data were retrospectively obtained from electronic and manual records of the hospital for all patients treated for leukemia between 2003 and 2006. Patients were classified into four groups: pediatric and adult patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL children and ALL adults, respectively), and pediatric and adult patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML children and AML adults, respectively). Results: Total accumulated costs of pharmacotherapy for acute leukemia between 2003 and 2006 were 304, 724, 845 Chilean pesos (USD 574, 952). The higher total or per patient costs, were generated by drugs for chemotherapy compared to other required medications. The exception were AML children, where support drugs, such as antimicrobials, ant emetic drugs and colony stimulating factors, generated the higher costs per patient. Among ALL adults, AML children and AML adults, the costs were concentrated in the first 6 months of treatment. NO children followed this tendency concentrating the costs between the seventh and twenty-fourth months. Conclusions: Annual costs of pharmacotherapy per patient for acute leukemia in this regional hospital were approximately USD 4, 717. Chemotherapy was the item with the greatest impact on cost...|$|R
