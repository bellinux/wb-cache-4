2500|$|Outhwaite {{has been}} asked {{numerous}} times {{about the possibility of}} Mel returning to EastEnders since her departure. At various stages she replied [...] "never say never" [...] when asked if she would return but also insisted the time was not right. Although she has always refused to rule out the possibility of a future return, in 2010 she pondered that a return would be unlikely as the character did not have links in the current cast, and that she had never been asked back anyway, stating: [...] "People always ask me, but I've never been asked! It looks like I'm turning it down on a yearly basis, but I'm not. They've never asked me! So they don't want me back for one and I don't have any family left on the show. There's nobody on the Square <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>I</b> don't even think any of Mel's friends are still in it ... I could walk down the market and be an extra, I suppose! [...] I don't know how Mel would return because there's no-one there for her to return to. She doesn't really know anyone apart from Ian Beale and Phil Mitchell. So unless she was coming back to see one of them..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By right, not yet. But, as {{knowing your}} views, she may fret herself till <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>I</b> {{think you had}} better come at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She thinks me {{old enough}} {{to take care of}} myself, {{whatever}} you do, Mr. Hailes; besides, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can come up to breathe! I long for it!' ...|$|E
25|$|ERICKSON: So that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was really}} interested.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, the boys." [...] It was Mr Crimble's little dilemma {{all over}} again: Lady Pollacke was evidently {{wondering}} whether <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|R
25|$|ERICKSON: No, so that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was really}} interested.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it don't. She told Dade Walker that I got all {{the biggest}} flat-irons, when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> offered her the bureau. I did {{everything}} I could {{to make her feel}} satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor child, {{how will}} she bear it when <b>she</b> <b>knows?</b> <b>I</b> shall {{never see her}} again in life. It is hard, so hard. She does not suspect? You guard her from that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The little model, who was {{stroking}} a china ash-tray {{with her}} ungloved, inky fingers, muttered, with a smile, half pathetic, half cynical: [...] "She doesn't like me! <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> don't belong here. She hates me to come. She's jealous!" ...|$|E
60|$|Brightened up when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was near! That was glorious! That brightened up creation.|$|R
5000|$|I told Kate she's {{running for}} the hills; <b>I</b> wonder if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was joking.|$|R
60|$|I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her {{tenderness}} towards my wife; and I {{was sure}} that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did.|$|R
6000|$|... "A folly--at such a time," [...] Sautron insisted. The Marquis {{looked a}} question. The Count {{answered}} it. [...] "Aline," [...] said he, pregnantly. [...] "She knows. How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can't tell you, but she knows, {{and she is}} deeply offended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a whit. She laughed, {{and said}} she was in jest," [...] {{answered}} Jenkin; [...] "but I know the she-devil's jest from her earnest too well to be taken in that way. But <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> would never betray her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said he, on {{recovering}} his composure; [...] "arter I saw Blazes-- Frank, I mean, that's my brother, sir--I {{goes right}} away home to bed. I stops with my mother, sir, an' {{she saw me}} come off here this mornin', sir. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> was comin' here." ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{our eyes}} met, and I fancied {{that this time}} she was looking a little frightened. At any rate <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> was sure of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> hadn't {{said a word}} at {{the phone}} except 'Yes--yes--yes.' She says <b>she</b> doesn't <b>know</b> how <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> but <b>she</b> did <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> was awake and she heard the ring and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that there was word from Jem.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was coming}} over to Hope {{just as soon as}} the roads made it safe and {{pleasant}} for automobiling," [...] he murmured to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go and see my mother presently. Of course she won't be {{worrying}} about me, for <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am {{able to take care}} of myself; but at the same time it will give her some satisfaction to know what I am doing. You could find my mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Charley, when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am ill, {{she will}} try to make her way into the room. Keep her out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the last! Charley, if you let her in but once, only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here, I shall die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{a terrible}} disgrace to me," [...] said the Watch-Dog of Merryland, in a solemn voice, [...] "if you escape me. What will the Queen say when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> have watched here three hundred years without seeing anyone, and then allowed the first strangers who came along {{to pass through the}} archway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She listen'd with a flitting blush, [...] With downcast {{eyes and}} modest grace: [...] For well <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> could not choose [...] But gaze upon her face.|$|R

6000|$|... "I do not <b>know</b> if <b>I</b> am to blame," [...] he said, [...] "my {{wife has}} been no real wife to me since <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had a {{mistress}} and was no real husband to her." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Walwyn {{would have}} argued that he need not regret his {{incapacity}} to move, since it was no doubt already too late, but Berenger burst forth--'She will resist; she will resist to the utmost, even if she deems me dead. Tortures will not shake her when <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> live. I must prepare.' And he started to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{inclined}} to think she did," [...] Maxwell answered thoughtfully. [...] "She was also probably giving you good advice in the one way available. How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> cannot tell, but {{by the light of}} past experience I can make {{a good deal of the}} medley. As you probably surmised, her warning was not the result of divination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, if I {{thought so}} I'd beg her forgiveness. But I reckon I don't. What's more, I feel better than before. I'm only a cowboy an' never was much good till I met her. Then I braced. I got to havin' hopes, studyin' books, an' {{you know how}} I've been lookin' into this ranchin' game. I stopped drinkin' an' saved my money. Wal, she knows all thet. Once {{she said she was}} proud of me. But it didn't seem to count big with her. An' if it can't count big I don't want it to count at all. I reckon the madder Bo is at me the more chance I've got. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> love her--thet I'd die for her--thet I'm a changed man. An' <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> never before thought of darin' to touch her hand. An' she knows she flirted with Turner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{it had all}} risen for Densher to a {{considerable}} interest. [...] "And Aunt Maud--why shouldn't <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> mean that your friend there isn't really anything. Does she suppose him of ducal value?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was not {{to leave}} this place until <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was safe within our lines. I have some friends who are {{faithful}} to me." [...] After a pause she added, [...] "She has been here already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I said I met you in New York. You see I {{thought she}} might think it queer if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> only met you in San Francisco three weeks ago. Of course I said we were married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, there's Mammy," [...] said Marie, [...] "I think it's selfish of her {{to sleep}} so sound nights; <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> need little attentions almost every hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet she's so hard to wake. I {{absolutely}} am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose you're right," [...] said Bobbie. [...] "But {{it beats}} me why she thinks such {{a lot of}} these rotten little dates. What's it matter if I forgot what day we were married on or what day she was born on or what day the cat had the measles? <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> love her just as much as if I were a memorizing freak at the halls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It ain't coming," [...] was the reply. [...] "You've {{only got}} to say you've got it. Fact of the matter is, I've got my eye on a young lady; there's another chap after 'er too, and if she thought I'd got a rich uncle it might make all the difference. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> 'ad an uncle that went to New Zealand and was never heard of since. That's what {{made me think of}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{subscribed to}} this {{with all my}} heart, God <b>knows.</b> <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did; for the stateliness of her manner already abated towards me, except when she spoke in praise of him, and then her air was always lofty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} man slowly, [...] "my mother had some old-world belief, {{and she said}} it was a special gift. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had it. <b>She</b> said a thing of that kind should never be used for money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{too much}} for her. She would plague herself with these wretched {{household}} accounts! <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> hated the sound of them. I never let her bring them to me; but little did I think that she cried over them alone!' ...|$|R
