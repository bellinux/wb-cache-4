5|$|In 1826, Holmboe was {{appointed}} a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some {{claimed that he}} owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie (Plan and <b>Spherical</b> <b>Trigonometry)</b> (1834), and Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).|$|E
5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E

50|$|Born in Sonneberg in 1892 to Carl and Marie Hoffmeister, Cuno Hoffmeister {{obtained}} {{his first}} telescope in 1905 {{and became an}} avid amateur astronomer. After his father lost most of his money in 1914, Hoffmeister had to leave school in 1916 to start an apprenticeship in his father's company. During this time he continued to study <b>spherical</b> mathematics and <b>trigonometry.</b> In April 1915 he {{had the opportunity to}} substitute as the assistant of Ernst Hartwig at Remeis Observatory in Bamberg while the current holder of the position was drafted, mainly working on observations of meteors and variable stars. He held this position {{until the end of the}} war and then moved back to Sonneberg, where he made his Abitur in 1920.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{indications}} that Hipparchus knew <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> {{but the first}} surviving text {{of it is that}} of Menelaus of Alexandria in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.)</b> Ptolemy later used <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> to compute things like the rising and setting points of the ecliptic, or to take account of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans. He might have used <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} {{trigonometry}} in China {{slowly began to}} change and advance during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), where Chinese mathematicians began to express greater emphasis for the need of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> in calendarical science and astronomical calculations. The polymath Chinese scientist, mathematician and official Shen Kuo (1031–1095) used trigonometric functions to solve mathematical problems of chords and arcs. Sal Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles {{provided the basis for}} <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> developed in the 13th century by the mathematician and astronomer Guo Shoujing (1231–1316). As the historians L. Gauchet and Joseph Needham state, Guo Shoujing used <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> in his calculations to improve the calendar system and Chinese astronomy. The mathematical science of the Chinese would incorporate the work and teaching of Arab missionaries with knowledge of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> who had come to China {{in the course of the}} thirteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Muslim mathematicians {{introduced}} Euclidean Geometry, <b>Spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> and Arabic numerals in China.|$|E
25|$|Many theorems from {{classical}} geometry {{hold true}} for spherical geometry as well, {{but not all}} do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> angles are defined between great circles. <b>Spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, {{the sum of the}} interior angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.|$|E
25|$|Most of Nunes' {{achievements}} {{were possible}} because of his profound understanding of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> {{and his ability to}} transpose Ptolemy's adaptations of Euclidean geometry to it.|$|E
25|$|Early Islamic {{scholars}} recognized earth's sphericity, leading Muslim mathematicians {{to develop}} <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> {{in order to}} further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to Mecca. This determined the Qibla, or Muslim direction of prayer.|$|E
25|$|When doing {{trigonometry}} on Earth or {{the celestial}} sphere, {{the sides of}} the triangles are great circle arcs. The first success of quaternions was a rendering of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> to algebra. Hamilton called a quaternion of norm one a versor, and these are the points of elliptic space.|$|E
25|$|The exsecant (exsec, exs) and excosecant (excosec, excsc, exc) are {{trigonometric}} functions {{defined in terms}} of the secant and cosecant functions. They used to be important in fields such as surveying, railway engineering, civil engineering, astronomy, and <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> and could help improve accuracy, but are rarely used today except to simplify some calculations.|$|E
25|$|Important {{in fields}} such as surveying, railway {{engineering}} (for example to lay out railroad curves and superelevation), civil engineering, astronomy, and <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> up into the 1980s, the exsecant function is now little-used. Mainly, {{this is because the}} broad availability of calculators and computers has removed the need for trigonometric tables of specialized functions such as this one.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th century, Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made {{advances}} in <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b> He also wrote influential work on Euclid's parallel postulate. In the 15th century, Ghiyath al-Kashi computed {{the value of}} π to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating nth roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by Ruffini and Horner.|$|E
25|$|Lexell made {{important}} {{discoveries in}} polygonometry and celestial mechanics; the latter {{led to a}} comet named in his honour. La Grande Encyclopédie states {{that he was the}} prominent mathematician of his time who contributed to <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> with new and interesting solutions, which he took as a basis for his research of comet and planet motion. His name was given to a theorem of spherical triangles.|$|E
25|$|The whole do not amount, {{in point}} of evidence, to what we know {{ourselves}} of Banneker. We know he had <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor and friend, and never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker, which shows him {{to have had a}} mind of very common stature indeed.|$|E
25|$|Book I {{contains}} {{an outline of}} Aristotle's cosmology: on the spherical form of the heavens, with the spherical Earth lying motionless as the center, with the fixed stars and the various planets revolving around the Earth. Then follows an explanation of chords with table of chords; observations of the obliquity of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun through the stars); and an introduction to <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1835, {{the term}} haversine (notated {{naturally}} as hav. or base-10 logarithmically as log. haversine or log. havers.) was coined by James Inman {{in the third}} edition of his work Navigation and Nautical Astronomy: For the Use of British Seamen to simplify the calculation of distances between two points {{on the surface of}} the earth using <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> for applications in navigation. Inman also used the terms nat. versine and nat. vers. for versines.|$|E
25|$|Aubrey Diller {{has shown}} that the clima {{calculations}} which Strabo preserved from Hipparchus were performed by <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> with the sole accurate obliquity known to have been used by ancient astronomers, 23°40'. All thirteen clima figures agree with Diller's proposal. Further confirming his contention is the finding that the big errors in Hipparchus's longitude of Regulus and both longitudes of Spica agree to a few minutes in all three instances with a theory that he took the wrong sign for his correction for parallax when using eclipses for determining stars' positions.|$|E
25|$|Prediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., {{exactly when}} and {{where it will be}} visible, {{requires}} a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first {{to be able to do}} this. A rigorous treatment requires <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in Perí tēs katá plátos mēniaías tēs selēnēs kinēseōs ("On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude"), a work mentioned in the Suda.|$|E
25|$|In {{any case}} the work started by Hipparchus {{has had a}} lasting heritage, and was much later updated by Al Sufi (964) and Copernicus (1543). Ulugh Beg reobserved all the Hipparchus stars he could see from Samarkand in 1437 to about the same {{accuracy}} as Hipparchus's. The catalog was superseded only in the late 16th century by Brahe and Wilhelm IV of Kassel via superior ruled instruments and <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> which improved accuracy by {{an order of magnitude}} even before the invention of the telescope. Hipparchus is considered the greatest observational astronomer from classical antiquity until Brahe.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 9th century, the Persian {{mathematician}} and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> and {{map projection}} methods {{in order to}} convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, this type of projection {{had been used in}} ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries.|$|E
25|$|She {{attended}} parochial {{grade school}} in Chestnut Hill and Hallahan Catholic Girls High School in Philadelphia. In high school, {{she had taken}} a year of algebra, a year of plane geometry, a second year of algebra, and a year of trigonometry and solid geometry. After graduating high school, she enrolled in Chestnut Hill College for Women. During her studies, she took every mathematics course offered, including <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> differential calculus, projective geometry, partial differential equations, and statistics. She graduated {{with a degree in}} mathematics in June 1942, one of only a few mathematics majors out of a class of 92 women.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding {{the arduous}} duties of his professorship, he found time for {{investigation}} in various fields of physical science, and he published {{a very large}} number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometre, and various problems of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thābit ibn Qurra (known as Thebit in Latin) (born 836) {{contributed to}} a number of areas in mathematics, where he played an {{important}} role in preparing the way for such important mathematical discoveries as the extension of the concept of number to (positive) real numbers, integral calculus, theorems in <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> analytic geometry, and non-Euclidean geometry. In astronomy Thabit was one of the first reformers of the Ptolemaic system, and in mechanics he was a founder of statics. An important geometrical aspect of Thabit's work was his book on the composition of ratios. In this book, Thabit deals with arithmetical operations applied to ratios of geometrical quantities. The Greeks had dealt with geometric quantities but had not thought of them in the same way as numbers to which the usual rules of arithmetic could be applied. By introducing arithmetical operations on quantities previously regarded as geometric and non-numerical, Thabit started a trend which led eventually to the generalisation of the number concept.|$|E
25|$|Army officers' {{training}} {{was completed in}} the Military Academy (now Academia Militar de Agulhas Negras, also the only engineering school in Brazil up to 1874), {{although it was not}} obligatory for personnel to study there to advance in the profession. Personnel from the infantry and cavalry branches only needed to study the disciplines of the 1st year (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and technical drawing) and 5th year (tactical, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign, terrain reconnaissance and chemistry). Engineers and artillerymen were obliged to study the complete course, which resulted in their branches being considered the most prestigious. However, if they preferred, infantrymen and cavalrymen were allowed to study the disciplines of the 2nd year (algebra, geometry, analytical geometry, differential and integral calculus, descriptive geometry and technical drawing); 3rd year (mechanics, ballistics and technical drawing); 4th year (<b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> physics, astronomy, geodesy, geography and technical drawing); 6th year (regular and irregular fortification, attacking and defending strongholds, civil architecture, roads, ports, canals, mineralogy and technical drawing); and 7th year (artillery, mines and natural history).|$|E
25|$|Published {{after the}} death of Johannes, and with support from King Sobieski, the Prodromus Astronomiae {{consisted}} of three separate parts: a preface (labeled Prodromus), a star catalog (named Catalogus Stellarum), and an atlas of constellations (named Firmamentum Sobiescianum, sive Uranographia).Prodromus outlines the methodology and technology used in creating the star catalogue. It provides examples of the use of the sextant and quadrant by Johannes, in tandem with known positions of the sun, in calculating each stars' longitude and latitude. The written draft of the Catalogus Stellarum consists of 183 leaves, 145, alphabetized according to constellation, containing star positions. Each star had specific information recorded in columns: the reference number and magnitude found by astronomer Tycho Brahe, Johannes' own magnitude calculation, the star's longitude and latitude by both ecliptic coordinates measured by angular distances and meridian altitudes found using Johannes' quadrant, and the star's equatorial coordinates calculated using <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b> The printed version was similar to the written draft, except the two columns describing a star's ecliptic coordinates were combined, and only the single best value for the star's latitude and longitude was given. Also, the printed version held more than 600 new stars and 12 new constellations not documented in the written draft, bringing its total to 1564. Although the observations of the catalog used nothing more than the astronomer's naked eye, the measurements were so precise as {{to be used in the}} making of celestial globes into the early 18th Century.Firmamentum Sobiescianum, while technically part of the Prodromus Astronomiae as a well, was likely published separately and in tighter circulation. Housing its own cover page and page-numbering system, the atlas consisted of two hemispheres and 54 double-page plates of 73 constellations. Both the northern and southern hemispheres were centered on an ecliptic pole, and most star locations were all based off Johannes' own observations. Those that were not, the southern polar stars, were based on a catalog and map published in 1679 by Edmond Halley.|$|E
500|$|In {{the broad}} field of mathematics, Shen Kuo {{mastered}} many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry, circle packing, and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, {{as large as}} 1043. Shen's [...] "technique of small increments" [...] laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series. Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid. In his formula [...] "technique of intersecting circles", he created an approximation of the {{arc of a circle}} s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316). He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298). Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of [...] "dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2," [...] was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition [...] "9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2".|$|E
2500|$|Al-Jayyani's The book {{of unknown}} arcs of a sphere (a {{treatise}} on <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry)</b> had a [...] "strong influence on European mathematics". Regiomantus' On Triangles (c. 1463) certainly took his material on <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> (without acknowledgement) from Arab sources. Much {{of the material}} {{was taken from the}} 12th-century work of Jabir ibn Aflah, as noted in the 16th century by Gerolamo Cardano.|$|E
2500|$|During the Islamic Golden Age, certain {{advances}} {{were made}} in scientific fields, notably in mathematics and astronomy (algebra, <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry),</b> and in [...] chemistry, [...] etc. which were later also transmitted to the West.|$|E
2500|$|On {{leaving the}} RAF he joined BOAC in 1953 as a {{navigator}} and pilot, while initially continuing {{to fly in}} the Royal Auxiliary Air Force with 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron at North Weald in Essex. Of his airline navigation training, he later said: [...] "In those days it was a considerable academic syllabus. You had {{to be up to}} speed on <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> to get through it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the astronomical}} {{instruments}} {{constructed by the}} famous Chinese astronomer Guo Shoujing shortly afterwards resemble the style of instrumentation built at Maragheh. In particular, the [...] "simplified instrument" [...] (jianyi) and the large gnomon at the Gaocheng Astronomical Observatory show traces of Islamic influence. While formulating the Shoushili calendar in 1281, Shoujing's work in <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> may have also been partially influenced by Islamic mathematics, which was largely accepted at Kublai's court. These possible influences include a pseudo-geometrical method for converting between equatorial and ecliptic coordinates, the systematic use of decimals in the underlying parameters, {{and the application of}} cubic interpolation in the calculation of the irregularity in the planetary motions.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{carries the}} {{subtitle}} [...] "A text-book {{for the use}} of students of mathematics and physics. [...] Founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs, Ph.D., LL.D." [...] The first chapter covers vectors in three spatial dimensions, the concept of a (real) scalar, and the product of a scalar with a vector. [...] The second chapter introduces the dot and cross products for pairs of vectors. [...] These are extended to a scalar triple product and a quadruple product. [...] Pages 7781 cover the essentials of <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry,</b> a topic of considerable interest at the time because of its use in celestial navigation. [...] The third chapter introduces the vector calculus notation based on the del operator. The Helmholtz decomposition of a vector field is given on page 237.|$|E
2500|$|The {{translation}} of Al-Khwarizmi's work greatly influenced mathematics in Europe. As Professor Victor J. Katz writes: [...] "Most early algebra works in Europe in fact {{recognized that the}} first algebra works in that continent were translations {{of the work of}} al-Khwärizmï and other Islamic authors. There was also some awareness that much of plane and <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry</b> could be attributed to Islamic authors". The words algorithm, deriving from Al-Khwarizmi's Latinized name Algorismi, and algebra, deriving from the title of his AD 820 book Hisab al-jabr w’al-muqabala, Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala are themselves Arabic loanwords. This and other Arabic astronomical and mathematical works, such as those by al-Battani and Muhammad al-Fazari's Great Sindhind (based on the Surya Siddhanta and the works of Brahmagupta). were translated into Latin during the 12th century.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Karaji, in his {{treatise}} al-Fakhri, {{extends the}} methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. The historian of mathematics, F. Woepcke, praised Al-Karaji for being [...] "the first who introduced {{the theory of}} algebraic calculus." [...] Also in the 10th century, Abul Wafa translated the works of Diophantus into Arabic. Ibn al-Haytham would develop analytic geometry. Al-Haytham derived the formula for {{the sum of the}} fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a paraboloid, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of polynomials up to the fourth degree. [...] In the late 11th century, Omar Khayyam would develop algebraic geometry, wrote Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid, and wrote on the general geometric solution to cubic equations. Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made advances in <b>spherical</b> <b>trigonometry.</b> Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals.|$|E
