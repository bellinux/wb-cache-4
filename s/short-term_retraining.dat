40|$|The study {{aimed to}} verify the pattern of {{critical}} load (CL) and anaerobic swim capacity (ASC) during a twelve-week continuous program, after 3 and 9 days of detraining, and in a <b>short-term</b> <b>retraining</b> in swimming rats. Animals were distributed into four groups: control (CG), trained (TG), detrained 3 days (D 3 G) and detrained 9 days (D 9 G). They were submitted to a CL test in a swimming exercise. TG group trained continuously during 12 weeks. D 3 G and D 9 G groups trained for five weeks, stopped for three and nine days, respectively, {{and came back to}} complete the training period. ANOVA two-way for repeated measures was used to compare data. All groups showed decline on CL during the twelve weeks of training, but TG showed higher CL values {{at the end of the}} twelve weeks (T: 7. 03 Â± 1. 62 % of body mass, p< 0. 05). ASC values did not have a regular pattern of change; there were no statistical difference in the end of the twelve weeks. This study showed that continuous training was able to keep CL values higher than the other groups, but detraining and a <b>short-term</b> <b>retraining</b> was not benefic for CL and ASC...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} {{effectiveness of}} three treatment packages for agoraphobia was tested. Patients received {{one of three}} <b>short-term</b> treatments: Breathing <b>Retraining</b> and Cognitive Restructuring, graded Self-Exposure in vivo, {{or a combination of}} both. No differential effects were found between the treatment conditions at posttest and at an 18 months follow-up. Improvement at follow-up assessment was associated with whether patients had further treatment during the follow-up period. No relationship was found between further improvment and demographic variables, pre- and posttest scores on psychological questionnaires or the use of medication at follow-up. Implications of these findings are examined...|$|R
