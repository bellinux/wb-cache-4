The {{vast majority of}} such systems cannot sup- port multiple restart cycles, thus limiting the applicability of hybrid rockets–especially for in-space propulsion. During research investigating its use as a fuel for hybrid rockets, {{it was discovered that}} Acrylonitrile <b>Butadiene</b> <b>Styrene</b> (ABS) <b>plastic</b> possesses unique electrical breakdown characteristics. During a properly designed breakdown event, application of a strong electric field induces a high-temperature arc along the surface of the ABS, concurrent with rapid production of hydrocarbon vapor. This behavior forms the basis of a novel ABS arc ignition system. Several such systems were designed, built and tested. Minimum con- ditions for successful operation were discovered, including minimum ignition pressure and electrical power requirements. Hands-off restart capability was demonstrated repeatedly.

The cost of plated ABS plastic substrate is substantially less (Rs. 4 /-sq. inch) compared to the cost of RT-Duroid (US $ 02 /-/-sq. inch). Two microstrip (hairpin line) band pass filters at 1537. 5 MHZ and 1575. 42 MHz have been developed and tested. The performance of filters have been verified over temperature range,- 10 deg. C to 60 deg. C. The ABS plastic blocks have been used in place of metal blocks of brass, copper and Commercial Aluminium to fabricate three dimensional microwave cavity filters for communication systems. The specific gravity of ABS plastic is 1. 03 gms/cubic cm compare to 2. 7, 6. 3 and 9. 6 gms/cubic cm of Com. Al, Copper and Brass respectively.

Three-dimensional (3 D) phantoms were built with acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> (ABS) <b>plastic</b> using an accurate 3 D imaging and an emergent 3 D printing technique. In this study, our method was utilized for the correction of optical properties (absorption coefficient μa and reduced scattering coefficient μs′) of objects obtained with a spatial frequency domain imaging system. The correction method was verified on three objects with simple to complex shapes. Incorrect optical properties due to surface with minimum 4 mm variation in height and 80 degree in slope were detected and improved, particularly for the absorption coefficients.

40|$|A key {{component}} of a safety helmet is the foam liner, which absorbs the greatest portion of impact energy during an accident. The aim {{of the present study}} is twofold: to design a motorcycle helmet equipped with an innovative liner optimized with regard to energy absorption and to do so by coupling engineering expertise with design of experiments and response surface modelling. The new liner consists of an acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> lamina shaped into deformable cones. Energy is absorbed via a combination of folding and collapsing of the cones. The main advantage that such a liner may introduce over common expanded polystyrene pads are that it allows a better optimization of energy absorption for different impact sites and configurations. Design of experiments was used to identify the most relevant parameters in the definition of the mechanical behaviour of the cones. Design of experiments and response surface modelling were then used to design a helmet with optimized performance. Finally, the performance of the newly designed helmet was compared with that of its existing commercial counterpart.

3000|$|... 3 D {{printing}} {{technologies have}} developed and {{advanced to the}} point where 3 D CAD models can be effectively printed (Breen et al. [2003]; and Simondetti [2002]). These modeling techniques are defined to be “the process of joining materials to make objects from 3 D model data, usually layer upon layer” (Buswell et al. [2007]; and Lim et al. [2012]). Having the ability to create physical models through a printing process presents an opportunity to support traditional information delivery with an accurate, scaled representation of a three dimensional space. There are many models of 3 D printers with similar technologies. The printers work by essentially building up an object with individual thin layers of a material, such as plastics or starch. ABS (acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene)</b> <b>plastics</b> or PLA (polylactic acid) plastics are two of the more common plastic outputs. A 3 D printed model was selected to represent a physical model to test its applicability as a format for information display. Ultimately, the means to achieve the end result of a physical model are not relevant to the outcomes of the study, as the primary objective was to test a physical model as opposed to blueprints or a CAD model.|$|R

50|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), {{also known}} as Creslan 61, is a synthetic, {{semicrystalline}} organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (C3H3N)n. Though it is thermoplastic, it does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above. Almost all polyacrylonitrile resins are copolymers made from mixtures of monomers with acrylonitrile as the main component. It is a versatile polymer used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of high-quality carbon fiber. PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 degrees Celsius to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 degrees Celsius in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found {{in a variety of}} both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets, badminton rackets & high-tech bicycles.

Acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>styrene</b> <b>plastic</b> molds were designed from each imaging modality and three-dimensional printed on a Stratasys FDM 3000. Silastic impression molds were fabricated directly from ovine menisci. These molds were used to generate shaped constructs using 2 % alginate with 2 % CaSO 4. Solid freeform fabrication was conducted on a custom openarchitecture three-dimensional printing platform. Printed samples were made using 2 % alginate with 0. 75 % CaSO 4. Hydrogel constructs were scanned via laser triangulation distance sensor. The point cloud images were analyzed to acquire computational measurements for key points of interest (e. g., height, width, and volume). Silastic molds were within 10 % error with respect to the native tissue for seven key measurements, mCT molds for six of seven, mCT prints for four of seven, MRI molds for five of seven, and MRI prints for four of seven.
