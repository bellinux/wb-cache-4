25|$|Lead-tin solder layers on copper leads {{can form}} copper-tin {{intermetallic}} layers; the solder alloy is then locally depleted of tin {{and form a}} lead-rich layer. The Sn-Cu intermetallics then can get exposed to oxidation, resulting in impaired <b>solderability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Copper plated with {{nickel and}} gold is often used. The thin gold layer {{facilitates}} good <b>solderability</b> of nickel as it protects the nickel from oxidation; the layer {{has to be}} thin enough to rapidly and completely dissolve so bare nickel is exposed to the solder.|$|E
25|$|Copper is an {{excellent}} material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, <b>solderability,</b> workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life. This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage.|$|E
25|$|Storage {{times can}} be tested using {{accelerated}} shelf-life testing, which requires storage without applied voltage at the upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours. This shelf life test is a good indicator for chemical stability and of the oxide layer, because all chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. Nearly all commercial series of non-solid electrolytics fulfill the 1000 hour shelf life test. However, many series are specified only for two years of storage. This also ensures the continuing <b>solderability</b> of the terminals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability of}} non-solid {{aluminum}} electrolytic capacitors {{to have a}} stable behavior during longer storage times can be tested by using an accelerating test of storage the capacitors at its upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours without voltage applied. This [...] "shelf life test" [...] is a good indicator for an inert chemically behavior of the electrolytic system against the dielectric aluminum oxide layer because all chemical reactions are accelerated by high temperatures. Nearly all today's series of capacitors fulfill the 1000 hours shelf life test, which is equivalent to a minimum five years of storage at room temperature. Modern electrolytic capacitors don't need preconditioning after such storage. However, many capacitor series are specified only for two years storage time, but the limit is set by oxidation of terminals and resulting <b>solderability</b> problems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Solderability</b> varies {{depending}} on the type of solder alloy under discussion. The discussion that follows applies only to unspecified electronic solders [...] (which may include solders that contain lead, now banned for use in nearly all electronic equipment made or sold in the EU). <b>Solderability</b> when using lead-free alloys can differ significantly from <b>solderability</b> when using lead based alloys.|$|E
50|$|The <b>solderability</b> of a {{substrate}} is {{a measure}} of the ease with which a soldered joint can be made to that material. Good <b>solderability</b> requires wetting (low contact angle) of the substrate by the solder.|$|E

5000|$|Hook-up wire is small-to-medium gauge, solid or stranded, {{insulated}} wire, {{used for}} making internal connections inside electrical or electronic devices. It is often tin-plated to improve <b>solderability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Organic <b>solderability</b> {{preservative}} or OSP is {{a method}} for coating of printed circuit boards. It uses a water-based organic compound that selectively bonds to copper and protects the copper until soldering.|$|E
50|$|Both {{quantitative}} and qualitative tests for <b>solderability</b> exist.The two most common testing methods are the 'dip and look' method and wetting balance analysis. In both of these tests, the soldered pieces undergo an accelerated aging process before being tested for <b>solderability,</b> {{to take into consideration}} the time a component was in storage prior to mounting to final assembly. The dip and look method is a qualitative test. One form of it is specified as Mil-Std-883 Method 2003. On the other hand, the wetting balance analysis is a quantitative test that measures the wetting forces between molten solder and the test surface as a function of time.|$|E
5000|$|Tin is also {{widely used}} in the {{electronics}} industry because {{of its ability to}} protect the base metal from oxidation thus preserving its <b>solderability.</b> In electronic applications, 3% to 7% lead may be added to improve <b>solderability</b> and to prevent the growth of metallic [...] "whiskers" [...] in compression stressed deposits, which would otherwise cause electrical shorting. However, RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulations enacted beginning in 2006 require that no lead be added intentionally and that the maximum percentage not exceed 1%. Some exemptions have been issued to RoHS requirements in critical electronics applications due to failures which are known to have occurred as a result of tin whisker formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{result was}} an {{accelerated}} commercialization of five inventions: Sequential Electrochemical Reduction Analysis (SERA) by Dr. Morgan Tench enabled manufacturers to improve yield by precisely measuring the <b>solderability</b> of parts before beginning assembly. Reduced Oxide Soldering Activation (ROSA) by Dr. Morgan Tench enabled manufacturers to reduce scrap and materials by restoring <b>solderability</b> {{to the entire}} lot of components before assembly without using flux; Plasma Assisted Dry Soldering (PADS) by Dr. Stephan Bobbio reduced the cost of materials and handling by enabling components to be soldered without flux. A national Laminography Standard by Dr. Thomas Siewert enabled X-Ray laminography inspection machines to be more accurately calibrated. And, Composite Solders by George Lucey and Dr. Roger Clough offered manufacturers the opportunity to reduce inspection and rework by increasing {{the strength of the}} joint.|$|E
50|$|Although certain {{technical}} barriers must be overcome, {{the use of}} medium phosphorus electroless nickel beneath immersion gold on circuit boards, shows promise. Commonly {{referred to as the}} ENIG (Electroless nickel immersion gold) process, it offers improved shelf life in humid conditions and maintains excellent <b>solderability</b> over periods of long storage.|$|E
50|$|Heat sinks, {{semiconductor}} packages, {{and battery}} components {{are examples of}} other high volume electroless nickel electronic applications (Figure 18). A variety of aluminium and zinc die cast connectors are plated with EN to enhance corrosion and wear resistance (Figure 19). Uniformity, electrical conductivity and <b>solderability</b> are other important properties for this application.|$|E

50|$|With the {{availability}} of stable and reproducible dispersions, PEDOT and polyaniline have gained some large scale applications. While PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) is mainly used in antistatic applications and as a transparent conductive layer in form of PEDOT:PSS dispersions (PSS=polystyrene sulfonic acid), polyaniline is widely used for printed circuit board manufacturing - in the final finish, for protecting copper from corrosion and preventing its <b>solderability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Metal pipes are {{generally}} made by first casting the desired lead alloy onto a long flat surface. Once the metal cools, it is cut into pieces, {{which are then}} rolled into shapes around molds called mandrels and soldered together. Thus, the cross-section of a metal pipe is usually circular. The low melting point, <b>solderability</b> and malleability of the organ metal makes the construction of pipes relatively easy.|$|E

With in-house surface finishing of Organic <b>Solderability</b> Preservative (OSP), Lead-Free Hot Air Solder Leveling (HASL), Immersion Gold / Silver / Tin. It manufactures for over 400 customers worldwide. Ellington's world ranking jumped from 88th in 2005 to 33rd in 2012. The company is growing rapidly with CAGR of 28.5% in 5 years.|$|E
5000|$|Cadmium plating (or [...] "cad plating") {{offers a}} long list of {{technical}} advantages such as excellent corrosion resistance even at relatively low thickness and in salt atmospheres, softness and malleability, freedom from sticky and/or bulky corrosion products, galvanic compatibility with aluminum, freedom from stick-slip thus allowing reliable torquing of plated threads, can be dyed to many colors and clear, has good lubricity and <b>solderability,</b> and works well either as a final finish or as a paint base.|$|E
50|$|The {{electroless}} nickel step is an auto-catalytic process that involves depositing nickel on the palladium-catalyzed copper surface. The reducing agent containing nickel ions must be replenished {{in order to}} provide proper concentration, temperature and pH levels necessary to create a consistent coating. During the immersion gold step, the gold adheres to the nickel-plated areas through molecular exchange, which will protect the nickel until the soldering process. The gold thickness needs to meet certain tolerances to ensure that the nickel maintains its <b>solderability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Surface {{finishing}} is a {{broad range}} of industrial processes that alter the surface of a manufactured item to achieve a certain property. Finishing processes may be employed to: improve appearance, adhesion or wettability, <b>solderability,</b> corrosion resistance, tarnish resistance, chemical resistance, wear resistance, hardness, modify electrical conductivity, remove burrs and other surface flaws, and control the surface friction. In limited cases some of these techniques can be used to restore original dimensions to salvage or repair an item. An unfinished surface is often called mill finish.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{electrically}} heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside {{the tip of}} the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.Oleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve <b>solderability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plating is {{a surface}} {{covering}} {{in which a}} metal is deposited on a conductive surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years; it is also critical for modern technology. Plating is used to decorate objects, for corrosion inhibition, to improve <b>solderability,</b> to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to improve paint adhesion, to alter conductivity, to improve IR reflectivity, for radiation shielding, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Thin-film deposition has plated objects as small as an atom, therefore plating finds uses in nanotechnology.|$|E
50|$|Smith & Associates {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{independent}} distributors to build an in-house, sophisticated, electronic component testing laboratory. The company uses their in-house lab resources to confirm product quality, origin, and conformity. Smith places emphasis on continuously upgrading equipment and expanding capabilities to reflect current developments in quality testing and anti-counterfeiting. The company’s testing resources include decapsulation, chemical testing, x-ray testing, x-ray fluorescence, microscopic inspection, <b>solderability</b> testing, counterfeit IC testing, C-SAM acoustic microscopic inspection, and functionality testing for a range of components. The company’s anti-counterfeit laboratory, located at its Houston headquarters, is accredited under ISO/IEC 17025, as is its Hong Kong laboratory.|$|E
5000|$|Use of {{electroless}} nickel for electronic applications {{continues to grow}} and is clearly the most diverse market segment. Magnetic properties, corrosion resistance and <b>solderability</b> are properties that have contributed the most to its success. A large application {{involves the use of}} high phosphorus deposits on polished aluminium substrates for magnetic data storage on computers. Uniformity, non-magnetic character and reliably smooth, defect free nature lend to its continued use. Over the past 20 years this application for EN has been threatened a number of times by emerging technology. In each case, EN has proven up to the challenge and maintained its position as the most reliable and cost effective technology. (Figure 17) ...|$|E
50|$|Copper is an {{excellent}} material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, <b>solderability,</b> workability, high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life (see: copper flashing). This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage. Cold rolled (to 1/8-hard temper) copper is recommended for most flashing applications. This material offers more resistance than soft copper to the stresses of expansion and contraction. Soft copper can be specified where extreme forming is required, such as in complicated roof shapes. Thermal movement in flashings is prevented or is permitted only at predetermined locations.|$|E
50|$|Noble metals may be easy {{to solder}} but they have brittle joints. The metals in the good {{category}} require {{a large amount of}} heat therefore oxidation is an issue. To overcome this a flux is required. For carbon steel, low alloy steel, zinc, and nickel the presence of sulfur creates a brittle joint; lower temperatures are used to minimize this problem. The oxides on the surface of aluminium cause wetting issues and special solders must be used to prevent galvanic corrosion issues. Stainless steel and high alloy steel have a low <b>solderability</b> because the chromium alloying element creates oxides that require aggressive fluxes. The only way that the final category of metals can be soldered is by pre-plating them in a metal that is solderable.|$|E
5000|$|A 2-3 µm {{layer of}} gold dissolves {{completely}} within one second during typical wave soldering conditions. [...] Layers of gold thinner than 0.5 µm (0.02 thou) also dissolve completely into the solder, exposing the underlying metal (usually nickel) to the solder. Impurities in the nickel layer can prevent the solder from bonding to it. Electroless nickel plating contains phosphorus. Nickel {{with more than}} 8% phosphorus is not solderable [...] Electrodeposited nickel may contain nickel hydroxide. An acid bath is required to remove the passivation layer before applying the gold layer; improper cleaning leads to a nickel surface difficult to solder. A stronger flux can help, as it aids dissolving the oxide deposits. Carbon is another nickel contaminant that hinders <b>solderability.</b>|$|E
