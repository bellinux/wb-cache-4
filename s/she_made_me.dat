500|$|Peggy {{has been}} spoofed in several programmes, {{including}} the ITV cartoon sketch show 2DTV, and Harry Hill's TV Burp. In the BBC's Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona performs as Peggy, shuffling around {{on her knees}} to exaggerate Barbara Windsor's petite height, and regularly using the catchphrase [...] "Get outta my pub!" [...] Impressionist Jan Ravens has spoofed her in the BBC's Dead Ringers, also mimicking her cheeky laugh. Commenting on Ancona's impersonation, Windsor has said: [...] "she does me brilliantly. I {{told her it was}} a great compliment. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> realise my little hands wave around a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
500|$|A scene {{featuring}} Peter, Cleveland, Mort and Quagmire {{drinking coffee}} in the booth, waiting {{for one of them}} to act irrationally due to Joe adding a substance into their drink, was cut from the broadcast for timing purposes. A deleted scene had been made for the episode, which showed one of the characters present in the booth after Joe added a substance into their drink, turning into a lizard-like creature from Jurassic Park, but the gag was never used. When Brian is explaining the situation with Meg to Lois in the uncensored version he says [...] "this morning <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> eat the hair in her pie" [...] Broadcast standards objected to this and it was changed for air to [...] "hair pie". On the DVD commentary MacFarlane remarked he thought the latter sounded more offensive. American actor and comedian Garrett Morris guest-starred on the episode, portraying the headmaster of the [...] "New York School for the Hard-of-Hearing", which was once a regular Weekend Update piece on the 1970s episodes of Saturday Night Live. When Peter and everybody else discover Meg attempting to seduce Brian in the hotel, Peter uses the term [...] "Chinaman"; this was changed for the television broadcast to [...] "oriental guy", as [...] "Chinaman" [...] is deemed to be an offensive word.|$|E

2500|$|In Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid (2013), Giovanni {{describes}} {{falling off}} of a bike and her mother saying, [...] "Come here, Nikki and I will pick you up." [...] She has explained that it was comforting to hear her mother say this, and that [...] "it took me the longest to realize – no, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> get up myself." [...] Chasing Utopia continues as a hybrid (poetry and prose) work about food as a metaphor and as {{a connection to the}} memory of her mother, sister, and grandmother. The theme of the work is love relationships.|$|E
2500|$|By New Year 1924, Bow {{defied the}} possessive Maxine Alton {{and brought her}} father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: [...] "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself {{into his arms and}} kissed and kissed him, and we both cried like a couple of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." [...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting [...] "his big star" [...] into a scandal. When Bow found out, [...] "She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." [...] Jacobson concluded, [...] " [...] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong." [...] On September 7, 1924, The Los Angeles Times, in a significant article [...] "A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, but oh, how she can act!", her father is titled [...] "business manager" [...] and Jacobson referred to as her brother.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't talk to me--don't speak! She {{knew from}} every {{syllable}} I uttered that I perfectly loathed it, and I {{know that she}} {{tried to make it}} as hateful to me all the way through as she could. She played it at me, and she knew it was me. It was as if she kept saying all the time, 'How do you like my translation of your Boston girl into Alabama, or Mississippi, or Arkansas, or wherever I came from? This is the way you would have acted, if you were me!' Yes, that is the hideous part of it. Her nature has come off on the character, and I shall never see, or hear, or think, or dream Salome, after this, without having Yolande Havisham before me. She's spoiled the sweetest thing in my life. <b>She's</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> hate myself; <b>she's</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> hate you! Will you go out somewhere and get your lunch? I don't want anything myself, and just now I can't bear to look at you. Oh, you're not to blame, that I know of, if that's what you mean. Only go!" ...|$|R
60|$|O Alison Gross, {{that lives}} in yon tow'r, The ugliest witch in the north countrie, She trysted me ae day up till her bow'r, And mony fair speeches <b>she</b> <b>made</b> to <b>me.</b>|$|R

60|$|CHARTERIS. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>me.</b> Why, I had to {{guarantee}} Cuthbertson as unmanly; and he's the leading representative of manly sentiment in London.|$|E
60|$|With those words, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a low curtsey, {{and laid}} a small {{photographic}} portrait {{on the desk}} at which I was sitting.|$|E
6000|$|Therewith <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> {{much good}} cheer; then, very tenderly taking her arms from about me, lest I should be hurt again, she cried-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Except myself," [...] {{retorted}} Soames, [...] "who am {{also in a}} damnable position. Hers is what <b>she</b> <b>made</b> for herself; mine what <b>she</b> <b>made</b> for <b>me.</b> I am not at {{all sure}} that in her own interests I shan't require her to return to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel {{almost as}} anxious and as {{uncertain}} about Miss Halcombe {{as she felt}} herself. I presumed {{to ask her to}} write me a line, if all went well in London. She answered, [...] "Most willingly, Mrs. Michelson." ...|$|R

60|$|And for {{all that}} evening I wooed her and kept her glad. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "But she {{has never}} made me cry," [...] Ah Kim disclaimed hastily. [...] "Never, from the time I was a little boy, has <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>me</b> cry." ...|$|E
60|$|But what <b>she</b> said <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel creepy like, for us Cornishmen goes a {{good deal}} on dreams and tokens; and sure enough mother had dreamed father {{was going to be}} drowned before he started on that last trip of his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, papa! papa!" [...] I cried. [...] "Don't part me from Mary! See {{how pretty}} and good she is! <b>She</b> has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> a flag for my boat. Let me {{come here and}} see her sometimes. I can't live without her." ...|$|R
30|$|Hannah: I {{would never}} have just worn a dress without a jacket before she came on to the scene. She always looks put-together, and I never thought that I could do that. <b>She</b> just <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel much more {{comfortable}} about it.|$|R

60|$|Looking back, I can see that, {{though the}} {{determining}} cause was Mr Tankerville Gifford, it was Audrey who was responsible. <b>She</b> had <b>made</b> <b>me</b> human, capable of sympathy, {{and it was}} sympathy, primarily, that led me to say what I said that night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, Rose, never," [...] {{answered}} Eveline; [...] "you know not--you cannot fuess what <b>she</b> has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suffer--exposing me to witchcraft and fiends.

2500|$|In {{contrary}} {{with what}} Sunni says, in Shia literature, {{there are some}} speeches from Ali that deny any problem with his spouse.
