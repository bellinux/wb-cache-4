50|$|When {{the boat}} {{approaches}} the landing, the bowhook {{should be ready}} to spring ashore with the painter (length of line secured to the bow of the boat for towing or making fast) and take a turn on the nearest cleat. When the boat approaches a ship"s side, the bowhook should be in the bow with the boathook, ready to <b>snag</b> the <b>boat</b> line and make it fast. The bowhook should always have a fender ready to drop over the side if a bump is unavoidable.|$|R
50|$|According to the government, {{the boat}} capsized after hitting a rock. The boat was badly {{overloaded}} according to police, and many passengers {{were unable to}} swim. Police initially attributed {{the cause of the}} capsize to rough weather, although the government also said that low water levels on the river due to the dry season may have been the cause, leading to a higher chance of <b>boats</b> <b>snagging</b> or hitting submerged sandbanks.|$|R

25|$|The back bay, roughly {{anything}} {{south of}} the Morro Bay State Park Marina, is very shallow. However, there is some slightly deeper water in the channels. The largest channel continues from the bay's main channel, winding its way towards Los Osos, on {{the southern end of}} the bay. The second largest breaks off from the largest about halfway to Los Osos and takes an extremely windy route to the sandspit. A few small channels on the landward side formed by runoff meet the largest channel as well. The narrow, unmarked channels are very hard to navigate and are filled with eel grass, which can <b>snag</b> the <b>boat</b> or clog the propeller. They are easiest to find at low tide, but if the tide is too low, the boat may run aground because the channels are only a few feet deeper than the surrounding water. An alternative to searching for the channels is to cross at very high tide.|$|R
50|$|Mariners are {{strongly}} urged to seek local advice prior to {{making use of}} the channel, especially when whitecaps or wind-blown water is evident or a small craft advisory is in effect, which is very often. The United States Coast Guard regards the harbor {{as one of the}} most dangerous in the entire nation, while others put it in the top six on the West Coast of the United States. In 1995, the Army Corps of Engineering deepened and expanded the channel to improve safety. From 1979 to 1987, 21 lives were lost in boating accidents alone. However, many additional deaths have resulted from sightseers and fisherman being swept off the rocks of the breakwater surrounding Morro Rock. They often approach too closely to the waves and are caught off guard when a big wave set comes in. The slippery and jagged rocks only add to the danger. Public access to the breakwater has been revoked and those who venture beyond the signs do so at their own peril.Coast Guard Station Morro Bay operates two small vessels. Limited transient vessel services are available. Yachtsmen may wish to contact the Morro Bay Yacht Club. A public boat launch ramp is available at the far south end of the Embarcadero.The back bay, roughly anything south of the Morro Bay State Park Marina, is very shallow.

40|$|In recent years, public {{awareness}} of aquatic invasive species (AIS) has increased considerably in Oregon {{and elsewhere in the}} western U. S [...] News articles, boat inspection stations and AIS permit programs have drawn attention to the threat of aquatic invasive species, especially animals like zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). However, invasive aquatic plants are also capable of causing severe impacts and may similarly be transferred between waterbodies on boats, trailers or other equipment. Heavy infestations can hinder recreational use by motorized and non-motorized <b>boats,</b> <b>snag</b> fishing lines, threaten the safety of swimmers and water-skiers, restrict delivery of irrigation water or quality of drinking water, and negatively impact aquatic habitats used by wildlife. One such plant, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), is wide-spread in much of the United States, but has only recently been found in four waterbodies in central Oregon’s Deschutes and Jefferson counties. This plant and many other macrophytes are capable of surviving when fragments or seed are carried to new waterbodies by natural or human-mediated means. While certain natural vectors like water currents and birds cannot be controlled, a containment strategy aimed at reducing secondary spread of EWM to new waterways via boat traffic would benefit aquatic resources in the region. Towards that goal, we examined boat launches at known infested waterbodies to determine: the extent of Eurasian watermilfoil, whether physical control techniques would reduce boaters’ direct encounters with this weed, and general awareness of AIS and support for local control of EWM by lake users...|$|R

5000|$|The upper Columbia was {{choked with}} snags, which were sunken logs jammed {{in the river}} bottom and {{sticking}} into the river. These could be significant barriers to navigation, {{as shown by the}} 23 days it took Clive to travel the 100 mi up to Windermere Lake. A significant reason for this delay were the numerous snags in the river. Snag removal was done by a specialized vessel called a [...] "snag boat" [...] which was equipped with a large hoist and powerful winches to pull the snags out of the river. ( [...] Samson V and W.T. Preston, at Anacortes, Washington, are two excellent existing examples of Pacific Northwest sternwheel snagboats.) In 1892, the Dominion government put a <b>snag</b> <b>boat,</b> the Muskrat o the upper river, which must have significantly improved river transportation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{low water}} levels of 1908 {{inspired}} {{a proposal to}} preserve the Indian Head Rock by removing it from the river and displaying it in a popular riverfront park in Portsmouth. The proposal was by Henry A. Lorberg (1856-1943), a well-known Portsmouth historian and benefactor of the time. [...] "Henry Lorberg is going {{to communicate with the}} light house department with a view to having the <b>snag</b> <b>boat</b> Woodruff pull up the Indian rock, the idea of Mr. Lorberg being to have the city place the historic bowlder sic in York park, in a position overlooking the river, with an iron railing around it and a history of the rock, as far as obtainable, engraved or painted on the face. The wonder is the government hasn't pulled the rock out of its place long ago and crushed it with dynamite, as it is an undoubted menace to navigation of the river between five and fifteen feet. The bottom of many a boat and barge was torn out by it in the old days when steamboats were plentiful...Portsmouth is the River City and to preserve the rock in the manner referred to would be highly appropriate." [...] This story credited the carving of the face on the rock to a Portsmouth resident in the 1830s. [...] "The man or boy, who did the carving is reputed to have been John Book, an older half-brother of W. T. Book, of East Eighth street. Book was a very adventurous boy and grew {{to be one of the}} best known citizens of the county and state was a captain in the civil war and killed in battle. He carved the face some time in the thirties." [...] Clearly, Lorberg's proposal was not acted upon.|$|E
