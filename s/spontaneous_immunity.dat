40|$|In {{recent years}} we {{and others have}} used the ELISPOT assay {{successfully}} to identify novel tumor antigens by the characterization of spontaneous HLA class I restricted immune responses against a number of minimal 9 – 10 amino acid long peptide epitopes. In the present study, we examined the capability of using longer peptides when scrutinizing Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PMBC) from melanoma patients for <b>spontaneous</b> <b>immunity</b> by means of ELISPOT IFN-γ secretion assay. To this end, we examined PBMC {{for the presence of}} specific T-cell responses against long peptides derived from the tumor associated antigen BCL-X(L). The protein product of the larger BCL-X(L) differs from Bcl-X(S) protein by an inserted region (amino acids 126 – 188). Thus, we scrutinized eight long peptides covering this inserted region for <b>spontaneous</b> <b>immunity.</b> The peptides were overlapping and consisted of 20 – 23 amino acids. PBMC were pre-stimulated with peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DC) and subjected to the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Four of the BCL-X(L) derived peptides elicited very frequent responses in several patients. Additionally, in all patients responses against more than one of the peptides could be detected. In conclusion several long BCL-X(L) derived peptide epitopes exist, which may be used in anti-cancer immunity. Furthermore, the ELISPOT assay offers an attractive and sensitive method for the characterization of spontaneous immune reactivity against long peptides...|$|E

In contrast to peptide stimulation, induction of specific Th 1 cells with S typhimurium– NY-ESO- 1 did not require in vitro deple-tion of CD 4 CD 25 Treg cells, and this prevailing effect was partially blocked by disruption of interleukin- 6 or glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR) signals. Fur-thermore, S typhimurium–induced Th 1 cells had higher GITR expression than peptide-induced Th 1 cells and were resistant to suppression by CD 4 CD 25 Treg cells in a GITR-dependent fashion.

However, these patients lack anti-SOX 2 immunity. Cellular immunity to SOX 2 inhibits the clonogenic growth of MGUS cells in vitro.

Clinical success to date has been limited by a number of factors including choice of immunogenic cancer rejection antigens, optimization of vaccine platforms and immune adjuvants to effectively polarize the immune response, and incorporation of strategies to reverse cancer mediated immune suppression by utilization of effective adjuvant/immune modulators.

In multiple myeloma, the cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) CT 7 (MAGE-C 1), CT 10 (MAGE-C 2) and MAGE-A CTAs are expressed in up to 80 % of cases. In this study, we investigated the expression and immunogenicity of several CTAs in patients with AL amyloidosis {{in a total of}} 38 bone marrow specimens by employing standard immunohistochemistry techniques on paraffin-embedded archival tissues. Plasma samples from 35 patients (27 with matched bone marrow samples) were also analyzed by ELISA for sero reactivity to a group of full-length CTA proteins. CT 7 was present in 25 / 38 (66 %) while CT 10 was demonstrated in 3 / 38 and GAGE in 1 / 38 AL amyloid cases. The expression pattern was mostly focal. There were no significant differences with regard to organ involvement, response to treatment, or prognosis in CTA positive compared to negative cases.

40|$|The MAGE cancer-testis antigens (CTA) are {{attractive}} candidates for immunotherapy. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the frequency of expression, humoral immunity and prognostic significance of MAGE CTA in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). mRNA or protein expression frequencies were determined for MAGE-A 1, -A 3, -A 4, -A 10 and -C 1 (CT 7) in tissue samples obtained from 400 patients with EOC. The presence of autologous antibodies against the MAGE antigens was determined from 285 serum samples. The relationships between MAGE expression, humoral immunity to MAGE antigens, and clinico-pathologic characteristics were studied. The individual frequencies of expression were as follows: A 1 : 15 % (42 / 281), A 3 : 36 % (131 / 390), A 4 : 47 % (186 / 399), A 10 : 52 % (204 / 395), C 1 : 16 % (42 / 267). Strong concordant expression was noted with MAGE-A 1 :-A 4, MAGE-A 1 :-C 1 and MAGE-A 4 :-A 10 (p< 0. 0005). Expression of MAGE-A 1 or -A 10 antigens resulted in poor progression free survival (PFS) (OR 1. 44, CI 1. 01 - 2. 04, p = 0. 044 and OR 1. 3, CI 1. 03 - 1. 64, p = 0. 03, respectively); whereas, MAGE-C 1 expression was associated with improved PFS (OR 0. 62, CI 0. 42 - 0. 92, p = 0. 016). The improved PFS observed for MAGE-C 1 expression, was diminished by co-expression of MAGE-A 1 or -A 10. <b>Spontaneous</b> humoral <b>immunity</b> to the MAGE antigens was present in 9 % (27 / 285) of patients, and this predicted poor overall survival (log-rank test p = 0. 0137).

Improved understanding {{of the significance of}} ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess <b>spontaneous</b> <b>immunity</b> to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I–IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A* 0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD 4 + and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA- 4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target...|$|E
40|$|Disabling the {{function}} of immune checkpoint molecules can unlock T cell immunity against cancer, yet despite remarkable clinical success with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block PD- 1 or CTLA- 4 resistance remains common and essentially unexplained. Certain tumors, especially pancreatic carcinoma, are fully refractory to these antibodies. As reported in this thesis, I used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic carcinoma in which <b>spontaneous</b> <b>immunity</b> is minimal, and found that PD-L 1 is prominent in the tumor microenvironment, a phenotype confirmed in patients. Tumor infiltrating T cells express PD- 1 even more prominently than T cells in a classical model of chronic infection, in which anti-PD- 1 mAb mediates clinical benefit. Despite this striking expression of PD- 1 and PD-L 1 in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, treatment with anti-PD- 1 mAb, with or without anti-CTLA- 4 mAb, fails in well-established tumors, recapitulating clinical results. Agonist anti-CD 40 mAb with chemotherapy, deployed as a vaccine, induces T cell immunity and reverses the complete resistance of pancreatic tumors to anti-PD- 1 and anti-CTLA- 4. The combination of anti-CD 40 /chemotherapy plus anti-PD- 1 and/or anti-CTLA- 4 induces regression of subcutaneous tumors, improves overall survival, and confers curative protection from multiple rechallenges, consistent with immune memory not otherwise achievable. Combinatorial treatment nearly doubles survival of mice with spontaneous pancreatic cancers, revealing a clinical opportunity. These findings suggest that in non immunogenic tumors, epitomized by pancreatic carcinoma, baseline refractoriness to checkpoint inhibitors may be rescued by the priming of a T cell response with an antitumor vaccine. These studies indicate that understanding the immunobiology of differing tumor types may improve the ability to rationally design combinatorial immunotherapies in oncology...|$|E

Multiple NY-ESO- 1 antigen-specific CD 4 þ T-cell responses with TH 1 dominance were induced or enhanced after ipilimumab treatment in peripheral blood in all four patients. NY-ESO- 1 antigen– specific CD 4 þ T-cell lines established from all four patients after ipilimumab treatment recognized naturally processed NY-ESO- 1 protein in antigen-presenting cells, expressed master transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes), and secreted perforin and Granzyme B.

Spontaneous humoral and cellular immune responses against NY-ESO- 1 are detected in a substantial proportion of patients with NY-ESO- 1 positive cancers. NY-ESO- 1 serum antibody is dependent on the presence of NY-ESO- 1 + cancer cells, and antibody titers correlate with the clinical development of the disease. NY-ESO- 1 serum antibody is associated with detectable NY-ESO- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cell reactivity. High titers of NY-ESO- 1 serum antibodies are found in patients with advanced NY-ESO- 1 + malignancies. Urine samples of seropositive patients with normal kidney function were tested for NY-ESO- 1 antibody by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Spontaneous CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses were found in patients with detectable NY-ESO- 1 serum antibody, indicating an integrated type of immune response induced by NY-ESO- 1 + malignancies. A close association between <b>spontaneous</b> NY-ESO- 1 <b>immunity</b> and the HLA-DP 4 allele was suggested in a recent study. To address these results, we assessed the NY-ESO- 1 antibody and HLA-DP 4 status of 102 patients with NY-ESO- 1 + malignancies. However, no correlation between HLA-DP 4 and NY-ESO- 1 immunity was found. To explore the role of HLA-DP 4 -restricted CD 4 + T cells in cancer immunity, we established HLA-DP 4 - restricted NY-ESO- 1 -specific CD 4 + T cell clones by limiting dilution and repeated stimulation with NY-ESO- 1 peptide p 157 - 170 from NY-ESO- 1 seropositive patients. A subset of CD 4 + T cell clones was reactive with naturally processed NY-ESO- 1 presented by autologous DCs that were pulsed with recombinant NY-ESO- 1 protein, lysates of NY-ESO- 1 -expressing tumor cell lines, or transduced with recombinant NY-ESO- 1 viral constructs in ELISPOT assays.

40|$|This thesis {{characterizes the}} extent of {{regulatory}} T cell–mediated immune suppression in breast cancer and explores the possibilities for its potential therapeutic modulation. Based on initial results obtained from a pilot clinical study of adoptive transfer of autologous bone marrow derived T cells in advanced metastatic breast cancer patients, we observed that T-cell unresponsiveness in 53 % of study patients was associated with an existing immune suppression exerted by Treg. Further IFN-γ secretion assays with primary breast cancer samples revealed that T-cell activation, proliferation as well as CTL responses upon tumour antigen stimulation were hampered when Treg were present. Flow cytometric data displayed that in primary breast cancer patients the bone marrow (BM) contained significantly lower frequencies of Treg than the peripheral blood (PB) (p< 0. 001), which may at least partially explain the improved functional potential of BM-derived memory T cells. Different migratory capacities of Treg in the BM and the PB were observed regarding breast cancer profiled chemokine receptors CCR 2, CCR 4 and CCR 5, which might be responsible for this scenario. By removing Treg through CD 25 targeting, the pre-existing T-cell anti-tumour immunity was evoked remarkably in both BM and PB, especially in otherwise less responding PB, as determined by IFN-γ ELISpot assay with polyvalent tumour antigens (MCF 7 and KS 24. 22) {{as well as with}} defined tumour associated antigens (polypeptides). This rescuing effect in the PB provides an opportunity of utilizing PB instead of limited BM as a source for adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy. As a pioneer exploitation, a large-scale Treg-depletion in a leukapheresis sample obtained from a metastatic breast cancer patient was operated with CliniMACS system under clinical-grade conditions (GMP). A sufficient depletion of Treg, a high viability of isolated cells and a satisfying recovery of total cells were documented. To exploit immunotherapy regarding eliminating Treg, an oral metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment (50 mg/day) was performed to selectively deplete Treg in vivo. This pilot clinical trial was applied on 13 advanced metastatic breast cancer patients for 3 months. Clinical responses was observed in 64 % of study patients accompanied by a rapid and effective reduction of Treg on Day 14 (p= 0. 005) and by an augmentation of <b>spontaneous</b> anti-tumour T-cell <b>immunity</b> on Day 70. Last but not least, in this thesis we found that Treg existing in breast cancer patients exhibit breast tumour antigen specificity, which was evidenced indirectly and directly. MCF 7 - or KS 24. 22 -specific IFN-γ secretion was abrogated when Treg were added back in ELISpot assay. The production of immunosuppressive cytokine IL- 10 was increased only when Treg encountered breast tumour antigens measured by ELISA and intracellular staining experiments. By applying a novelly designed Treg Specificity Assay, we detected a broad spectrum of tumour antigens recognized by Treg in at least 47 % of tested breast cancer patients with Mammaglobin A as the most frequent one (85 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Structural and {{pharmacological}} interventions (for example, needle syringe {{programs and}} opioid substitution therapy) are partially effective for preventing hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{in people who}} inject drugs (PWID) but additional strategies are required. Individual behavioural interventions (counselling and education) are common, but {{little is known about}} their effectiveness. Prophylactic vaccines are the gold standard for infectious disease prevention, but there is no HCV vaccine. Research on correlates of successful naturally acquired immune responses to HCV can help to inform HCV vaccine development. Interventions that take the injecting social network structure into account are an area of ongoing research. Aims: The broad aim of this research was to inform HCV prevention efforts in PWID, including vaccine development and other prevention strategies. Specific aims included synthesis of evidence on individual behavioural interventions to prevent HCV transmission; assessing whether the injecting-social network is important for HCV transmission in order to understand whether it should be a target of HCV prevention programs; and understanding the epidemiology and biological markers of HCV reinfection and spontaneous clearance of reinfection in order to inform vaccine development. Methods: Research involved a systematic review (Chapter Two), analysis of data from the Networks 2 study (a cohort study of HCV in PWID in Melbourne, Chapters Three, Four, and Six), data from the InC 3 study (pooled data from nine cohort studies of incidence HCV and HIV internationally, Chapter Five), and simulated data (Chapter Six). Analysis of data from the Networks 2 study combined social network epidemiology, phylogenetics, time-to-event regression, and Bayesian post-estimation. Analysis of simulated data was undertaken using Bayesian post-estimation. Analysis of data from the InC 3 study involved mainly time-to-event regression. Key findings: Few controlled trials have evaluated the effects of individual behavioural interventions on HCV incidence, and those that have done so vary in study design, outcome measures and magnitude, direction and statistical significance of findings between studies. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that behavioural interventions can have a substantial effect on HCV transmission, at least in isolation. HCV phylogeny was associated with the social-injecting network in the Networks 2 study in Melbourne, highlighting the importance of the injecting network in HCV transmission. Collectively the studies presented in Chapters Four–Six suggest that reinfection occurs at least as frequently as primary HCV infection, but in reinfection there is a greater propensity toward spontaneous clearance due to naturally acquired <b>immunity.</b> <b>Spontaneous</b> clearance of reinfection was predicted by female gender and INFL 3 rs 860 -CC genotype, indicating that these factors are associated with ongoing natural immune protection from persistent HCV infection. Conclusion: Prevention of HCV in PWID requires a multifaceted approach. It is unlikely that individual behavioural interventions can substantially reduce HCV transmission. The injecting social network appears to be important for HCV transmission; ongoing research is required to assess its role in HCV prevention. HCV reinfection spontaneously clears more commonly than primary infection, suggesting naturally acquired immunity. Females with INFL 3 rs 860 -CC genotype appear to have ongoing protection from persistent HCV infection. Elucidation of the mechanism behind this may inform vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|Conventional tumor therapy, {{including}} surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, effectively prolongs {{the survival}} time of tumor-bearing patients. However, critical adverse effects frequently occur during conventional tumor therapy, disturbing {{the quality of}} life (QOL) of these patients. Immunotherapy is therefore expected to be an alternative therapy for accelerating antitumor immunity, while inducing less adverse effects. In tumor-bearing animals, the activation of <b>spontaneous</b> cellular <b>immunity</b> to tumorous tissue is relatively limited, and this suppression of immune function is not easily compensated even after the removal of the tumor mass. The induction of both specific and nonspecific immunity, especially T cell function, is imperative for the activation of antitumor immunity, which is suppressed in tumor-bearing animals. Passive immunotherapy by administration of artificially proliferated effector cells that are activated ex vivo is considered to be applicable for these immunosuppressed animals. Activated lymphocyte therapy is a type of passive immunotherapy; it involves sequential administration of autologous lymphocytes stimulated and cultured with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) - 3 antibody and human recombinant (hr) interleukin (IL) - 2. The majority of these cultured cells are speculated to be CD 3 + T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which can induce both specific and nonspecific immunity against the tumor mass. It is essential to determine the optimum conditions for lymphocyte culture and cell administration and to evaluate this method, which is not yet well established. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to establish the methodology for the administration of activated lymphocyte therapy in tumor-bearing dogs and to evaluate this therapy. In the first part of this study, the dynamics of canine CD 56 + cells in peripheral blood collected from healthy beagles were investigated. CD 56 is considered to be one of the markers for NK cells in human beings; thus, canine CD 56 is expected to be a candidate marker for canine NK cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to determine canine CD 56 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in normal tissues, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and stimulated lymphocytes. The highest CD 56 mRNA expression was observed in the brain. The CD 56 mRNAexpression in stimulated lymphocytes was higher than that in PBMCs. To localize CD 56 mRNA, in situ hybridization was performed. The number of CD 56 + cells of stimulated lymphocytes was extremely higher than that of PBMCs. CD 56 mRNAexpression in canine lymphocytes was considerably lower; most lymphocytes were CD 56 -. However, in the lymphocytes activated by stimulated PBMCs, both the CD 56 mRNAexpression and the number of CD 56 + cells increased. In the second part of the study, PBMCs collected from clinically healthy dogs were activated using anti-CD 3 antibody and hr IL- 2 and reactivated using hr interferon (IFN) -α and IL- 2. The properties of the cells thus obtained were analyzed in order to investigate the adaptation of canine activated lymphocyte therapy. In the obtained cells, the proportion of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells was significantly increased; the cytotoxicity of the cultured cells was reinforced; and CD 56 mRNA levels tended to be increased. These cells were confirmed to be activated lymphocytes. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of sequential administration of these cells in healthy dogs. This sequential administration was shown to increase the cell proliferative activity of PBMCs, the proportions of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells, and the serum IFN-γ concentration; no severe adverse effects were observed. We concluded that activated lymphocytes could be administered to healthy dogs, and sequential administration of these cells reinforced the recipient’s immunity. In the third part of the study, autogenous activated lymphocytes, which were activated in the second part of the study, were sequentially administered as an adjuvant antitumor therapy to 10 dogs with spontaneous malignant tumors, in Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Hokkaido University. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from tumor-bearing dogs were proliferated and activated for 14 days in culture. After sequential administration of these activated lymphocytes, the proliferation activities of PBMCs, proportions of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells, and serum IFN-γ concentration increased in some cases. The general conditions of all 10 patients remained stable, and the patients were comfortable during the entire period of lymphocyte administration. The owners of these dogs considered this new concept of antitumor therapy acceptable. This shows that the QOL of these tumor-bearing dogs was maintained in a relatively favorable state, with no evidence of any adverse effects. Activated lymphocyte therapy was therefore thought to be applicable and effective as an adjuvant antitumor therapy; moreover, it maintained the QOL in immunosuppressed tumor-bearing dogs. In conclusion, CD 56 + cells existed in canine peripheral blood, and these cells proliferated during the process of activation to lymphocytes. Expression of canine CD 56 mRNApossibly indicates the activation of lymphocytes. The conditions of activation of lymphocytes were then optimized, using anti-canine CD 3 antibody, hr IL- 2, and hr IFN-α in healthy and tumor-bearing dogs. Sequential administration of these activated lymphocytes was an applicable and effective therapy for tumor-bearing small animals with immunosuppression induced by malignant tumors...|$|R
