5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
25|$|In 11Q13 Melchizedek is {{referred}} to as god the divine judge. Melchizedek in the bible was the king of Salem. At least some in the Qumran community <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that at the end of}} days Melchizedek would reign as their king. The passage is based on Psalm 82.|$|E
25|$|Media {{across the}} nation began speculating whether the vote was not an {{indication}} of dissatisfaction with the PUP administration; most <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it was. Most political analysts credited the UDP with smart selection, timely deduction and ruthless campaigning, whereas the PUP {{did not seem to}} put their all into the campaign, perhaps wiped out from the protests the previous year.|$|E

She was still a member of the Fabian Society; neither she nor anyone else <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the two movements incompatible at the time.|$|E
25|$|After the {{traditional}} three-day wait before {{one can see}} an African big chief, Msiri received them courteously on 17 December 1891. Gifts were presented and negotiations started. Both sides feigned the possibility of future compliance with the other's demands. Msiri wanted gunpowder and removal of Legat, Stairs wanted to fly the Free State flag over Bunkeya. Stairs <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the Le Marinel letter indicated Msiri's acquiescence, but it was vague, and Msiri repudiated any such interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, Philip of Flanders {{arrived in}} Jerusalem on pilgrimage; he was Baldwin IV's cousin, {{and the king}} offered him the regency and command of the army, both of which Philip refused, {{although}} he objected to the appointment of Raynald as regent. Philip then attempted {{to intervene in the}} negotiations for Sibylla's second husband, and suggested one of his own retinue, but the native barons refused his suggestion. In addition, Philip <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he could carve out a territory of his own in Egypt, but he refused to participate with the planned Byzantine-Jerusalem expedition. The expedition was delayed and finally cancelled, and Philip took his army away to the north.|$|E

25|$|At {{that time}} fierce fights were {{underway}} at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent {{against each other}} under claims {{that they were going}} to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that they were loyal to Ceausescu's regime.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{told the}} War Policy Committee (19 June, and {{contrary}} to Robertson's advice of six days earlier) that “Germany was nearer her end than they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> … Germany was within {{six months of the}} total exhaustion of her available manpower, if the fighting continues at its present intensity” and (20 June) he had no “intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses” whilst Robertson wanted to avoid “disproportionate loss” (23 June). At this time Haig was involved in discussions as to whether Robertson should be appointed First Lord of the Admiralty (a ministerial post), and Woodward suggests that he may have felt that Robertson had outlived his usefulness as CIGS. Ministers were not entirely convinced by Jellicoe’s warnings about German submarines and destroyers operating from the Belgian ports, but were influenced by France’s decline (the opposite to Robertson’s original view that this made a major offensive less sensible) and by the apparent success of the Kerensky Offensive. The Flanders Offensive was finally sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2005, Pratchett criticised media {{coverage}} of Harry Potter author J. K.

Pratchett later denied claims that this was a swipe at Rowling, and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism, but was pointing out the [...] "shared heritage" [...] of the fantasy genre. Pratchett also posted on the Harry Potter newsgroup about a media-covered exchange of views with her.|$|E

500|$|It {{had been}} alleged by Canadian {{historian}} Holger Herwig that both in November 1940 and May 1941, leading into and {{through to the}} period in which Japan began planning the naval attack that would bring the United States into the war, that Hitler had stated that he had a desire to [...] "deploy long-range bombers against American cities from the Azores." [...] Due to their location, Hitler <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a Luftwaffe airbase located on the Portuguese Azores islands were Germany's [...] "only possibility of carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States", in a period about a year before the May 1942 emergence of the Amerika Bomber trans-oceanic range strategic bomber design competition.|$|E

Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. [...] "I do regret that {{in a lot of}} ways", Iommi said.

500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation.... Many people <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E

500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reception as well, particularly from gay rights groups. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) was welcoming of the episode, calling it [...] "a ray of light". GLAAD executive director Joan Garry enjoyed seeing Marge's transformation, from having ambivalent feelings for her sister to then supporting her. He commented that [...] "when Marge learns that Patty's about to marry someone who isn't really a lesbian, she comes to realize that what her sister really deserves {{is to be in}} love with and married to a person who's right for her. If millions of Simpsons viewers came away from last night's episode with that little bit of moral truth, it was time well spent." [...] AfterEllen.com's David Kennerley approved of the willingness of a [...] "hit network TV show in prime time, watched by children and adults" [...] to [...] "serve up such a politically charged issue". Rick Garcia, an activist of the gay rights group Equality Illinois, said to the Chicago Tribune that the episode would likely affect society in a positive way because of the iconic status of the show which [...] "shape our attitudes". Unlike many of the conservative groups, Kennerley noted that [...] "in the show's tradition of equal-opportunity lampooning, the message is not all pro-gay. Irksome lesbian stereotypes abound, and Nelson the bully suggests they 'legalize gay funerals.' And naturally, Reverend Lovejoy shutters his church to the same-sex sinners." [...] According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, the episode also had supporters among conservative groups. He told Encore magazine that [...] "gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with the episode, but arch conservatives and right-wing Christians loved the episode, too, because they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we were making fun of gay people. We really had it both ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chang {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} cramps, but managed to take a 5–3 lead in the fifth set with two match points on Lendl's serve.

The crowd started laughing at the bizarre situation and Lendl <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> everyone was mocking him. The tactic worked, as Lendl produced a double-fault to give Chang the victory, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3, 6–3, in 4 hours and 37 minutes.
