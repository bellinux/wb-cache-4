The soldier responsible for his death was U. S. Army cook Pfc. Raymond Norwood Bell of North Carolina, who was overcome by remorse and died of alcoholism in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Extremism within Islam {{goes back}} to the 7th century, to the Khawarijes. From their {{essentially}} political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death. Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij. Sunni critics, including Salafi and jihadist muftis such as Adnan al-Aroor and Abu Basir al-Tartusi, say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> the mainstream of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.|$|E

In the third quarter, Maryland recorded two safeties in quick succession: one when punter Joe Pallotta <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> {{of the end zone}} and the other when Bob Ward tackled Frank Mattingly for a loss. With three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Georgetown scored another touchdown to narrow the deficit to 18–14. Fullerton then rushed for 24 yards to advance to the Georgetown six-yard line. Scarbath then ran into the end zone for the final result of 25–14.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1837, in Boston's Faneuil Hall, Phillips' {{leadership}} and oratory established his preeminence within the abolitionist movement. Bostonians gathered at Faneuil Hall to discuss Elijah P. Lovejoy's murder by a mob outside his abolitionist printing press in Alton, Illinois on November 7. Lovejoy died defending {{himself and his}} press from pro-slavery rioters who set fire to a warehouse storing his press and shot Lovejoy as he <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> to tip a ladder {{being used by the}} mob. His death engendered a national controversy between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists. At Faneuil Hall, Massachusetts attorney general James T. Austin defended the anti-abolitionist mob, comparing their actions to 1776 patriots who fought against the British. Deeply disgusted, Phillips spontaneously rebutted, praising Lovejoy’s actions as a defense of liberty. Inspired by Phillips’ eloquence and conviction, Garrison entered a partnership with him that came to define the beginning of the 1840s abolitionist movement.|$|E

500|$|Following {{opposition}} to the potential of Edward's marriage to Wallis Simpson from the British government and autonomous Dominions of the British Commonwealth, the fort became the final setting of Edward's abdication as king. He held several meetings with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at the fort during the crisis, and on 10 December 1936 signed his written abdication notices at the fort, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given legislative form by special Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Following his abdication at the fort, Edward described himself as feeling [...] "like a swimmer surfacing from a great depth... I left the room and <b>stepped</b> <b>outside,</b> inhaling the fresh morning air." [...] He retained the visitor's book from the fort, and it would grace all their subsequent homes.|$|E

Inside the station, MalcolmX and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Johnson was not bailed, and police said he could not go back to the hospital until his arraignment the following day. Considering the situation to be at an impasse, MalcolmX <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> the station house and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed. One police officer told the New York Amsterdam News: [...] "No one man should have that much power." [...] Within a month the New York City Police Department arranged to keep MalcolmX under surveillance; it also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time. A grand jury declined to indict the officers who beat Johnson. In October, MalcolmX sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon the police department assigned undercover officers to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.|$|E

500|$|Morgan's {{letter of}} marque gave him {{permission}} to attack Spanish ships at sea; there was no permission for attacks on land. Any plunder obtained from the attacks would be split {{between the government and}} the owners of the ships rented by the privateers. If the privateers <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> their official remit and raided a city, any resultant plunder would be retained by the privateers. Rogoziński observes that [...] "attacks on cities were illegal piracy—but extremely profitable", although Zahedieh records that if Morgan was able to provide evidence of a potential Spanish attack, the attacks on cities were justifiable under the terms of his commission. Morgan's initial plan was to attack Havana, but, on discovering it was heavily defended, this was changed to Puerto Principe (now Camagüey), a town [...] inland. Morgan and his men took the town, but the treasure obtained was less than hoped for. According to Alexandre Exquemelin, who sailed with Morgan, [...] "It caused a general resentment and grief, to see such a small booty". When Morgan reported the taking of Puerto Principe to Modyford, he informed the governor that they had evidence that the Spanish were planning an attack on British territory: [...] "we found seventy men had been pressed to go against Jamaica... and considerable forces were expected from Vera Cruz and Campeachy... and from Porto Bello and Cartagena to rendezvous at St Jago of Cuba [...] ".|$|E

His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He <b>stepped</b> <b>outside</b> of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E
