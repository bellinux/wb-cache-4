50|$|The {{second of}} the C128's two CPUs is the Zilog Z80, which allows the C128 to run CP/M. The C128 was shipped with CP/M 3.0 (a.k.a. CP/M Plus, which is backward-compatible with CP/M 2.2) and ADM31/3A {{terminal}} emulation. A CP/M cartridge had been available for the C64, but it was expensive and of limited use since the 1541 drive cannot read the MFM-formatted disks that CP/M software was distributed on. Software {{had to be made}} available on Commodore-specific disks formatted using the GCR encoding scheme. Commodore made versions of PerfectCalc and the EMACS-derived PerfectWriter available, and Commodore user groups sometimes had a selection of CP/M diskettes, but the limited <b>software</b> <b>availability</b> negated one of CP/M's chief attractions —its huge software library. In addition, the cartridges only work on early-model C64s from 1982 and are incompatible with later units. Since they were also incompatible with the C128, the design team decided to support CP/M by putting the Z80 on the main system board.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Most present {{researches}} {{of software}} quality separate <b>software</b> <b>availability</b> from hardware availability thoroughly. However, <b>software</b> <b>availability</b> {{is defined as}} the probability that software is operating according to requirements at a given point in time. Hardware error, fault or failure surely has negative impact on software operation and decreases <b>software</b> <b>availability.</b> Applications are running on Operation System and/or some platforms, which are called runtime environment. Users tend to consider unrepeatable and unobvious hardware or environmental errors as application errors. Therefore, such factors should be considered in <b>software</b> <b>availability.</b> Abstract machine is a theoretical foundation for software programming. An Abstract Machine with Hardware Reliability (AM-HR) and an Abstract Machine with Environment Reliability (AM-ER) is proposed in this paper. Based on AM-ER, A novel metric named structural availability of software is presented.
