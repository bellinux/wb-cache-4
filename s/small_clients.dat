Simply by tuning parameters, Ring ORAM matches or exceeds {{the performance of the}} best-known <b>small</b> and large <b>client</b> storage schemes and can achieve a constant factor online bandwidth overhead over insecure systems. We evaluate Ring ORAM in theory and in practice. On the theory side, we prove that Ring ORAM matches the asymptotic bandwidth and client storage of Path ORAM, the prior-art scheme for <b>small</b> <b>client</b> storage. Tuning parameters for <b>small</b> <b>client</b> storage, Ring ORAM reduces overall bandwidth relative to Path ORAM by a factor of 2. 7 × and reduces online bandwidth to constant (a 57 × improvement over Path ORAM given realistic parameters). Tuning parameters for large client storage, Ring ORAM outperforms Path ORAM (which is given equal storage) by 4. 5 × and SSS ORAM, the prior-art scheme for large client storage, by 16 - 33 %. Using secure processors as a case study for <b>small</b> <b>client</b> storage, Ring ORAM on average reduces ORAM response time by nearly 5 × and improves workload completion time by 2. 75 ×, relative to Path ORAM. In the large storage setting, running an enterprise file system trace with bursty requests, Ring ORAM adds negli-gible overhead to response time given a> 100 Mbps network bandwidth. By comparison, Burst ORAM incurs large overheads in response time unless network bandwidth> 350 Mbps.

40|$|The {{process of}} selling {{consultancy}} services to large and <b>small</b> <b>clients</b> alike {{is becoming more}} and more difficult. The problem may be seen to be particularly acute when the services on offer have a significant intangible component. This paper discusses strategies devised in response to the difficulties of selling a little known problem-solving method (TRIZ), in the notoriously difficult area of creativity and innovation, with the hope that some of those strategies will have parallel relevance in the selling of other services. Key to the successes now being realised in selling the TRIZ capability are tools to assist in the mapping of perceptions, systematic win-win strategies and, of particular focus through the paper, the phenomenon of ‘plausible deniability’. Plausible deniability is the reason that clients are looking for (either implicitly or explicitly) to justify their decision to not give you the contract. The paper describes systematic strategies aimed at, first, identifying, and then eliminating such reasons...|$|E

40|$|The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) {{is a new}} Internet {{transport}} protocol. It {{is meant}} {{to serve as an}} alternative protocol for applications that require low delays and where a certain degree of data loss is acceptable. TCP is not well-suited for these applications, since its reliable in-order delivery, combined with its congestion control, can cause arbitrarily long delays. UDP avoids long delays, but UDP does not provide congestion control. DCCP provides built-in congestion control for unreliable datagram flows. DCCP supports several different congestion control profiles. One such profile is aimed towards <b>small</b> <b>clients,</b> i. e. devices that have limited memory and/or processing power. An example of such a device is the mobile phone. Modern mobile phones today use the Symbian OS, which is the standard operating system for mobile devices. The goal of this Master Thesis was to implement DCCP with the thin congestion control profile in the Symbian OS. Experiments show that the DCCP implementation adapts well to changes in the network and in the mobile phone, but that the currently available communication technology, GPRS, is too limited to support real-time applications where DCCP could be applicable.

We exogenously administrated one of three different compounds to adults, that is, (a) cortisol, (b) glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone RU 486 or (c) sham (saline), and observed their cleaning behaviour during the following 45. min. The effects of cortisol match an earlier observational study that first described the existence of "cheating" cleaners: such cleaners provide <b>small</b> <b>clients</b> with more tactile stimulation with their pectoral and pelvic fins, a behaviour that attracts larger clients that are then bitten to obtain mucus. Blocking glucocorticoid receptors led to more tactile stimulation to large clients.

40|$|The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 {{requires}} the lead audit or coordinating partner and the reviewing partner to rotate off the audit {{every five years}} so the engagement can be viewed “with fresh and skeptical eyes. ” Using data obtained from actual audits by multiple US. ofices of three large international audit firms, we examine {{whether there is a}} relation-ship between evidence of reduced audit quality, measured by estimated discretionary accruals, and audit partner tenure with a specific client. We find that estimated discretionary accruals are significantly and neg-atively associated with the lead audit partner’s tenure with a specific client. Thus, audit quality appears to increase with increased partner tenure. After controlling for client size and engagement risk, we find audit partner tenure significantly and negatively associated with esti-mated discretionary accruals only for <b>small</b> <b>clients</b> with partner tenure of greater than seven years, regardless of risk level. We also find that tenure is not significantly associated with estimated discretionary accruals for large clients. This suggests that as partner tenure increases, auditors of small client firms become less willing to accept more aggres-sive financial statement assertions by managers, and that partner tenure does not affect audit quality for large clients or for shorter-tenure smaller clients.

40|$|Purpose – There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} on how differences in economic environments affect {{the demand for}} and supply of auditing. Research on audit pricing has mainly focused on large client markets in developed economies; in contrast, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to focus on the small client segment in the emerging economy of Thailand which offers a choice between auditors of two different qualities. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a random stratified sample of <b>small</b> <b>clients</b> in Thailand qualifying for audit exemption. The final sample consists of 1, 950 firm-year observations for 2002 - 2006. Findings – The authors find evidence of product differentiation in the small client market, suggesting that small firms view certified public accountants as superior and pay a premium for their services. The authors also find that audit fees have a positive significant association with leverage, metropolitan location and client size. Audit risk and audit opinion are not, however, significantly associated with audit fees. Furthermore, the authors find no evidence that clients whose financial year ends in the auditors’ busy period pay significantly higher audit fees, and auditors engage in low-balling on initial engagements to attract audit clients. Research limitations/implications – The research shows the importance of exploring actual decisions regarding audit practice and audit pricing in different institutional and organizational settings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process - specifically, the profit status of provider agencies awarded contracts, the service volume awarded and contract duration - on the quality of home care services and outcomes. A cross-sectional (contract characteristics) and repeated measures (clients) design was used to collect data on the study variables. Primary data were collected in 2002 - 2003 from 11 Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) and 11 nursing provider agencies in Ontario. The sample included 750 home care clients recruited consecutively from home care referrals. Follow-up assessments were completed on 498 clients. CCACs and provider agencies completed written questionnaires about profit status, contract volume, duration of contract, potential for renewal, number of visits made by a principal nurse and number of visits made by a registered nurse. Data were collected on client health outcomes either at admission to home care service for new clients or at entry to the study for long-term clients, and then at discharge from service or at the end of six weeks, whichever came first, using the eight subscales of the Medical Outcome Study SF- 36. Analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modelling. For the most part, contract characteristics were not related to the consistency of principal nurse visits or client outcomes. Where differences existed, they were <b>small.</b> <b>Clients</b> of agencies awarded longer contracts received greater consistency in principal nurse visits than clients of agencies awarded shorter contracts. Clients cared for by for-profit agencies reported slightly higher satisfaction with care and better mental health outcomes than clients cared for by not-for-profit agencies.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} no one who disagrees on how {{important}} data is in every industry especially in enterprise market. More recently, the key point that decides the survival of a business is the management of their big data, which is defined by the 3 V?s: Volume, Velocity, and Variety [1]. While the rate of data generation increases exponentially, processing that data with the limited resources can be a burden to the both business managers and IT managers. Therefore many researchers have already studied new systems which can serve as an alternative resource to calculate and process data. Parallel hardware, such as a general-purpose GPU (GPGPU), {{is one of the most}} well-known alternative. With them, it is possible to process various applications, including data-intensive applications, quickly [2]. OpenCL, in collaborated with several GPU vendors and software organizations, has been launched by the Khronos group as the first open standard platform for the programming of both the GPUs and CPUs [3]. It makes the binary codes execute on various heterogeneous processing units such as CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs simultaneously. It also supports <b>small</b> <b>clients</b> like mobile GPUs for the mobile world. This paper proposes the method to optimize a machine learning algorithm with the heterogeneous platform which uses both the CPUs and GPUs using OpenCL.

As most accounting transactions are now computerized, auditing of accounting data {{is also expected}} to be computerized as well.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utilization of GAS by external auditors in the UK. The paper focuses on small and medium‐sized audit firms in the UK whereas most other GAS studies have examined “Big 4 ” firms. Registered statutory auditors have been selected as a sample. Design/methodology/approach – A framework was developed to identify a range of relevant factors which are important when considering the application of GAS. A web‐based survey has been used to gather the perceptions based on the responses from 205 statutory auditors across the UK. The questions posed to respondents were mapped against the framework. Findings – The research finds that the utilization of GAS is unusually low among audit firms in the UK.
