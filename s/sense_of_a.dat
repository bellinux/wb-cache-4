5|$|Castles, in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{fortified}} {{residence of}} a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland {{as part of}} David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly {{in the south and}} east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

5|$|The Antemoro soon {{developed}} a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed sorabe, which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the Malagasy language. Antemoro ombiasy (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation {{of a network of}} powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

40|$|Word sense {{ambiguity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems of natural language semantic interpretation. In traditional method, there is a combinatorial explosion problem due to the fact that the propriety <b>of</b> each word <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambiguous word is independently checked with each word <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> other ambiguous words during the disambiguation process. In this paper, we describe an `incremental semantic disambiguation' model which uses two representations called `generalized discrimination network' [Okumura et al., 1990] and `bit-vector-formed conceptual hierarchy representation'. By these representations, word <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambiguous word are represented in the expression that can be used immediately in disambiguation process by not individualizing these word senses. Consequently, the complexity in semantic disambiguation process is improved, independent of the number <b>of</b> word <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word. Operations for the disambiguation process in our model are simply equivalent to OR operation...|$|R
