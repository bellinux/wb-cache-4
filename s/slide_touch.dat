The individual consumer is faced with an array of choice; possibly, for some, too overwhelming to choose from. To narrow down the phone selection process, increasingly phone outlets are using psychographic segmentation processes, where the consumer's individual profile is mapped and matched against a smaller selection of phones and phone accessories. For example, CNET has six profiles, which includes the basic user, the busy executive, gear head, fashion, weekend warrior and multimedia. These profiles are based on personal charactoristics, the self-concept, and external influences such as cultural norms, friends and family...|$|E

In the group stages he {{recorded}} a goal in a 2–0 win over Canada, and in the quarter-finals, Dempsey also scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Jamaica. In the semi-finals against Panama, who had shockingly defeated the United States 1–2 in the group stage, Dempsey scored the only goal to advance the Americans to the final. With a <b>sliding</b> <b>touch</b> Dempsey redirected Landon Donovan's pass into the net.|$|R
40|$|A non-smooth Gause predator–prey {{model with}} a {{constant}} refuge is proposed and analyzed. Firstly, the existence and stability of regular, virtual, pseudo-equilibria and tangent points are addressed. Then {{the relations between the}} existence of a regular equilibrium and a pseudo-equilibrium are studied, and the results indicate that the two types of equilibria cannot coexist. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the global stability of limit cycle, <b>sliding</b> <b>touching</b> cycle, canard cycle, focus point and pseudo-equilibrium are provided by using qualitative analysis techniques of non-smooth Filippov dynamic systems. Furthermore, sliding bifurcations related to boundary node (focus) and touching bifurcations were investigated by employing theoretical and numerical techniques. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies on a non-smooth Gause predator–prey model without involving a carrying capacity for the prey population, and some biological implications are discussed...|$|R

By focusing on 5 totally blind persons, it was found that they have been developing their dexterity for oneself in daily life. Basically, they walks along the physical guide using by <b>slide</b> motions and <b>touch</b> techniques which were instructed in the walking training. However, they have been progressing the combination <b>slide</b> motions with <b>touch</b> techniques as complex skills.

David shared the story about kids whose parent couldn't pay for their children's cleft lip and palate {{surgeries}} and the complications they would encounter in their lives. The pictures on the <b>slide</b> show <b>touched</b> Keegan deeply and after the talk {{he walked up to}} David and asked to be involved. Since that day, The Cape Trek Project and Keegan have raised an incredible amount of money for the organization. Costing just R5 500 to not only repair a child's palate and lip but also their life, gives these people another chance at life. Keegan has always maintained {{that it would have been}} impossible to do the things he had done if he had a deformity like this and has committed to helping others..|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a system for}} virtual slide guitar playing. From the control point of view, {{it can be seen}} as a successor of the virtual air guitar (VAG) developed at Helsinki University of Technology (TKK) a few years ago (Karjalainen et al. 2006). The original VAG allows the user to control an electric guitar synthesizer by mimicking guitar-playing gestures. In the current work, the same gesture-control approach that was found successful in the VAG is used: a computer-visionbased system, in which a camera detects the player’s hands and a computer tracks the hand movements and converts them into control data, such as pluck events and string length. Sound synthesis in the virtual slide guitar application is based on an energy-compensated time-varying digital waveguide model of a guitar with new extensions to generate contact sounds caused by the <b>slide</b> tube <b>touching</b> the strings. Video files showing the virtual slide guitar in action can be found on the accompanying Web pag...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} This paper introduces JerkTilts, quick back-and-forth gestures {{that combine}} device pitch and roll. JerkTilts {{may serve as}} gestural self-delimited shortcuts for activating commands. Because they only depend on device acceleration and rely on a parallel and independent input channel, these gestures do not interfere with finger activity on the touch screen. Our experimental data suggest that recognition rates in an eight-choice selection task are as high with JerkTilts as with thumb <b>slides</b> on the <b>touch</b> screen. We also report data confirming that JerkTilts can be combined successfully with simple touch-screen operation. Data from a field study suggest that inadvertent JerkTilts are unlikely to occur in real-life contexts. We describe three illustrative implementations of JerkTilts, which show how the technique helps to simplify frequently used commands. </p...|$|R

40|$|Progress in the {{molecular}} oncology of gastrointestinal carcinomas depends on high quality cancer tissues for research. Recent acceleration on new technological platforms {{as well as}} the “ omics” revolution increases the demands on tissues and peripheral blood for research at the DNA, mRNA and protein levels. Tissue bank creation emerges as a priority. Tumor tissue banks are facilities that are organized to collect, store and distribute samples of tumor and normal tissue for further use in basic and translational cancer research. The samples are generally obtained immediately after excision, prior to fixation, to ensure optimal preservation of proteins and nucleic acids. It is possible for surgeons or pathologists to collect fresh tissue prospectively during their routine dissection procedures. Most tissue banks are “ project-driven” tumor banks, which are specialized collections of tumor samples on which their research is based. Systematic collection of all available tumor tissue is much rarer. High quality tissue banks need the collaboration of clinicians and basic scientists, but also the informed consent of patients and ethical approval. Through the standard operation procedure, snap frozen fresh tissue collection, storage and quality control for cryopreserved tissues are the pivotal factors on tissue bank construction and maintaining. The purpose of the tissue bank creation is enhancing the quality and speed on both the basic and translational research on gastrointestinal cancer. The quality assurance and quality control are handled based on reviewing HE staining <b>slides</b> or <b>touch</b> imprint cytology by pathologists...|$|R
40|$|As {{smartphones}} {{came into}} wide use recently, {{it has become}} increasingly popular not only among young people, but among middle-aged people as well. Most smartphones adopt capacitive full touch screen, so touch commands are made by fingers unlike the PDAs in the past that use touch pens. In this case, {{a significant portion of the}} smartphone’s screen is blocked by the finger so it is impossible to see the screens around the finger touching the screen; this causes difficulties in making precise inputs. To solve this problem, this research proposes a method of using simple AR markers to improve the interface of smartphones. A marker is placed in front of the smartphone camera. Then, the camera image of the marker is analyzed to determine the position of the marker as the position of the mouse cursor. This method can enable click, double-click, drag-and-drop used in PCs as well as <b>touch,</b> <b>slide,</b> long-touch-input in smartphones. Through this research, smartphone inputs can be made more precise and simple, and show the possibility of the application of a new concept of smartphone interface...|$|R
40|$|Geotourism is a {{specialised}} form {{of tourism}} where {{the focus of}} attention is the geosite. A geosite can be a landscape, group of landforms. a single landform. a rock outcrop, a fossil bed or assemblage of crystals. Many such sites and features are exposed in coastal environments and those countries with extensive coastlines provide much scope for geotourism. Examples of existing geotourism locations are described and the case of enhancing the tourism product along the coastline of Kalbarri National Park in Western Australia via geosite interpretation is described. Materials {{that can be used to}} assist in interpreting geosites include, information panels, brochures, books, displays, video, <b>slide</b> shows, interactive <b>touch</b> panels, models, specimens, computer animations and activities. In addition an essential part of presenting geotourism to the visitor is the role of the tour guide, a trained interpreter who can deliver the information and inspire the geotourist. Any coastal landscape has geotourism potential. Developing geotourism requires recognition of resources (resource inventory) and a tourism strategy that incorporates education/interpretation and on-site visitor management...|$|R
