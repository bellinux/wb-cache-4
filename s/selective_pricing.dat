40|$|Due to the {{proliferation}} of the diversity in user behaviors and traffic demands, traffic engineering mechanisms have become an inevitable task in data networks. Nowadays, most commonly used algorithm in end hosts is the popular TCP and its variants (such as MulTCP). These are loss based schemes therefore exhibit oscillatory behavior which reduces network performance. Moreover, since the price for all sessions is normally based on the aggregate throughput, losses that are caused by TCP may affect other sessions as well and aggressively reduce their throughput and also have a drastic effect on the overall throughput /goodput of the network. In this paper a novel traffic engineering mechanism {{in the form of}} the <b>selective</b> <b>pricing</b> is proposed in which different prices are imposed on the network resources for different users. The proposed mechanism not only reduces the packet loss ratio, but also increases the goodput performance of the non-TCP elastic sessions such as Proportional or Minimum Potential Delay schemes. Stability property of the algorithms are investigated and some numerical analysis is presented to validate the results 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an analytical and selective empirical survey of inflation in sub-Saharan Africa. It {{begins with an}} empirical assessment of inflation in Africa using various price indicators, and then looks at the major instruments of anti-inflationary policy. Instead of listing each instrument, the paper attempts to distinguish countries by broad policy regimes into four categories. A common generalized model of inflation is set-up, and each policy regime is {{shown to be a}} special case of that general model. The four prototypes classified are: (a) the CFA franc zone model of pegged exchange rates, open capital account and no price controls; (b) fixed-but-adjusting exchange rates, with closed capital account and some <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> controls; (c) fixed-but-adjusting exchange rates with widespread parallel markets, closed capital account and <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> controls; and (d) dual exchange rates, closed capital account but with extensive and effective pricecontrols. It uses the results from various empirical studies to examine the issues of policy coordination and sequencing that arise under each of the policy regimes. The paper particularly focuses on the interaction of exchange rate policy and inflation in view of the recent debate on this subject. It also examines the question of unravelling price controls and its implication for exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policy and financial sector reforms.

40|$|The {{plethora of}} {{comparison}} shopping agents (CSAs) in today's markets enables buyers to query {{more than a}} single CSA when shopping, and an inter-CSAs competition naturally arises. We suggest a new approach, termed "selective price disclosure", which improves the attractiveness of a CSA by removing some of the prices in the outputted list. The underlying idea behind this approach is to affect the buyer's beliefs regarding the chance of obtaining more attractive prices. The paper presents two methods, which are suitable for fully-rational buyers, for deciding which prices among those known to the CSA should be disclosed. The effectiveness and efficiency of the methods are evaluated using real data collected from five CSAs. The methods are also evaluated with human subjects, showing that <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> disclosure can be highly effective in this case as well, however, the disclosed subset of prices should be extracted in a different (simplistic) manner.

40|$|Firms in many {{industries}} experience protracted {{periods of}} pricing power, {{the ability to}} successfully enact price increases. In these situations, firms must decide not only whether to raise prices, but to whom. Specifically, in a competitive context, they must determine whether it is more profitable to increase prices across-the-board or to a specific segment of their customer base. While <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> decreases are ubiquitous in practice (e. g., better deals to potential new customers by phone carriers; better deals to current customers by various magazines), to our knowledge <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> increases are relatively rare. We illustrate the benefits of targeted price increases, and, as such, we expand the repertoire of firms' promotional policies. To that end, we explore a scenario where two competing firms must decide whether to increase prices to the entire market or only to a specific segment. Targeted price increases (TPI), i. e., being offered an unchanged price (selectively) when others are subject to price increases, can be offered to Loyals (those who bought from the firm in the previous period) or Switchers (those who did not). The effects of TPIs are estimated through a laboratory experiment and an associated stochastic model, each allowing for both rational (Loyalty, Switching) and behaviorist (Betrayal, Jealousy) effects. We find that TPIs can indeed yield beneficial results (greater retention for Loyals or greater attraction of Switchers) and greater profits in certain circumstances. Results for TPI are additionally benchmarked against those for targeted price decreases and are found to differ. The range of effects stemming from the experiment {{can be used in}} a competitive analysis to yield equilibrium strategies for the two firms. In this case, we find that [...] depending on the magnitude of the price increase, market shares of the two firms, and price knowledge across consumer segments [...] a firm may wish to embrace targeted price increases in some situations, to institute across-the-board price increases in others, and to not enact any price increases in still others. We show that a firm can sacrifice considerable profit if it settles on a suboptimal pricing strategy (e. g., wrongly instituting an across-the-board increase), favors the wrong segment (e. g., Switchers instead of Loyals), or ignores "behaviorist" effects (Betrayal or Jealousy). game theory, stochastic models, targeted pricing, pricing power, promotions...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: Environmental policy; General {{equilibrium}} modeling; Negishi format; Waste management policies; Market distortions. About 40 % of {{the entire}} budget spent on environmental problems in the Netherlands is reserved for the waste management problem. Regardless of the amount spent on waste management, the quantity of municipal solid waste generated still increases. It has up till now proven impossible to decouple generation of municipal solid waste and income growth. This thesis investigates the policy options {{that can be used}} to reduce generation of municipal solid waste and looks specifically at the direct and indirect effects of introducing unit-based pricing. Two types of unit-based pricing are distinguished: a full unit-based pricing scheme, in which municipalities charge a variable price for collection of both organic waste and rest waste, and a <b>selective</b> unit-based <b>pricing</b> scheme, in which municipalities only charge a unit-based price for the collection of rest waste. It presents a modeling framework to simulate the waste market in the Netherlands. The model includes several municipalities as sources of waste, consumer preferences, economies of scale, transport costs, and several kinds of emissions caused by waste treatment. In this thesis specific focus was given to the possibility of waste leakage, where consumers pollute the organic waste stream with rest waste. The model was used in a stylized example with numerical data based on the Netherlands in 2000. The results show that the <b>selective</b> unit-based <b>pricing</b> scheme is the most effective policy tool to reduce generation of municipal solid waste. Due to the effects of waste leakage, however, it is not advisable to introduce unit-based pricing in every municipality. The results show that it is not cost effective to introduce <b>selective</b> unit-based <b>pricing</b> for waste collection in larger municipalities. In these municipalities the effects of waste leakage are too costly. The degree of pollution is so high that part of the organic waste stream cannot be composted and will have to be incinerated, thus greatly increasing the costs of treating organic waste. Only in small municipalities with a relatively large number of environmentally concerned consumers <b>selective</b> unit-based <b>pricing</b> can be introduced. Larger municipalities may consider introducing full unit-based pricing. This policy tool, however, only stimulates prevention and not recycling, thus the effects for reducing generation of rest waste are limited...|$|R
40|$|In June 2014, the General Court of the EU {{delivered}} its {{judgment in}} Intel. The debates {{to which it}} has given rise in {{less than six months}} suggest that the controversy about the legal treatment of exclusive dealing and rebates under Article 102 TFEU is still very much alive. This piece seeks {{to make sense of the}} persistence of academic and non-academic discussions around the question. It appears that the real reasons behind the contentious status of the relevant case law are more limited in their nature and scope than commonly assumed. Ongoing disagreements are merely the manifestation of what can be termed a ‘friction’ in the case law. If rulings like Intel (and previous ones like Michelin II and British Airways) are contested, this is so because they are difficult to reconcile with other judgments addressing the same or comparable issues. First, the case law on, respectively, article 101 and 102 TFEU is based on mutually incompatible premises. Secondly, and to the extent that there is no reason to presume that exclusivity and rebate schemes are implemented for anticompetitive purposes and/or to assume that they harm the competitive process, they would be assessed more sensibly under a standard – as ‘margin squeeze’ abuses and <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> cuts already are...|$|R

40|$|Price {{discrimination}} {{is one of}} the most complex areas of EC competition law. There are several reasons for this. First, the concept of price discrimination covers many different practices (discounts and rebates, tying, <b>selective</b> <b>price</b> cuts, discriminatory input prices set by vertically-integrated operators, etc.) whose objectives and effects on competition significantly differ. From the point of view of competition law analysis, it is thus not easy to classify these practices under a coherent analytical framework. Second, there is a consensus among economists that the welfare effects of the (various categories of) price discrimination are ambiguous. It is hard to say a priori whether a given form of price discrimination increases or decreases welfare. The response to this question may indeed depend on which type of welfare standard (total or consumer) is actually pursued. Moreover, even if one agrees on a given standard, the welfare effects of discriminatory prices generally depend on factual issues, such as whether it increases or decreases total output. Third, the exact scope of Article 82 (c), the only Treaty provision dealing with discrimination, is not entirely clear. While the European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) and the Community courts have applied Article 82 (c) to many different practices, there are good reasons to believe that this provision should be applied to a limited set of circumstances, most forms of discrimination being adequately covered by Article 82 (b) or other provisions of the Treaty. Against this background, the main objective of this paper is to throw some light on the compatibility of price discrimination with EC competition law. In order to do so, this paper does not seek to propose a grand unifying theory that would provide a single test offering a way to distinguish between practices compatible and incompatible with the EC Treaty. Instead, we offer an analytical framework which distinguishes between different categories of price discrimination depending on their effects on competition. Different tests may thus be needed to assess the compatibility of the practices belonging to these categories with EC competition law. Another objective of the paper is to show that Article 82 (c) should only be applied to the limited circumstances where a non-vertically integrated dominant firm price discriminates between customers with the effect of placing one or several of them at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other customers (secondary line price discrimination). In contrast, Article 82 (c) should not be applied to pricing measures designed to harm the dominant firm's competitors (first line price discrimination) or to fragment the single market across national lines. As will be seen, relying on Article 82 (c) to condemn such practices goes against the letter and the spirit of this provision and may also apply a wrong test to such practices. It is also not necessary since other Treaty provisions can be used to achieve this objective...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{with the main}} aspects of medical trace molecules detection by means of intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS), namely with the equirements for highly sensitive, highly <b>selective,</b> low <b>price,</b> and compact size sensor. A novel two modes semiconductor laser sensor is demonstrated. Its operation principle {{is based on the}} competition between these two modes. The sensor sensitivity is improved when the sample is placed inside the two modes laser cavity, and the competition between the two modes exists. The effects of the mode competition in ICLAS are discussed theoretically and experimentally. The sensor selectivity is enhanced using external cavity diode laser (ECDL) configuration, where the tuning range only depends on the external cavity configuration. In order to considerably reduce the sensor cost, relative intensity noise (RIN) is chosen for monitoring the intensity ratio of the two modes. RIN is found to be an excellent indicator for the two modes intensity ratio variations which strongly supports the sensor methodology. On the other hand, it has been found that, wavelength tuning has no effect on the RIN spectrum which is very beneficial for the proposed detection principle. In order to use the sensor for medical applications, the absorption line of an anesthetic sample, propofol, is measured. Propofol has been dissolved in various solvents. RIN has been chosen to monitor the sensor response. From the measured spectra, the sensor sensitivity enhancement factor is found to be of the order of 10 ^(3) times of the conventional laser spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|In the U. K., home {{contents}} {{insurance is}} widely available, with {{a reduction in}} the number of “traditional” insurance companies offering cover being offset by a growth in the availability through “non-traditional” providers such as supermarkets, motoring organizations and even energy providers. Research suggests that while around 80 per cent of all households are covered by home contents insurance, only around 50 per cent of people living in rented or local authority housing insure their contents. The low uptake is undesirable for two reasons. Firstly, financial exclusion is a phenomenon whereby individuals or sectors of society are deliberately, or effectively, denied access to financial services products, including home insurance, and it is commonly government policy to reduce such exclusion. Secondly, possession of contents insurance by householders minimizes the possibility that after a catastrophic loss such as flooding, uninsured persons will seek emergency assistance and temporary housing at the expense of their local authority. Studies and government reports exist that shed light upon the reasons behind the low purchase of conventionally marketed insurance. Special schemes exist to encourage purchase of insurance by enabling home contents insurance for local authority tenants to be paid for along with rent. Governments support such schemes. There appears to be little published research to indicate the extent to which such schemes are used by tenants. We survey local authorities in Scotland to determine the availability of “insurance with rent” schemes and their take-up rate by tenants. We find that many schemes exist, providing average market cover at typically average or lower cost and that there is no evidence of highly <b>selective</b> underwriting and <b>pricing.</b> Despite this easy availability of competitively priced, good policy cover, we find that the take-up rates by tenants are low. We consider reasons why apparently effective insurance products are not more popular. We conclude that local authorities and government need to promote the schemes with greater vigour.

40|$|Two feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to study the combined effects of (i) varying degrees of selective consumption and (ii) supplementation with cowpea (Trail 1) or groundnut haulms (Trial 2), on intake of organic matter (IOM) from sorghum stover, and total intake of digestible organic matter (IDOM). In both trials, 36 rams were allocated to 36 different treatments: six levels of feeding sorghum stover (25, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 160 g organic matter (OM) kg- 0. 75 per day) combined with six levels of supplementation (0, 5, 12. 5, 20, 40, and 60 g OM kg- 0. 75 per day). Each diet was offered for a 21 day period; intake and digestibility were recorded during the last 9 days. Non-linear regression models were {{used to describe the}} combined effects of varying amounts of stover (x) and supplements (s) offered. All animals ate the full amount of supplement offered, but not the sorghum stover. For animals without supplement, maximum intake (m) of stover (i. e. IOM at high levels of x) was estimated at 50. 7 g kg- 0. 75 per day in Trial 1 and 45. 7 g kg- 0. 75 per day in Trial 2. In both trials, m decreased linearly with s at the rate 0. 4 g g- 1. Also, the shape of the curve relating intake of stover to x was affected by level of supplementation. Digestibility of whole stover (0. 47 in Trial 1; 0. 40 in Trial 2) was much lower than that of cowpea haulms (0. 70) and groundnut haulms (0. 62), but in both trials animals selected material of higher digestibility when excess stover was offered. Thus, the negative effect of supplementation on intake of stover was partly compensated by higher digestibility of consumed stover. For rations without cowpea in Trial 1, the maintenance level of IDOM was reached by offering 61 g sorghum OM (kg- 0. 75 per day) of which 47 g was consumed. With the same amount of offered sorghum 9, 18, 28, 38 and 48 g cowpea OM were needed to attain intake levels equivalent to 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, 1. 8 and 2. 0 times maintenance, respectively. In the trial with groundnut, maintenance was not reached with sorghum alone and larger amounts of supplement were required for the levels of intake mentioned above. Iso-production curves describing which amounts of stover and supplement gave the same IDOM, were not linear with constant slope corresponding to the comparative digestibility of whole stover and supplements, but strongly curved. Such curves can be used to derive optimum combinations of stover and higher quality feeds, depending on feed prices, desired production level and taking into account the effects of <b>selective</b> consumption. With <b>prices</b> of cowpea and groundnut haulms 4 times higher than that of stover, the results of Trial 1 indicate that least cost rations for feeding at 1. 2 M (maintenance) would consist of 72 g sorghum OM (kg- 0. 75 per day) combined with 7 g cowpea haulms. For feeding at 1. 6 M this would be 70 26 g, and at 2 M, 54 50 g. Similarly, with the feeds used in Trial 2, optimum combinations of sorghum stover and groundnut haulms for the same levels of feeding would be 58 24, 51 47, and 11 78 gOMkg- 0. 75 perday...|$|R
