40|$|Research {{indicates}} that <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> raids increased during the 1990 s {{and continue to}} be a common enforcement tool for law enforcement. The extant literature does not provide a detailed understanding of why police departments are increasingly using <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> and in particular why plainclothes detectives are conducting these raids at a higher rate. Furthermore, the research does not provide an understanding for how <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> are secured and executed by police departments. This research examines the social constructions detectives use to justify and carry out the various stages of the <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> process. Ethnographic research was used to observe 73 <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> over a 21 month period. The findings indicate there are five stages to the <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> process: (1) when detectives seek warrants; (2) obtaining the warrant; (3) preparing for the warrant; (4) executing the warrant; and (5) measuring the warrant’s success. When examining the <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> process as a whole, the research finds those detectives’ typifications of the need for <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> rests on the officer safety and the need to secure evidence of criminal activity before it is destroyed. The research also shows the detectives’ emphasis on safety is contradictory as the process detectives use to execute <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> exposes the detectives to increased and often unnecessary risks...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "information" [...] is {{also used}} for other {{purposes}} in the Criminal Code, such as applications to obtain a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> A peace officer who is seeking a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> must file a sworn information before a justice of the peace, outlining the reasons {{in support of a}} <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The justice of the peace then reviews the information to obtain, and decides whether the information supports the issuance of a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|R

25|$|What {{amounts to}} “reasonable grounds” is not {{defined in the}} Search and Surveillance Act 2012, however a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> will be invalid only where the {{application}} for it was insufficient or it is so defective as {{to be likely to}} mislead the affected parties. Part 4, subpart 3 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 sets out the requirements for lawfully carrying out a <b>search</b> once a <b>warrant</b> has been obtained. A search conducted without a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> or outside of the terms of a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> is highly likely to be unlawful and unreasonable.|$|R

50|$|If {{an agent}} has {{evidence}} that television is being watched or recorded illegally but is denied entry by the occupants so that (s)he cannot verify the suspicion, then TV Licensing may {{apply to a}} magistrate for a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The BBC states that a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> would never be applied for {{solely on the basis}} of non-cooperation with TV Licensing and that in the event of being denied access to unlicensed property will use detection equipment rather than a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{obtain a}} <b>search</b> <b>warrant,</b> an officer must prove to a {{magistrate}} or judge that probable cause exists based upon direct information (i.e., the officer's personal observation) or hearsay information. Hearsay information {{can even be}} obtained by oral testimony given over a telephone or from an anonymous or confidential informant, so long as probable cause exists based on {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Police can seize both property and persons under a <b>search</b> <b>warrant.</b> The standard for a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> is lower than the quantum of proof required for a later conviction. The rationale is that evidence police collect without a <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> may not be sufficient to convict, but may be sufficient to suggest that a warrant would allow police to find enough evidence to convict.|$|R

An unusual in rem case {{heard by the}} Supreme Court where the named object was not the seized {{property}} but the warrant under which it was seized. Since all the government agents involved were indisputably acting within the law as it stood, {{the only way for}} the petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of the seizure was to name the <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> itself as defendant.|$|R
40|$|This article {{posits that}} {{cognitive}} biases {{play a significant}} role in the gap between the rhetoric regarding Fourth Amendment protection and actual practices regarding <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> scrutiny, particularly for <b>search</b> <b>warrants</b> based on informants’ tips. Specifically, this article examines the ways in which implicit bias, tunnel vision, priming, and hindsight bias can affect <b>search</b> <b>warrants.</b> These biases can affect each stage of the <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> process, including targeting decisions, the drafting process, the magistrate’s decision whether to grant the warrant, and post-search review by trial and appellate courts. These biases create room for informant falsehoods to go unchecked, with a likely disproportionate effect on minority communities. To address these effects, the article proposes a number of interconnected solutions, all revolving around the idea of full disclosure. The article proposes that police officers, magistrates, and judges all receive education about cognitive biases generally and the value of meaningful judicial review of warrants for combatting these biases. To facilitate this review, police should use a checklist when preparing <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> applications to help them identify and disclose all relevant information. The article then suggests changes for judicial review of challenges to the accuracy and completeness of <b>search</b> <b>warrant</b> information. These revised standards should incentivize providing full disclosure and to ensure meaningful post-search review of magistrates’ decisions...|$|R
