40|$|Utilization {{of a novel}} plant host by herbivorous insects {{requires}} {{coordination of}} numerous physiological and behavioral adaptations in both larvae and adults. The recent host range expansion of the crucifer-specialist diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), to the <b>sugar</b> <b>pea</b> crop in Kenya provides an opportunity to study this process in action. Previous {{studies have shown that}} larval ability to grow and complete development on <b>sugar</b> <b>pea</b> is genetically based, but that females of the pea-adapted strain do not prefer to oviposit on pea. Here we examine larval preference for the novel host plant. Larvae of the newly evolved pea-adapted host strain were offered the choice of the novel host plant <b>sugar</b> <b>pea</b> and the original host cabbage. These larvae significantly preferred pea, while in contrast, all larvae of a cabbage-adapted DBM strain preferred cabbage. However, pea-adapted larvae, which were reared on cabbage, also preferred cabbage. Thus both genetic differences and previous exposure affect larval host choice, while adult choice for the novel host has not yet evolved...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth (DBM, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)) consumes a {{wide variety}} of brassicaceous host plants and is a common pest of {{crucifer}} crops worldwide. A highly unusual infestation of a <b>sugar</b> <b>pea</b> crop was recorded in Kenya in 1999, which persisted for two consecutive years. A strain (DBM-P) from this population was established in the laboratory and {{is the only one of}} several strains tested that can complete larval development on sugar peas. The oviposition acceptance and preference of the DBM-P strain was assessed in the presence of cabbage plants, <b>sugar</b> <b>pea</b> plants or both, in comparison to another strain (DBM-Cj) that was collected from cabbage and is unable to grow on pea plants. As expected, DBM-Cj females preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants. Surprisingly, DBM-P females also laid most eggs on cabbage and very few on peas. However, they laid significantly more eggs on the cabbage plant when pea plants were present. Our findings suggest that DBM-P manifested the initial stages of an evolutionary host range expansion, which is incomplete due to lack of oviposition fidelity on pea plants...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Small broomrape, a holoparasitic weed, is a {{relatively}} new weed introduction in the Pacific Northwest that has contaminated a limited number of red clover fields in Oregon. Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate small broomrape response to common crop and weed species in the Pacific Northwest. Host species in the greenhouse or field study included alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, carrot, celery, common vetch, crimson clover, lettuce, prickly lettuce, red clover, spotted catsear, subterranean clover, white clover, and wild carrot. False-host species included barley, birdsfoot trefoil, creeping bentgrass, cucumber, field corn, fine fescue, flax, Italian ryegrass, nasturtium, oat, orchardgrass, perennial ryegrass, snap bean, <b>sugar</b> <b>pea,</b> sunflower, sweet corn, tall fescue, tomato, and wheat. Non-host species included sugar beet and curly dock. The greenhouse polyethylene bag system provided a rapid and inexpensive screening for plant species host status to small broomrape. Germination and attachment to host roots are initiated by chemical exudates, that may change concentration in response to nutrient availability and microorganisms. Red clover was grown in varying concentrations of ammonium sulfate fertilizer with and without Rhizobium inoculation, and with small broomrape seeds. Neither Rhizobium inoculation nor ammonium concentration influenced the number of small broomrape attachments to red clover roots. A survey was conducted of red clover seed growers with small broomrape-contaminated fields in the Pacific Northwest. Red clover seed from six respondents were cleaned at the same cleaning facility, and the same respondents purchased their seed stock from this cleaning facility. Small broomrape was not identified in red clover fields prior to or during the first clover seed harvest of fall planted red clover in small broomrape-contaminated sites...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of sowing date and seed density on the growth and yield of the <b>sugar</b> snap <b>pea</b> at industrial scale. Six randomized blocks experiments with four replicates were conducted on irrigated land in Villafranca (Navarra, Spain) in 1998, 1999, and 2000.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} study the {{sensitivity}} of 9 crops to atrazine soil residual, two separate experiments were conducted in field and greenhouse conditions. First experiment was conducted in a field with treated soil by atrazine based on split plot and the results evaluated in greenhouse conditions. Treatments in the field experiment included two organic manure application rates (0 and 50 t/ha) as main plots and 2 atrazine application rates (2 and 4 kg/ha atrazine a. i.) as sob plots. After corn harvesting soil was sampled at 0 - 15 cm surface layer in each plots in 15 points, after mixing the samples. Wheat, barley, <b>sugar</b> beet, <b>pea,</b> lens and colza planted in pots at greenhouse. Second experiment conducted in greenhouse conditions for evaluation of atrazine soil residual in completely randomized design. Treatments included atrazine soil residual concentrations (0, 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg soil) and crops included wheat, barley, <b>sugar</b> beet, <b>pea,</b> lens, rape, bean and tomato. Results showed that atrazine residue {{had no effect on}} crops growth in field experiment treated with atrazine. It seems that atrazine residue in filed soil is lower that its damage threshold for crops or maybe for its fast removal in field than in control conditions.
