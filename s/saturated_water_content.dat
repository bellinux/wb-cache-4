40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of biochar amendment on soil aggregate formation and stability, and soil hydraulic properties. Biochar produced from dairy manure was added to two different soils (a silty clay and a sandy loam soil) at a ratio of 2 % (w/w in dry weight basis). Incubation experiments were conducted within a 90 -d period with the soils (the controls) and the soil/biochar mixtures. Compared with the controls, biochar addition significantly enhanced the formation of macroaggregates and slightly increased saturated hydraulic conductivities of the soils. Attributable to the soil structure change, <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> increased and residual <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> decreased with the biochar amendment. These changes with biochar addition greatly affected the shape of soil water retention functions.

These two areas often have also different organic matter contents and soil compaction properties, and hence also soil hydraulic properties, thus causing further {{differences in the}} local infiltration rates close to and away from trees. In this study we analyzed possible differences in the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties of the stemflow and throughfall areas below an oil palm tree. Tension disc infiltrometer experiments were carried out underneath the canopy and in the interspace area of an oil palm tree plantation at successive tensions of 5, 2, and 0 cm. Soil hydraulic properties were estimated inversely from the measured data using the HYDRUS- 2 D/ 3 D software package. Four van Genuchten soil hydraulic parameters (i. e., the residual <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> θr, the shape factors α and n, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks) were optimized. <b>Saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents,</b> θs, were fixed at their laboratory-measured values.

This applies to transpiration from a leaf with the degree of fractionation dependent {{on a number of}} environmental and physiological factors that are well understood. Nevertheless, the ¹⁸O enrichment of bulk leaf water is often less than that predicted for the sites of evaporation. The advection of less enriched water in the transpiration stream has been suggested to limit the back diffusion of enriched evaporative site water (Péclet effect); however, evidence for this effect has been varied. In sampling across a range of species with different vein densities and <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents,</b> we demonstrate the importance of accounting for the relative 'pool' sizes of the vascular and mesophyll water for the interpretation of a Péclet effect.

However, the soil interior hydrological and ecological effects {{will be affected by}} the grassland vegetation degradation. This research was carried out in the source region of the Yellow River, where grassland vegetation was in severe degradation, with the methods of choosing typical areas and quadrates to collect soil samples and doing experiments in laboratory. Some important results were obtained from this research which mainly contained four aspects as follows. (1) With the increasing of grassland degradation degrees, the capillary water holding capacity and <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> decreased in all soil layers as a whole. However, the capillary water holding capacity and <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> increased when the grassland degradation from middle degree to heavy degree in all soil layers.

The five principal functional types, which {{are defined by}} innovations such as Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), epiphytism, the tank growth form and neoteny, display distinct ecological water-use strategies. The contribution of putative drought-resistance traits to the ecological differentiation of functional types has not previously been assessed, despite growing interest {{in the importance of}} these traits in other plant groups. We formulated a set of hypotheses to be tested through a major survey of 376 bromeliad species (over 10 % of the entire family) representing different functional types and ecologies. We quantified four drought-resistance traits: osmotic potential at full turgor (π o), <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> (SWC), water mass per unit area (WMA) and dry leaf mass per unit area (LMA). For a subset of 308 species, relationships between drought-resistance traits and species bioclimatic envelopes were also analysed. <b>Saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> WMA and LMA were closely inter-correlated, and there was weaker coordination with π o, but the four traits differed significantly between functional types. Species of different functional types occupied distinct areas of bioclimatic space, and the relationships mapping drought-resistance trait values into bioclimatic space also varied between functional types. We conclude that divergences in drought-resistance trait values form {{an integral part of the}} evolution of functional type distinctiveness and climatic niche differentiation in this megadiverse tropical plant family.

It is also a limiting factor for many processes involve mass or energy transfer between air and water phases in vadose zone. In this research, the gas-phase partitioning tracer method was used to measure air-water interfacial area for eight porous media. The experimental results were used to investigate the influencing factors of the magnitude of air-water interfacial area and the relationship between the air-water interfacial area and water saturation, and capillary pressure. The porous media comprised a series of sands with narrow particle-size ranges, a sand with a wider particle-size distribution, a sandy soil, and a loamy sandy soil. The measurement range was extended to very low <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> in an attempt to determine upper limits for air-water interfacial areas. The measured values were compared to the normalized surface areas of the porous media. The results of the experiments showed that the magnitude of the air-water interfacial areas increased with decreasing water saturation, and approached that of the normalized surface areas. Generally, air-water interfacial areas were larger for media with larger specific surface areas. The change in air-water interfacial area with changing water saturation was less near <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> and greater at smaller values. In addition, the change was greater for the poorly-sorted media than the well-sorted media. An empirical model was developed to describe the observed relationship between air-water interfacial area and water saturation. The coefficients of the model were found to correlate to the porous-medium uniformity coefficient. With this model and associated correlations, only bulk density, specific surface area, and uniformity coefficient are needed to estimate air-water interfacial area for a given water saturation. The model was shown to provide a reasonable description of a literature data set. Potential relationships between air-water interfacial area and capillary pressure under higher water-content conditions are investigated for unsaturated sandy porous media. A conceptual relationship between air-water interfacial area and capillary pressure is hypothesized, and is tested using air-water interfacial area data obtained from gas-phase tracer tests and saturation-pressure data obtained from water-drainage experiments.

The structure of the surface layer of the soil is strongly influenced by soil tillage practices, with important consequences for the hydraulic properties and soil moisture dynamics in the top soil layer. In this study, during four 28 -d periods, we monitored L-band brightness temperatures and infrared (IR) temperatures over bare silt loam soil plots with different soil surface structure: tilled, seedbed, and compacted plots. Differences in absolute and normalized L-band brightness temperatures between the plots indicated that plot specific roughness, soil moisture contents, and soil hydraulic properties might be inverted from L-band brightness temperatures using a coupled radiative transfer, roughness correction, and soil hydrological model. The inversely estimated surface roughness parameters compared well with those derived from laser profiler measurements. The estimated <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> of the tilled and seedbed plots were larger than the one of the compacted plot, and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was smaller in the former plots than in the compacted plot for more negative pressure heads. These differences in hydraulic properties translated into larger dynamics of the simulated soil moisture during a 28 -d measurement period in the tilled and seedbed plots than in the compacted plot. This difference could be confirmed qualitatively but not quantitatively by in situ soil moisture measurements.

40|$|The {{unsaturated}} soil hydraulic properties are often described using Mualem–van Genuchten (MVG) type analytical functions. Recent studies suggest several shortcomings of these functions near satura-tion, notably {{the lack of}} second-order continuity of the soil water retention function at saturation and {{the inability of the}} hydraulic conductivity function to account for macroporosity. We present a modified MVG formulation that improves the description of the hydraulic conductivity near saturation. The modified model introduces a small but constant air-entry pressure (hs) into the water retention curve. Analysis of the UNSODA soil hydraulic database revealed an optimal value of 24 cm for hs, more or less independent of soil texture. The modified model uses a pressure dependent piece-wise linear cor-rection to ensure that deviations between measured and fitted conduc-tivities between pressure heads of 0 and 240 cm were eliminated. A small correction was found necessary between 24 and 240 cm, and a much larger correction was needed between 0 and 24 cm. An average RMSE in logKof only 0. 26 remained for a data set of 235 samples. The resulting modified MVG model was found to have small systematic errors across the entire pressure range. The modified model appears well suited for large-scale vadose zone flow and transport simulations, including inverse modeling studies.

This is called the soil state factor which was developed for the initial and soaking state. The initial state factor is a combination of the dry density, water content and void ratio while the soaking state factor is a combination of the saturated dry density, <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> and amount of swelling during the soaking period. On basis of this concept, characterisation charts for swelling and initial state behaviour as well as strength and initial state behaviour were developed. The use of these charts in pavement design, evaluation and field compaction control on expansive soil areas is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} of saline marsh in Songnen plain {{was controlled by}} many factors. Based on in-situ observation and laboratory analysis, soil properties and matters translocation in Zhalong wetland at local scale as affected by freeze and thaw action was explored. Results show that within the study plot, 1500 m in distance, but varying only 80 cm in altitude, existed four types of soils i. e. Shallow-horizon Alkalic Halosols (SAH), Crust Alkalic Halosols (CAH) and Para-alkalic Dark-Aquic Cambosols (PDC) and Sodic Hapli-Orthic Gleyosols (SHG). High content total porosity with amounts to 62 % in surface horizon in marsh would help to water conservation and wetland formation. In contrast, large rate of silt or clay in texture in alkali soil and meadow soil constrain the water content in topsoil, i. e. the <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> 0 - 30 cm horizon of meadow soil and alkali soil were merely 0. 83 and 0. 7...|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{soil-cement}} block masonry buildings exist in India {{and many other}} countries. The paper deals with an experimental study {{on the influence of}} soil grading on the characteristics of soil-cement blocks and shear-bond strength of soil-cement block masonry triplets. Influence of clay content of the soil-cement block on strength, absorption and durability characteristics, and interfacial mortar-block bond strength has been examined. Some of the major conclusions of the study are: (1) optimum clay content leading to maximum strength is in the range of 14 – 16 %; (2) <b>saturated</b> <b>water</b> <b>content</b> of the blocks increases with increase in clay content of the block; (3) initial rate of absorption decreases with increase in clay content of the block; (4) weight loss after ASTM wire scratch test is minimum when the clay content of the block is about 16 %; and (5) optimum clay content for the highest modulus for the blocks and for highest shear-bond strength is about 16 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Irrigated {{agriculture}} is usually performed in semi-arid regions despite {{scarcity of water}} resources. Therefore, optimal irrigation management by monitoring the soil is essential, and assessing soil hydraulic properties and water flow dynamics {{is presented as a}} first measure. For this purpose, the control of volumetric <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> θ, and pressure head, h, is required. This study adopted two types of monitoring strategies in the same experimental plot to control θ and h in the vadose zone: i) non-automatic and more time-consuming; ii) automatic connected to a datalogger. Water flux was modelled with Hydrus- 1 D using the data collected from both acquisition strategies independently (3820 daily values for the automatic; less than 1000 for the non-automatic). Goodness-of-fit results reported a better adjustment in case of automatic sensors. Both model outputs adequately predicted the general trend of θ and h, but with slight differences in computed annual drainage (711 mm and 774 mm). Soil hydraulic properties were inversely estimated from both data acquisition systems. Major differences were obtained in the <b>saturated</b> volumetric <b>water</b> <b>content,</b> θs, and the n and α van Genuchten model shape parameters. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, shown lower variability with a coefficient of variation range from 0. 13 to 0. 24 for the soil layers defined. Soil hydraulic properties were better assessed through automatic data acquisition as data variability was lower and accuracy was higher...|$|R
40|$|Aims Assessment of the {{ecological}} benefits of forest in soil water retention based on conventionally monitored factors and exploration {{of the relation between}} forest carbon-sink function and hydrological benefits has special meaning in Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Our objectives were to 1) characterize the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture in three subtropical forests and 2) determine the controlling action of soil organic matter on soil moisture retention during vegetation succession. Methods Standard plots were established in Pinus massonniana coniferous forest (PF), mixed Pinus massonniana-broad-leaved forest (PBF) and monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (MBF). We measured soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> every 10 days from 2002 to 2008 using neutron probes and analyzed soil organic matter content in the laboratory by the potassium dichromate oxidation method. Important findings With natural succession from planted PF to climax MBF, soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> (0 – 30 cm soil layer) increased significantly; soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> was highest in MBF and lowest in PBF. The distribution patterns of soil moisture in the three forests were different: the soil moisture of MBF decreased with soil depth, was more homogeneous in the soil profile in PBF and was lower at the surface than in deeper layers in PF. The soil water characteristic curves showed that under the same matrix suction the magnitude of soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> (0 – 40 cm soil layer) was: MBF > PBF > PF; the soil of MBF was the most retentive. Further analysis indicated that soil porosity had the greatest impact on soil moisture, followed by <b>saturated</b> soil <b>water</b> <b>content</b> and soil organic matter content, while soil bulk density had a minimal impact. In the process of natural succession, soil moisture was significantly correlated with the soil organic matter content (p = 0. 014), as the soil organic matter could affect soil moisture holding (p = 0. 030). Accordingly, we recommend soil organic matter as an effective and integrated index for appraising forest ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores {{recovered}} during ODP drilling {{operations are}} commonly scanned using a Minolta CM- 2002 spectrophotometer to obtain spectral data. Core processing procedures aboard the JOIDES Resolution require that these spectral data be measured on wet cores. However, {{the effects of}} changing <b>water</b> <b>content</b> on the spectra of marine sediments is unknown. We {{examined the effects of}} changing <b>water</b> <b>content</b> on visible light (VIS) diffuse refiectance spectra for core samples composed of clay to foraminiferal ooze. The spectra of dry powdered samples were measured, then the samples were completely saturated (~ 35 % <b>water</b> <b>content)</b> and spectra were measured at set time intervals as the samples progressively dried. The fully saturated samples were appreciably darker than the initial dry samples. The samples continued to darken during the initial phases of drying until the <b>water</b> <b>content</b> had decreased from 35 % to ~ 20 %. As the <b>water</b> <b>content</b> continued to decrease below 20 %, the samples became progressively lighter and attained spectral values similar to the fully <b>saturated</b> samples at <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> of ~ 17 %. Samples continued to lighten until they were totally dry; however, values never became as light as those of the dry samples prior to initial wetting. Changes in refiectance with decreasing <b>water</b> <b>content</b> are not uniform across the VIS. If the <b>water</b> <b>content</b> is greater than 5 %, the refiectance decrease relative to a dry sample is greater at the red end of the spectrum. However, at <b>water</b> <b>contents</b> of less than 5 %, the spectral curves of the wet and dry sediments are similar in shape, but the wet sediments are still darker. Comparison of these data with data obtained from similar saturation experiments using a coarse-grained beach sand suggest that the initial darkening of the saturated carbonate sediments apparently results frorn changing of the physical properties of the sediment; decreasing the <b>water</b> <b>content</b> apparently rearranges the grains. These studies suggest that maximum information will be obtained when spectral measurements are taken on samples that are allowed to dry as much as possible...|$|R
