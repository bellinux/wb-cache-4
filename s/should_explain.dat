5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia. This {{gathering}} mandated that all clergy <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity, as well as legislating on clerical dress, control of monasteries, and {{the behavior of the}} clergy. It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the decisions of the council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E

If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E

[...] In his blog, Romm has described the technology solutions that he believes can control global warming. The New York Times also quoted Romm as stating that, to solve the climate crisis, [...] "We will need a WWII-style approach". [...] The article noted Romm's belief that [...] "credible people" [...] and the press should publicly {{support the notion that}} government action is needed to help solve the global warming crisis. [...] In particular, the press <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> how current news stories, such as hurricanes, droughts and insect infestations are related to global warming.|$|E

500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war Guthrie had striven to {{keep the}} Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base, and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made two stipulations: first, as he was unwilling to seek his own release from the forces, the {{governing}} board of the Old Vic <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> to the authorities why it should be granted; secondly, that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, [...] "It would be a disaster, {{you would have to}} spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." [...] It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, [...] "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{strong voice}} against Fortuño was NPP former President Leo Díaz. Díaz accused Fortuño {{and his wife}} of having ties to PDP law firms and to {{colonialist}} interests. At a November 4, 2007, rally called [...] "Con Fuerza para Vencer" [...] (With the Strength to Win), Díaz said, [...] "In this primary the life of this party is in jeopardy. The other candidate, Fortuño, isn't a real statehood defender! He <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> why he has ties with PDP's law firms and why the colonialist special interests are financing his campaign". He has since rejoined party activities and chairs Santini's 2012 reelection efforts.|$|E

According to MK Ghattas: [...] "Patriarch <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> Nadaf that it's not his job. Please take off his cape and join the Likud or Yisrael Beiteinu. He wants to bring the Christian community to the status of the Druze community, and take it out of its national affiliation". In addition patriarch was sent letters on the matter from [...] leaders of the Arab sector councils.|$|E
2500|$|Julian Rushton has {{suggested}} that any solution should satisfy five criteria: a [...] "dark saying" [...] must be involved; the theme [...] "is not played"; the theme should be [...] "well known" [...] (as Elgar stated multiple times); it <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> Elgar's remark that Dora Penny should have been, [...] "of all people", the one to solve the Enigma; and fifthly, some musical observations in the notes Elgar provided to accompany the pianola roll edition {{may be part of}} the solution. Furthermore, the solution (if it exists) [...] "must be multivalent, must deal with musical as well as cryptographic issues, must produce workable counterpoint within Elgar's stylistic range, and must at the same time seem obvious (and not just to its begetter)".|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey of}} admissions {{officers}} revealed that 28% agreed that their school had accepted athletes despite having lower grades and test scores than others. A {{survey by the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that schools with strong athletics departments tended to have athletes with lower SAT scores than non-athletic students. Athletes get better treatment even at elite colleges, according to one academic study. A report suggested that some applications by athletes go first to a special committee for review by coaches, who may then, in turn, advocate for particular players. Recruited athletes who play in-demand or [...] "revenue" [...] sports (i.e. generate ticket sales) such as football or basketball can have a [...] "significantly greater advantage in admissions" [...] than others. Some Ivy League coaches, seeking to improve the average academic performance of their teams, would admit mediocre athletes with top academic skills {{as a means to}} balance out the stellar athletes with below-average academic ability. To fix this [...] "average score" [...] arrangement in which there had been a temptation to admit an extremely poor student with great athletic ability, many schools went to a banding arrangement. For example, coaches would consider all wrestling applicants within a specified range or band of academic performance, and coaches could admit more wrestler-applicants who showed greater scholastic promise. Howard and Matthew Greene report that coaches do not make admissions decisions, but they can advocate for a particular applicant. And they report that committed athletes <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> in their applications how much time they have used towards perfecting their athletic ability: ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cao Cao's position, Yu Jin encountered {{about a dozen}} {{injured and}} naked men on the road. When he asked them what happened, they told him that they were robbed by the Qingzhou Corps (青州兵). The Qingzhou Corps was a unit in Cao Cao's forces formed by the former Yellow Turban rebels who surrendered to Cao in Qing Province (Qingzhou) in the early 190s. The furious Yu Jin said, [...] "The Qingzhou Corps are part of Lord Cao's army. How dare they become robbers!" [...] He then led his men to attack and punish them. Some of the Qingzhou soldiers escaped to Wuyin and accused Yu Jin of committing the crimes they were responsible for. When Yu Jin reached Wuyin, he immediately set up defensive fortifications around the camp instead of reporting directly to Cao Cao. His subordinates told him, [...] "The Qingzhou soldiers framed you. You <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> matters to Lord Cao as soon as possible." [...] Yu Jin replied, [...] "The enemy is still in pursuit and may reach here anytime. If we don't set up defences now, how can we expect to hold them off? Lord Cao is intelligent and wise. Those accusations aren't a cause for concern." [...] After the defences were set up, Yu Jin went to meet Cao Cao and explained everything. Cao Cao was pleased and he said, [...] "How dangerous {{it was for me}} when we were defeated at the Yu River (淯水). General, you're able to bring order to chaos and hold your ground against a fierce enemy, and you display unwavering loyalty. Even the famous generals of ancient times couldn't have done better than you!" [...] Yu Jin was awarded the title [...] "Marquis of Yishou Village" [...] (益壽亭侯) in recognition of his contributions.|$|E
