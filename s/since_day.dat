5|$|Sophie/Dogface Victoria Reade (born 18 May 1989) is a glamour {{model from}} Nantwich, Cheshire, has {{appeared}} in Hot Shots Calendar and was {{the winner of the}} series. Reade changed her name by deed poll to Dogface, to become a house-mate during the show's first week. On Day 33 Big Brother told Reade that she had to remain silent until 2am as punishment for discussing nominations; she failed to keep quiet and therefore faced the public vote. Reade had a romantic relationship with Kris in the House. On Day 39 she and Siavash were punished by Big Brother for talking about nominations, and told they were not allowed to swear before 3pm; they both failed and faced eviction. On Day 72, as a special prize, Dogface (Reade) legally changed her name back to Sophie. <b>Since</b> <b>Day</b> 88, Sophie was the bookies' favourite to win. She left the house to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E

At the last minute, Millikan {{decided to make a}} call to noted actor John Diehl, famous for his work in Nixon, Stargate, and Miami Vice. Millikan explained that, [...] " [...] had been on my list to put into the show <b>since</b> <b>Day</b> One. [...] It turned out the producers like him too—he'd read for us a couple of times already—and {{we were able to get}} him in without even a reading".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg ravioli, which has been on the menu <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single ravioli stuffed with quail egg yolk and laced with truffle butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature organic ingredients. [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of out-of-season strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|E

500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided to then make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself. That’s been the same <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as – you know – action thrillers have changed {{along the lines of the}} Bond films and the Bourne films".|$|E
500|$|Development of Baldur's Gate II {{began in}} January 1999. From the {{suggestions}} of fans on message boards and newsgroups, reviews of Baldur's Gate, and internal suggestions, {{a list of}} constructive criticism was compiled; from this list, a slightly shorter one of features {{to be added to}} the game was made. Some of the items on this list were: support for higher resolutions, such as 800 by 600 pixels and above; 3D support; non-pausing dialogue in multiplayer; drop off panels in the interface; character kits; dual-wielding of weapons; a streamlined journal and annotable map; deathmatch; and inclusion of famous AD monsters such as the dragon. Not many features had to be cut, and they kept as many as they could. Because of the engine's mature state of development, most features were fairly easy to add. Ben Smedstad, the producer of the game, said, [...] "The engine was up and running <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one, which is a huge morale booster. When a monster is complete, we put it into the 'override' directory and it appears in the game! This is a huge change from working on the original." [...] Late in the project, deathmatch was removed, while non-pausing dialogue, which proved [...] "the most problematic feature", was removed early on before being reintroduced in early 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number {{of woman who}} breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation increases the risk of neonatal mortality. Experts suggest breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old. [...] Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour. Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2005, {{following}} {{the confirmation of}} asbestos fibres found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: [...] "This {{is what we have}} been asking for <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues.

2500|$|The art and {{animation}} of the Hunter × Hunter anime {{have also been}} commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter × Hunter, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having [...] "understated energy and flair, {{making the most of}} the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life." [...] Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. [...] "The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is," [...] the reviewer commented, [...] "hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater." [...] Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter × Hunter, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs. Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential. Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as [...] "a letdown <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one".|$|E
2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for termination of contract, at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because he had been there <b>since</b> <b>day</b> one. He added, [...] " [...] carry a lot of history. Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future we see him making a determined effort to put his family back together. Whatever happens he'll always carry a torch for Kathy". According to Holden at that time, Pete was [...] "an untouchable", not in danger of being killed-off.|$|E
