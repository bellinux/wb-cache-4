50|$|Dolby Digital EX {{is similar}} in {{practice}} to Dolby's earlier Pro-Logic format, which utilized matrix technology to add a center <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> and single rear <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> to stereo soundtracks.

50|$|Dolby Stereo (1975) was {{the first}} {{standard}} cinema sound system using a single matrixed mono rear channel (note Disney's Fantasound from the 1930s used a <b>surround</b> <b>channel).</b> Dolby Surround (1982) {{was the first}} home audio system to use a rear channel. It and its successor, Dolby Pro Logic (1987), used a single rear <b>surround</b> <b>channel,</b> but often using two speakers connected in anti-phase or a dipole radiator, {{as shown in the}} speaker configuration diagram to the right in gray.|$|E
50|$|For music <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> {{information}} {{is intended to}} be more direct as in a soundstage there would be direct noise from all around and not ambience as in a movie setting. For this reason surround speakers should not be set up to be strictly diffuse. Optimally there should be discrete surround channels for diffuse and direct effects. This is part of the design for Tomlinson Holman's 10.2 surround sound. For movies <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> {{information is}} usually more diffuse ambient noise.|$|E

5000|$|... 7.1 {{sound is}} the common name for an eight-channel {{surround}} audio system commonly used in home theatre configurations. It adds two additional speakers to the more conventional six-channel (5.1) audio configuration. As with 5.1 surround sound, 7.1 surround sound positional audio uses the standard front, center, and LFE (subwoofer) speaker configuration. However, whereas a 5.1 surround sound system combines both <b>surround</b> and rear <b>channel</b> effects into two channels (commonly configured in home theatre set-ups as two rear surround speakers), a 7.1 surround system splits the <b>surround</b> and rear <b>channel</b> information into four distinct channels, in which sound effects are directed to left and right <b>surround</b> <b>channels,</b> plus two rear <b>surround</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... 5.1 {{dates back}} to 1976 when Dolby Labs {{modified}} the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on Todd-AO 70 mm film prints. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, Logan's Run) did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with Apocalypse Now. Instead of the five screen channels and one <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> of the Todd-AO format, Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> monophonically blended with the two surround channels.|$|E
50|$|Some {{surround}} sound {{systems such as}} Dolby Digital EX and Pro Logic IIx incorporate a third (back surround) or even fourth <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> (back left and back right). These channels are matrixed from the standard surround channels; they are not discrete.|$|E
50|$|It {{provides}} an economical and backwards-compatible means for 5.1 soundtracks {{to carry a}} sixth, center back <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> for improved localization of effects. The extra <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> is matrix encoded onto the discrete left surround and right surround channels of the 5.1 mix, much like the front center channel on Dolby Pro Logic encoded stereo soundtracks. The result can be played without loss of information on standard 5.1 systems, or played in 6.1 or 7.1 on systems with Surround EX decoding and added speakers.Dolby Digital Surround EX has since been used for the Star Wars prequels on the DVD versions and also the remastered original Star Wars trilogy. A number of DVDs have a Dolby Digital Surround EX audio option.|$|E

5000|$|Some matrix {{encoding}} {{surround sound}} systems use a single back center <b>channel</b> <b>surround</b> (Dolby Digital EX, Dolby Pro Logic IIx 6.1) or a back left and back right (Dolby Pro Logic IIx 7.1) speaker configuration.

Other commercial formats include the competing DVD-Audio (DVD-A) and Super Audio CD (SACD) formats, and MP3 Surround. Cinema 5.1 surround formats include Dolby Digital and DTS. Sony Dynamic Digital Sound (SDDS) is an 8 channel cinema configuration which features 5 independent audio channels across the front with two independent <b>surround</b> <b>channels,</b> and a Low-frequency effects <b>channel.</b> Traditional 7.1 <b>surround</b> speaker configuration introduces two additional rear speakers to the conventional 5.1 arrangement, {{for a total of}} four <b>surround</b> <b>channels</b> and three front channels, to create a more 360° sound field.|$|R

50|$|The first common soundtrack format was Dolby Pro Logic, a {{surround}} sound processing technology. This format contains a center channel and a <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> mixed {{into the left}} and right channels using a process called matrixing, providing a total of four channels. Receivers with Dolby Pro Logic decoders can separate out the center and surround channels from {{the left and right}} channels.|$|E
5000|$|To {{overcome}} this problem the cinema decoder uses so-called [...] "logic" [...] circuitry to improve the separation. The logic circuitry decides which speaker channel has the highest signal level and gives it priority, attenuating the signals fed to the adjacent channels. Because there already is complete separation between opposite channels {{there is no need}} to attenuate those, in effect the decoder switches between L and R priority and C and S priority. This places some limitations on mixing for Dolby Stereo and to ensure that sound mixers mixed soundtracks appropriately they would monitor the sound mix via a Dolby Stereo encoder and decoder in tandem. In addition to the logic circuitry the <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> is also fed via a delay, adjustable up to 100 ms to suit auditoria of differing sizes, to ensure that any leakage of program material intended for left or right speakers into the <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> is always heard first from the intended speaker. This exploits the [...] "Precedence effect" [...] to localize the sound to the intended direction.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Dolby debuted the 70mm [...] "Baby Boom" [...] {{format and}} used the same 70mm format as Todd-AO with a {{reconfiguration}} of its original six-track sound. The new setup utilized speakers left over from old 70mm Todd-AO engagements. There were three screen channels, one <b>surround</b> <b>channel</b> and two dedicated boom channels that utilized frequencies > 250 Hz. Encoding Dolby A-type NR (Noise Reduction) on prints meant {{that each of the}} six magnetic tracks had less tape hiss.|$|E
