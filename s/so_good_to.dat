500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come... I think of you always, my dear, because you are <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me..." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger, said the meetings themselves were very entertaining and allowed for good character development between April and Andy, and Ron and April. However, {{he said the}} main plot with Leslie and the historic mansion was not tied strongly enough to Leslie's fear that Mark and Ann would get married. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode, especially the callbacks to previous episodes and {{the interaction of the}} characters during the meetings. Although the show was only on hiatus for about a month, he said, [...] "Man, it feels <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have Parks and Recreation back. [...] I don't think there's another comedy on TV right now that contains such 'miss-able' characters." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> us {{that we should not}} be deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E
500|$|Townshend {{played a}} 1959 Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins hollow body guitar fed through an Edwards volume pedal to a Fender Bandmaster amp, {{all of which}} he had been given by Joe Walsh while in New York. This {{combination}} became his main electric guitar recording setup for subsequent albums. Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take. Overdubs, including an acoustic guitar part played by Townshend, were recorded at Olympic Studios at the end of April. The track was mixed at Island Studios by Johns on 28 May. After Lifehouse was abandoned as a project, Johns felt [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became Who's Next.|$|E

500|$|... "Breakout" [...] is a pop song lasting {{three minutes}} and twenty-six seconds. Written {{in the key}} of E major, it follows the chord {{progression}} G5—Dsus—Csus2—Dsus, beginning with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progressing to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer". In the view of Chris William of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Breakout"'s lyrics are [...] "a harangue against life's cruelest inequities", drawing attention to the opening verse, [...] "Every week's the same/Stuck in school's so lame/My parents say that I'm lazy/Getting up at 8 a.m.'s crazy/Tired of bein' told what to do/So unfair, so uncool," [...] though adding that the song {{was a sign that}} the [...] "little girl isn't growing up". However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said the song was indeed about growing up fast, referencing the lines [...] "It feels <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> let go" [...] and [...] "Wish it would never end" [...] and Jodi Rosen of Rolling Stone also believed [...] "she's venting the frustrations of a teen who's too grown-up to submit to her parents, teachers or anyone else" [...] with the lines [...] "tired of bein' told what to do".|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{the majority of}} his career signed to Sony, and later, Sony BMG, Arjona signed a long-term recording deal with Warner Music Latina. The deal was closed in September 2008. Iñigo Zabala, chairman of Warner Music Latin America commented that [...] "He's an artist that fits perfectly with our company," [...] and that [...] "We are a label that has a major catalog of songwriters and quality pop and rock from the likes of Maná, Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, and now, Arjona." [...] In an interview, the singer commented that while composing 5to Piso he [...] "tried to recoup some of the freshness" [...] of his past releases, stating that [...] "it makes <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the songs". He further stated that he believes [...] "all albums are result of an evolution, and contradictions either", also stating that he celebrated contradictions as part of life. Arjona begun working on the album as early as 2005. Talking about the process of recording the album, he stated that [...] "We must work to make the albums comfortable to us", further commenting that [...] "The rest is a matter of how good or bad the albums defend themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2000s, 44singles {{reached the}} number one {{position}} on the Christian Songs chart. MercyMe was the most successful group, with seven of their singles topping the chart during the 2000s.

500|$|... 5to Piso {{is mainly}} driven by piano and strings. Exceptions are [...] "La Bailarina Vecina", crafted with pure orchestral arrangements; and [...] "Ni Tú Ni Yo", a ranchera style song {{featuring}} Paquita la del Barrio. The album {{also includes a}} song called [...] "Que Nadie Vea", in which the artist sings about homosexuality. On 5to Piso, Arjona commented {{that he tried to}} recoup the freshness of his first albums, saying that he [...] "tried to reconcile a little with the Ricardo Arjona from the first albums to let out some of that freshness that makes <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the songs." [...] Poquita Ropa offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of a cappella performances. Arjona commented about this album that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes." [...] Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort", considering it [...] "impressive". He also commented that Poquita Ropa [...] "finds Arjona at his most naked, backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar, piano, and Hammond B-3 along with occasional touches of strings, woodwinds, and chorus vocals." ...|$|E
500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, you look <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After that we did it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field. And that's the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible.

500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will [...] "greatly enjoy this disc", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: [...] "It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although {{much has been made}} of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] music video. He concluded by stating that: [...] "Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout." [...] Beierle compared Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> the video releases of Mariah Carey. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as [...] "very slick and promotional". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez [...] "comes through energetically" [...] and without [...] "much star-ego". In the United States, Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 50,000 units.|$|E

A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars".
