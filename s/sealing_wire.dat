40|$|An {{investigation}} into the performance of two 22 mm diameter, 60 tonne tensile strength capacity Hilti cable bolts in shear was conducted using the double shear testing apparatus at the laboratory of the School of Civil, Mining and Environmental Engineering Faculty of Engineering and information sciences, University of Wollongong. The tested cable bolts were (a) Hilti 19 wire HTT-UXG plain strand and (b) Hilti 19 wire HTT-IXG spirally indented strand cable bolt, with indentation only {{on the surface of}} the outer strands. Both cable bolts were of <b>sealed</b> <b>wire</b> construction type, consisting of an outer 5. 5 mm diameter strand layer overlying the middle 3 mm diameter wire strands. Both layers are wrapped around a single solid 7 mm diameter strand wire core. The double shearing test was carried out in 40 MPa concrete blocks, contained in concrete moulds. The cable bolts were encapsulated in concrete using Minova/ Orica FB 400 pumpable grout. Prior to encapsulation, each cable bolt were pretensioned initially to 50 kN axial force. A 500 t capacity servo controlled compression testing machine was used for both tests, and during each test the vertical shear displacement was limited to 70 mm on travel. The rate of vertical shear displacement was maintained constant at 1 mm/min. The maximum shearing load achieved for the plain strand cable was 1024 KN, while the indented cable peak load was 904 kN, before the cable bolt strands began to individually snap, which lead to the cable bolt break up into two pieces.

Introduction: The materials {{necessary to the}} construction are â€“ 1. A glass specimen or test tube about three-fourths inch in diameter and three inches long; 2. A piece of platinum wire {{about two or three}} inches long; 3. A rod of pure zinc about two inches long; 4. Two six-inch pieces of copper wire; 5. Pure mercury; 6. mercurous sulphate; 7. zinc carbonate; 8. zinc sulphate; 9. fur odds and ends. In constructing the cell, first <b>seal</b> the platinum <b>wire</b> into the closed end of the specimen or test tube so that about one inch of it is within the tube. A piece of glass tubing of proper diameter and length may be used instead of the specimen or test tube, by closing one end in the blow pipe flame. In this case the platinum <b>wire</b> may be <b>sealed</b> in at the time of closing the end. This sealing in of the platinum wire may be avoided by using a piece of capillary tubing three inches long and <b>sealing</b> the <b>wire</b> into one end of it.

40|$|Brush seals {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in the latest turbine engines to reduce leakage and improve efficiency. However, the life of these seals is limited by wear. Studies have shown that optimal sealing characteristics for a brush seal occur before the interference fit between the brush and shaft is excessively worn. Research to develop improved tribopairs (brush and coating) with reduced wear and lower friction has been hindered {{by the lack of}} an accurate, low-cost, efficient test methodology. Estimated costs for evaluating a new material combination in an engine company seal test program are on the order of $ 100, 000. To address this need, the NASA Lewis Research Center designed, built, and validated a unique, innovative brush seal tuft tester that slides a single tuft of brush <b>seal</b> <b>wire</b> against a rotating shaft under controlled loads, speeds, and temperatures comparable to those in turbine engines. As an initial screening tool, the brush seal tuft tester can tribologicaly evaluate candidate seal materials for 1 / 10 th the cost of full-scale seal tests. Previous {{to the development of the}} brush seal tuft tester facility, most relevant tribological data had been obtained from full-scale seal tests conducted primarily to determine seal leakage characteristics. However, from a tribological point of view, these tests included the confounding effects of varying contact pressures, bristle flaring, high-temperature oxidation, and varying bristle contact angles. These confounding effects are overcome in tuft testing. The interface contact pressures can be either constant or varying depending on the tuft mounting device, and bristle wear can be measured optically with inscribed witness marks. In a recent cooperative program with a U. S. turbine engine manufacturer, five metallic wire candidates were tested against a plasma-sprayed Nichrome-bonded chrome carbide. The wire materials used during this collaboration were either nickel-chrome- or cobaltchrome-based superalloys. These tests corroborated full-scale seal test results and provided insight into previously untested combinations. As the cycle temperature for improved efficiency turbine engines increases, new brush seal materials combinations must be considered. Future brush seal tuft testing will include both metallic and ceramic bristles versus commercial and NASA-developed shaft coatings. The ultimate goal of this work is to expand the current data base so that seal designers can tailor brush seal materials to specific applications...|$|R

50|$|Cryogenic seals {{provide a}} {{mechanical}} containment mechanism for materials held at cryogenic temperatures, such as cryogenic fluids. Various techniques, including soldering and welding {{are available for}} creating seals; however, specialized materials and processes are necessary to hermetically entrap cryogenic constituents under vacuum-tight conditions.

40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry <b>seals</b> in <b>wire</b> harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operatorâ€™s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operatorsâ€™ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat shrink tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamberâ€™s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R
30|$|In this research, {{we propose}} a {{micromachining}} method {{to solve these}} problems. By using this technique, CNTs are firmly embedded into the Ni micro wire. Ni has been widely used as an adhesion wetting layer for the CNT field emitters due to its high adhesive strength and electrical conductivity [16]. Effective direct contact between CNTs and the metal substrate was achieved, which would be crucial for low contact resistance. Meanwhile, as the CNT tips were firmly buried into the substrate, there would hardly be any detachment of CNTs from the substrate induced by weak adhesion. By optimum geometric design, the micro wire shows excellent mechanical properties for planar supporting and large amplitude bending.
