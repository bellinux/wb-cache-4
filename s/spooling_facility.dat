5000|$|A <b>SPOOLing</b> <b>facility</b> for MFT II and MVT (which DOS/360 {{initially}} lacked, but was, later, {{provided by}} the POWER application).|$|E
50|$|GRASP was {{a systems}} {{software}} package that provided <b>spooling</b> <b>facilities</b> for the IBM/370 running DOS/VS or DOS/VSE environment, and IBM/360 running DOS or retrofitted with modified DOS.|$|R
50|$|POWER was an IBM {{operating}} system enhancement package that provided <b>spooling</b> <b>facilities</b> for the IBM System/360 running DOS/360 or retrofitted with modified DOS/360. Upgrades, POWER/VS and POWER/VSE {{were available for}} and the IBM System/370 running DOS/VS and DOS/VSE respectively. POWER is an acronym for Priority Output Writers, Execution processors and input Readers.|$|R
50|$|The Spooler was {{a systems}} {{software}} operating system package that provided <b>spooling</b> <b>facilities</b> for the IBM System/370 running DOS/VS, DOS/VSE environment, and IBM System/360 running DOS/360 or retrofitted with modified DOS/360, such as TCSC's EDOS. Other venders offering The Spooler {{as part of}} their OS were Amdahl, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Magnuson, and RCA.|$|R
50|$|The Job Entry Subsystem (JES) is a {{component}} of IBM's MVS (OS/VS2 R2 through z/OS) operating systems that receives jobs into the computer system, schedules them for processing, and controls their output processing. There is also a JES in OS/VS1, {{often referred to as}} JES1. While MVS/370's immediate predecessor, SVS, retained the <b>spooling</b> <b>facilities</b> of OS/360, most installations used the optional ASP Version 3 or HASP II Version 4, sometimes incorrectly referred to as HASP4; ASP V3 is available for OS/360 and HASP II V4 has been quite easily retrofitted to OS/360, even on systems which did not, and cannot support the System/370 instruction set (there are a very limited number of non-privileged S/370 instructions, and no privileged S/370 instructions, and each such instance can be replaced by a number of S/360 instructions which performs the equivalent function).|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the NASA/GE Highly-Loaded Turbine Research Program at the NASA Glenn Research Center is presented. The program {{is sponsored by the}} Subsonic Fixed Wing Project of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program. The goals of the turbine research program are presented along with their relationship to the higher-level program goals. Two turbine research programs are described; the highly-loaded, single-stage high pressure turbine (HPT) and the highly loaded low pressure turbine (LPT). The HPT program is centered on an extremely high pressure ratio single-stage turbine with an engine stage pressure ratio of 5. 5. It was designed with a 33 % increase in stage loading. It has shown performance levels 2 points better than current engines operating at the higher work level. Some advantages of the turbine include reduced weight and parts count. Optimization of the blade shape to reduce shock losses is described. The LPT program utilizes a four-stage low pressure turbine with an integral first stage vane/transition duct strut; counterrotation; low-solidity blading; fully optimized flowpath including vanes, blades, and endwalls; and a fluidically controlled turbine vane frame/exit guide vane. The implementation of the LPT into GE s and NASA s test facilities is described. A description of NASA s Single <b>Spool</b> Turbine <b>Facility</b> that is currently under renovation is given. The new, upgraded facility is compared to its predecessor. Renovation design requirements are outlined. Facility limits on pressures, temperatures, flow rates, rotational speeds, and power absorption are described. The current renovation status is given...|$|R
