5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able {{to grow in the}} absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender {{can be found on the}} higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath—primarily the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, but locally dominant are the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Other local heathland species at Ferndown Common include the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly (Plebejus argus), European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) and European stonechat. In the south-east of the site there are several small ponds, which support at least 14 species of dragonflies, most of which are heathland species. Also resident in the ponds are large populations of the widespread, although in decline, common frog (Rana temporaria) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus).|$|E

40|$|Many species require {{habitats}} {{that are}} naturally patchily-distributed and ephemeral, but human activities fundamentally alter the rate and scale of habitat change. This thesis describes {{the development of}} a new metapopulation simulation model applicable to a broad range of species that depend on dynamic habitat. I apply the model to two' case studies, both involving butterfly species that use early-successional habitats and that are UK BiodiversIty Action Plan priority species. I describe. two methods for parameterising the model for a particular metapopulation in a particular landscape. One method uses parallel disturbance ar:d population presence data for a few consecutive years; the other derives population parameters and landscape parameters from separate data sources. In the first case study, I found that the BAP target for Heath Fritillary (Melitaea athalia) populations in the Blean Woods, Kent, could either be met by approximately doubling the coppicing effort, or by concentrating the existing effort into one of the larger woodland blocks. In the second case study, I found that the rate of heathland burning in the South Stack area of Angl~seywas not enough by itself to sustain the metapopulation of <b>Silver-studded</b> <b>Blues</b> (Plebejus argus). However, the metapopulation is probably saved from extinction by the existence of permanently-suitable habitat close to the coast. I have also elucidated an important phenomenon in metapopulations with dynamic habitat: the relationship between patch occupancy and patch connectivity can be obscured by the temporal changes in habitat. This has important implications for the debate about whether many real populations actually fit the metapopulation paradigm because the existence of metapopulation dynamics is often determined by testing the connectivity-occupancy relationship. The simulation model, 'MANAGE', is an important new tool for integrating landscape-scale information, and answering conservation questions, in a field which is relatively new and unexplored.

50|$|The <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (Plebejus argus) is a {{butterfly}} {{in the family}} Lycaenidae. It occurs throughout thePalearctic ecozone.|$|E
50|$|The {{surrounding}} Horsford Forest {{has been}} designated a County Wildlife Site. The rare <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly has a colony in this forest.|$|E
50|$|Butterflies inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the long-tailed blue, European swallowtail, purple hairstreak, grayling, silver-washed fritillary, dark green fritillary, brown argus and <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dunes {{are also}} a {{valuable}} resource for wildlife, with many rare plants and insects including Cornwall's largest colony of the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> a Red Data Book species.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} 25 {{species of}} butterfly and 15 dragonfly and damselfly species, {{which include the}} nationally scarce varieties of <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (Plebejus argus) and blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio).|$|E
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} by the entomologist Charles Rothschild (1877-1923) as being of ecological importance. He was {{particularly interested in the}} site as the habitat of the large heath butterfly and the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Famous for its {{rare species}} and {{fascinating}} geology, South Stack Cliffs RSPB reserve helps to conserve the <b>Silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly Plebejus argus {{found on the}} reserve in Spring. The Spathulate fleawort, a small yellow flower, is only found here, in the whole World.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of two separate areas in Martlesham Heath and Purdis Heath. They contain heather heath and acid grassland, with clumps of bracken and gorse. This mosaic of habitats is valuable for butterflies. such as the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> common blue and small heath.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{butterflies}} {{that can be}} found on the coast include grayling (Hipparchia semele), <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (Plebejus argus), small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene) and wall (Lasiommata megera). There is also a day-flying moth, the thrift clearwing (Synansphecia muscaeformis); the adult is a bee mimic and the larva feed on thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
50|$|The heath {{is mainly}} heathers with {{a mosaic of}} heather and acidic {{grassland}} habitats. The <b>Silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly was reintroduced at the site in 2007. Bird species present include nightjar, woodlark and tree pipit with reptiles such as the common lizard and adder Vipera berus established on the site. There are also colonies of solitary bees and ant-lions.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{management}} provides {{open grassland}} and short sward conditions. With {{the use of}} innovative surface-scraping, the team management have re-recreated the conditions needed by the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly and the black ants with which it is associated. In April-May 2011, a conservation team from Weymouth spent six weeks snipping, sawing and burning up unwanted scrubby bushes at the nature reserve at Broadcroft Quarry {{in order to improve}} the habitats for butterflies and moths. The group also worked with a digger to scrape off the surface on part of the reserve to create the bare-ground habitat that the rare <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly needs to survive. The project was funded through the Awards for All strand of the Big Lottery. As a follow-up, Butterfly Conservation held a public event at Broadcroft Quarry over the first weekend of July to show visitors some of the butterflies and moths there.|$|E
50|$|It {{is also an}} {{important}} site for its insect fauna, especially Lepidoptera, with the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly sometimes counted in thousands. Twenty-seven species of butterfly and one hundred and seven species of moth have been recorded on the dunes. The exclusion of the public in the restricted military area of Penhale Camp has protected the nature conservation interest of this area.|$|E
50|$|Over 1000 {{species of}} Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) have been {{recorded}} at Minsmere. The 32 recorded butterfly species include the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> the Camberwell beauty and the Queen of Spain fritillary. In September 2004 the moth species Catocala conjuncta, previously unrecorded in Britain, {{was found on the}} reserve. To acknowledge its place of capture it was given the common name Minsmere crimson underwing.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} {{butterfly}} became extinct {{owing to the}} loss of habitat to scrub, notably the Adonis blue, <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> dingy skipper, and dark green fritillary. Others such as the chalkhill blue and small blue were at the brink of extinction, but are now flourishing again. Indeed, the hill has now probably the largest metapopulation of the small blue in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} land habitats, {{many of which}} are floristically rich, support a diverse and {{abundant}} invertebrate fauna, including the following Red Data Book species: the mud snail Lymnaea glabra, the bug Heterogaster artimisae and the hoverfly Microdon mutabilis. Nationally scarce butterflies including the pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria euphrosyne and <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> Plebejus argus, and the nationally scarce jewel beetle Trachys troglodytes alsooccur.|$|E
50|$|Some rare {{invertebrates}} {{inhabit the}} hill and its surrounding area. The scarce chaser (Libellula fulva), hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense) and downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) all {{make use of the}} ponds in the wetter areas of the heath, while the heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) {{can be found on the}} sandy areas among the heather along with the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly (Plebejus argus).|$|E
50|$|A nationally rare invertebrate, the weevil Anthonomus rufus, {{occurs on}} the cliffs and is {{associated}} with blackthorn the larvae almost certainly in the flower buds. Formerly widespread in coastal Britain, now localised.There are butterfly colonies of the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (Plebejus argus), small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene) on Cribba Head {{in the eastern part}} of the site as well as the thrift clearwing (Synansphecia muscaeformis) a day-flying moth.|$|E
50|$|Llysfaen located one {{kilometre}} (0.6 miles) inland, {{halfway between}} the coastal towns of Abergele and Colwyn Bay. Neighbouring villages include Old Colwyn, Llanddulas, Dolwen and Betws-yn-Rhos. To its immediate west is Mynydd Marian, a mountain known for its limestone grassland and the rare dwarf subspecies of the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly. Llysfaen also holds spectacular views, overlooking the Irish sea, as well as Kinmel Bay, Rhyl, and the Clwydian Range.|$|E
50|$|Many insect {{species can}} be found at North Warren, with large numbers of {{dragonfly}} and butterfly in summer months (northern hemisphere), including the nationally rare <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue.</b> In 2007, an invasive insect pest, the wheat bug Nysius huttoni, was found at North Warren {{for the first time in}} the UK. Originally from New Zealand the insect feeds on weeds and crop plants and has since been found at other sites in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Ludshott Common, {{adjoining}} {{the eastern}} and southern boundary of the village, {{is one of the}} largest remaining areas of heathland in East Hampshire. A National Trust property, it covers 285 ha (705 acres) and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the number of endangered species, including woodlark, nightjar and Dartford warbler. There is also a great variety of spider and butterfly species, including the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> grayling and green hairstreak.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the area}} falls within the Gwithian to Mexico Towans SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), noted for both its {{geological}} and biological interest. Two areas of the site are also Local Nature Reserves. Upton Towans {{is owned by the}} Cornwall Wildlife Trust. It is a habitat of sand dune and grassland is suited to a variety of wildlife and plants including the pyramidal orchid, glow worm, <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, and skylark. Species in Gwithian Towans Local Nature Reserve include skylarks and adders.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} {{interest on the}} heath are its reptiles - all six native British reptile species {{are found in the}} dry areas of the heath: the adder, grass snake, smooth snake, slowworm, viviparous lizard and sand lizard. Resident birds include the stonechat, nightjar and rare Dartford warbler. In addition, the boggy areas support many dragonfly species as well as carnivorous round-leaved sundew and raft spiders. Local butterflies including the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> and grayling. Amongst the rare flowering plants on the reserve are the marsh gentian and Dorset heath.|$|E
50|$|The reserve has around 500 {{species of}} {{butterflies}} and moths, including the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> and white admiral butterflies. Other invertebrate species include solitary bees and wasps, ant-lions and over 100 species of cranefly. Bird species number around 300, including bitterns and marsh harriers, whilst mammals found include otters and five species of deer. Natterjack toads have been re-introduced to the area. Flora {{found in the}} reserve include species such as marsh sowthistle, bog pimpernel, sneezewort, and greater bladderwort in the wetland areas. Heathland areas feature species such as fenugreek and mossy stonecrop.|$|E
50|$|St Catherine's Hill is a 53 m hill in {{the borough}} of Christchurch which, {{together}} with Ramsdown and Blackwater hills, forms a ridge between the Avon and Stour valleys. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest with some areas additionally designated as Special Protection Areas and/or Special Areas of Conservation. The hill provides a range of habitats with both wet and dry heathland, coniferous and broadleaf woodland and scrubland; and is home to some rare flora and fauna including the sand lizard, smooth snake, <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly and two types of carnivorous plant.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{supports}} a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain's 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the black darter, brilliant emerald and small red damselfly. It {{is also an}} important home for the golden-ringed dragonfly, which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest's 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being gorses and heathers.|$|E
50|$|The village {{also has}} a disused quarry which has become colonised by many {{interesting}} plants, moths and butterflies, including the dingy skipper and white-letter hairstreak: a small colony of the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> introduced from Prees Heath in the 1970s, may now have died out. The quarry was originally opened in 1927 to provide materials {{for the construction of}} the Mersey Tunnel; quarrying ceased in 1971 when the 39 acre were allowed to regenerate naturally. The area was designated a SSSI in 1989 and 26 acre were purchased in 1990 by the North Wales Wildlife Trust as a nature reserve.|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} twenty-four {{different}} species of butterfly {{to be seen in}} the reserve. Most notable is the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (seen in late June/early July), which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Some other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), a very strong population of the common blue (seen from May to September), while migrant species such as clouded yellow and painted lady have been seen in the area. Moth species include Portland ribbon wave, four-spotted moth, chalk carpet, beautiful gothic and valerian pug.|$|E
50|$|The {{headland}} is {{the habitat}} of several endangered species of butterflies and moths, including the silky wave, the <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue</b> (Plebejus argus subsp. caernesis) and the grayling (Hipparchia semele thyone) These last two {{have adapted to}} the Great Orme by appearing {{earlier in the year}} {{to take advantage of the}} limestone flowers and grasses. Also they are smaller than in other parts of the country and are recognised as a definite subspecies. The Great Orme is reported as the northernmost known habitat within Britain for several ‘southern’ species of spider notably: Segestria bavarica, Episinus truncatus, Micrargus laudatus, Drassyllus praeficus, Liocranum rupicola and Ozyptila scabricula.|$|E
50|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland.

5000|$|Today, Ludshott Common {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{remaining}} areas of heathland in East Hampshire. It lies parallel to and south of the B3002 road between Headley Down to the west and Grayshott to the east. It covers 285 ha and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA) due to the number of endangered species, including woodlark, nightjar and Dartford warbler. There are also a great many spiders and butterflies, including <b>silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> grayling and green hairstreak. [...] Adders, grass snakes and sand lizards also inhabit the common. Rabbits are widespread and roe deer may occasionally be seen. The most common trees are Scots pine and silver birch, with some oak.|$|E
50|$|As we {{walk in the}} Kalmthoutse Heide, we can notice some {{remarkable}} species, such as Smooth snake, Viviparous lizard and Crested newt, as well as Moor frog. Rare butterfly {{species are}} Green hairstreak, Grayling, <b>Silver-studded</b> <b>blue,</b> Chequered skipper and Clouded yellow. In nearby nature reserves, we can find even rarer species:Klein Schietveld: Grizzled skipper: {{one of the largest}} and last remaining populations of this species in Flanders.Groot Schietveld: Alcon blue: even threatened on European scale and ofcours very restricted in Flanders: only found in the north-east of Belgium. This species used to occur in the wet heathlands of the Kalmthoutse Heide, but because of the lack of larval foodplants, this species is now considered extinct, even though occasionally eggs are found.|$|E
