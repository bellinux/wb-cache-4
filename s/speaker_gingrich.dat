2500|$|Newt Gingrich, whose {{approval}} as Speaker, {{both in the}} Congress and in {{the public}} eye, had already greatly suffered due to his polarizing political style and a formal House reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the House losses by Republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. Facing the second major attempt in as many years by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as <b>Speaker,</b> <b>Gingrich</b> announced he would resign from Congress. Following Gingrich's announcement, Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston of Louisiana became the presumptive Speaker-elect until December 1998, when, during House debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, he admitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew his name from consideration as Speaker. Armey {{was out of the}} running after fending off a bruising challenge to his majority leader's post from Steve Largent of Oklahoma, and DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, appeared to have the inside track to the Speakership. However DeLay decided that he would be [...] "too nuclear" [...] to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. So instead DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations {{on both sides of the}} aisle. As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip.|$|E

[...] The first shutdown ended after Clinton agreed to the seven-year budget plan due to public surliness about the shutdown, and the prospect that a continuing resolution might be passed over his veto.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{voters in}} 1992 and 1996 had {{been willing to}} {{overlook}} long-standing rumors of extramarital affairs by Clinton, deeming them irrelevant. These matters came to a head, however, in February 1998 when reports surfaced of ongoing sexual relations between Clinton and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Clinton initially and vigorously denied the relationship; [...] "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." [...] His wife Hillary described the allegations as fraudulent smears dredged up by a [...] "vast right-wing conspiracy." [...] Clinton was forced to retract his assertions in August 1998 after the Lewinsky matter came under investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Clinton was impeached in the United States House of Representatives, but acquitted at his trial by the U.S. Senate. A public backlash forced <b>Speaker</b> <b>Gingrich</b> to resign after a poor showing in the 1998 midterm elections.

5000|$|The {{roles of}} the parties {{reversed}} in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the [...] "Contract with America", an idea spearheaded by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. <b>Speaker</b> <b>Gingrich</b> would regularly clash with Democratic President Bill Clinton, leading to the United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as Speaker. His successor, Dennis Hastert, had been chosen as a compromise candidate, since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial. Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary Speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and President George W. Bush. The Republicans {{came out of the}} 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001-2002 and 2003-2007 were the first times since 1953-1955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001-2003 as Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51-49 majority.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the Republican sweep in November 1994 ushered in {{an uncertain future}} for the policy agenda of black Americans. As a minority party, Republicans were regarded as not particularly receptive to black interests and showed early signs of amplifying that view upon their ascension into the majority. In the House, <b>Speaker</b> <b>Gingrich</b> ordered elimination of funding for all caucuses-or Legislative Service Organizations-of which the black caucus was the largest, oldest, and most influential. Suddenly, black members of Congress found themselves without the caucus that had afforded them so much power over policy in previous years, on issues from Haiti to housing. Although the decision was framed in terms of fiscal austerity, the political implication was clear. This suspicion seemed confirmed by the initial flurry of votes. As the black caucus and others have argued, much of the Contract with America especially cuts in social spending and a general reduction in governmental power-seems against the policy interests of black Americans. However, there is much left unanswered from this cursory look at these broad notions – and this thesis will examine these unanswered questions.
