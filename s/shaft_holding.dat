40|$|Dynamics of huge renovated lathe is simulated. Turning scheme {{concerns}} to heavy rotor shaft finishing. Lofty parts and milling head may create dynamic problems. Static, modal and harmonic {{frequency response function}} simulations were provided. Bearing system consists of bed, support, tool, lunettes, tailstock. Headstock didn’t take part in <b>shaft</b> <b>holding.</b> Static and dynamic rigidities founded 3 – 4 times less for support than for shaft. Tool rigidity lessens from 186. 5 to 11. 9 N/µm for speeding from slow to near resonance turning. Twelve lathe eigenmodes were evaluated. Two eigenmodes are most dangerous. It is “shaft swinging on lunettes” (M 1, 26. 7 Hz) and “support pecking” (M 3, 54. 4 Hz). Bed has excessive flexibility due to through holes and lack of inner ribbing. Polymer concrete filling is moderately effective. Changing two-lunette (2 L) scheme to three-lunette (3 L) increases rigidity of shaft at 2. 09 times at statics but gives limited action in dynamics. Resonant peaks on frequency response function are lowered only at 1. 32 times for M 1, M 3. Effect of dynamic damping is revealed under condition of proximity middle lunette to lofty support. Support serves as tuned mass damper. Measures of machine tool reinforcement are simulated. Shaft swinging according to M 1 may hardly be blocked by passive means. It {{would be better to}} bypass it. “Support pecking” resonance (M 3) succumbs to only full set of measures. Small effect of partial reinforcement is predicted. Three frequency intervals are recommended for turn-milling at huge lathe: pre-resonant ( 65 Hz). The last one is more suited. Next design step is to create triangle inner ribbing system or caissons inside of bed. </p...|$|E

25|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, the shafts of {{mattocks}} are often {{fitted with a}} screw below the head and parallel with it to secure the head from slipping down the shaft, but in the western United States, where tools are more commonly dismantled for transport, this is rarely done.

The head end of the shaft is tapered outwards, and the oval opening of the iron head is similarly tapered so that the head will not fly off when used. The mattock head ought never be raised higher than the user's hands, {{so that it will}} not slide down and hit the user's hands.

It is imperative to have a dynamic system to measure the range of motion which will aid for a progressive therapeutic treatment. Hence in the present study, a novel goniometer for real time dynamic angle measurement between two surfaces {{with the aid of a}} Fiber Bragg Grating sensor is proposed. The angular rotation between the two surfaces will be identified by the two arms of the Fiber Bragg Grating Goniometer (FBGG), which is translated to the rotation of the <b>shaft</b> which <b>holds</b> these arms together.

Further, the proposed FBGG facilitates tunable sensitivity by the discs of varying diameters on the rotating shaft. Tunable sensitivity of the FBGG is realised by the movement of these discs by varying circumferential arc lengths for the same angular movement, which will actuate the pull on the cantilever beam.

It represented a woman, still young. To judge by her costume and the mellow unity which reigned over the canvas, she had long been dead; to judge by the vivacity of the attitude, the eyes and the features, I might have been beholding in a mirror the image of life. Her figure was very slim and strong, and of a just proportion; red tresses lay like a crown over her brow; her eyes, of a very golden brown, held mine with a look; and her face, which was perfectly shaped, was yet marred by a cruel, sullen, and sensual expression. Something in both face and figure, something exquisitely intangible, like the echo of an echo, suggested the features and bearing of my guide; and I stood a while unpleasantly attracted and wondering at the oddity of the resemblance.

It has been reported that centrifugal technique is very useful for production of functionally graded porous membranes for gas permeable applications. Studies on different centrifugal casting machine design suggest that the centrifugal casting machine consists of a high speed motor (capable of rotating at high speed greater than 12000 rpm) equipped with a suitable sample holder capable of rotation around the same axis of the motor.

5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line <b>shafts,</b> and collars <b>holding</b> the <b>shafts</b> from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|R
6000|$|... § XIX. I {{have not}} in this chapter spoken {{at all of the}} {{profiles}} which are given in Northern architecture to the projections of the lower members of the base, b and c in Fig. II., nor of the methods in which both these, and the rolls of the mouldings in Plate X., are decorated, especially in Roman architecture, with superadded chain work or chasing of various patterns. Of the first I have not spoken, because I shall have no occasion to allude to them in the following essay; nor of the second, because I consider them barbarisms. Decorated rolls and decorated ogee profiles, such, for instance, as the base of the Arc de l'Etoile at Paris, are among the richest and farthest refinements of decorative appliances; and they ought always to be reserved for jambs, cornices, and archivolts: if you begin with them in the base, you have no power of refining your decorations as you ascend, and, which is still worse, you put your most delicate work on the jutting portions of the foundation,--the very portions which are most exposed to abrasion. The best expression of a base is that of stern endurance,--the look of being able to bear roughing; or, if the whole building is so delicate that no one can be expected to treat even its base with unkindness,[80] then at least the expression of quiet, prefatory simplicity. The angle spur may receive such decoration as we have seen, because {{it is one of the}} most important features in the whole building; and the eye is always so attracted to it that it cannot be in rich architecture left altogether blank; the eye is stayed upon it by its position, but glides, and ought to glide, along the basic rolls to take measurement of their length: and even with all this added fitness, the ornament of the basic spur is best, in the long run, when it is boldest and simplest. The base above described, § XVIII., as the most beautiful I ever saw, was not for that reason the best I ever saw: beautiful in its place, in a quiet corner of a Baptistery sheeted with jasper and alabaster, it would have been utterly wrong, nay, even offensive, if used in sterner work, or repeated along a whole colonnade. The base No. 10 of Plate XII. is the richest with which I was ever perfectly satisfied for general service; and the basic spurs of the building which I have named as the best Gothic monument in the world (p. 141), have no ornament upon them whatever. The adaptation, therefore, of rich cornice and roll mouldings to the level and ordinary lines of bases, whether of walls or <b>shafts,</b> I <b>hold</b> to be one of the worst barbarisms which the Roman and Renaissance architects ever committed; and that nothing can afterwards redeem the effeminacy and vulgarity of the buildings in which it prominently takes place.|$|R

The conclusions from this testing are: (1) The filter flux at 0. 06 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 26 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (6. 25 gpm total). (2) The filter flux at 0. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 17 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (4 gpm total). (3) The filter flux at 1. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 10 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (2. 4 gpm total). (4) Because of differences in solids loadings, a direct comparison between crossflow filter flux and rotary filter flux is not possible. The data show the rotary filter produces a higher flux than the crossflow filter, but the improvement is not as large as seen in previous testing. (5) Filtrate turbidity measured < 4 NTU in all samples collected.
