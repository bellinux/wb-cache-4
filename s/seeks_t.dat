The resources traded include physical resources such as bandwidth, processor cycles, storage, I/O devices or sensors as well as higherlevel services such as file storage, name service, database or web service. Prices reflect a balance between supply and demand for a resource while the budgets assigned to client processes determine their priority in gaining QoS access to resources.

When extreme events occur at the interface between natural and human systems, they are often called "disasters. " Here, we use a systemic, contextual view of disasters to construct a framework for organizing research and policy. Within this framework, reduction of vulnerability is the organizing principle, and decision processes (which lead to reduced vulnerability) are the fun-damental unit of analysis and action. Scientific research is connected to decision processes through knowledge-integrating activities such as prediction, observation, and heuristics. But the value of research depends on its capacity to enhance decision-making capabilities. Our goal is to define an approach by which policy-relevant research questions can be more readily recognized. and soci-etally valuable (i. e., vulnerability-reducing) knowledge can be more effectively created and used.

The last decade, however, has seen {{significant progress in}} vision technologies for human-computer interaction. Computer Vision IN THE INTERFACE Visual information is clearly important as people converse and interact with one another. Through the modality of vision, we can instantly determine a number of salient facts and features about others, including their location, identity, approximate age, focus of attention, facial expression, posture, gestures, and general activity. These visual cues affect the content and flow of conversation, and they impart contextual information different from, but related to, speech—for example, a gesture or facial expression may be a key signal, or the direction of gaze may disambiguate the object referred to in speech as “this” or the direction “over there. ” In other words, vision and speech are co-expressive and complementary channels in human-human interaction [6].

Most current literature examines China's voting behavior on peace operations in the UN Security Council. This thesis employs a research design that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the drivers behind China's personnel contributions to peace operations. Specifically, the thesis examines the factors that lead China to deploy large contingents of peacekeepers to some missions and smaller numbers or none to others. The thesis posits that China's personnel contributions will be higher in peace operations taking place in states that have a high strategic value to China. That is, the peace operation host state is important to China because of the presence of natural resources, Chinese investment, diplomatic interests, or a variety of other factors.

40|$|Astronomy, {{through both}} {{the allure of}} the sky and popular culture, enjoys {{significant}} penetration into the public and especially the young. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary character of the field makes it an ideal avenue for teaching basic scientific principles in a context that is both relevant to the subject and interesting to the learners. Nevertheless, communicating astronomy to the public presents certain significant challenges: (a) highly specialized scientific knowledge needs to be disseminated to an audience of a disperse scientific background, often without extended and/or uniform scientific education and skills; (b) the audience is widely dispersed in age, preferences and goals regarding their pursuit of astronomy knowledge; and (c) the audience, consisting mostly of volunteer adults, has a diverse daily time-schedule while scattered over a region considerably larger than a university campus. Most importantly, considering the amateur, sideline nature of public astronomy education, the whole educational procedure needs to be a leisure activity rather than formal learning. Thus in contemporary physical science and astronomy education, educational programs increasingly include problem-based learning and other small group instructional models, collaborative organizations to support student-faculty interactions, and technology-enhanced educational tools.

40|$|For decades, {{research}} in the field of European Studies adopted a ‘bottom-up’ perspective in analyzing Member State responses to Europeanization. The literature was mainly concerned with how to conceptualize and explain the effect of Member States on processes and outcomes of European integration. In the 1990 s, students of European integration became increasingly interested in how the Member States responded to the impact of European processes and institutions. The ‘top-down ’ literature has focused on the effect of the evolving European system of governance on the political institutions, policies, and political processes of the Member States. While most studies on the domestic impact of Europe emphasize that the relationship between the EU and its Member States is not a one-way street, they usually bracket European institutions and processes, i. e. take them as given and analyze their effects on the Member States. How Member States responses to Europeanization feed back into EU institutions and policy processes is rarely explored.

40|$|There is {{more than}} one price policy in a spatial market. Three main spatial price {{policies}} are: (1) uniform mill price under which the seller chooses a constant f. o. b. price and transportation costs are paid by consumers; (2) spatial price discrimination (hereafter, SPD) under which different and location-specific prices are selected over space; and (3) uniform delivered price policy (UDP) under which consumers at different market sites pay the same delivered price. Among these price polices, price discrimination is treated by antitrust authorities of many countries being illegal per se, but uniform mill price is often appealing because of “its imitation of the spatial structure of marginal costs ” (Hobbs, 1986). Perhaps because of this, much efforts in the literature has been devoted to the socially superiority of SPD as compared with uniform mill price. 1 The main conclusion hereupon is that in some cases, SPD is socially preferable as compared with uniform mill price. This implies that as compared with uniform mill price, the social superiority of SPD is model specific. Uniform delivered pricing is also appealing as compared with SPD, and often tolerated by antitrust authorities. But there is a paucity of research that <b>seeks</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E

We present one viewpoint on computer assisted proofs, or what we call proofs via the computational method [13]. While one might expect pure mathematicians {{to be a bit}} leery of the computational method, one would hope that computer scientists would be more receptive. After all, in seems contradictory for computer scientists not to believe in algorithms. In the author's experience, this has not been the case. The comment one often hears is 't you nd a better proof"? One of the arguments given against the computational method is that a computer assisted proof cannot possibly be elegant. We question this argument here. It is important that we dene precisely what we mean by the computational method. In the computational method we <b>seek</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} in India has been looked into with a view which has been narrow in its expanse, often missing out on many social categories which had a relatively limited, yet important, presence in colonial India. Sufficient {{attention has been paid}} to the official policies of the British Indian government (starting from Macaulay’s Minute). However, a critical analysis of it is assumed to be provided by the nationalist discourse, which is popularly perceived as almost an antithesis of colonial education. In the entire process, the discussion on education broadly gets limited to two sections – the ruler and the ruled, thereby eschewing the diversity within the realm of those seeking and providing education. In this paper, an attempt will be made to understand the emerging importance of ‘Europeans and Eurasians ’ as a social category with a peculiar position in colonial India. Though technically part of the ruling ‘race’, their economic standing was not always congruent with their assumed racial superiority. Termed as ‘poor whites ’ their presence in India posed challenges to the British government especially after the 1857 mutiny. Employed in the ‘communication network ’ of the British Raj, their presence in postal, railways and telegraph departments was imperative for its successful working.

40|$|With {{vast amounts}} of {{financial}} and intellectual capital already being spent on international harmonization, inefficiencies infecting the lawmaking process render it ineffective and threaten the goodwill of the whole enterprise. This paper represents a synthesis {{of some of the}} most meaningful criticism about the perceived failures of the classic vehicle for harmonization—international conventions. In it, we have highlighted these failures, looked for their underlying causes, and searched for compelling soft law alternatives. This paper seeks to show that, above all, conventions suffer from over ambition. By intervening in the legal marketplace, underestimating national distrust and legal conflict, and insisting on uniformity, conventions create a rigid enterprise that simply tries to do too much. Soft law, on the other hand, embraces the organic emergence of law from practice, in which best solutions rise to the top. In doing so, soft law creates rules as they “should ” be, while conventions create rules as they “must ” be—the fragmentary result of compromised consensus. It would be a misconception to envisage a future of harmonization and unification of commercial law solely driven by the market operators and loosely framed by soft law instruments. However, it would be a similar misconception to envisage a future in which conventions operated on a business-as-usual basis.

40|$|New School University), is to date {{still the}} only internationally {{recognized}} work by a Filipino {{in the field of}} economic methodology, an important area in economics representing an application of the philosophy of science to economics, typically utilizing parts of the history of economic thought as material. The author’s overlapping competencies (in both economics and philosophy) place him in a favored position to work in a difficult field where only few practicing economists feel themselves qualified. The present volume addresses the current and controversial issue dealing with the peculiarities of economic science, whose actual practice (notwithstanding the discipline’s arithmetization) is well known as failing to conform with the textbook standard of scientific practice laid down by the natural sciences (particularly physics), a standard to which economic practitioners aspired until well into the past century. 1 The problem the book asks is whether and how it is possible to measure advance in economics. As a major result of the process, the author must indirectly lay down normative rules for the valid (or progressive) pursuit of economics as a discipline. Ochangco advances his thesis (in Part One of the book) mainly through a description of the praxis followed by major writers in economics (i. e., running successively through Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Walras and Jevons, and Marshall) as they discussed the theory of value.
