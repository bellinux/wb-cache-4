5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage survived a bite from the spider.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{is similar}} in age to Cerro Azul and Descabezado Grande, and its eruptions may {{correspond}} to past activity at both volcanoes. Eruption products of very similar composition (including mafic andesite, agglutinates, and dacite) make up the volcanoes. There is also a <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> size (all are between 40 and 70 cubic kilometers in volume).|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the general <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} by historians that 168, 170 and 172 Denmark Hill {{were designed by}} noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> architectural style to his other buildings. However, as the original documentation relating {{to the construction of}} these houses has been lost or destroyed, it has proved impossible to confirm this.|$|E

5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters. Whether the three species are truly closely related needs to be determined using molecular data.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1900, the <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> {{shape of}} the shell of Amphidromus to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists.

The authors note that especially higher degrees – from the fourth to the seventh – show formal similarities, while the seventh degree also reveals <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> contents.

5|$|After {{having been}} {{unconscious}} {{for over a}} week, Makoto awakens in the hospital to find Yukari, who explains their <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> having both lost parents during the accident in the past. The next day Ikutsuki, Akihiko and Mitsuru recruit Makoto to the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad—SEES to help them fight the Shadow creatures responsible for the Apathy Syndrome by preying on humans during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon. Not long after as Junpei also joins SEES, Akihiko deduces that they have enough members to begin exploring their school's Dark Hour form, a Shadow-infested labyrinth called Tartarus, where they hope to unearth {{the mystery of the}} Dark Hour. Makoto also befriends Fuka Yamagishi (Mamiko Noto) and learns of her strained relationship with class bully, Natsuki Moriyama (Yuka Komatsu).|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. <b>Similarity</b> <b>in</b> dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
