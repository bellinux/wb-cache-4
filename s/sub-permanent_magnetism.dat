40|$|The ship-magnetism-stabilization in the training-vessels, the Kagoshima-maru and the Keiten-maru was {{put under}} researching investigations, using, as the researching data, the yearly {{fluctuation}} {{of the permanent}} magnetism recorded on board the above mentioned two vessels, in the magnetic equator during the period covering 4 ~ 6 years, beginning 1961, with the following items ascertained. 1) It may be affirmed that, at present, the <b>sub-permanent</b> <b>magnetism</b> of the Kagoshima-maru {{has been reduced to}} naught; while the permanent magnetism has been stabilized. 2) On the magnetizings of the permanent magnetissm of the Keiten-maru, the one belonging to the deviation co-efficient (B) seems to be almost completely stabilized; but the one belonging to the deviation co-efficient (C) seems to be more or less unstable. 3) This {{may be due to the}} remodelings and repairs given to the vesseles, but minuter investigations will be necessary before further clarification will be brought forth on this phenomenon...|$|E
