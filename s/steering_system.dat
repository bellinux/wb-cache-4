5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata {{until the beginning of}} the war, when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> developed by BI was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} steering. The <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> was set up so that gentle turns used just the {{steerable}} front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b> The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E

5|$|The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC.

The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station.

5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking power <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing car while behind the safety car, while the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose to tail in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am to the No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E

25|$|The {{system is}} fully regenerative, {{all of the}} engine's power reaches the track either through the main {{driveshaft}} or the <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> none of the energy is being lost to brakes or clutches. Additionally, since power is fed around the transmission to the <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> in some designs the tank can be turned even when the main gearbox is not engaged.

Simulations with these models on carefully selected scenarios where RCF is predicted with a conventional vehicle are carried out in order to evaluate {{the potential benefits of}} using active <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> for the mitigation of RCF, showing that in some situations, low-bandwidth active <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> are effective in reducing the propensity to generate RCF, whereas for other running conditions, higher bandwidths are required...|$|R

With this ever increasing complexity, relying only on physical testing is no longer practical due to slow feedback loops from testing back to development {{and the lack of}} repeatability.

25|$|The {{simplest}} single-engine <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> {{in mechanical}} terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was {{the combination of}} a brake and a clutch connected to steering controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the clutch, releasing that track and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to that track, allowing the turning circle to be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|As {{the desired}} angle is approached, {{the front wheel}} must usually be steered into the turn to {{maintain}} that angle or the bike will continue to lean with gravity, increasing in rate, until the side contacts the ground. This process often requires little or no physical effort, because the geometry of the <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> of most bikes is designed {{in such a way}} that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean.|$|E
25|$|Differential braking (or braked differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|E

40|$|The {{variance}} and passivity constrained {{fuzzy control}} {{problem for the}} nonlinear ship <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> with state multiplicative noises is investigated. The continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is used to represent the nonlinear ship <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> with state multiplicative noises.

By solving the corresponding linear matrix inequality conditions, a parallel distributed compensation based fuzzy controller can be obtained to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear ship <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> subject to variance and passivity performance constraints.
