40|$|This study extends Ertimur et al. (2003) and Jegadeesh and Livnat (2006 a) by {{providing}} a contextual framework for the information content of revenue and earnings <b>surprises.</b> I find that the influence of earnings <b>surprises</b> (revenue <b>surprises)</b> on stock returns is lower (higher) in R&D intensive companies. Also, market reaction to earnings <b>surprises</b> is lower in the fourth quarter, and to revenue <b>surprises</b> it is higher in industries with oligopolistic competition. A comprehensive analysis indicates that, in contrast to previous studies for the full sample, in several contexts market reaction to earnings <b>surprises</b> is not higher than to revenue <b>surprises.</b> Copyright (c) 2008 The Author Journal compilation (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} that trends in firm-level earnings <b>surprises</b> predict returns. This finding demonstrates that consistency within {{the sign of}} multiple prior quarterly earnings <b>surprises</b> is important for future returns. The return predictability of trends remains after controlling for the relatively large earnings <b>surprises</b> that define post-earnings announcement drift. Furthermore, these large earnings <b>surprises</b> exert a stronger influence on future returns when they occur within trends. The return predictability of trends is not attributable to consecutive earnings <b>surprises</b> with the same sign nor the autocorrelation in earnings <b>surprises.</b> Instead, as hypothesized by Rabin 2 ̆ 7 s (2002) theory, investors underreact to trends...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{earnings}} <b>surprises</b> on changes in information asymmetry. We hypothesize and find that asymmetry is lower (higher) in the quarter following positive (negative) earnings <b>surprises</b> compared to firms that meet the consensus analyst earnings forecast. The relations between earnings <b>surprises</b> and information asymmetry are stronger when the <b>surprises</b> are more likely to capture investors' attention. Examining the source of these changes, we show that decreased information search activities is the most important factor for asymmetry declining after positive surprises; for negative <b>surprises,</b> decreased uninformed trading plays a dominant role increasing asymmetry.

5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and <b>surprise</b> to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of <b>surprise</b> to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of <b>surprise</b> had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{documents the}} existence of two distinct post-earnings-announcement-drifts. Interestingly, investors seem to underreact more toward analyst-based earnings <b>surprises</b> than toward seasonal random walk earnings <b>surprises.</b> In this paper, we measure the extent of investors’ delayed reaction relative to the total market response to the earnings <b>surprises.</b> Using this measure, we find that investors react proportionately faster and more thoroughly to analyst-based earnings <b>surprises</b> than to random walk earnings <b>surprises,</b> suggesting that analyst-based earnings <b>surprises</b> are relatively less related with a delayed investor reaction compared with random walk earnings <b>surprises.</b> We also find that as the informativeness of analyst earnings forecasts increases, investors’ response to earnings <b>surprises</b> increases more in instant form than in delayed form. In contrast, as the informativeness of random walk earnings expectations increases, investors’ delayed response increases more than their instant response. Finally, we find that investors’ faster and more thorough response to analyst-based earnings <b>surprises</b> increases {{in the quality of}} the firms’ information environment. Our results complement existing research findings by utilizing a relative PEAD measure and provide a greater understanding toward the interpretation of both drifts...|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} examines whether trait anxiety {{is associated with}} negative interpretation bias when resolving valence ambiguity of <b>surprised</b> faces. To further isolate the neuro-cognitive mechanism, we presented angry, happy, and <b>surprised</b> faces at broad, high, and low spatial frequency and asked participants to determine the valence of each face. High trait anxiety was associated with more negative interpretations of broad spatial frequency (i. e., intact) <b>surprised</b> faces. However, the modulation of trait anxiety on the negative interpretation of <b>surprised</b> faces disappeared at high and low spatial frequencies. The current study provides evidence that trait anxiety modulates negative interpretations of broad spatial frequency <b>surprised</b> faces. However, the negative interpretation of low spatial frequency <b>surprised</b> faces {{appears to be a}} robust default response that occurs regardless of individual differences in trait anxiety...|$|R
