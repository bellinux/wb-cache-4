40|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} {{to characterize the}} elastic modulus of wood and those currently using the natural frequencies of vibration stand out as they are non-destructive techniques, producing results that can be repeated and compared over time. This study reports {{on the effectiveness of}} the testing methods based on the natural frequencies of vibration versus static bending to obtain the elastic properties of reforested structural wood components usually employed in civil construction. The following components were evaluated: 24 beams of Eucalyptus sp. with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 60 x 2. 000 mm) and 14 beams of Pinus oocarpa with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (45 x 90 x 2. 300 mm) both without treatment; 30 boards with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 240 x 2. 010 mm) and 30 boards with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> (40 x 240 x 3. 050 mm), both of Pinus oocarpa and with chromate copper arsenate (CCA) preservative treatment. The results obtained in thiswork show good correlation when compared to the results obtained by the static bending mechanical method, especially when applying the natural frequency of longitudinal vibration. The use of longitudinal frequency was reliable and practical, therefore recommended for determining the modulus of elasticity of wood structural elements. It was also found that no specific support is needed for the specimens using the longitudinal frequency, as well as no previous calibrations, reducing the execution time and enabling to test many samples...|$|R

40|$|In design practice, {{in most of}} cases, {{stresses}} and deformations of structures with <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> and average material properties were analyzed. It have been concluded that such procedure is most often sufficient. However, there are design solutions, especially in high-effort structures for example aircraft and turbine engines, where scatter of geometrical dimensions consistent with assumed tolerances cause significant scatter of {{stresses and}} strains, differ from values coming from <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Scatter of these values have essential influence on service life of presented structures. Example of such effect is described in the paper. There were used FEM analyses to determination of scatter of stresses and stress concentration coefficient in herringbone lock joint of K- 15 engine’s turbine. Another example of fault impact on stresses in structure is analysis of undercarriage element with material fault. Both these examples indicate on great sensitivity of stress distribution on manufacturing imperfections. The impact of these faults and imperfections reaches hundreds of percent, {{and in some cases}} could be serious menace of operating safety.

40|$|Issues of {{constraint}} management, {{the identification}} and solution of constraints, are critical to any CAD/CAE system seeking to combine component and assembly design. Physical contact between components and other engineering considerations create constraints on the relative position of the components, their <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and the tolerances on those dimensions. The number of such constraints can be large even for relatively simple assemblies. Specialized techniques are needed {{to account for the}} distinctive nature of these geometric constraints. ^ The constraint tools developed in this work address some of these challenges. The general approach is to: (1) Identify the constraining relationships among the assembly components; (2) derive algebraic expressions that properly express the effect of the identified constraints, and; (3) solve the resulting constraints with numerical approaches appropriate to the domain of interest. The incorporation of these techniques into a CAD environment allows the designer to assemble a set of parts in an intuitive and robust manner, have the assembly constraints extracted automatically including those that may involve unanticipated mating conditions, propagate changes in the component <b>nominal</b> <b>dimensions</b> to the entire assembly, specify desired clearances between parts and have those clearances automatically synthesized, and perform tolerance analysis on the assembly for a given component tolerance specification. ...|$|R

The aperture map and physical characteristics of the fractures reveal that the aperture map of the granite fracture has a higher spatial variability than the Vosges sandstone one. A conservative methylene blue aqueous solution was injected uniformly along the fracture inlets, and exited through free outlet boundaries. A series of images was recorded at known time intervals during each experiment. Breakthrough curves were subsequently determined at the fracture outlets and at different distances, using an image processing based on the attenuation law of Beer―Lambert. These curves were then interpreted using a stratified medium model that incorporates a permeability distribution {{to account for the}} fracture heterogeneity, and a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model, as well as the classical advection―dispersion equation (ADE). The stratified model provides generally satisfactory matches to the data, while the CTRW model captures the full evolution of the long tailing displayed by the breakthrough curves. The transport behavior is found to be non-Fickian, so that the ADE is not applicable. In both stratified and CTRW models, parameter values related to the aperture field spatial variability indicate that the granite fracture is more heterogeneous than the Vosges sandstone fracture...|$|R
