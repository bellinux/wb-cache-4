40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{presentation}} of the results that concerned the influence of morphology of eutectic <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> on mechanical properties, especially on the cleavage fracture toughness of AlSi 5 Cu 1 alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Microscopic studies – optical microscope NIKON 300 and quantitative analysis of geometrical parameters of microstructure – image analysis program APHELION, tensile and fracture toughness tests – testing machine INSTRON 8810. Findings: The sizes of <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> and values of yield strength, tensile strength and plane strain fracture toughness have been determined. Relationships between mechanical properties and <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> size were described using Hall-Petch equation. It was found that a decrease in <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> causes an increasing in strength and in fracture toughness. Practical implications: This paper is part of the previous author’s investigations which results in modification of the casting technology of turboblower compressor impellers. Originality/value: The microscopic observations indicated that alloy cracking begins with nucleation and growth of micro-cracks in the <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> of large size, in orthogonal plane to tension direction.

2500|$|Bengali-Indian {{physicist}} Jagadish Chandra Bose {{was first}} to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894. In 1901, Bose filed for a U.S. patent for [...] "A Device for Detecting Electrical Disturbances" [...] that mentioned {{the use of a}} galena crystal; this was granted in 1904, #755840. The device depended on the large variation of a semiconductor's conductance with temperature; today we would call his invention a bolometer. Bose's patent is frequently, but erroneously, cited as a type of rectifying detector. On August 30, 1906, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard filed a patent for a <b>silicon</b> <b>crystal</b> detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906. Pickard's detector was revolutionary in that he found that a fine pointed wire known as a [...] "cat's whisker", in delicate contact with a mineral, produced the best semiconductor effect (that of rectification).|$|E
2500|$|Indian {{scientist}} Jagadish Chandra Bose was {{the first}} to use a crystal for detecting radio waves in 1894. The crystal detector was developed into a practical device for wireless telegraphy by Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, who invented a <b>silicon</b> <b>crystal</b> detector in 1903 and received a patent for it on November 20, 1906. Other experimenters tried a variety of other substances, of which the most widely used was the mineral galena (lead sulfide). Other substances offered slightly better performance, but galena was most widely used because it had the advantage of being cheap and easy to obtain. The crystal detector in these early crystal radio sets consisted of an adjustable wire point-contact, often made of gold or platinum because of their incorrodible nature (the so-called [...] "cat's whisker"), which could be manually moved over the face of the crystal in search of a portion of that mineral with rectifying qualities. This troublesome device was superseded by thermionic diodes (vacuum tubes) by the 1920s, but after high purity semiconductor materials became available, the crystal detector returned to dominant use with the advent, in the 1950s, of inexpensive fixed-germanium diodes. Bell Labs also developed a germanium diode for microwave reception, and AT used these in their microwave towers that criss-crossed the United States starting in the late 1940s, carrying telephone and network television signals. Bell Labs did not develop a satisfactory thermionic diode for microwave reception.|$|E
2500|$|After being awarded her bachelor's {{degree in}} Mathematics in 1984, Hau {{continued}} {{to study at}} the University of Aarhus for her master's degree in Physics which was awarded two years later. For her doctoral studies in quantum theory Hau worked on ideas similar to those involved in fibre optic cables carrying light, but her work involved strings of atoms in a <b>silicon</b> <b>crystal</b> carrying electrons. While working towards her doctorate Hau spent seven months at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva. She received her doctorate from the University of Aarhus in Denmark in 1991, but by this time her research interests had changed direction. In 1991 she joined the Rowland Institute for Science at Cambridge, Massachusetts as a scientific staff member, beginning to explore the possibilities of slow light and cold atoms. In 1999, Hau accepted a two-year appointment as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. Her formalized training is in theoretical physics but her interest moved to experimental research {{in an effort to}} create a new form of matter known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. [...] "Hau applied to the National Science Foundation for funds to make a batch of this condensate but was rejected on the grounds that she was a theorist for whom such experiments would be too difficult to do." [...] Undeterred, she gained alternative funding, and {{became one of the first}} handful of physicists to create such a condensate. In September 1999 she was appointed the Gordon Mckay Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Physics at Harvard. She was also awarded tenure in 1999, and is now Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard. In 2001 she became the first person to stop light completely, using a Bose–Einstein condensate to achieve this. Since then she has produced copious research, and new experimental work, in electromagnetically induced transparency, various areas of quantum physics, photonics and contributed to the development of new quantum devices and novel nanoscale applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{strontium}} on the solidi. cation mode of hypereutectic aluminium-silicon alloys have been studied. Samples were prepared from an aluminium- 17 wt% silicon-based alloy and strontium was added at several different concentrations. The {{development of the}} microstructure was investigated by cooling curve analysis, interrupted solidi. cation experiments and optical and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that nucleation of primary silicon is suppressed by additions of strontium. The suppressed nucleation results in supersaturation of the liquid prior to nucleation, and an increased growth rate after nucleation. As a result, the <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> become less faceted and more dendritic with increasing strontium additions. Increasing the strontium concentration slightly refined the eutectic spacing and introduced {{a small amount of}} fibrous silicon. Electron back-scatter diffraction measurements were performed to determine the crystallographic relation between the primary and eutectic silicon phases. The eutectic silicon in the unmodified alloy does not have any crystallographic relationship with the primary <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals.</b> In contrast, the eutectic <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> in the strontium-modified alloys often share an identical or twin relationship with nearby primary <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals.</b> The incidence of twinning within primary <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> was relatively low and did not appear to increase with strontium additions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{possibility}} of magnetic-field-induced modification of structural defects in <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> is studied. It is shown that magnetic field action essentially affects the structure-dependent properties of Si (mechanical and electrophysical). Investigation {{of the magnetic}} field (MF) action on solids has recently attracted particular interest. A number of phenomena involving the effect of weak MF {{on a variety of}} physical processes in crystalline solids have been discovered [1 - 7]. In theoretical models, it is proposed to interpret the influence of MF on the crystals mainly by MF action on the formation and breakage of chemical bonds [8, 9]. A growing number of publications on this subject has resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} trend in the physics of plasticity – spin micromechanics – aimed at getting knowledge of the micromechanical spin-dependent processes affecting the mechanical properties of solids. As to the class of elementary semiconductor <b>crystals,</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>crystals</b> in particular, there are very few publications on the elucidation of the MF action on the mechanical properties of those crystals in the literature.
