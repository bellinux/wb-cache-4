5|$|In London, Gandhi studied law and {{jurisprudence}} {{and enrolled}} at the Inner Temple {{with the intention of}} becoming a barrister. His childhood <b>shyness</b> and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in London, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law.|$|E
5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} where he came to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the <b>shyness</b> and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political and social issues facing South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Padayappa is an {{engineer}} who {{returns to his}} village from Chennai to attend his sister's wedding. His sister is engaged to their maternal uncle's son Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and {{falls in love with}} her. However, <b>shyness</b> and fear of Neelambari, her landlady, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. In addition, Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoiled sister, who is madly in love with Padayappa.|$|E
5|$|She grew {{close to}} Strasberg {{and his wife}} Paula, {{receiving}} private lessons at their home due to her <b>shyness,</b> and soon became like a family member. She dismissed her old drama coach, Natasha Lytess, and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence {{for the rest of}} her career. Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.|$|E
5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and {{get along with}} horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that <b>shyness</b> {{be treated as a}} fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural <b>shyness</b> could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, Cassidy began {{singing and}} playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street. This band {{performed}} {{in a variety of}} styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her <b>shyness,</b> she struggled with performing in front of strangers. While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a member of this working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George's Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of <b>shyness</b> that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|He and {{his sister}} Maraea {{were born in the}} family's home in Waimea, which stood across the Waikōloa Stream from the {{residence}} of early American Protestant missionary Lorenzo Lyons who was a close friend of the family. Iaukea was given the first name Curtis after Lyons' son Curtis Jere Lyons. When he was later presented to King Kamehameha IV as a young child, the king gave him the additional name Piʻehu in respect of his <b>shyness</b> and lighter skin complexion. At court, he was known and referred to by his Hawaiian name Piʻehu.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was slowed by Hobbs' <b>shyness</b> and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it {{was reported in the}} press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The lesser kudu's <b>shyness</b> and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his <b>shyness</b> was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and <b>shyness</b> in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with <b>shyness</b> while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the <b>shyness</b> of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her <b>shyness,</b> she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} the tenor Steuart Wilson and his wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious <b>shyness</b> with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted {{for the rest of his}} life. The enmity it provoked in Wilson had repercussions in Boult's later career. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career but not Boult's: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of George VI in 1937.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame <b>shyness</b> to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive <b>shyness,</b> and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his <b>shyness</b> prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
5|$|From 1918, Burnet {{attended}} the University of Melbourne, {{where he lived}} in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and {{was influenced by the}} ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing <b>shyness,</b> Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted {{by the end of the}} war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her <b>shyness,</b> was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{cause of}} <b>shyness</b> varies. Scientists {{believe that they}} have located genetic data {{supporting}} the hypothesis that <b>shyness</b> is, at least, partially genetic. However, there is also evidence that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their <b>shyness.</b> This includes child abuse, particularly emotional abuse such as ridicule. <b>Shyness</b> can originate after a person has experienced a physical anxiety reaction; at other times, <b>shyness</b> seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. <b>Shyness</b> differs from social anxiety, which is a broader, often depression-related psychological condition including the experience of fear, apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing panic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shyness</b> {{can also}} be seen as an {{academic}} determinant. It has been determined that there is a negative relationship between <b>shyness</b> and classroom performance. As the <b>shyness</b> of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shyness</b> (also called diffidence) is {{the feeling}} of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness {{especially}} {{when a person is}} around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. <b>Shyness</b> can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem. Stronger forms of <b>shyness</b> are usually referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shyness</b> {{may come}} from genetic traits, the {{environment}} in which a person is raised and personal experiences. <b>Shyness</b> may be a personality trait or can occur at certain stages of development in children.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that no unique physiological response, {{such as an}} increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and <b>shyness</b> causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that <b>shyness</b> and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and <b>shyness</b> in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view <b>shyness</b> as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively {{as a threat to}} group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts <b>shyness</b> and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive <b>shyness</b> as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|After {{the prison}} experiment, Zimbardo {{decided to look}} for ways he could use {{psychology}} to help people; this led to the founding of The <b>Shyness</b> Clinic in Menlo Park, California, which treats shy behavior in adults and children. Zimbardo's research on <b>shyness</b> resulted in several bestselling books on the topic. Other subjects he has researched include mind control and cultic behavior.|$|E
25|$|Rather, {{according}} to {{professor of psychology}} Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts choose to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations. Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found <b>shyness</b> overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of <b>shyness</b> or introversion may reinforce a shy or introverted individual's low self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Emo {{has been}} {{associated}} with a stereotype of emotion, sensitivity, <b>shyness,</b> introversion or angst. Other stereotypes include depression, self-harm and suicide.|$|E
25|$|Aidos, in Greek mythology, was the daimona (goddess) of <b>shyness,</b> shame, and humility. She was {{the quality}} that {{restrained}} human beings from wrong.|$|E
25|$|Mistaking {{introversion}} for <b>shyness</b> is {{a common}} error. Introverts prefer solitary to social activities, but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do.|$|E
25|$|Out of <b>shyness,</b> {{she often}} wore large t-shirts {{to hide her}} body and would get fully dressed just {{to go to the}} trash-can while at the beach.|$|E
25|$|Females with FXS {{frequently}} display <b>shyness,</b> social {{anxiety and}} social avoidance or withdrawal. In addition, premutation in females {{has been found}} to be associated with social anxiety.|$|E
25|$|A Social anxiety spectrum. This {{has been}} defined to span <b>shyness</b> to social anxiety disorder, {{including}} typical and atypical presentations, isolated signs and symptoms, and elements of avoidant personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|No {{correlation}} (positive or negative) {{exists between}} intelligence and <b>shyness.</b> Research indicates that shy {{children have a}} harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and because they do not engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that <b>shyness</b> is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own <b>shyness,</b> more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.|$|E
