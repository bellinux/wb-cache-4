50|$|The Treasury {{discovered}} that these tallies {{could also be}} used to create money. When the crown had exhausted its current resources, it could use the tally receipts representing future tax payments due to the crown as a form of payment to its own creditors, who in turn could either collect the tax revenue directly from those assessed or use the same tally to pay their own taxes to the government. The tallies could also be sold to other parties in exchange for gold or silver coin at a discount reflecting the length of time remaining until the taxes was due for payment. Thus, the tallies became an accepted medium of exchange for some types of transactions and an accepted medium for store of value. Like the girobanks before it, the Treasury soon realized that it could also issue tallies that were not backed by any specific assessment of taxes. By doing so, the Treasury created new money that was backed by public trust and confidence in the monarchy rather than by <b>specific</b> <b>revenue</b> receipts.|$|E

The model shows that the certifier offers his service to sellers and buyers to maximize his own profit with a higher share from the sellers. Overall, certifiers increase welfare in <b>specific</b> markets. <b>Revenue</b> shifts due to the financial crisis are also explained. ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} {{directions}} {{and suggestions for}} future research. First of all, the proposed model can be easily extended to the case where more than two power plants exist with different environmental effects. Second, tax and subsidy may be incorporated in the prices of electricity, thus customers are persuaded to use green electricity owning to their competitive price. In this case, the demand functions should be changed appropriately. Moreover, {{we assume that the}} government reduces environmental impacts with regard to <b>specific</b> <b>revenue.</b> However, it is extremely appealing to investigate the effects of other objectives of the government such as revenue seeking behavior. Eventually, it would be very interesting, but challenging to consider the uncertainty on other model parameters such as electricity production costs or reservation utility of power plants.|$|E
40|$|Cross-border {{financial}} statements can confuse users of {{financial statements}}, therefore the development ofInternational Accounting Standards {{is important in}} the accounting profession. Comparing countries financial statements can be difficult because Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) vary in different countries. To illustrate the need for harmonization of accounting standards, this paper is divided into three research sections. The first section discusses the history, organizations, and conceptual framework of United States and Australian accounting professions. The second section compares and contrasts the similarities and differences between United States GAAP and Australian GAAP.

40|$|This paper simulates {{alternative}} {{distributions of}} general purpose state aid to local governments under {{different combinations of}} criteria: tax capacity, effort, and revenue needs. Revenue needs are based on Tobit estimates {{of the costs of}} providing average levels of 16 categories of services. Segmenting the sample into high and low population jurisdictions provided a more realistic set of cost estimates. Available revenues or capacity are determined by multiplying each jurisdiction's tax bases by standard tax rates. A Need-Capacity gap, the difference between needed revenues and available revenues, is used as a needs-based distribution strategy for general purpose aid. Finally an effort gap, based on above average tax efforts was added to the Need-Capacity gap to define a Need-Capacity-Effort strategy.
