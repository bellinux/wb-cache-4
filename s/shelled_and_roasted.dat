40|$|Increasing {{fuel and}} liquid gas prices make this energy source {{is no longer}} cheap. Therefore, it is {{necessary}} to create an alternative energy resource {{that can be used to}} replace the role of fuel and gas. Waste sawdust <b>and</b> coconut <b>shell</b> has a huge potential that can be used as raw material charcoal briquettes. The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of sawdust briquettes with the addition of coconut shell charcoal. To improve the quality of charcoal briquettes, the addition of coconut shell charcoal with a variation of 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 60 % of the weight of sawdust briquette charcoal. Authoring process is done by burning coconut <b>shells</b> directly <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> methods to sawdust. Adhesives are used as much as 50 %. The calorific value generated in sawdust briquettes with materials: coconut shell at a concentration of 100 % is 5622. 7769 cal/gram, a concentration of 80 : 20 % is 6504. 67785 cal/gram, the concentration of 70 : 30 % is 6624. 09305 cal/gram, the concentration of 60 : 40 % is 7017. 5178 cal/gram, a concentration of 50 : 50 % is 7288. 7523 cal/gram and 40 : 60 % is 7386. 4805 cal/gram. Overall, the quality of sawdust briquettes with palm shell charcoal is quite good, so it can be used as an alternative fue...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the percentage of rate, nutrient contents and physical properties of grinding <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> products of freshwater mussel shell. Fresh mussel samples were collected from four different lakes in West Sumatra: Maninjau, Singkarak, Danau Diatas and Danau Dibawah. The samples of about 3 kg each were processed to separate the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> their body content. The shells were then dried and processed to produce three different products: raw coarse ground, raw fine ground <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> fine ground. Parameters measured included: percent rate of meal, the content of DM, ash, Ca and P, and physical properties (angle of response, bulk and compacted bulk densities and specific density). The results showed that grinding <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> gave no significant effect on specific density and mineral content of the meal product. The rate of meal product and bulk density decreased, while angle of response and compacted bulk density increased significantly. It was concluded that both <b>roasting</b> <b>and</b> grinding could not improve both nutrient content and physical properties of freshwater mussel shell...|$|R

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> leaves from Morinda citrifolia L. intended {{to be used for}} the preparation of infusions. After cutting, the leaves of M. citrifolia are subjected to drying <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> steps. The steps are standard procedures commonly applied in food production and do not give rise to concern. Compositional data on various batches of dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves from French Polynesia have been provided. The information presented does not indicate detrimental nutritional effects to be expected from the consumption of tea infusions made from dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves. Under the applied analytical conditions none of the anthraquinones rubiadin, alizarin and lucidin could be detected in dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves (detection limits 0. 25, 0. 025 and 0. 4 mg/kg) and in infusions (detection limits 1. 04, 0. 1 and 1. 67 µg/l), respectively. 5, 15 -Dimethylmorindol, an anthraquinone previously isolated from the fruits of M. citrifolia, was shown to be present in dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves at concentrations ranging from 11. 3 to 42. 6 mg/kg.

40|$|A {{total of}} {{eighteen}} natural <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> hazelnut varieties (amongst which only Tombul variety {{is classified as}} prime quality), grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, were compared for their differences in descriptive sensory analysis (DSA), electronic nose (e-nose) data and chemometrics. Differences in some descriptive of DSA between natural <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> hazelnuts as well as within the varieties were observed. Although Tombul hazelnut was selected {{as one of the}} best varieties in terms of flavour attributes and received the highest intensities in general, no significant differences (P> 0. 05) existed among hazelnut varieties except in certain flavour attributes ('after taste' and 'nutty'). DSA and e-nose data of natural <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> hazelnuts were also evaluated for discrimination using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. Results of PCA using e-nose data showed that extracted principal components explained 99. 7 % and 99. 8 % of the total variance of the data for natural <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> hazelnut varieties, respectively.

40|$|Physico-chemical, {{proximate}} and nutritionally valuable minerals {{were determined}} aiming to compare raw <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> groundnut seeds. The {{results indicated that}} total ash content of raw groundnut (4. 6 %) was higher than the roasted groundnut (4. 1 %) seeds. Crude protein content of roasted groundnut was higher (26. 1 %) when {{compared to that of}} raw groundnut (24. 9 %). Crude carbohydrates levels of raw groundnut (25. 3 %) are lower when compared with that of roasted groundnut (26. 5 %). Crude fat ranged from 39. 1 % in raw groundnut to 39. 6 % in roasted groundnut. Crude fiber percentage both in raw (2. 9 %) <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> (3. 1 %) conditions were good. The moisture content of the raw groundnut (4. 1 %) was more than the roasted groundnut (3. 6 %) because of not exposure to heat. Seeds showed higher energy values both in raw <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> conditions. Significant amount of minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were present both in raw <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> conditions. Based on statistical analysis the results showed highly significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the raw <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> seeds...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} paper on poultry-feed nutrition. An eight week feeding trial involving 126 Nera breed laying hens {{in a completely}} randomized block design, was carried out to evaluate sun-dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> maggot meal as protein sources in laying chickens diet. The sun-dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> maggot meals incorporated in the diets at levels of 0, 50 and 100 percent, in replacement of equivalents of soyabean meal and soyabean plus fish meal. There were significant effects on some performance characteristics with increasing levels of sun-dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> maggot meal in the diets. Hen-day production was generally improved in the maggot-based diets but was higher in SMM diets than in RMM <b>and</b> control diets. <b>Shell</b> thickness <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> weight were significantly affected (p<. 05). Egg shell weight as percent of egg weight was higher (p< 0. 05) for chickens-fed RMM than sun-dried maggot meal [SMM] and control diets. Egg yolk, albumin and percentage of blood/meat sport were significantly affected (p< 0. 05) but did not follow a specific trend attributable to the diets. Cholesterol and content of egg yolk were significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) by maggot meal. Maggot meal also reduced cost/kg of egg, which was slightly higher for RMM than SMM diets. The use of maggot meal as the sole protein source in laying chickens' diet is possible without detrimental effect. The reduction of egg yolk cholesterol by maggot meal is of nutritional and health importance to consumers, therefore the use of maggot meal in laying hens should be encouraged...|$|R
