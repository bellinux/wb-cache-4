5000|$|Beer kegs {{are made}} of {{stainless}} steel, or less commonly, of aluminium. A keg has a single opening on one end, called a [...] "bung." [...] A tube called a [...] "spear" [...] extends from the opening to the other end. There is a <b>self-closing</b> <b>valve</b> that is opened by the coupling fitting which is attached when the keg is tapped. There is also an opening {{at the top of}} the spear that allows gas (usually carbon dioxide) to drive the beer out of the keg. The coupling fitting has one or two valves that control the flow of beer out of and gas into the keg. The keg must be in the upright position, that is, with the opening on top, for the beer to be dispensed. Kegs can be contrasted to casks, which have two or more openings and no spear. Most major breweries now use internally speared kegs.|$|E
40|$|The author {{provides}} a dejinition of mechatronics. He explains how mechanical engineering design must change {{to take full}} advantage of developments in microelectronics and illustrates this by three structural examples. He goes on to show by further examples how mechatronics strengthens an underlying trend in engineering he calls ‘the imitation of nature ’ with products which tend increasingly to resemble living creatures. THOMAS HAWKSLEY Thomas Hawksley was a distinguished Victorian engin-eer whose greatest memorial, perhaps, is Lake Vyrnwy, created to supply Liverpool with water, a project of which he was engineer-in-chief. He was President at dif-ferent times of both the Civils and the Mechanicals, in 1872 - 3 and 1876 - 7 respectively. Together with William (later Lord) Armstrong he invented a <b>self-closing</b> <b>valve</b> which shut when the velocity of water through it exceeded a set limit. Primarily a waterworks engineer, he was associated at some time with most major citie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The fuel {{injector}} acts a double role: {{it is the}} valve of the pump supplying fuel to the combustion chamber and the device spraying a supplied dose. As the valve it may operate as a self-opening or <b>self-closing</b> <b>valve,</b> depending on the pressure produced by the fuel pump, or the valve controlled by external signals. Techniques and diagnosis methods for {{fuel injector}}s depend on a fuel injector’s control system and construction details. For practical reasons the fuel injector is a sectional valve with a separated component called atomizer. Atomizers must be cooled. It is possible to cool with fuel or with external water- or oil-cooling system. In case of liquid-cooled fuel injectors, apart from malfunctions causes known from literature, decrease of the cooling efficiency may appear, as {{the effect of the}} penetration of fuel from injector to the cooling system of injector. There are no reports concerning detectability of fuel leakage into cooling liquid with known techniques and diagnosis methods of injection systems and fuel injectors. In the article there will be presented as follows: a connection of the atomizer and injector body as the place of fuel leakage into the cooling system, reasons for loss of leak tightness in connection of atomizer with the body of atomizer and methods applicable for the leak tightness analysis, mechanisms of injector’s malfunction caused by the loss of leak tightness. The analysis of applied and possible methods of injectors diagnosis in the aspect of identification of said leakiness will be carried out...|$|E
25|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of ideas coming into the market place to extend the options for openhole completions; for example, electronics can be used to actuate a self-opening or <b>self-closing</b> liner <b>valve.</b> This might be used in an openhole completion to improve clean-up, by bringing the well onto production from the toe-end for 100 days, then self-opening the heel-end. Inflow control devices and intelligent completions are also installed as openhole completions.|$|R

High pressure NMR spectroscopy is a most promising analytical tool for the study of these states at atomic resolution. High pressure quartz cells are difficult to handle, high quality sapphire {{high pressure}} cells are difficult to obtain commercially. In this work, we describe the use of high pressure ceramic cells produced from yttrium stabilized ZrO 2 that are capable of resisting pressures up to 200 MPa. Since the new cells should also be usable in the easily damageable cryoprobes a completely new autoclave for these cells has been constructed, including an improved method for pressure transmission, an integrated safety jacket, a displacement body, and a fast <b>self-closing</b> emergency <b>valve.</b> DF...|$|R
