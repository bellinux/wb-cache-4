40|$|The {{first in}} a planned series of heated {{jettison}} tests on the Centaur Standard <b>Shround</b> was conducted at NASA Plum Brook Station's Space Power Facility on November 19, 1973. The first 250 -second portion of the test sequence involved heating the shroud with a specially-built fixture {{designed to provide a}} simulation of the heating environment encountered by the shroud during its ascent through the earth's atmosphere. The two heater halves, which were mounted on a rail system, were then retracted. This was followed by the jettison of the two shroud halves into catch nets positioned at 90 deg to the heater rails. The condition which made this test unique compared to the planned subsequent tests was the location of the maximum thermal line at 32 deg from the shroud separation plane. Information on the test hardware, configuration, and sequence is presented. Shroud thermal and deflection data encountered during the heating portion of the test sequence is compared with free-skin design temperatures in various graphical formats...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{and laser}} {{measurement}} {{results are presented}} for a transonic centrifugal compressor stage, equipped with a backswept rotor designed for 586 m/s tip speed and a mean relative inlet tip Mach number of 1. 30. The flow field features of the rotor are analysed in detail {{with the help of}} laser measurements and the results obtained from a 3 D viscous calculation. Both laser measurements and calculations are carried out for the impeller's design point and a comparison between measured and calculated data is presented for four measurement planes representing the inlet, exit and channel flow conditions. The maximum relative Mach number is found to be 1. 45 and jet/wake type flow exists in the rear part of the flow channel with the wake concentrating in the shroud region. For the operating point investigated, the wake development is due more to the strong <b>shround</b> curvature in the meridional plane than to a shock induced boundary layer separation. Laser measurments and calculations point to a significant flow displacement in the impeller exit region caused by the wake flow. The theoretical results indicate that a flow separation occurs also at the front side of the vaneless diffuser...|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of {{left-hand-drive}} Atkinsons were built for export to mainland Europe in the late 1960s, with pressed-steel cabs bought from Krupp after that company had ceased commercial vehicle production. Most were sold eventually in the U.K., via Comberhill Commercials of Wakefield. A different design of glass-fibre cab, launched in prototype form at the 1966 Commercial Motor Show, and named View-Line, had a deep single-piece main windscreen with wrap-around quarter glasses. The prototype had three separate chrome radiator grilles, but lacked {{the character of the}} exposed radiator models. Thereafter, although the Krupp Cabs, introduced in 1969, and View-Line cabs had concealed radiators, they carried a fibreglass replica of the Atkinson radiator outline with the 'Big A' device centred upon it. Both were available until 1970 and the merger with Seddon. Notable Atkinsons of the era were a fleet of 6x6 gritters built in 1962-73 on the orders of various U.K. highway authorities for use on the motorway network. These had Cummins NHK engines installed, rather than the more popular Gardner power units, due ostensibly to the use of steel in their construction, which didn't suffer salt corrosion to the same degree as the alloy-constructed Gardners. Early examples had AEC engines.From 1968 the standard Mk I glass-fibre clad cab was revised, with stronger ash framing, larger dimensions and wider, deeper windscreens. The traditional Withnell-tubed, exposed radiator was replaced with the more imposing enclosed version, which was concealed behind a glass-fibre <b>shrounded</b> metal grille - again carrying the Knight's Head, circular A logo and additional adornments in the form of engine manufacturer plates.This cab featured on the final Atkinson haulage models, the naming of which originated from an idea by Frank Whalley, the company publicity officer at the time. The most famous of the range were Two-axle tractor units were carried the name 'Borderer'. Three-axle rear-steer tractor units carried the name 'Leader'. Three-axle haulage chassis carried the name 'Searcher'. Four-axle chassis carried the name 'Defender'. Three-axle heavy haulage tractor units carried the name 'Venturer'. The two-axle haulage chassis were never given an official name, but was planned to carry the name 'Raider', although factory grille plates were never produced for this model.|$|R
