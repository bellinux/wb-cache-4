5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One tree was planted on the north <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that the}} initiative passed to the Israeli <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E

5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward on one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Afghanistan {{participated in}} the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea, from September 29 to October 14, 2002. This marked Afghanistan's return to {{international}} sporting events {{after the fall of}} the Taliban regime. The Afghan delegation consisted of 12 officials (11 men and one woman) and 44 competitors (40 men and four women) participating in seven different sports. The Afghanistan national football team played its first international match since the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification phase. An English teacher from Kabul, Roia Zamani, won a bronze medal in the 72kg middleweight class of taekwondo without winning a single match. Zamani was the only medalist from the Afghan <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first Afghan medalist in 20 years. None of the remaining athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and as such did not win any medals.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E

5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods on one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean on one <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} evasive action, manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her port <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft. Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling across the deck, he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud Line on the north <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Furuset Line {{on the south side of}} Groruddalen and the Lambertseter Line on the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly need a good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set out {{to take over the}} island, but only half of the force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E

The US I and IX Corps were to defend the Imjin and Hantan River respectively, while the ROK III Corps were to guard the areas around Chuncheon. The boundary between US I and IX Corps was marked by Route 33, and was defended by the ROK 1st Infantry Division on the west <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east side.|$|E
