The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

5000|$|Normative social distance: A second {{approach}} views <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> as {{a normative}} category. Normative <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> {{refers to the}} widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who {{should be considered as}} an [...] "insider" [...] and who an [...] "outsider/foreigner."

In an employer/employee relationship, this difference in <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> between the employer and the various employees leads to a disadvantageous situation for the socially distant workers when raises, promotions, special considerations etc. are given.

50|$|Research {{indicates}} that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately {{in order to}} be effective. During the 1918 flu pandemic, authorities in the US implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings, and other <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> interventions in Philadelphia and in St. Louis, but in Philadelphia the delay of five days in initiating these measures allowed transmission rates to double three to five times, whereas a more immediate response in St. Louis was significant in reducing transmission there. Bootsma and Ferguson analyzed <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> interventions in 16 US cities during the 1918 epidemic and found that time-limited interventions reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10-30%), and that the impact was often very limited because the interventions were introduced too late and lifted too early. It was observed that several cities experienced a second epidemic peak after <b>social</b> <b>distancing</b> controls were lifted, because susceptible individuals who had been protected were now exposed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{notion of}} <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> was first {{introduced}} by the sociologist Emory Bogardus (1925), who {{referred to it as}} the degrees of understanding and feeling that people experience regarding each other. Considering the <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> phenomenon an aspect of Davison’s (1983) third-person perception, Perloff (1993) articulated it as a complex variable including perceived similarity, familiarity, and identification, and pointed that {{there are at least two}} different ways to conceptualize <b>social</b> <b>distance.</b> First, <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> is a continuum going from “just like me” to “not at all like me.” Second, <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> reflects the heterogeneity and size of the audience. Perloff (1993), reviewing 16 studies of the third-person effect, acknowledged that the phenomenon is magnified when the hypothetical others are defined in broad terms. Thus, in Perloff’s (2002) terms, <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> corollary is “the notion that self-other disparities grow in magnitude with increases in perceived distance between self and comparison others.” ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{influence}} of <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> on levels of trust and reciprocity in China. <b>Social</b> <b>distance,</b> reflected in the indigenous concept of guanxi, is of central importance to Chinese culture. In Study 1, some participants participated in two financially salient trust games to measure behavior, one with an anonymous classmate {{and the other with}} an anonymous, demographically identical nonclassmate. Other participants, drawn from the same population, completed hypothetical surveys to gauge both hypothetical behavior and expectations of others. <b>Social</b> <b>distance</b> effects on actual and hypothetical behavior were statistically consistent. The results together corroborated the hypothesized negative relationship between trust and <b>social</b> <b>distance.</b> However, reciprocity was not responsive to <b>social</b> <b>distance.</b> Study 2 found that affect-based trust, but not cognition-based trust, played a mediating role in the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> and interpersonal trust in a hypothetical scenario. We conclude that close guanxi ties in China engender affect-based trust, which is extended to shouren classmates. This is true despite the fact that no more cognition-based trust is placed nor reciprocity received or expected from classmates compared to demographically identical shengren nonclassmates.

40|$|I {{start the}} thesis with a {{focusing}} {{model in which}} increasing the range of values of an attribute makes the decision-maker place more weight on this attribute. This model explains the documented communality between risky choice and intertemporal choice, and provides a unique explanation to the common ratio, common delay, and magnitude effects. It also captures preference reversals between choice and valuation, and different forms of context dependence such as the asymmetric dominance effect. Since the model is not restricted to probabilities and temporal delays, I also apply it to allocations characterised by an amount of money and a <b>social</b> <b>distance.</b> It predicts ‘common social distance’ effects, magnitude effects in the social domain, and preference reversals between choice and valuation of allocations. I look for these social preference reversals in the second Chapter. I invite student subjects in the laboratory and isolate {{the effect of the}} <b>social</b> <b>distance</b> by comparing weak <b>social</b> <b>distances,</b> with allocations benefiting students in other Faculties, to strong <b>social</b> <b>distances,</b> where the allocations benefit widely different charities. <b>Social</b> <b>distances</b> are measured with tools developed in social psychology. I find preference reversals only with weak <b>social</b> <b>distances,</b> where subjects do not take into account <b>social</b> <b>distances</b> when they form a valuation. When <b>social</b> <b>distances</b> become stronger with the charities, subjects take <b>social</b> <b>distances</b> into account for both choice and valuation and preference reversals disappear. These results confirm that social preference reversals exist and that <b>social</b> <b>distances</b> are a relevant attribute.
