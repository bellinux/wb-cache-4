Most seeds dispersed by the green-head ant and A.longiceps are eventually eaten by Pheidole ants. Since the seeds have a higher survival rate if they are not collected by Pheidole, these two ants are more beneficial to the seeds than Pheidole. Seeds in green-head ant nests rarely germinate.|$|R
5000|$|The Nama Karoo biome {{is located}} {{entirely on the}} central Plateau mostly at altitudes between 1000 m and 1500 m. [...] It {{incorporates}} nearly {{the whole of the}} historical and geographical Great Karoo, but also includes a portion of southern Namibia's [...] "Namaqualand", and South Africa's [...] "Bushmanland" [...] (both local geographical names, not names of biomes). It is the second largest biome in South Africa, and forms the botanical transition between the [...] "Fynbos biome" [...] to the south and the [...] "Savannah biome" [...] to the north. It is defined primarily by the dominance of dwarf (less than 1 m high) shrubs with a co-dominance of grasses especially towards the north-east and east where it grades into the [...] "Grassland biome" [...] of the Highveld and the Eastern Midlands. The shrubs and grasses are deciduous, mainly in response to the irregular rainfall. Much of the Nama Karoo biome is used for sheep and goat farming, providing mutton, wool and pelts for local and international markets, especially since livestock can frequently be provided with a regular supply of water from boreholes. Overgrazing exacerbates the erosion caused by the violent thunderstorms that occur, infrequently, in the summer. It also promotes the replacement of the grasses by shrubs, especially the less edible varieties such as the threethorn (Rhigozum trichotomum), bitterbos (Chrysocoma ciliate) and <b>sweet</b> thorn (<b>Acacia</b> karroo). However, there are few rare or Red Data Book plant species in the Nama Karoo biome.|$|R
50|$|Vachellia farnesiana, {{also known}} as Acacia farnesiana, and {{previously}} Mimosa farnesiana, commonly known as <b>sweet</b> <b>acacia,</b> huisache or needle bush, is so named because of the numerous thorns distributed along its branches. The native range of V. farnesiana is uncertain. While the point of origin is Mexico and Central America, the species has a pantropical distribution incorporating northern Australia and southern Asia. It remains unclear whether the extra-American distribution is primarily natural or anthropogenic. It is deciduous over part of its range, but evergreen in most locales. The species grows to a height of up to 8 m and has a lifespan of about 25-50 years.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{compounds}} from plants can provide an alternative approach against food-borne pathogens. The mechanisms of action of most plant extracts with antimicrobial activity have been poorly studied. In this work, changes in membrane integrity, membrane potential, internal pH (pHin), and ATP synthesis were measured in Vibrio cholerae cells after exposure to extracts of edible and medicinal plants. A preliminary screen of methanolic, ethanolic, and aqueous extracts of medicinal and edible plants was performed. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were measured for extracts showing high antimicrobial activity. Our results indicate that methanolic extracts of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), nopal cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica var. Villanueva L.), <b>sweet</b> <b>acacia</b> (Acacia farnesiana L.), and white sagebrush (Artemisia ludoviciana Nutt.) are the most active against V. cholera, with MBCs ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 0 mg/ml. Using four fluorogenic techniques, we studied the membrane integrity of V. cholerae cells after exposure to these four extracts. Extracts from these plants were able to disrupt the cell membranes of V. cholerae cells, causing increased membrane permeability, a clear decrease in cytoplasmic pH, cell membrane hyperpolarization, {{and a decrease in}} cellular ATP concentration in all strains tested. These four plant extracts could be studied as future alternatives to control V. cholerae contamination in foods and the diseases associated with this microorganism...|$|E
