40|$|Study of {{the main}} {{channels}} of an ephemeral discontinuous stream shows the presence of pool-riffle morphology scoured into underlying Holocene muds. Pools are defined as starting at the point <b>of</b> maximum bed <b>slope</b> and reaching half the distance downstream to the next point <b>of</b> maximum bed <b>slope.</b> Pool-riffle morphology correlates well with high-stage hydraulics. Channel fill along pools is subject to hydraulicjump scour during intermediate-stage flows. Pools are preferentially scoured during high-stage discharges with flow completely in the tranquil flow regime. During large-stage flows, channel fill is almost completely washed away and the variable <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the exposed mud subfloor is found to show negative exponential correlation to energy gradients, sediment transport, and shear. Reaches <b>of</b> steep bed <b>slope</b> and low shear become the locus of kinematic particle interference and gravel deposition during recession from high stages. During low-stage flow, relationships between bed slope and energy expenditure are the reverse of those during high-stage flow. Evidence indicates that certain discontinuous streams and their fans evolve to braid chute units along gullies comprising steep slope, braided channels upstream <b>of</b> a single-channeled <b>chute</b> <b>of</b> low <b>slope.</b> During large discharges, shear and sediment transport are higher along chutes, causing net scour of channel fill. This fill is stored along the braided channels of the next braid-chute downstream. During low-stage flows, the reverse occurs. Thus, the braid-chute functions as a morphologic unit to maintain evenness of sediment transport {{in an environment of}} variable flow sizes. Long-term sediment-budget deficit is indicated by gradual scour of channel subfloors. In all braid-chutes, the bed <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the braid is greater than the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the flood surface, and both are greater than the bed <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chute.</b> Along chutes, average low-stage energy slopes approximately equal bed slopes. As stages rise, energy slopes increase with increasing discharge so that at bankfull stages, they approximate the flood-surface slopes. This relationship allows the inference of a feedback link between channel slopes and flood-surface slopes along a chute. Along braided channels, energy slopes decrease with increasing stage. Hypothetically, the contrasting energy-gradient changes with discharge could produce a system in which bankfull stages are reached simultaneously along the entire braid-chute. Data for discontinuous streams indicate that they may be analogous to noncontinuous braided perennial streams. Braided reaches in such perennial streams may be correlated to the alluvial fans below discontinuous channels. Straight and sinuous perennial channels between braided reaches may be analogous to the discontinuous channel. Bed <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the discontinuous channel and its analogues are flatter than those of adjoining flood surfaces. This contrast in gradients brings flow close {{to the level of the}} flood plain at some point downstream where the flow can begin to spread laterally onto this surface. In the ephemeral environment, this downstream branching usually takes place over a riffle. The fan, which lies below the studied discontinuous stream, contains braided-channel flow, mixed channel flow and sheetflow, and sheetflow, respectively, in a down-fan direction. It is postulated that a low water to sediment discharge ratio over a long time span would produce net deposition in the fan as well as in the discontinuous channel upstream. This, in turn, would force the fanhead to migrate upstream over the filling channel. Valley alluviation, thus caused by a discontinuous stream, would construct an elongate, tabular body of sediments composed of coarse channel deposits at the base overlain by laterally extensive channel sands and sheetflood sands. Above these, there would be finer grained sheetflood silts...|$|R

40|$|Chute cutoffs reduce {{sinuosity}} of meandering {{rivers and}} potentially cause {{a transition from}} a single to a multiple channel river. The channel bifurcation of the main channel and the mouth <b>of</b> the incipient <b>chute</b> channel controls sediment and flow partitioning and development <b>of</b> the <b>chute.</b> Recent channel bifurcation models suggest that upstream bend radius, gradient advantage, inlet step, and upstream sediment supply at the bifurcation are important factors {{in the evolution of}} bifurcations. Our objective is to unravel the relative importance of these factors for chute cutoff success and development. We compare results from a morphodynamic three-dimensional (3 D) model and a one-dimensional (1 D) model with nodal-point relation with field observations <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> cutoffs in a meandering gravel-bed river. The balance between increased gradient advantage and flow curvature upstream <b>of</b> the <b>chute</b> channel bifurcation was systematically investigated with the 1 D model. The 3 D model runs and the field observations show the development of two types <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> cutoffs: a scroll-slough cutoff and a bend cutoff. The morphodynamic 3 D model demonstrates that chutes are initiated when flow depth exceeds the floodplain elevation. Overbank flow and a significant gradient advantage result in a bend cutoff. The outcome of the 1 D model shows that channel curvature at the bifurcation determines the success or failure <b>of</b> the <b>chute</b> cutoff when the chute channel is located at the inner bend, {{as in the case of}} scroll-slough cutoffs. We conclude that chute initiation depends on floodplain characteristics, i. e., floodplain elevation, sediment composition, and the presence <b>of</b> vegetation. <b>Chute</b> cutoff success or failure is determined by the dynamics just upstream of the channel bifurcation and location <b>of</b> the <b>chute</b> channel in the bend, which determines channel curvature and gradient advantage. These findings have ramifications for the prediction <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> cutoff in a wide range of rivers under natural and managed conditions and for the understanding of stratigraphy and architecture of deposits.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} processes <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> channel {{formation in}} four tropical sand-bed meandering rivers; the Strickland and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea, the Beni in Bolivia, {{and the lower}} Paraguay on the Paraguay/Argentina border. Empirical planform analyses highlight an association between meander bend widening and chute initiation {{that is consistent with}} recent physics-based modelling work. GIS analyses indicate that bend widening may be driven by a variety of mechanisms, including scour and cutbank bench formation at sharply-curving bends, point bar erosion due to cutbank impingement against cohesive terrace material, rapid cutbank erosion at rapidly extending bends, and spontaneous mid-channel bar formation. Chute channel initiation is observed to be predominantly associated with two of these widening mechanisms; i) an imbalance between cutbank erosion and point bar deposition associated with rapid bend extension, and ii) bank erosion forced by spontaneous mid-channel bar development. The work extends previous empirical analyses, which highlighted the role of bend extension (elongation) in driving chute initiation, with the observation that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> initiation increases once bend extension rates and/or widening ratios exceed a reach-scale threshold. A temporal pattern <b>of</b> increased <b>chute</b> initiation frequency on the Ok Tedi, in response to channel steepening and mid-channel bar development following the addition of mine tailings, mirrors the inter- and intra-reach spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> initiation frequency on the Paraguay, Strickland and Beni Rivers, where increased stream power and sediment load are associated with increased bend extension and chute initiation rates. The process <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> formation is shown to be rate-dependent, and the threshold values of bend extension and widening ratio for chute initiation are shown to scale with measures of river energy, reminiscent of slopeâratio thresholds in river avulsion. Furthermore, Delft 3 D simulations suggest that chute formation can exert negative feedback on shear stress and bank erosion in the adjacent mainstem bifurcate, such that the process <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> formation may also be rate-limiting. Chute formation is activated iteratively in space and time in response to changes in river energy (and sediment load), predominantly affecting sites of rapid channel elongation, and thereby mediating the river response...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} better understand the possible effects <b>of</b> <b>chute</b> construction, both initially and as chute development continues, on Missouri River nutrient concentrations. Our first objective was to determin e if the addition of sediment from proposed chute locations to river water samples (i. e., elutriate samples) increased nutrient concentrations relative to water-only river samples collected just upstream <b>of</b> the proposed <b>chute</b> locations or river water samples collected from eight long-term water quality monitoring stations.
