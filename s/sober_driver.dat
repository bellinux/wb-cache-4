50|$|In the Blomberg et al. {{study the}} crash {{statistics}} indicated a lowered risk for BACs 0.01% to 0.04% (87-92% {{of the risk}} of a <b>sober</b> <b>driver).</b> When adjusted for the demographic variables, already at 0.05% BAC the risk seemed to be slightly higher than for the same drivers in 0% although less than for average 0% drivers.

When also the estimated selection bias was corrected, the risk for these drivers was estimated to be 3-6% higher than for sober drivers, although the difference was not significant. In Alsop's Grand Rapids study the accident risk at BAC 0.01-0.03% was just 80-96% of that of sober drivers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this deliverable is to assess the risk of driving with alcohol, illicit drugs and medicines in various European countries. In total nine countries {{participated in the study}} on relative risk of serious injury/fatality while positive for psychoactive substances. Six countries contributed to the study on the relative risk of getting seriously injured: Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. Four countries contributed to the study on the relative risk of getting killed: Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal. The risk for a driver of getting seriously injured or killed in an accident while positive for a given substance was calculated as the ratio between the odds for a driver of being seriously injured/killed in an accident while positive for a given substance and the odds of being seriously injured/killed while negative. The odds ratios were calculated by means of logistic regression using the SAS 9. 2 procedure proc logistic. Data from the case study population consisted of samples from the hospital studies of seriously injured drivers and those of killed drivers. In total, 2, 490 seriously injured drivers and 1, 112 killed drivers were included. Data from the control population came from the roadside surveys in the same countries, in total, 15, 832 drivers participated in the control sample of the seriously injured drivers and 21, 917 drivers participated in the control samples of killed drivers; data were weighted for the national distribution of traffic in each of eight time periods of the week. The relative risk estimates were adjusted for age and gender. An estimation of the overall relative risk by substance group is given. These risk estimates are based on the odds ratios estimated separately for each country, together with aggregated odds ratios estimated on the basis of all countries’ data together or a subset of countries. In the estimate is also taken into account the imprecision of the odds ratios of getting seriously injured and killed as expressed by the confidence intervals of the odds ratio estimates. The main finding of this report is that the highest risk of getting seriously injured or killed is associated with driving with high alcohol concentrations (above 1. 2 g/L) and alcohol combined with other psychoactive substances. These two groups indicate extremely high risks of about 20 - 200 times that of <b>sober</b> <b>drivers.</b> Other high risk groups are drivers with medium blood alcohol concentrations (between 0. 8 g/L and 1. 2 g/L), multiple drug use and amphetamines. The risks indicated for this group are about 5 - 30 times that of <b>sober</b> <b>drivers.</b> Medium increased risk was found for alcohol concentrations between 0. 5 and 0. 8 g/L, for cocaine, benzoylecgonine, illicit opiates and medicinal opioids. Risk for this group was estimated to about 2 - 10 times that of <b>sober</b> <b>drivers.</b> The risk associated with benzoylecgonine that is not an active agent might be caused by sleep deprivation after cocaine consumption. The risk associated with cannabis seems to be similar to the risk when driving with a low alcohol concentration (between 0. 1 g/L and 0. 5 g/L), which is slightly increased of about 1 - 3 times that of <b>sober</b> <b>drivers.</b> (Author/publisher) This document is available at [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Many {{policies}} are being implemented {{around the world}} to decrease the competition for explicit attention capture while operating a vehicle. For example, there are legislative efforts in many countries aimed at banning or restricting the use of cell phones while driving. Research has shown that the use of both hands-free and hand-held cellular devices while driving results in the failure of attention to explicitly capture other salient and distinctive objects, leading to significantly delayed reaction times, as well as inattentional blindness. A study published in 1997, based on accident data in Toronto, found the risk involved in driving while using a cell phone to be similar to that of driving drunk. In both cases, the risk of a collision was three to six times higher compared to a <b>sober</b> <b>driver</b> not using a cell phone. Moreover, Strayer et al.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} on moderate alcohol intake and motor vehicle crash (MVC) risk, and discuss the possible public health tension in balancing risk reduction and increment with respect to moderate alcohol intake. Method: A Medline review was conducted on moderate alcohol intake, MVC, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. Result: Moderate alcohol intake (24 g ethanol, two US standard drinks, or less a day) is associated with 20 % reduction in risk of CVD. Public awareness of this may contribute to why rates of driving with blood alcohol content (BAC) < 0. 08 g/dl in the United States are static. Studies show 3 - to 17 -fold increased risk of a fatal MVC with BAC < 0. 08 g/dl compared to <b>sober</b> <b>drivers.</b> The United States has 0. 08 g/dl BAC laws, higher than that reached by a driver drinking two drinks per day or less. Conclusion: The public should be educated that although moderate alcohol drinking may not violate BAC laws, it still carries significant risk of MVC. Current BAC laws in some countries needs re-evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} hegemonic masculinity and drunken driving behaviour among male students. Hegemonic masculinity is the most dominant form of masculinity and {{can be described as}} an ideological model of what {{is considered to be a}} 'real man' (Kimmel 2000 : 11). According to Wetherall (1996 : 323) hegemonic masculinity is essentially 'robocop'; tough, assertive, aggressive, all- conquering, cool and big. This research hypothesised that men who drink and drive are much more likely to display characteristics of hegemonic masculinity. Excessive drinking has always been synonymous with student culture and this research focuses on alcohol being viewed as a rite of passage for young male students into adulthood. Socialisation theories are used to explain how patterns of alcohol consumption among individuals are related to the socio-cultural context in which they live. These theories also explain how the ideals of hegemonic masculinity are acquired through the reproduction of norms, values and beliefs in a society or group of people. Thus this research project focuses on how alcohol consumption is considered part of the 'male domain' and due to this, men feel great pressure to drink in order to maintain their masculine identity. The research involved male students at the University of KwaZulu Natal, Pietermaritzburg. Quantitative methods were used in the form of a survey questionnaire. The survey provided statistical information about the incidence of drunken driving relating to masculinity discourse. The sample consisted of male student drivers who drank alcohol. Overall the sample consisted of young adult males with 215 male students participating in the survey with an average age of 22 years. The survey data was statistically analysed using a computer programme known as the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The data was divided into two groups, namely, the responses of <b>sober</b> male <b>drivers</b> and the responses of drunk male <b>drivers.</b> The <b>sober</b> <b>drivers</b> served as the control group while the drunk drivers served as the experimental group. The responses from these two groups were used to conduct independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests in order to assess which group displayed more attributes of hegemonic masculinity and whether or not there was a difference. Student responses from the open-ended questions were included as direct quotes to highlight the findings in the related closed questions. The findings reveal that the male students who drink and drive were more likely to display characteristics of hegemonic masculinity than the <b>sober</b> male <b>drivers.</b> These characteristics included: risk-taking, recklessness, strength, control and independence...|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{businesses}} have sprouted {{up across the}} United States to help {{address the problem of}} drinking and driving. Some transport their drivers home, as passengers, using one of three methods: car, collapsible scooter, or foldable bike. These are not necessarily true designated driver programs, but instead Safe Ride programs, as the <b>sober</b> <b>driver</b> is not designated from within the natural drinking group. [...] Designated Drivers, Inc, was founded in 1998 and later based out of Las Vegas, NV. This company has used two person teams: one person to drive the impaired individual in their own vehicle, and the other person as the follow driver. Pittsburgh's Pear Transportation Company, aka The Pear Cares, has also become well known for using the two-person team approach. Dryver, formerly known as BeMyDD, established itself by offering designated driver services for events, car pickups for drivers who are too impaired to make it home, and personal drivers for evenings out. NightRiders, Incorporated was the first company to use collapsible, motorized scooters in the US. The drivers drove customers home using their own vehicles, stowing a scooter in the customer's trunk (or truck). Upon arrival to the customer's destination, the driver parked the vehicle, collected the fare, assembled the scooter from the vehicle, and rode off to the next customer. This company is now out of business, according to their website. Zingo Transportation has operated this kind of service in southern US cities since 2005. Drivers Incorporated, of Washington DC, has used foldable bicycles for the last mile of transportation, to and from public transportation. SafeRide, Inc., formerly known as Piedmont SafeRide serves the Carolinas by providing 2-person driver teams (1 male/1 female) to appropriately match up with the client.|$|E

40|$|Motor vehicle crashes claim over 40, 000 lives {{a year in}} the United States, {{approximately}} the same number of Americans killed over the course of either the Korean or Vietnam wars. The death toll in motor vehicle accidents roughly equals the combined number of suicides and homicides, and motor vehicle deaths are thirty times as frequent as accidental deaths due to firearms. Motor vehicle accidents are {{the leading cause of death}} for Americans aged 6 - 27. Alcohol is often implicated in automobile deaths. According to police reports, at least one driver has been drinking (although not necessarily over the legal blood-alcohol limit) in over 40 percent of fatal crashes.

Our study aimed to estimate the prevalence of alcohol-impaired road users {{at the time of the}} RTA and report psychoactive drug use, in various categories of casualties, and in various circumstances of the crash. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 893 casualties involved in fatal or non-fatal RTAs and admitted at the Emergency Room or the Forensic Institute from March to September 2012. Blood alcohol dosage (BAC) and urine drug screening were carried out, and results were linked with hospital and police crash report data. The mean BAC in positive cases indicated heavy drinking before the crash: drivers (1. 9 g/L), pedestrians (2. 1 g/L), passengers (1. 5 g/L). The prevalence of alcohol-impairment was significantly higher in drivers (41 %) and riders (27 %) compared to pedestrians (17 %) and passengers (13 %). Over 75 % of casualties that tested positive for alcohol had a BAC largely above the legal limit. Psychoactive drug use was twice more prevalent in alcohol-impaired <b>drivers</b> than in <b>sober</b> <b>drivers</b> (20 % vs 10 %).

40|$|Straightforward and {{powerful}} reasons exist for lowering {{the legal limit}} of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from 0. 10 to 0. 08. In 1964, Borkenstein et al. showed that drivers who had been drinking {{were more likely to}} be involved in a crash than <b>sober</b> <b>drivers,</b> and that beginning with low BACs, the greater the level of intoxication, the higher the probability of being in a crash. Other investigators have replicated and refined Borkenstein et al. 's original findings. More recently, Mounce and Pendleton (1992) extended this line of research by showing that driver BAC is associated with the probability of being respo sible for a crash in which they were involved. Research also shows that virtually all drivers, even experienced drivers, are significantly impaired with regard to critical driving tasks at 0. 08 BAC. The strong relationship between BAC level, probability of crash involvement, and increased impairment, has led a growing number of states to lower their legal BAC limits. To date, 16 states and the District of Columbia have lowered the BAC limit to 0. 08 for adult drivers. It is hypothesized that implementing a 0. 08 BAC law has a synergistic effect on the other components of the anti-drunk driving system, namely the enforcement, adjudication, judicial, licensing, and public information and education components.

40|$|Measuring the {{relative}} likelihood of fatal crash involvement for {{different types of}} drivers would seem to require information on both the number of fatal crashes by driver type and the fraction of drivers on the road falling into each category. In this paper, however, we present a methodology for measuring fatal crash likelihood that relies solely on fatal crash data. The key to our identification strategy is the hidden richness inherent to two-car crashes. Crashes involving two drinking drivers are proportional to {{the square of the}} number of drinking drivers on the road; crashes with one drinking and one <b>sober</b> <b>driver</b> increase linearly in the number of drinking drivers. Imposing a limited set of assumptions (e. g. independence across crashes, equal mixing on the roads), we are able to estimate both the likelihood of causing a fatal crash and the fraction of drivers of each type on the road. Our estimates suggest that drivers with alcohol in their blood are at least eight times more likely to cause a fatal crash; legally drunk drivers pose a risk at least 15 times greater than sober drivers. Males, young drivers, and drivers with bad past driving records are all more dangerous, but the impact of these other factors is far less than that of alcohol. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the prevalence and predictors of 11 {{strategies to avoid}} driving when feeling intoxicated among 561 bar-room patrons in two medium-sized Maryland communities. Logistic regression analyses identified demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal predictors of avoidance strategies and interactions among predictors. Overall, 89 % reported one or more DWI avoidance actions in the past year, and 38 % reported driving intoxicated during that time. Average frequencies of avoidance behavior and intoxicated driving increased significantly as drinking level increased. However, the higher the drinking level, the smaller the ratio of avoidance actions to DWI experiences, highlighting the vulnerability of heavy drinkers who had driven intoxicated. Using a <b>sober</b> <b>driver</b> or one who allegedly drank less than the respondent were {{the most popular and}} frequent strategies, but paying for a cab, walking, and using a bus or free cab were relatively unpopular. Higher drinking levels predicted significantly higher odds of using avoidance approaches, as did intoxicated driving. Confidence in driving safely when intoxicated was positively related to drinking level and intoxicated driving, but it tended to predict lower odds of avoidance actions. Similarly, marital status, age, gender, and location influenced the odds of avoidance behaviors. Interventions should be strategically tailored to exploit or counter drinker predilections among avoidance options...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol breath {{testing on}} a larger scale will save lives. Alcohol intake affects the human body by {{significantly}} longer response time to external stimuli. In demanding situations where the senses need to be on alert a prolonged reaction time can be {{the difference between life and}} death, both for the intoxicated subject and for surrounding  individuals. The aims of this thesis include investigations of a new type of breath alcohol sensor, designed for operation without a mouthpiece, both with regards to sensor performance as well as usability in relation to various breath  alcohol  screening applications. In many situations where breath alcohol screening is suitable, there is a need for quick and easy use. The instrument should interfere as little as possible with the regular routines and procedures. One such task is driving. To accommodate for these needs in an in-vehicle application, the breath alcohol sensing system must be seamlessly installed in the vehicle and not interfere with the normal behavior of the <b>sober</b> <b>driver.</b> Driving is also a task requiring high level of concentration over a prolonged period of time. In the U. S. alone thousands of lives are annually lost in accidents where the driver was under the influence of  alcohol.   Similar numbers have been recorded for Europe. The potential for a system handling the needs for ease-of-use is huge and may result in successful products. The results presented within this thesis provide experimental evidence of sufficient sensor performance for screening applications with an instrument operating without a mouthpiece. Smarter calculation methods were also shown to be a feasible path to improved measurement reliability. Important steps towards an even more passive solution for in-vehicle screening is also presented.

40|$|This conference paper {{presents}} an accident study investigating where fatal alcohol- and drug-related accidents occur {{with respect to}} traffic environment (i. e., urban versus rural), road type, speed limit, annual average daily traffic flow, and road category. The study uses data from in-depth studies of fatal accidents and from the Swedish National Road Database. Accident data from the 2006 – 2009 period are used. The {{results indicate that the}} proportion of all fatal accidents that are alcohol-related is about the same on urban (21 %) and rural roads (23 %). However, the proportion of alcohol-related fatal accidents is higher on ordinary roads (i. e., two-lane single carriageways with no central reservation or median barrier; 23 %) than on other types of rural state roads (11 %). On ordinary roads, alcohol-related fatal accidents are more common on roads with speed limits of 60 – 70 km/h (35 %) than on roads with speed limits of 80 – 100 km/h (14 %) and more common on second- and third-class county roads (32 %) than on roads in other categories (less than 20 %). The alcohol-related accident risk follows the same pattern, i. e., the accident risk is highest where the proportion of alcohol-related accidents is highest.  It was also found that the distribution of drug-related fatal accidents among various parts of the road network is more similar to the distribution of fatal accidents involving <b>sober</b> <b>drivers</b> than to alcohol-related fatal accidents.

40|$|Given {{that over}} a million people are fatally injured in road {{accidents}} each year, {{the need for a}} systematic proactive approach is undeniable. The Swedish Road Administration (SRA) has developed a model for a safe road transport system based on the Vision Zero philosophy, to identify and prevent deviations from a safe system approach with regard to crashes. The overall objective of this thesis was: to study road crashes using this system approach, to identify whether the SRA model could be used to classify fatal crashes, and to identify system weaknesses as well as important factors {{that need to be addressed}} to further develop a safe road transport system. The thesis comprises four studies based on real-world crashes in Sweden. Three kinds of data were used in the studies: in-depth fatal crash data, in-depth car crashes involving cars fitted with an on-board crash pulse recorder, and observational data. In two studies, the aim was to investigate the interactions between a few safety performance indicators (SPIs), and how these indicators could be used to identify the most important factors in road crashes. The other two studies focused on SPIs of the vehicle and the road, to evaluate whether the SPIs used reflect the most important factors in the system. The aims of these two studies were also to present average crash severity, depending on collision partner as well as road safety standard. Most road traffic injuries are related to an interaction between the three components: the road, the vehicle and the road user. Therefore a system approach is needed to analyse crashes and to find preventive interventions. The SRA model was found to be useful for classifying in-depth fatal crashes. However, to identify weaknesses in the road traffic system, a more sophisticated model is needed. Based on crashes involving cars fitted with an on-board crash pulse recorder, crash severity was found to differ depending on collision partner. Frontal two-vehicle crashes and single-vehicle crashes with rigid roadside objects were shown to generate the highest crash severity. The least harmful crash type was single-vehicle crashes into deformable objects. Furthermore, crash severity was lower in crashes occurring on roads with a good safety rating than in those that occurred on roads with a poor safety rating. While it was found that a higher speed limit resulted in higher crash severity on roads with a poor safety rating, the opposite was found on roads with a good safety rating. The main reason for this was that lanes for traffic travelling in opposite directions were more often separated at higher speeds on roads with a good safety rating. On divided roads, no crashes resulted in a crash severity above the level corresponding to a 10 % risk of sustaining serious or fatal injury. Simultaneous 100 % fulfilment of a set of SPIs (<b>sober</b> <b>driver,</b> non-excessive speed, seat belt use and divided roads) also supports this finding, since only 5 % of all fatalities on rural roads in Sweden occurred under these circumstances. Divided roads are therefore one of the most important SPIs for car occupants. The overall the results of the thesis indicates that it is necessary to establish a system approach, where the road infrastructure is based on the capabilities and limitations of human beings through good road and vehicle design...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{well-known}} that alcohol-impaired driving increases crash risk, {{the number of}} crash deaths specifically attributable to alcohol-impaired driving is less well known. Many fatal crashes occur with <b>sober</b> <b>drivers,</b> and many fatal crashes of drinking drivers still would have occurred {{if they had not}} been drinking. In order to understand what is possible with different countermeasures — for example, those aimed at convicted offenders or high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) drivers versus those targeted at the general population of drivers — {{it is important to know}} how much of the problem is accounted for by these different target populations. In this paper we describe a calculation procedure for estimating the number of crash fatalities in the 2005 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) attributable to different driver BACs. The procedure first classifies all fatalities by the highest BAC for driver(s) involved in the crash. Then, using the risk curve developed by Zador et al., 1 the number of fatalities specifically attributable to the high BACs is estimated. It is estimated that drivers with BACs at or above 0. 08 g/dL were involved in the deaths of 12, 945 road users in the United States in 2005 and that, had all these drivers had BACs below 0. 08 g/dL, 8, 916 of the deaths would have been prevented – this is the number attributable directly to BACs at or above 0. 08 g/dL. Had all drivers had BACs below 0. 05 g/dL, an estimated 11, 100 deaths would have been prevented. If all drivers in 2005 had had zero BACs, as many as 13, 452 deaths would have been prevented. If all drivers with at least one alcohol-impaired driving conviction within 3 years prior to the crash were restricted to BACs below 0. 08 g/dL, 777 deaths could have been prevented in 2005...|$|R
50|$|The {{victims had}} been {{walking up the}} Bakadzhik peak to attend a {{traditional}} Ascension Day (Spasovden) feast and fair held on the summit. Around 9:15 AM local time the bus, a Chavdar 11 operated by the Yambol transport company MCI Slavi Slavov, crashed into a group of pedestrians while descending from a tour to the Alexander Nevsky Memorial Church located at the summit. Although the bus had been declared roadworthy on 12 May, some speculate that the cause for the accident may have been brake failure. Other factors {{that contributed to the}} tragedy were the narrow road, the high speed and the damp asphalt. The driver, 60-year-old Gospodinov Dimitrov, was legally <b>sober.</b> The bus <b>driver</b> was heavily injured and transported to Sofia to be treated at Pirogov Hospital.|$|R
50|$|This {{statistic}} includes {{any and all}} vehicular (including {{bicycle and}} motorcycle) accidents in which any alcohol has been consumed, or {{believed to have been}} consumed, by the driver, a passenger or a pedestrian associated with the accident. Thus, if a person who has consumed alcohol and has stopped for a red light is rear-ended by a completely <b>sober</b> but inattentive <b>driver,</b> the accident is listed as alcohol-related, although alcohol {{had nothing to do with}} causing the accident. Furthermore, if a sober motorist hits a drunk pedestrian, the accident is also listed as alcohol-related. Alcohol-related accidents are often mistakenly confused with alcohol-caused accidents. Some have criticized the NHTSA for compiling this statistic since it may give the impression that drunk drivers cause a much higher percentage of accidents and does not accurately reflect the problem of drunk driving in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people are}} {{challenged}} by the concept of unsafe speed because they find it vague and arbitrary. It {{is well known that}} people instead resolve such challenges by attribute substitution, which in this case can mean simply emulating the behaviors of others. In accord with the cultural theory of risk, indeed a substantial part of a driver's risk perception comes from comparing their contemplated conduct to the behavior of others; this includes the safeness of a given speed, notwithstanding the actual risk. As a result of this uncorrected vagueness, group behavior can often be in opposition to safe speed and still be governing a hazardous posted speed limit. By Federal law, posted speed limits are generally within 5 mph of the 85th-percentile speed of free-flowing traffic. Functionality, this amounts to citizens [...] "voting" [...] a street's speed limit with their gas pedal from the influence of groupshift. As people generally follow explicit rules all the time of which they do not agree, it is often simply a jurisdiction's failure in their law to sufficiently quantify and disseminate fair notice of an explicit standard of care, such as the ACDA rule. Most DMV driver manuals teach the practice, but far fewer states explicitly back it up in their actual statutes and law enforcement. If drivers were mindful of the ACDA, the operating speed would by definition not exceed the inferred design speed. In some cases, police focused on driving while [...] "influenced," [...] and pull over slower quartile <b>sober</b> night-time <b>drivers</b> moving no faster than they can stop within the radius of their headlights; this discourages adjusting speed downward from anything but the posted [...] "maximum speed" [...] permitted by law—which is determined as previously described.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of all traffic accidents {{are caused by}} human factors (Lewin, 1982; Evans, 1991). One of these human factors that is well known {{to be associated with}} increased accident risk is the committing of various traffic law violations (Reason et al., 1990, Parker et al. 1995; Zaidel, 2001). Probably the best studied and documented is the relationship between driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} and accident risk. After consuming one to two glasses of alcoholic beverages, accident risk starts to increase exponentially with every additional glass, resulting in increased risk factors of 4, 6, and 17 for BAG levels of 1, 1. 3, and 1. 8 g/ 1 respectively (Borkenstein et al., 1974; Hurst et al., 1994). Beside the increased accident risk alcohol consumption negatively influences injury severity as well. Fatality rates for drivers involved in a traffic accident with a BAG above 1. 5 g/ 1 are reported to be up to 200 times higher than to those of <b>sober</b> <b>drivers</b> (Simpson & Mayhew, 1991). Speeding is another traffic violation with ample evidence of its relationship with accident risk and severity. Newtonian physics implies that higher speeds increase crash risk due to reduction of available friction, leading to risk of loss of control, reduction of time-to-collision, and crash forces increasing with the square of speed. On the basis of extensive research on the relationship between speed, speed limits, and accidents, it is estimated that, depending on the road category, a one mile per hour reduction in mean speed of traffic could produce a two to seven percentage reduction in the number of injury accidents (Nilsson, 1990; Finch et al., 1994, Taylor et al., 2000). Other researchers have pointed to the importance of speed variance: vehicles moving much slower or faster than the mean traffic speed tend to be over-represented in accident statistics (Solomon, 1964; Girillo, 1968; Hauer, 1971). The rule of thumb that results from various studies is: an average speed increase of 1 km/h means a three percent higher risk of an injury accident (Finch et al., 1994; Taylor et al., 2000). In severe accidents, the increase is even bigger: 1 km/h means a five percent higher risk of serious or fatal injury. The broad concept of 'traffic law enforcement' covers the entire penal procedure designed to persuade road users to obey traffic laws and regulations through the threat of detection of a violation and the imposition of a penalty. Enforcement of traffic laws is intended to influence the behaviour of road users in such a way that their risk of becoming involved in an accident, or causing an accident, decreases. 'Police enforcement' is the actual work of monitoring violations of traffic laws, apprehending offenders, and securing evidence needed for prosecution of offenders. There is good evidence that police enforcement of traffic rules promotes road safety and safe traffic behaviour, and therefore should be considered an integral part of transport management policies (Zaidel, 2002; Zaal, 1994; ETSG, 1999). Police enforcement can only be effective if it operates in a supportive environment of laws, regulations, and a sensitive penal system. These combined forces act to create the deterrence effect of police enforcement, both on the individual level and on society at large (Hakkert, 1994). In this presentation I will describe the Dutch measures and effects in the field of enforcement of drinking-and-driving. First, section 2 provides a description of the monitoring of drinking-and-driving in the Netherlands. Section 3 presents an overview regarding developments in the field of drink-driving in the Netherlands. Section 4 addresses the effort and costs necessary to achieve cost-effective levels of Random Breath Testing in the Netherlands. In section 5 recommendations are given to improve the effectiveness and efficacy of enforcement of drinking and driving...|$|R
