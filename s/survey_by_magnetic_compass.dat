40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of a migratory bird, the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), {{was shown}} to be lateralized in favour of the right eye/left brain hemisphere.

This change from a bilateral to a lateralized <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> appears to be a maturation process, the first such case known so far in birds.

40|$|Magnetoreception {{can play}} a {{substantial}} role in long distance navigation by animals. I hypothesize that locomotion guided <b>by</b> a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> sense could {{also play a role}} in short distance navigation. Animals identify mates, prey or other short distance navigational goals using different sensory modalities (olfaction, vision, audition, etc.) to detect sensory cues associated with those goals. In conditions where these cues become unreliable for navigation (due to flow changes, obstructions, noise interference, etc.), switching to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> sense to guide locomotion towards the navigational goals could be beneficial. Using simulations based on known locomotory and flow parameters, I show this strategy has strong theoretical benefits for the nudibranch mollusc Tritonia diomedea navigating towards odour sources in variable flow. A number of other animals may garner similar benefits, particularly slow-moving species in environments with rapidly changing cues relevant for navigation. Faster animals might also benefit from switching to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> sense, provided the initial cues used for navigation (acoustic signals, odours, etc.) are intermittent or change rapidly enough that the entire navigation behaviour cannot be guided by a continuously detectable cue. Examination of the relative durations of navigational tasks, the persistence of navigational cues, and the stability of both navigators and navigational targets will identify candidates with the appropriate combination of unreliable initial cues and relatively immobile navigational goals for which this hypothetical behaviour could be beneficial. Magnetic manipulations can then test whether a switch to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> sense occurs. This hypothesis thus provides an alternative when considering the behavioural significance of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> sense in animals...|$|R

The projection and the integration of these data on a one dimensional neural field allows to build a visual compass which accurately reconstructs the local reference in the neighborhood of the locations of learning. We also investigate how this visual compass can be used to calibrate an orientation system, which could be maintained by the odometry. Finally, the global system is validated in an experiment of route learning. I...|$|R

One leading hypothesis is that absorption of light by specialised photoreceptors in the retina produces short‐lived chemical intermediates known as radical pairs whose chemistry is sensitive to tiny magnetic interactions. A potentially serious but largely ignored obstacle to this theory is how directional information derived from the Earth’s magnetic field can {{be separated from the}} much stronger variations in the intensity and polarization of the incident light. Here we propose a simple solution in which these extraneous effects are cancelled by taking the ratio of the signals from two neighbouring populations of magnetoreceptors. Geometric and biological arguments are used to derive a set of conditions that make this possible. We argue that one likely location of the magnetoreceptor molecules would be in association with ordered opsin dimers in the membrane discs of the outer segments of double‐cone photoreceptor cells...|$|R

Such a sensor has not been described in any known literature and is cost-efficient compared to the common method of using two encoders for differentially driven mobile robots. The kinematic analysis and the mechanical design of this sensor are presented in this paper. The maximum mean error of the proposed orientation sensor was about 0. 7 ° during the component tests.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 23 (FGF 23) is a hormone that is {{produced}} by osteocytes and regulates phosphate and vitamin D metabolism through binding to the Klotho-FGF receptor complex. Excessive actions of FGF 23 cause several kinds of hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia. Tumor-induced rickets/osteomalacia (TIO) is a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by overproduction of FGF 23 from the responsible tumors. Because TIO is cured by complete resection of the causative tumors, it is of great clinical importance to locate these tumors. Several imaging methods including skeletal <b>survey</b> <b>by</b> <b>magnetic</b> resonance imaging and octreotide scintigraphy {{have been used to}} identify the tumors that cause TIO.

The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position.

Unlike in birds, however, the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed, this is a surprising finding.

Tilt error of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is compensated using a biaxial accelerometer generally.

In the simulation results, the accuracy of derived error equations is verified. If a biaxial <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is used instead of a triaxial one, the magnetic dip and z-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> data must be estimated for tilt compensation.
