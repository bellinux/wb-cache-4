5000|$|It was {{announced}} in December 2014 that the show would be moved to a [...] "summer slot" [...] {{instead of the usual}} autumn to <b>spring</b> <b>slot</b> from 2015 onwards. Instead Nicky Byrne would host The Million Euro Challenge. It was confirmed by Marty Whelan that Winning Streak would be back on RTÉ One on Saturday 20 June 2015 and would run each Saturday night throughout the summer. However [...] "The Million Euro Challenge" [...] was axed after one series bringing Winning Streak back to its autumn-spring slot.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>spring</b> pins: <b>slotted</b> <b>spring</b> pins and coiled spring pins.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Slotted</b> <b>spring</b> pins are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. <b>Slotted</b> <b>spring</b> pins are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R

50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove pins, <b>slotted</b> <b>spring</b> pins and spirally coiled spring pins.|$|R
25|$|Davison {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the season eighteen closer, Logopolis, although it was to be a year until his first full season in the part began in 1982. In the meantime Alan Hart, Controller of BBC 1, had decided to move the programme from an autumn to a <b>spring</b> transmission <b>slot.</b> This was partly because, after eighteen years on Saturday evenings, he had also decided to change the transmission date, running the series twice-weekly on weekdays instead of once a week on Saturdays. This had the effect of halving the number of weeks the series was on-air to thirteen instead of twenty-six, and moving from an autumn to a spring debut. Additionally, Davison was also working on the BBC sit com Sink or Swim and was unavailable to record enough episodes to make an autumn start date viable.|$|R
40|$|DE 20211698 U UPAB: 20030307 NOVELTY - Each of {{the springs}} {{integrated}} in the shock absorbing sole {{of the shoe}} can be a cylindrically shaped <b>slotted</b> <b>spring,</b> a disk spring, or a spring element assembled {{of at least two}} combined cup springs. The spring elements can be either permanently integrated in the material of the sole or in the fluid or gaseous filling of a particularly designed chamber acting as the sole of the shoe, or removable inserted, facilitating the adjustment and exchange of worn out or inappropriate springs. USE - The shock absorbing spring element can be integrated in the sole of a shoe particularly used in sports. ADVANTAGE - The spring system has a high shock absorbing capacity, it is durable and strong. The energy created by the impact can be used for an economical way of walking or running...|$|R
40|$|For the KEK B-factory, two rings with a {{circumference}} of 3016 m; mainly made of copper, were constructed. A {{gap between the}} flanges is filled using Helicoflex as a vacuum seal. The contact force of an RF finger in a bellows is assured by using a <b>spring</b> finger. Pumping <b>slots</b> are backed by crossing bars to prevent the penetration of beam-induced fields. To obtain a pressure of 109 Torr with the beam when the photo-desorption coefficient reaches 106; the design of pump layout is aimed to realize 100 c s 1 m 1 : NEG strips are used as the main pump. Chemical polishing is applied to clean the extruded surface of a copper chamber. Almost all chambers were baked before installation. Only ion pumps were baked in situ. The photo-desorption coefficient {{at the start of}} commissioning was slightly higher than expected, but a decrease of the coefficient is as expected on the whole. At high currents, some bellows were found to be warmed by the TE mode of beam induced fields. The effect of the electron cloud became evident, especially in the LER. Direct damage by the beam is seen at the surface of the movable mask...|$|R
40|$|Titanium nickelide (nitinol) {{is one of}} {{prospective}} materials for production of special endo-prostheses and other parts and characterized with effect of shape memory. A specific feature of vascular endo-prostheses is the necessity to provide the required rigidity within the temperature interval from 15 to 42 оС. It has been established that titanium nickelide is able to provide the required rigidity but it depends on preliminary heat treatment parameters. So, {{it is important to}} determine rela-tions between rigidity of titanium nickelide wire and its preliminary heat treatment parameters for the given temperature in-terval. The aim of the work is to create devices that allow to estimate radial and flexural rigidity of elements made of flexible nitinol wire for manufacturing various medical products, including endo-prostheses of vessels – stents and stent grafts, filter traps. Laboratory digital scales and a specially developed dynamometer based on a cylindrical <b>slotted</b> <b>spring</b> and inductive displacement transducer have been used for measuring a load. The paper proposes possible variants of device designs used to monitor radial rigidity of blood vessel endo-prostheses, as well as to control flexural rigidity of endo-prosthesis elements and wire for their manufacture. The developed devices allow us to evaluate mechanical characteristics of samples under the desired temperature conditions. An introduction of the developed devices has permitted to carry out an operative control on radial and flexural stiffness of intravascular endo-prostheses elements both under conditions of research investigations and during technological process of their manufacture. Currently, the devices are used to specify heat treatment regimes for nitin-ol wire from various manufacturers while manufacturing vascular endo-prostheses.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a <b>sloted</b> <b>spring</b> pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs. Will be achieved through experimental testing  Testing time should be reasonable, result would preferably be achieved within 2 - 4 weeks. Will be achieved through experimental testing  The testing equipment should be customised for a CA 50 - 50 cam ring. (CA 50 motor series strongest motor 50 Nm/bar) Achieved  Testing equipment should be usable with the current laboratory equipment of Bosh Rexroths (420 bars maximum preassure). Probably achieved  The crack needs to be detected in an appropriate way, to stop the testing. Achieved  The testing equipment {{needs to be able to}} be manufactured by using the developed blueprints. Achieve...|$|R
