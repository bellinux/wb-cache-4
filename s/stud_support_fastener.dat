40|$|Gravity frames {{in steel}} {{buildings}} are inherently simple systems, with beam-to-column connections designed only to resist shear, and composite slab with ribbed metal decking designed for bending or diaphragm action. This simplicity {{has led to}} questions regarding the structural integrity or robustness of these systems. This {{research is part of}} a collaborative research project studying the structural integrity of steel gravity framing systems composed of steel beams and girders with composite slab on metal deck. ^ For the portion of the research conducted at Purdue University, investigation focuses on the composite slab. The concept of structural integrity is often tied {{to the idea of a}} column removal scenario, where the structure would be required to develop alternate load paths. The mobilization of the composite slab as a part of this behavior, theorized to be via membrane or catenary action, shifts the loading in the slab from bending to primarily tension. An initial phase of component tests on the concrete slab on metal deck includes uniaxial tests to evaluate behavior in both orthogonal directions with respect to the deck corrugations, and shear and tension tests of the sidelap splices. Parameters include metal deck thickness and type of sidelap (e. g., button punch, screw, weld). A second phase includes uniaxial tests of the slab transverse to the deck corrugations with additional reinforcement and tension tests of the <b>support</b> <b>fastener</b> connections between the metal deck and beams and girders. An effort is made to apply forces to the specimens in such a way as to be consistent with loading expected in a column removal scenario. ^ The results from the component tests provide important information regarding the response of the composite slab to expected column removal forces. The composite slab is shown to be weak in the transverse direction regardless of sidelap engagement and strong but susceptible to debonding in the longitudinal direction. The experimental results also cast doubt on the ability of the <b>support</b> <b>fasteners</b> to develop the longitudinal strength. These results both support and conflict with various assumptions that have been previously made regarding composite slabs in computational column removal simulations. ^ The acquired experimental data is evaluated from a computational perspective, building on previous work. Subassembly models are created to validate against the component level tests, and the lessons learned are extended to system level modeling. Further model refinement at the system level is accomplished through special consideration of the composite slab to girder connection. Additional parametric studies are carried out to establish the effects of these new adjustments on previously established parametric relationships. These refinements, especially the explicit realistic consideration of the <b>support</b> <b>fastener</b> connection, reduce the capacity of the system below expected gravity loading levels. Some suggestions for improvement are provided. ^ This research provides an important update to knowledge regarding the contribution of the composite slab to structural integrity in steel gravity framing systems, both in terms of experimental data and computational representation. It is expected that this work will lead to improved evaluation of both new and existing structures. ...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated {{testing in}} environments {{aggressive}} {{for the specific}} material have shown that fastener threads that are rolled after strengthening heat treatments have improved resistance to SCC initiation. For example, intergranular SCC was produced in one day when machined (cut) threads of high strength steel (ASTM A 193 B- 7 and A 354 Grade 8) were exposed to an aggressive aqueous environment containing 8 weight % boiling ammonium nitrate and stressed to about 40 % of the steel's yield strength (120 ksi, 827 MPa). In similar testing conditions, fasteners that had threads rolled before heat-treatment (quench and temper) had similar susceptibility to SCC. However, threads rolled after strengthening, exhibited no SCC {{after a week of}} exposure, even when stressed to 100 % of the B- 7 alloy yield strength. Similarly, intergranular SCC was produced in less than one day when machined (cut) threads of nickel-base alloys (X- 750 and aged 625) were exposed to an aggressive 750 F doped steam environment (containing 100 ppm of chloride, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate and a controlled hydrogen overpressure) and stressed to about 80 % of the alloy yield strength (117 ksi, 807 MPa). In similar testing conditions, threads rolled after strengthening exhibited no SCC after 50 days of exposure. This beneficial effect of the optimum thread rolling process (i. e., threads rolled after strengthening) is due to the retention of large residual compressive stresses in the thread roots (notches) which mitigate the applied notch tensile stresses resulting from joint design pre-loads. use of these material specific aggressive environments can provide an accelerated test to verify that threads were produced by the optimum thread rolling process.

Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fire stops can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood <b>studs,</b> <b>supporting</b> a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a fire stop, the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a fire stop provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a fire stop at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical fire stop. Adding batt insulation to fill the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission. Strictly speaking, this is not a fire stop, but it does provide the necessary fire resistance (as shown in the companion study of fire spread) and meets the presc [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Tire studs, with pins {{typically}} {{made out}} of cemented carbide with cobalt (WC-Co), are used in several countries to improve the gripping power during winter. Throughout their use, the tire studs are worn. This leads to emissions of particles, of which some are nano-sized. Until now, WC-Co nanoparticles have seldom been included in environmental risk assessments of nanomaterials. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the magnitude of emissions of WC-Co (nano) particles from tire studs on a national level, compare WC-Co emissions to those of other nanomaterials, and conduct a screening risk assessment of the WC-Co emissions. The country in focus was Sweden, where 66 % of the passenger cars use studded tires during winter. Substance flow analysis (SFA) was used to quantify the mass flows related to tire studs from the raw material extraction phase to the waste management phase. Furthermore, particle flow analysis (PFA) was used to quantify particle number flows in the use phase, where emissions of W-containing nanoparticles have been observed. As part of these quantifications, use phase emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles were calculated using a leaching-type model based on the number of km driven by the Swedish car fleet and experimental measurements of W-emission rates. Two scenarios – a low-emission and a high-emission scenario – were employed. Preliminary results show annual WC-Co emissions of 10 - 10 ^ 3 kg/year and 10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 20 particles/year. These estimated emissions were then compared to estimated emissions of some other nanomaterials in Sweden, including silver, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This comparison indicated that the emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles from tire studs are in the same range as estimated emissions of some of these other nanomaterials. Our estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of WC-Co nanoparticles in road runoff was in the same order of magnitude as measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of W-containing particles. The limited existing ecotoxicity data indicate that much higher concentrations are required in order to reach toxic levels, but further studies are needed to confirm this. Overall, the notable emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles during the use of tire <b>studs</b> <b>support</b> the further study and inclusion of this material in risk-related studies of nanoparticles...|$|R

Procollagenase bound to granular cells and to abundant granules scattered throughout the dermis.

Activated collagenase also bound to dermal mast cells but in addition bound strongly to the dermal collagen.

40|$|This report {{describes}} in-plane experimental {{testing and}} numerical modelling of timberconcrete floor diaphragms. The experimental tests investigated the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the stiffness {{and strength of}} different connections between the diaphragm and the lateral load resisting system. The test model was 1 / 3 scale and three meters square in plan. Seven tests with {{a different kind of}} connection between the floor and the rigid lateral supports (which simulated a timber lateral load resisting system) have been performed. The results of the experimental testing are used to calibrate numerical models which are used to investigate the effects of the floor flexibility on the seismic behaviour of post-tensioned timber buildings. For the experimental tests, screw and nail fasteners were used to connected to floor unit to the lateral <b>supports.</b> These <b>fasteners</b> were embedded into the concrete slab or timber edge joints at different orientations. The stiffness of the diaphragm connections was vastly different for each detail. Screws installed at a 45 ? angle (inclined) to the lateral supports were four times stiffer than the screws installed orthogonal to the lateral supports. The initial stiffness of the inclined fasteners was similar for timber-to-timber and concrete-to-timber connections. For the timberto- timber connections the orientation did not seem to influence the strength of the connection. The tested diaphragm had an uncracked stiffness of 4000 kN/mm and a cracked stiffness of 300 kN/mm. For the tested floor unit it was concluded that the influence of the diaphragm flexibility was negligible compared to the connector flexibility. The floor flexibility can be idealized as three different parts, the deformation of the connectors, the shear deformation of the diaphragm and the flexural deformation of the diaphragm. The numerical analyses showed that in most perceivable situations the connection deformation will govern the in-plane seismic response of the floor. Hence, it is justified to model it as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) element. The influence of the floor flexibility on the seismic response of post-tensioned timber buildings is small. In most cases neglecting the floor flexibility is a conservative approach for the structural design of the building. However, structures with stiff walls and long floor spans there can be a significant amplification of the seismic response. For that case, a simple SDOF representation is proposed. Code-based recommendations for predicting the peak floor accelerations are found to be inadequate. A methodology is proposed to more accurately predict the expected peak floor accelerations for desig...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold‐formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for wall framing in {{many different types of}} structures. One of its main uses has been as non‐structural members in curtain wall assemblies of structural steel framed buildings. In an exterior wall application, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to transfer out of plane loads to the steel frame while not supporting any superimposed gravity loads. Therefore, when the curtain wall is in the plane of the structural steel frame, the vertical deflection of the spandrel beam directly above the wall must be known to provide the appropriate deflection gap between the beam and the curtain wall so that gravity loads are not transferred to the wall. Common practice is to size the gap for the deflection from 100 % of the live load. In some cases, the deflection gap may be significant, and since this gap must also be provided in the exterior cladding of the wall, it creates a design issue for the architect. This report presents the results of an investigation into the feasibility of reducing the size of the deflection gap when the wall is located directly under the spandrel beam. In this study, analytical models were developed for common design situations of curtain walls constructed of cold‐formed steel studs in structural steel framed buildings. This study investigates two common stud heights combined with different floor live loads. Taking into account that wall studs have some available axial compressive strength, a procedure was developed to determine an appropriate reduction for the gap. Using an iterative process a relationship is made between the axial compressive strength of the stud and the amount of axial load the <b>stud</b> can <b>support</b> to establish a factor which gives the percentage the live load gap for 100 % live load can be safely reduced by...|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing {{capacity}} of studs of timber-frame houses can be greatly improved if {{the contribution of}} wall-covering material and insulation is also taken into account (scheme C in figure 1). This principle is use to design a new construction principle for industrially produced dwellings [Moonen 1998]. In this paper the results are presented from experiments to prove the validity of this scheme. In total 16 wall elements with slimline studs and a very thin skin glued to the stud and insulation are tested under compression. The experiments are intended to investigate the minimum thickness of the skin to force the stud to buckle perpendicular to the wall plane. Therefore the slenderness of the studs and also {{the thickness of the}} skin is varied in the test specimen. The composition of the tested wall elements is predetermined by commercial available elements (figure 2 and table 1) because the dimensions of these panels suited well in the scope of the research. And by using ready-made panels we were able to concentrate on the structural behavior of the panels instead of production issues of glued surfaces. These panels are in the Netherlands common used as roof boarding with integrated insulation. The experiments confirmed the chosen scheme and indicated that a 3 mm (1 / 8 inch) skin is amply sufficient to <b>support</b> <b>studs</b> with a slenderness-ratio of 1 : 6 (width : height), forcing the stud to buckle across the strongest axis. The thin skin is also able to transfer 10 - 50 % of the load to the adjacent stud. The test-results have good prospects to develop new elements for timber frame houses. The elements to be developed will lead up to a reduction of structural materials and an improvement of thermal insulation and are expressly tailored to industrial production with improved working conditions...|$|R
40|$|Metallic foams are a {{relatively}} new class of materials with low density and novel physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and acoustic properties. Although incompletely characterized, they offer comparable mechanical performance to traditional spacecraft structural materials (i. e. honeycomb sandwich panels) without detrimental through-thickness channeling cells. There are two competing types of metallic foams: open cell and closed cell. Open cell foams are considered the more promising technology due to their lower weight and higher degree of homogeneity. Leading micrometeoroid and orbital debris shields (MMOD) incorporate thin plates separated by a void space (i. e. Whipple shield). Inclusion of intermediate fabric layers, or multiple bumper plates have led to significant performance enhancements, yet these shields require additional non-ballistic mass for installation (<b>fasteners,</b> <b>supports,</b> etc.) that can consume up to 35 % of the total shield weight [1]. Structural panels, such as open cell foam core sandwich panels, that are also capable of providing sufficient MMOD protection, represent a significant potential for increased efficiency in hypervelocity impact shielding from a systems perspective through a reduction in required non-ballistic mass. In this paper, {{the results of an}} extensive impact test program on aluminum foam core sandwich panels are reported. The effect of pore density, and core thickness on shielding performance have been evaluated over impact velocities ranging from 2. 2 - 9. 3 km/s at various angles.
