5|$|Records of {{tropical}} cyclones in the East Pacific before 1950 are sparse, {{but there were}} still several <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> produced rainfall over Arizona in this period.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the term}} great {{hurricane}} {{was used to}} describe <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> possessed winds of at least 110kn (125mph; 200km/h), large radii (over 160km / 100mi) and that caused large amounts of destruction. This term fell into disuse after {{the introduction of the}} Saffir–Simpson scale in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{names were}} used for named <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> formed in the eastern Pacific in 1962. No names were retired from this list. This {{is a part of}} list 1 and list 2, which was used from 1960-1965. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} in Arizona are not common, {{since the}} predominant wind pattern steers most <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> {{form in the}} Eastern Pacific either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico. As a result, most <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States, with only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes entering US territory. Not all Arizona hurricanes originate from the Pacific Ocean, however; in July 2008 an Atlantic hurricane named Hurricane Dolly produced rainfall in the eastern portion of the state, and another Atlantic storm reached Arizona as a tropical depression. Many, but not all, of these systems also impacted California.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E

5|$|Due to its unusual loop, initial reports {{suggested}} {{it was two}} separate <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it {{was identified as a}} single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} or winter <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> require closing Loveland Pass, {{there is a}} procedure in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use the tunnel. Once per hour, the tunnel bores will be closed to regular traffic, and the trucks will be guided through the tunnel in a convoy with escorts.|$|E
5|$|For <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> {{form in the}} Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, {{encompassing}} {{the area}} between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used {{in a series of}} four rotating lists.

5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Galveston hurricane, {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} {{to hit the}} United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category4 storm. Other examples of <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> peaked at Category4 intensity, and made landfall at that intensity include: Hazel (1954), Gracie (1959), Flora (1963), Cleo (1964), Betsy (1965), Frederic (1979), Joan (1988), Iniki (1992), Luis (1995), Iris (2001), Charley (2004), Dennis (2005), Gustav (2008), Ike (2008), Joaquin (2015), and Harvey (2017).|$|E

5|$|The 1981–82 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} {{destructive}} and deadly in Madagascar, where four cyclones killed 100people and caused $250million (USD) in damage. The season was fairly active, lasting from October to May. There were nine named <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> attained gale-force winds, {{or at least}} 65km/h (40mph). Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, which have 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|The convoy, {{moving at}} , was not {{detected}} for some time, because of two tropical <b>storms</b> <b>that</b> struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, {{the crew of}} a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy.
