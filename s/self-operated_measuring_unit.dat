40|$|International audienceDan {{refers to}} a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for {{capacity}} and a vessel often encountered {{in the management of}} grain during the Qin and the Western Han dynasties. It was only after Wang Mang that it was in general replaced by the hu. As the highest administrative <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity, in Qin and Western Han times it was used in parallel with tong, the highest legal <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity. The unit for capacity dan takes its origin in the regulation stating that 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” and one weight unit dan of a cereal plant just harvested had equal values. This is why 10 dou of “coarsely husked grain” could be called 1 dan “standard husked grain. ” The small dan and the large dan were <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> and vessels specific to the measurement of grain {{in the context of the}} rationing system used in the northern border area. During the Qin and the Western Han time periods, there already existed an absolute value unit “dan” which was neither a weight nor a capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit.</b> “Dan,” being originally a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight, used to measure “cereal plants” just harvested, was pronounced zjya(k); however, since, from the viewpoint of its value, it was equivalent to the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for capacity dan （担）used in the measurement of “standard husked grain”, the latter capacity <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> was also called dan“石”and pronounced ta(m). Simultaneously there occurred a “transformation in the pronunciation of “dan” (石) which was pronounced like dan （担). ” As a result, whether it meant a <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> for weight or for capacity, “dan” (石) in both cases could at the time be pronounced as ta（m). This relates to the fact that today the <b>measuring</b> <b>units</b> for weight and capacity dan are also read in the same way...|$|R

40|$|For online {{quality control}} of car engine production, {{pneumatic}} measurement instrument plays an unshakeable role in measuring diameters inside engine block {{because of its}} portability and high-accuracy. To the limitation of its measuring principle, however, the working space between the pneumatic device and measured surface {{is too small to}} require manual operation. This lowers the measuring efficiency and becomes an obstacle to perform automatic measurement. In this article, a high-speed, automatic measuring system is proposed {{to take the place of}} pneumatic devices by using a laser-based <b>measuring</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> is considered as a set of several measuring modules, where each of them acts like a single bore gauge and is made of four laser triangulation sensors (LTSs), which are installed on different positions and in opposite directions. The spatial relationship among these LTSs was calibrated before measurements. Sampling points from measured shaft holes can be collected by the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit.</b> A unified mathematical model was established for both calibration and measurement. Based on the established model, the relative pose between the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> and <b>measured</b> workpiece does not impact the measuring accuracy. This frees the <b>measuring</b> <b>unit</b> from accurate positioning or adjustment, and makes it possible to realize fast and automatic measurement.
