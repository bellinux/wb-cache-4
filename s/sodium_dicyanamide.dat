40|$|Cyclohexene is an {{important}} intermediate product for a highly efficient and greener formation of major end products like adipic acid, nylon 6, and nylon 6. 6. By using a complex tetra-phase system (g/l/l/s) including hydrogen (g), water (l), an organic phase, i. e., benzene (l), and a supported ruthenium catalyst (s) {{it is possible to}} get the desired intermediate cyclohexene based on benzene. We prepared an oxide-supported ruthenium catalyst that was applied together with minimal amounts of the additive NaDCA (<b>sodium</b> <b>dicyanamide)</b> in a batch and continuous apparatus for the selective benzene hydrogenation. We compared these two processes and reached by an optimization of the reaction parameters in continuous process selectivities up to 50 % at conversions of 36 %. This corresponds to cyclohexene yields of 18 % over a period of 100 h. Finally, the catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and laser scattering to understand the performance of the catalyst and the effect of the small deactivation...|$|E

The cluster/Na(dca) ratio, reaction {{time as well}} as the nature of the solvent dictate the relative ratio of [Mo 3 S 4 (dmpe) 3 Cl 2 (dca) ]PF 6 ([2]PF 6), [Mo 3 S 4 (dmpe) 3 Cl(dca) 2]PF 6 ([3]PF 6) and [Mo 3 S 4 (dmpe) 3 (dca) 3]PF 6 ([4]PF 6). An electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) based protocol was employed for high-throughput optimization of reaction conditions directed to obtain [2 – 4]PF 6 in optimal yield. The incorporation of dca confers significant polarity differences on the [2 – 4]PF 6 series, so that compounds [2 – 4]PF 6 can be efficiently isolated in analytically pure form after silica gel chromatography and represent the first examples of unsymmetrically substituted Mo 3 S 44 + clusters that feature mixed terminal ligands. The structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical consequences of the stepwise Cl/dca replacement along the [1 – 4]PF 6 series are also presented. The distinctive UV/Vis and electrochemical features along the [1 – 4]PF 6 series illustrate the ability to fine-tune the physicochemical properties of Mo 3 S 44 + clusters upon stepwise dca incorporation more efficiently than upon complete ligand substitution...|$|E
40|$|The {{successive}} {{addition of}} KCN and Ph 3 CCl to B(C 6 F 4 -C 6 F 5 - 2) (3) (PBB) affords triphenylmethyl salts of the [NC-PBB](-) anion. By contrast, the analogous reaction with <b>sodium</b> <b>dicyanamide</b> followed by treatment with Ph 3 CCl {{leads to the}} zwitterionic aminoborane H 2 NB(C 12 F 9) (2) C 12 F 8, via nucleophilic attack on an o-F atom, together with CPh 3 [F-PBB]. Whereas treatment of [NC-PBB](-) with either PBB or B(C 6 F 5) (3) fails to give isolable cyano-bridged diborates, the reaction of Me 3 SiNC-B(C 6 F 5) (3) with PBB {{in the presence of}} Ph 3 CCl affords [Ph 3 C][PBB-NC-B(C 6 F 5) (3) ]. Due to steric hindrance this anion is prone to borane dissociation. The longer linking group N(CN) (2) (-) gives the very voluminous anions [N{CNB(C 6 F 5) (3) }(2) ](-) and [N(CN-PBB) (2) ](-). A comparison of propylene polymerisations with rac-Me 2 Si(Ind) (2) ZrMe 2 activated with the various boranes or trityl borates gives an anion-dependent activity sequence, in the order [NC-PBB](-) < [MeB(C 6 F 5) (3) ](-) < [MePBB](-) approximate to [PBB-NCB(C 6 F 5) (3) ](-) approximate to [N{CNB(C 6 F 5) (3) }(2) ](-) < [F-PBB](-) << [B(C 6 F 5) (4) ](-) < [N(CN-PBB) (2) ](-). The anion [N(CN-PBB) (2) ](-) gives a catalyst productivity about 2500 times higher than that of [NC-PBB](-) and exceeds that of [B(C 6 F 5) (4) ](-) based catalysts. The van der Waals volumes and surface areas of the anions have been calculated and provide a rationale for the observed reactivity trends in polymerisation reactions...|$|E
40|$|A Schiff-base ligand, 4 -bromo- 2 -[(2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -dimethylethylimino) methyl]phenol (HL 1), and its reduced {{analogue}} 4 -bromo- 2 -[(2 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -dimethylethylamino) methyl]phenol (HL 2) {{have been}} synthesized. Treatment of HL 1 and HL 2 with Cu(ClO 4) 2 · 6 [*]H 2 O {{in the presence}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>dicyanamide</b> in MeOH and MeCN has been investigated. HL 1 generates [Cu(L 1) (MeOH) (dca) ] (1) in MeOH (dca = dicyanamide) but [Cu 2 (L 1) 2 (dca) 2] (2) in MeCN. HL 2 in MeOH produces [Cu 4 (L 2) 4 (MeOH) 2 (ClO 4) 2] (3). On the other hand, in MeCN an interesting redox reaction is observed. CuII undergoes reduction, and [CuI(MeCN) 4](ClO 4) (4) is formed with concomitant oxidation of HL 2 to HL 1. The solvent-dependent nuclearity change (i. e, conversion of mononuclear species 1 into dinuclear species 2) has been investigated by ESI-MS, through the addition of MeCN to a methanolic solution of 1, and the origin of the conversion has been explained by means of DFT calculations. The catecholase activity of 1, 2 and 3 in MeCN and DMF has been investigated with the model substrates 3, 5 -di-tert-butylcatechol (3, 5 -DTBC), tetrachlorocatechol (TCC) and pyrocatechol (PRC). Compound 1 is inactive with all substrates, whereas 2 is active only with 3, 5 -DTBC in DMF. In contrast, 3 – which exists as a dinuclear species in solution, as is evident from ESI-MS – is highly active with all three substrates, especially in MeCN. The exceptionally high catalytic activity of 3 over 2 is likely to be due to the higher flexibility of the reduced Schiff-base ligand in comparison with its Schiff base analogue...|$|E
