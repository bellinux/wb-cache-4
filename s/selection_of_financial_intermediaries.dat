Four measures <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development are used including an index <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development constructed from three indicators <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development using principal component analysis.

This paper examines whether <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> serve as shock absorbers or shock magnifiers that mitigate or amplify the effect of real and monetary shocks on output fluctuations. Using data from 8 countries of ASEAN- 5 Plus 3, the empirical results indicate that (1) there is strong and robust evidence for the dampening effect <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development on output fluctuations via the propagation of real shocks, (2) there is somewhat weak evidence for the magnifying effect <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development via the propagation of monetary shocks and (3) <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development has strong direct impact on output fluctuations if countries are bankdependent in the cointegration regression.
