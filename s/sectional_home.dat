40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the socio-demographic characteristics {{and quality of}} life of elderly patients with systemic arterial hypertension; to correlate the quality of life with the time of diagnosis and number of medication, as well as to compare the quality of life with the type of medication. METHOD: In this cross <b>sectional</b> <b>home</b> survey design, 460 elderly people from rural areas were involved. The data was collected {{with the use of the}} following instruments: World Health Organization Quality of Life-bref and World Health Organization Quality of Life Olders. A descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation and t-Student test (p< 0. 05) were undertaken. RESULTS: Predominant patient characteristics were: women between the age of 60 and 70, married, four to eight years of formal education, income of one minimum wage, living with their partners. The time of diagnosis was associated with lower quality of life in the physical domain. Elderly patients who used Inhibitors and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme and who did not use AT 1 blocker had lower scores in relation to functioning of the senses. Those who used calcium channel blocker scored higher in relation to autonomy. CONCLUSION: there is a need for actions to control systemic arterial hypertension and its associated complications, with the purpose of improving quality of life...|$|E

By suggesting {{the prospect of}} quick annexation, Jackson raised the danger of war with Mexico, and heightened <b>sectional</b> tensions at <b>home.</b> New England abolitionists charged {{that there was a}} [...] "slaveholding conspiracy to acquire Texas", and Daniel Webster eloquently denounced annexation.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} impact of non-fatal war related {{injuries}} on physical disability in a group of war wounded civilians and to assess their needs.  DESIGN—Cross <b>sectional</b> study. <b>Home</b> interviews were conducted using a structured interview schedule around one month after the injury, to assess impairments, disabilities, and needs.  STUDY POPULATION AND SETTING—War wounded persons in towns and villages in South Lebanon during the attack "Grapes of Wrath" in 1996.  RESULTS—The majority of the study population were young and in their productive age, mostly injured in the street or while hiding in open shelters. Around half of the injuries resulted in impairments, but, there were no age, gender or geographical differentials by severity of impairment. Almost one third (29 %) of the students enrolled in schools {{at the time of the}} injury reported failure to continue their education and 42 % of the working members lost their jobs with no potential for 34 % of them to resume their former jobs. The impact of the injury on impairments, motor disabilities and physical independence was highest for injuries to the lower limbs (age and sex adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1. 62,  95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 25,  2. 10; 2. 98,  95 % CI 2. 09,  4. 23; and 2. 13,  95 % CI 1. 39,  3. 27, respectively). Despite the acute and early relief services provided by all those concerned at the time of the injury, when asked about unmet needs, the majority of the impaired (66 %) reported the need for additional services, mostly medical in nature. The degree of disability was a salient factor for the need for rehabilitative services but not for medical services.  CONCLUSIONS—The chronic and diverse needs of people with war injuries are often neglected and underestimated by the governmental institutions and relief agencies. Research funds as well as services should be allocated to tackle the long term and continuous health and social needs of those injured and their families.    Keywords: war injuries; impairments and disabilitie...|$|R
40|$|Background: In a {{previous}} study, {{the levels of}} pain reported by patients with "possible" vascular dementia (VaD) were higher than those reported by older individuals without dementia. Objective: To examine experienced pain in patients with "probable" VaD, confirmed by brain imaging. Study Design: Observational, cross <b>sectional.</b> Setting: Nursing <b>home.</b> Methods: The participants were 20 nursing home residents (14 females, 6 males) who met the NINDS-AIREN criteria for "probable" VaD and 22 nursing home residents with a normal mental status (18 females, 4 males). The patients were in a mild to moderate stage of dementia. All {{of the participants were}} suffering from arthritis/arthrosis or osteoporosis. Global cognitive functioning was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Pain was assessed by the Coloured Analogue Scale (CAS: original and modified version) and the Faces Pain Scale. The Geriatric Depression Scale and the Symptom Checklist- 90 were used to assess mood. Results: The main finding was that, after controlling for mood, the pain levels indicated by patients with "probable" VaD (M= 102. 32; standard deviation [SD]= 53. 42) were significantly higher than those indicated by the control group (M= 59. 17; SD= 38. 75), only according to the CAS modified version (F[1, 29]) = 5. 62, P= 0. 01,...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To assess neuropsychiatric {{sequelae}} 1 {{year after}} minor head injury in a cross <b>sectional</b> study using <b>home</b> interviews with {{patients and their}} relatives at 1 year after head injury.  METHODS—The study cohort included 148 adults who were admitted to hospital after a minor head injury between 1 July 1994 and 30 June 1995 and showed clinical or radiological evidence of brain injury. Main outcome measures {{used in the study}} were the Glasgow outcome scale, Edinburgh rehabilitation status scale, Barthel index, clinical interview schedule-revised, mini mental state examination, and assessment of symptoms of postconcussional syndrome.  RESULTS—At one year follow up, four (2. 9 %) patients had a severe disability, 35 (25. 5 %) had a moderate disability, and 95 (69. 3 %) had no disability according to the Glasgow outcome scale. A slightly higher proportion (33. 3 %, n= 45) showed disability according to the Edinburgh rehabilitation status scale. Thirty one patients (23. 1 %) scored < 24 in the mini mental state examination. These were mostly patients over the age of 65. Twenty three patients (17. 2 %) were diagnosed as psychiatric cases according to the clinical interview schedule-revised scale. Seventy four (55. 2 %) patients showed one of the symptoms of postconcussional syndrome. The most commonly shown neurobehavioural problems were irritability (30 %), sleep disturbance (29 %), and impatience (27 %).  CONCLUSION—One year after a minor head injury, a substantial proportion of patients showed neuropsychiatric sequelae. ...|$|R
