And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

[...] Herc did say that the biggest shock was the revelation that the Romulans were behind the bombing of the Human Embassy. He gave it a rating of three out of five. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, calling it an [...] "absolutely gripping episode" [...] except for the [...] "ludicrousness of the ending". She made the admission about the ending that, [...] "I suppose the Romulans had to show up at <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> guess Vulcan is as good a place as any." [...] She thought that the torture scenes were [...] "pointless", but was pleased with the characterisation seen in Archer, T'Pol and Tucker. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that the episode was [...] "not perfect, but good" [...] with an [...] "intriguing" [...] ending. He also praised Jeffrey Combs as Shran, and thought that the torture screens were potent but that the ending was rushed. He gave the episode a rating of three out of four. The first home media release of [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] was in the season four DVD box set of Enterprise, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.|$|E

In this paper, <b>I</b> investigate <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>I</b> believe to be of particular interest: {{some of them are}} briefly broached by Meinong, whereas others form an important part of his argument. Moreover, I will connect the discussion with more recent concerns in analytical philosophy. This presentation is structured in the following way. In section (1), I present Meinong’s definition of memory, and contrast it with more recent conceptions. In section (2), I present his epistemological discussion of memory judgements, which is further investigated in section (3), where I discuss the notion of presumptive evidence via the criticisms it elicited from Franz Brentano. At the end of this presentation, we will understand why Meinong’s essay is a landmark in the philosophical investigation of memory...|$|R
