40|$|The American {{financial}} crisis, {{which started}} in 2007, triggered subsequently a global economic decline. To boost the decreasing national economies, many countries introduced various stipulating measures. The automotive industry {{has been among the}} numerous fields, which were affected by the decline. The proclaimed importance of this industry led to the introduction of a new economic tool to support the short-term consumption, usually referred to as the <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> scheme. This scheme stands for a special incentive to purchase a new car. Usually, the incentive is introduced {{in the form of a}} direct financial support or an ex-post tax relief, and is conditioned by scrapping the applicant´s old car. The microeconomic analysis of consumer behaviour proved that the <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> scheme can mitigate the maximum decline of the aggregate consumption, thanks to the shift of the consumption line and of the map of the indifference curves. However, the <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> scheme has many other impacts, whose research should be elaborated. microeconomics, consumer behaviour, <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> scheme, automotive industry...|$|R

40|$|Automotive {{industry}} in several developed countries {{has been the}} back bone of their economies employing {{a large number of}} workers and contributing significantly to the overall industrial output. Sudden decline in demand for new cars caused by reduced finance accessibility and by bleak consumer outlook led many governments to the introduction of special <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> schemes – special programs designed to stimulate new car purchases in search for lower emissions and increased road safety. The question of that time as well as today remains the same: do <b>car</b> <b>scrapping</b> schemes unlock the demand for new cars, alleviate consumer fears and contribute to the long term prospect of car markets or did they simply bring the demand forward, exhaust the market capacity, and immediate gains would be offset later on by lower car sales...|$|R
