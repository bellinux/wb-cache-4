5000|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>chromate</b> (Ag2CrO4) is a brown-red monoclinic {{crystal and}} is a {{chemical}} precursor to modern photography. It can be formed by combining silver nitrate (AgNO3) and potassium chromate (K2CrO4) or sodium chromate (Na2CrO4). This reaction has been important in neuroscience, as it {{is used in the}} [...] "Golgi method" [...] of staining neurons for microscopy: the <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> produced precipitates inside neurons and makes their morphology visible.|$|E
50|$|Brgy. Tubod is {{surrounded}} by mountainous terrains, hills and the famous Mt. Maniayao standing overlooking the town. Pasturelands and mountain ranges, the presence of natural deposit and mineral resources like gold, <b>silver,</b> copper, <b>chromate</b> and iron are all God’s blessings for the Tuboranon to this very day.|$|R
40|$|The gram-negative metal-reducing microorganism, {{previously}} {{known as}} strain GS- 15, was further characterized. This strict anaerobe oxidizes several short-chain fatty acids, alcohols, and monoaromatic compounds with Fe(III) {{as the sole}} electron acceptor. Furthermore, acetate is also oxidized with the reduction of Mn (IV), U (VI), and nitrate. In whole cell suspensions, the c-type cytochrome(s) of this organism was oxidized by physiological electron acceptors and also by gold, <b>silver,</b> mercury, and <b>chromate.</b> Menaquinone was recovered in concentrations comparable to those previously found in gram-negative sulfate reducers. Profiles of the phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids indicated that both the anaerobic desaturase and the branched pathways for fatty acid biosynthesis were operative. The organism contained three lipopolysaccharide hydroxy fatty acids which have not been previously reported in microorganisms, but have been observed in anaerobic freshwater sediments. The 16 S rRNA sequence indicated that this organism belongs in the delta proteobacteria. Its closest known relative is Desulfuromonas acetoxidans. The name Geobacter metallireducens is proposed...|$|R

50|$|Golgi's {{staining}} {{is achieved}} by impregnating fixed nervous tissue with potassium dichromate and silver nitrate. Cells thus stained are filled by microcrystallization of <b>silver</b> <b>chromate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The classic Golgi stain uses {{potassium}} dichromate and silver nitrate to fill selectively with a <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly). This so-called <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths {{up to their}} thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent {{to the lack of}} staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactivity}} of chromate anion with silver {{is lower than}} halides (chloride and others) So, {{in a mixture of}} both ions silver chloride will be formed. Only when no chloride (or any halogen) is left will <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> (red-brown) form and precipitate out.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding {{his work}} in psychiatry, Simarro is largely remembered for a {{contribution}} made in histology when he developed a silver bromide modification of Camillo Golgi's <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> technique. Famed Spanish histologist Ramon y Cajal recognized Simarro's achievement, and mentioned {{that it was a}} milestone that allowed him to abandon general histology and to focus on neurohistology.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cells are}} argentaffin. These reduce silver {{solution}} to metallic silver after formalin fixation. This method {{was discovered by}} Italian Camillo Golgi, by using a reaction between silver nitrate and potassium dichromate, thus precipitating <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> in some cells (see Golgi's method). Other cells are argyrophilic. These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a reductant, for example hydroquinone or formalin.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{endpoint}} {{the solution}} has a milky lemon yellow appearance, {{due to the}} color of the chromate ion and the precipitate of silver chloride already formed. When approaching the endpoint, additions of silver nitrate lead to steadily slower disappearing red colorations. When the red brownish color remains (with grayish spots of silver chloride in it) the endpoint of titration is reached. This is for neutral pH. In very acidic pH, the <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> is soluble, and in alkaline pH the silver precipitated as hydroxide.|$|E
5000|$|The black {{reaction}} consisted in fixing <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> particles to the neurilemma (the neuron membrane) by reacting {{silver nitrate}} with potassium dichromate. This {{resulted in a}} stark black deposit on the soma {{as well as on}} the axon and all dendrites, providing an exceedingly clear and well-contrasted picture of neuron against a yellow background. The ability to visualize separate neurons led to the eventual acceptance of the neuron doctrine. However, Golgi himself was led to a conviction that nervous system is a single network, not of separate cells; the notion called [...] "reticular theory." [...] He supported this discredited theory even in his Nobel lecture.|$|E

50|$|The role of {{electricity}} in nerves was first observed in dissected frogs by Luigi Galvani {{in the second}} half of the 18th century. In the 1820s, Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in animals describing their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior. Richard Caton presented his findings in 1875 about electrical phenomena of the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s that used a <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> salt to reveal the intricate structures of single neurons.

Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The hypotheses of the neuron doctrine were supported by experiments following Galvani's pioneering work in the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons. In the late 19th century, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Johannes Peter Müller, and Hermann von Helmholtz showed neurons were electrically excitable and that their activity predictably affected the electrical state of adjacent neurons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} the nervous system dates back to ancient Egypt but only in the ninetieth century it became more detailed. With the {{invention}} of the microscope and a technique of staining developed by Camillo Golgi, it was possible to study individual neurons. This scientist started to impregnate nervous tissue with metal, as silver. The reaction consists in fixing particles of <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> to the neurilemma, and resulted in a stark black deposit in the soma, axon and dendrites of the neuron. Thus, it was possible to identify different types of neurons, as Golgi Cell, Golgi I and Golgi II.In 1885 there was a German medical researcher called Franz Nissl who developed another staining technique now known by Nissl staining. This technique is slightly different from Golgi staining since it stains the cell body and the endoplasmic reticulum.In 1887, a Spanish scientist called Santiago Ramon y Cajal learned the staining technique with Golgi and started his famous work of neuroanatomy. [...] With this technique he made an extensive study of several areas of the brain and in different species. He also described very precisely the purkinje cells, the chick cerebellum and the neuronal circuit of the rodent hippocampus.In 1941 Dr. Albert Coons used {{for the first time a}} revolutionary technique that uses the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in the tissues. He created an immunoflorescent technique for labelling the antibodies. [...] This technique continues to be widely used in neuroscience studies for identifying different structures. The most important neural markers used nowadays are the GFAB, Nestin, NeuroD antibodies and others. For the past years there are still creating new neural markers for immunocytochemistry or/and immunohistochemistry.In 1953 Heinrich Klüver invented a new staining technique called, Luxol Fast Blue stain or LFB, and with this technique it’s possible to detect demyelination in the central nervous system. Myelin sheath will be stained blue, but other structures will be stained as well.The next revolutionary technique was invented in 1969 by an American scientist called Joseph G. Gall. This technique is called in situ Hybridization and it is used in a large variety of studies but mainly used in developmental biology. With this technique it is possible to mark some genes expressed in determined areas of the animal. In neurobiology, it's very useful for understanding the formation {{of the nervous system}}.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{electrochemical}} oxidation of silver in chromate solutions, and the subsequent reduction of the <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> formed is described. In {{the absence of any}} chromate, only silver dissolution and deposition are observed. In solutions containing 1 × 10 − 3 M chromate, a shoulder corresponding to <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> formation can be observed, but it is largely obscured by c oncurrent silver dissolution. At higher concentrations of chromate, the <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> formation peaks are fully resolved. The <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> grows as a film which, when formed from solutions with low chromate ion concentration (< 10 − 2 M), does not impede the silver dissolution reaction. However, the dissolution process is suppressed when the film is formed from more concentrated chromate solutions. In 1 M chromate solution, when the anodic potential exceeds about 0. 64 V(she), where silver dissolution would have occurred {{in the absence of any}} chromate, the <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> layer continues to thicken, and a second reduction peak is observed. This second reduction peak is associated with the formation of a powdery layer of <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> on the surface of the original compact layer which gives rise to the first reduction peak...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of bicarbonate was undertaken by titration to the methyl orange endpoint.

40|$|UnrestrictedSelf-organized {{patterns}} can {{be formed}} in diffusion experiments where two interdiffusing electrolytes {{react to form}} an insoluble precipitate in a medium (such as gelatin) that permits diffusive motion of ions, but prevents product particles from moving from their site of formation. Various pattern morphologies such as periodic bands, dendritic crystals, and continuous precipitates can be formed in many types of diffusion media. We hypothesized that interfering ions that {{are not part of}} the dominant precipitation reaction could affect the formation of self-organized patterns in a reproducible fashion, and that the same precipitation reaction occurring in different diffusion media would produce different pattern morphologies (depending on the physical and chemical properties of that medium).; To initially characterize the patterns formed by various diffusion/reaction systems, we performed experiments with ferrous carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide precipitation in agarose gel. Ferrous compounds were precipitated under reducing conditions, forming self-organized patterns such as periodic bands, and were subsequently oxidized as atmospheric oxygen diffused into the gel. Mineral replacement occurred upon introduction of a reactant that formed a more insoluble compound than the one already present, and after replacement the banding pattern remained unaltered, allowing identification of the original precipitate.; We also characterized the effects of the diffusion medium and interfering ions on self-organized precipitation in silver nitrate/potassium chromate and silver nitrate/potassium dichromate reaction systems. We observed that precipitate morphology was characteristic of the reactants that were initially present and the type of gel medium in which they precipitated. It was found that soluble impurities in agarose gel were responsible for the slight banding produced in <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> precipitation experiments. We then tested the effects of organic compounds (simple amino acids and their N-acetylated derivatives) on morphologies of <b>silver</b> <b>chromate</b> precipitates in purified agarose gel. High concentrations of pure amino acids caused periodic banding of crystals, and N-acetyl amino acids were more effective than pure amino acids, because of their negative charge. We hypothesized that the length and orientation of the neutral side chain of the amino acids, as well as charge, affects the degree of binding to the crystal surface, and hence the ability to induce banded patterns.; To better apply these studies to self-organized patterns that form in natural systems, where the diffusion medium may be inhomogeneous (such as sand or sandstone), we studied laboratory and field examples of self-organized mineral precipitates in porous media. <b>Silver</b> <b>chromate</b> precipitation experiments in tubes of glass beads and glass bead/gel mixtures produced structures such as finger fluid fronts, periodic banding, and millimeter-size spherules. The spheroidal precipitates produced in our experiments nucleated via self-organizing processes throughout the glass bead medium, and bear morphological resemblance to iron oxide concretions formed via self-organizing processes in the Navajo Sandstone, UT, that preserve records of fluid flow events in a porous and permeable sandstone...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>chromate</b> (Ag 2 CrO 4) photocatalysts are {{prepared}} by microemulsion, precipitation, and hydrothermal methods, {{in order to}} investigate the effect of preparation methods on the structure and the visible-light photocatalytic activity. It is found that the photocatalytic activity of the prepared Ag 2 CrO 4 was highly dependent on the preparation methods. The sample prepared by microemulsion method exhibits the highest photocatalytic efficiency {{on the degradation of}} methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the smaller particle size, higher surface area, relatively stronger light absorption, and blue-shift absorption edge, which result in the adsorption of more MB molecules, a shorter diffusion process of more photogenerated excitons, and a stronger oxidation ability of the photogenerated holes. Considering the universalities of microemulsion, precipitation, and hydrothermal methods, this work may also provide a prototype for the comparative study of semiconductor based photocatalysis for water purification and environmental remediation...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} conductivity and {{catalytic activity}} toward oxygen reduction, silver {{has been used}} as cathode (or electrocatalyst), current collector, or electrical contact in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Here we report our findings on the contamination of silver or a silver-containing cathode from the chromium oxide layer found on a Cr-containing interconnect. Silver wire was attached to a patterned La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 cathode deposited onto a yttrium oxide-stabilized zirconium oxide substrate. The samples were placed inside a temperature- and atmosphere-controlled sample chamber filled with Cr-containing vapor.

Further, the use of in situ Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for probing and mapping new phase formation on electrode surfaces under fuel cell operating conditions is demonstrated...|$|E
