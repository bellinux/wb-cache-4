Such a feature is only reconcilable with the hypothesis of the chain being double, as the Cordillera of Peru and Chili is said to be, geographically, and which in a geological sense it no doubt is: but to the Cordillera the Himalaya offers no parallel. The results of Dr. Thomson's study of the north-west Himalaya and Tibet, and my own of the north-east extreme of Sikkim and Tibet, first gave me an insight into the true structure of this chain. Donkia mountain is the culminant point of an immensely elevated mass of mountains, of greater mean height than a similarly extensive area around Kinchin junga. It comprises Chumulari, and many other mountains much above 20,000 feet, though none equalling Kinchinjunga, Junnoo, and Kubra. The great lakes of Ramchoo and Cholamoo are placed on it; and the rivers rising on it flow in various directions; the Painomchoo north-west into the Yaru; the Arun west to Nepal; the Teesta south- west through Sikkim; the Machoo south, and the Pachoo south-east, through Bhotan. All these rivers have their sources far beyond the great snowed mountains, the Arun most conspicuously of all, flowing completely at the back or north of Kinchinjunga. Those that flow southwards, break through no chain, nor do they meet any contraction as they pass the snowy parts of the mountains which bound the valleys in which they flow, but are bound by uniform ranges of lofty mountains, which become more snowy as they approach the plains of India. These valleys, however, gradually contract as they descend, being less open in Sikkim and Nepal than in Tibet, though there bounded by rugged mountains, which from being so bare of snow and of vegetation, do not give the same impression of height as the isolated sharper peaks which rise out of a dense forest, and on which the <b>snow</b> <b>limit</b> is 4,000 or 5,000 feet lower.|$|E

In this paper, the fundamental traces of the last glaciations in the Abetone area are synthetically illustrated. The data acquired in time by many Authors allowed glacial chronology to be reconstructed, starting from late Upper Pleistocene. As regards the Abetone area (Rio delle Pozze and Torrente Motte valleys), glacial traces referable only to the Alpine Würm III were recognized. In this area, an attempt to reconstruct a relative chronology of the stadial phases identified forms related to Apennines Stages I and II.

40|$|Geomorphological and {{geological}} {{data collected}} {{over many years}} suggest at least eight episodes during which the Tatra Mts. were glaci-ated during the Quaternary. Evidence of glaciers can be found both in the Slovakian and Polish parts of the mountains as glaciofluvial de-posits located at different altitudes, {{and in some cases}} also as terminal and lateral moraines. There are no moraines for the three oldest glaciations, Biber, Donau and Günz, maybe as a result of less intense development of glaciers. During the Mindel (Sanian 2) Glaciation the glaciers occuped a larger area in the High Tatra Mts. in comparison to the Western Tatra Mts., whereas during the succeeding younger pre-Riss (Liviecian) Glaciation their development was more restricted. A greater extent of the Tatra Mts. glaciers occurred again during the Riss I (Odranian) Glaciation, while they were less extensive during the Riss II (Wartanian) Glaciation. During the Würm (Vistulian) Glaciation the glaciers were surprisingly large. This might have resulted from many factors, including changes in atmospheric circulation responsible for the distribution of precipitation, as well as changes in the position of the permanent <b>snow</b> <b>limit</b> due to climatic changes and/or neotectonic movements.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} present and past geomorphological processes {{in an area}} of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines near Abetone was achieved in this study, also by elaborating a geomorphological map at a 1 : 10, 000 scale. In this territory, prevalently characterised by arenaceous rock types and, secondarily, by argillaceous and silty ones, the landforms listed below were recognised. - Structural landforms: the most evident are located near the mountain crest, where the slope face corresponds to the stratum surface of the Macigno Sandstones and where there are structural scarps more than 30 m high. - Glacial landforms and deposits: they include cirques, overdeepened hollows, roches moutonnées and moraine ridges. - Cryogenic and nivation landforms and deposits: among these, block fields, nivation hollows, avalanche tracks and cones, protalus ramparts, block streams and gelifluction deposits should be mentioned. - Gravity-induced slope landforms and processes: besides the presence of particularly developed scree slopes, various types of mass movements have been recognised, such as earthflows, falls and topples, translational slides, rotational and roto-translational slides, as well as deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (Dgsd), the latter characterised by a dominant structural control (NW-SE and SW-NE oriented faults). - Landforms, processes and deposits due to running waters: slopes affected by rill wash, colluvial and alluvial fans, related to concentrated running waters, are present together with swampy deposits filling small structural depressions; moreover, two orders of alluvial terraces, badland forms, debris flows and small waterfalls have been surveyed. Since the hydrographic network is in a deepening stage, present alluvial deposits are found only upstream of the numerous wiers that dam the courses of the Pozze and Motte torrents. - Anthropogenetic landforms and deposits: among Man's activities which modify the landscape, the construction of large parking areas and ski pistes should be mentioned; these kinds of activities have produced slope cuts and filling of some small swampy areas. The data acquired allowed geomorphological events to be reconstructed starting from late Upper Pleistocene. In particular, in this sector of the Northern Apennines glacial traces ascribable only to the glaciation known in the Alps as Würm III were found. An attempt to reconstruct a relative chronology of the stadial phases was also carried out, thus identifying forms related to Apennines Stage I, which was characterised by two distinct stages with snow limits respectively of 1, 611 and 1, 663 m a. s. l., and Apennines Stage II, also characterised by two phases with a <b>snow</b> <b>limit</b> ranging between 1, 770 and 1, 836 m. Apennines Stage III did not leave any trace since, according to the previous authors, its permanent <b>snow</b> <b>limit</b> would be found at heights superior to those of the Apennine peaks of this area.

Such temporal and spatial disparity in phenology is difficult to balance without properly matched scenes. Unburned dNBR may not be normally distributed, and the bias and standard deviation are typically larger than the previous examples (Figure 8 right). Because the ecological effect is spatially variable, general calibration by the unchanged bias may not be desirable. This scenario may be common in alpine or dry ecotypes, including herb and shrub communities that are moisture or <b>snow</b> <b>limited</b> (Grau and Veblen 2000). Growth can vary dramatically year-to-year depending on stochastic weather; so multi-temporal scenes can be challenging to match. The distribution and density of green foliage, soil moisture and snow are key factors, not simply time of year. Obviously, datasets that are not phenologically matched have reduced application to burn analysis derived from multi-temporal ecological difference.|$|R
