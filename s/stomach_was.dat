5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was {{an effective way to}} discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> empty, ghrelin is secreted. When the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> stretched, {{secretion}} stops. It acts on hypothalamic {{brain cells}} both to increase hunger, {{and to increase}} gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake.|$|R
2500|$|The word <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from}} the Latin [...] which is {{derived from the}} Greek word stomachos (...) , {{ultimately}} from stoma (...) , [...] "mouth".

50|$|Gastropexy is a {{surgical}} operation {{in which the}} <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> sutured to the abdominal wall or the diaphragm. Gastropexys in which the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> sutured to the diaphragm are sometimes performed as a treatment of GERD to prevent the stomach from moving up into the chest.|$|R
5|$|Her mantra may be {{repeated}} ten thousand times, repeated one thousand times while offering flowers and ghee {{in a fire}} sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while offering water (Arghya) or while offering food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people. A rice-flour bread prepared while repeating her mantra is said to give the power to attract women. It is likewise {{said that it is}} possible to make a person one's slave by feeding him or her the ashes of a crow whose <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> stuffed with a conch and burnt in a cremation ground while repeating the goddess' mantra.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} the {{creature}} that eventually {{marked the end of}} the attacks is credited to a local hunter named Jean Chastel, who shot it during a hunt organised by a local nobleman, the Marquis d'Apcher, on June 19, 1767. Writers later introduced the idea that Chastel shot the creature with a bullet self made with silver and upon being opened, the animal's <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> shown to contain human remains.|$|E
25|$|Both {{species of}} gastric-brooding frogs were very {{different}} in appearance and behaviour from other Australian frog species. Their large protruding eyes and short, blunt snout along with complete webbing and slimy bodies differentiated them from all other Australian frogs.

25|$|The {{digestive}} tract can mostly be traced, either because the intestines are still present {{or by the}} presence of food items. The position of the oesophagus is indicated by a five millimetre long series of small food particles. Below the ninth dorsal vertebra the location of the stomach is shown by a cluster of bones of prey animals, the organ itself likely having been dissolved by its own stomach acid shortly after death. The rather backward position of the cluster suggests the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> dual in structure, with a forward enzyme-secreting proventriculus preceding a muscular gizzard. Gastroliths have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{thylacine}} was exclusively carnivorous. Its <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> muscular, {{and could}} distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey {{in the general direction}} of an individual waiting in ambush. Trappers reported it as an ambush predator.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{rarity of}} {{complete}} fossils, these very rare intact specimens do {{allow us to}} gain an insight into the internal organ arrangement of the Thelodonts. Some specimens described in 1993 {{were the first to}} be found with a significant degree of three-dimensionality, ending speculations that the Thelodonts were flattened fish. Further, these fossils allowed the gut morphology to be interpreted, which generated much excitement: their guts were unlike those of any other agnathans, and a <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> clearly visible: this was unexpected, as it was previously thought that stomachs evolved after jaws. Distinctive fork-shaped tails - usually characteristic of the jawed fish (gnathostomes) - were also found, linking the two groups to an unexpected degree.|$|E

25|$|According to Livy, writing {{five hundred}} years after the fact, Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession. Livy says that Menenius told the {{soldiers}} a fable about {{the parts of the}} human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body. The rest of the body thought the <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach. Soon, the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they were nothing without it. In the story, the stomach represents the patrician class and the other body parts represent the plebs. Eventually, Livy says, an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs, which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the female {{swallowed}} the fertilized eggs her <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> no {{different from that of}} any other frog species. In the jelly around each egg was a substance called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which could turn off production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This source of PGE2 was enough to cease the production of acid during the embryonic stages of the developing eggs. When the eggs had hatched the tadpoles created PGE2. The mucus excreted from the tadpoles' gills contained the PGE2 necessary to keep the stomach in a non-functional state. These mucus excretions do not occur in tadpoles of most other species. Tadpoles that don't live entirely off a yolk supply still produce mucus cord, but the mucus along with small food particles travels down the oesophagus into the gut. With Rheobatrachus (and several other species) there is no opening to the gut and the mucus cords are excreted. During the period that the offspring were present in the stomach the frog would not eat.|$|E
25|$|Held in a {{prisoner}} of war camp, Clifton soon managed to escape and made his way as far as the Swiss border before being recaptured. Transferred to a punishment camp at Gavi, he made three further escape attempts, the last of which was in September 1943 and involved the digging of a tunnel with 60 other prisoners. Detected before they could break out, the prisoners were moved to a camp in Germany. While en route, Clifton jumped from the train transporting them through Germany. His escape was short lived and while hiding in a bush near the train tracks, he was shot in the leg and stomach by a guard. Other prisoners, under guard, retrieved him and dressed his wounds. Taken to a hospital, he was treated for his wounds; the bullet, which had lodged in his <b>stomach,</b> <b>was</b> later given to him as a souvenir. In March 1944, after recuperating for four months, he was placed in a camp near Hadamar which was specially designated for recidivist escapees.|$|E

40|$|Esophagoplasty with isoperistaltic <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> {{a useful}} and {{satisfactory}} means of {{reconstruction of the}} esophagus. It is simpler {{and there is no}} necessity for using a reversed gastric tube. The most essential points of technique for the modelling of the <b>stomach,</b> <b>is</b> taking advantage of the ample intramural vascular network and adequate selection of the highest point of the stomach for the site of the esophago-or pharyngogastrostomy. To utilize the intramural vascular network, sufficient width of the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> necessary. This also allows stretching of the stomach. Esophageal resection and reconstruction using the isoperistaltic stomach above the level of the neck was performed on 130 cases. Among them 40 cases were pharyngogastromies and 90 cases were cervical esophagogastromies. There was one operative death due to alcoholic liver cirrhosis (operative mortality rate 0. 8 %). If the <b>stomach</b> <b>is</b> properly handled, esophageal replacement by the isoperistaltic stomach gives constant success...|$|R
25|$|Caribou or wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti (tuntu, tuntupik or tuntupiaq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tuntupig in Cup'ig). Prior to European contact, caribou were {{important}} not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. The second most commonly received resources for Manokotak residents were caribou (%64.8 of households). Caribou meat was often made into jerky. The stomach contents such as sedges and other greens, were eaten. Virtually all of the edible parts of the animal was utilized. Caribou have been absent from Nunivak Island for at least 100 years, {{but many of the}} procedures for preparing the flesh of this animal also apply to the domestic reindeer. In earlier times, however, caribou livers were placed in the animal's stomach to ferment; this is no longer done. The lining of a reindeer <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> cut up and eaten with dried fish or by itself. Lungs and kidneys were given to the dogs, but the heart was eaten. Neither caribou meat nor fish were ever pounded as a method of preservation.|$|E
25|$|On his return, de Hory {{discovered}} that his paintings were fetching high prices at several art galleries, and was incensed that the galleries had only paid him {{a fraction of}} what they thought the paintings were worth. Further compounding de Hory's plight was that the manner of his forgeries had become recognizable, and he was now a person of interest to the FBI. This unwanted attention may have prompted de Hory to temporarily abandon his fakery and resume creating his own artwork once more. This led him to an ascetic existence in a low-rent apartment near Pershing Square in Los Angeles. Here, he had limited success, mostly selling paintings of pink poodles to interior decorators. However, his self-imposed exile was not to his liking. He decided to return to the East Coast and try his luck once more at his illicit craft, for which he always found an eager buyer—eventually. In Washington DC, de Hory began an ill-fated association with a picture dealer that ended in disaster. In 1959, suffering from depression, he attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping pills. A friend rescued him and called an ambulance. His <b>stomach</b> <b>was</b> pumped, and after a stay in the hospital, de Hory convalesced in New York City, helped by an enterprising young man, Fernand Legros.|$|E
