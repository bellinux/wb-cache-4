40|$|The Kennedy Igneous Province (KIP) {{in north}} Queensland, Australia is host to a gold mineralising event (8. 5 Moz) {{associated}} with Carboniferous–Permian aged magmatism. Gold production was {{mainly from the}} shallowly emplaced (< 5 km) hydrothermal breccia pipe hosted gold deposits like Kidston, Mt Leyshon and Mt Wright. The Kidston and Mt Leyshon deposits share characteristics with intrusion-related gold systems of the Tintina Gold Province, Yukon and Alaska. This suggests north Queensland is prospective for intrusion-related gold deposits or intrusion-related gold systems. The thesis focused on whether two gold occurrences, the Empire <b>Stockworks</b> and Douglas Creek gold mineralisation, share similarities with other intrusion-related gold systems. Empire <b>Stockworks</b> gold mineralisation is temporally and spatially associated with rhyolite dykes located on the eastern margin of the Empire dacite hydrothermal breccia pipe. A number of Empire <b>Stockworks</b> characteristics are similar to other shallow intrusion-related gold systems. The geochemistry of the Empire <b>Stockworks</b> rhyolite dykes suggest they are weakly to strongly oxidised (Fe₂O₃, 0. 5 - 8), sub-alkaline (1, -ve Eu compared to REECN) intrusions derived from a crustal source (depleted in Ba, Nb, La, Ce, Sr, P and Ti compared to primitive mantle).

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the research results in mineralogy for the Shanggong gold depost, E Qinling, China, and defines a three-stage {{evolution of the}} hydrothermal metallogenesis. The early stage was marked by milky coloured, coarse-grained quartz veins, in which minerals were obviously broken and deformed with little gold. The early stage mineralization {{was caused by a}} lithostatic fluid-system of metamorphic origin in a compressive setting. The middle stage is characterized by fine-disseminated <b>stockworks</b> composed of polymetallic sulfides-tellurides-native elements. The <b>stockworks</b> filled in conjugate joints or other fissures, and show no deformation. Minerals of this generation contain much high gold and non-lattice elements. Native gold and minerals of the generation precipitated coevally in boiling phase of a metamorphic fluid-system. The fluid-boiling event was resulted from rapidly crustal uplift and erosion. The late stage formed comb-like quartz-carbonate veinlets with very low content of Au. In a extensional tectonic setting, input of hydrostatic, meteoric water into extensional fractures resulted in development of late-stage veinlets. Geological and geochemical characteristics of the Shanggong gold deposit was {{are similar to those of}} orogenic-type. Metallogenesis of the Shanggong deposit was coeval with continental collision between the Yangtze and North China plates.

The Fosterville Fault is a planar mineralized structure with significant old mine workings in the oxidized zone over a strike length of 8 km. The present Central Ellesmere and F. osterville prospects are situated along the Fosterville Fault. The style of mineralization present in the Fosterville goldfield is a sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposit, along the Fosterville Fault Zone. Gold occurs within sediment hosted arsenopyrite and pyrite, in crystal lattice and/or as minute inclusions. The mineralized fault breccia and associated <b>stockworks</b> are vertical to sub-vertical and up to 30 m in width; only very minor quartz veining occurs. The origin of the Fosterville gold deposit {{is considered to be}} genetically related to a granite source, with a temperature for the mineralizing fluid of approximately 370 oc. The depth of the system range from 6. 5 - 10 km. PIXE (proton-induced x-ray emission) and AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy) have been very useful in analyzing for trace elements in vein quartz. The Fosterville quartz shows generally high levels of trace elements. The analyses showed positive correlation between the presence ofK, Ge, AI and As with Au in the host rock and ihe intensity of the EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) of quartz veins. There is a highly significant correlation between the Ge content and EPR of the quartz at the absorption peak at g 2. 0027. The present study indicates that the paramagnetic centre is Ge-AI related. The high correlation between Ge, Au and EPR suggests that EPR and Ge may be used as an indicator of gold mineralization in this type of deposits.
