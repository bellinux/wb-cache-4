50|$|Under the 1941 scheme, when divisional antitank battalions were {{converted}} to tank destroyers, they were renumbered.

50|$|In the military, {{vehicles}} such as trucks or tractor units {{can be used}} {{to transport}} or launch missiles (rockets with warheads), essentially a form of rocket artillery. Such a vehicle may transport one or multiple missiles. The missile vehicle may be a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>unit</b> or the missile holder/launcher may be on a trailer towed by a prime mover. They are used in the military forces of a number of countries in the world. Long missiles are commonly transported parallel to the ground on these vehicles, but elevated into an inclined or vertical position for launching. Missile vehicles include transporter erector launchers (TEL) and multiple rocket launchers (MRL) such as the Patriot missile system. Single or dual missile vehicles often transport their missiles uncovered. The missile batteries of multiple rocket launchers often hold their missiles inside tubular or rectangular canisters for each missile, from which the missiles or rockets can be launched (or fired, in other words). Many missile trucks use pneumatic (air-filled) tires, although they may be large and specialized for offroad travel. However, some missile vehicles use tractor crawler drive similar to that of a tank.|$|E

40|$|Labour-intensive manual digging {{with various}} sorts of spades or forks {{is the most}} common {{technique}} to control broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius). Machines for removing roots exist, but are not in use. The process leaves undesired holes in the ground and large quantities of soil have to be removed. An invention for separating the fertile soil from the roots directly in the field and refilling the holes thus created would represent a significant advance. Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon ART has developed a separation unit to improve the mechanical weeding process. The separator unit consists of three paired rotary brushes (d = 200 mm,l = 250 mm) and an oscillating sieve (surface: 200 x 500 mm, gaps: 15 x 500 mm). In the summer 2011 a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>unit</b> dug out 174 Rumex obtusifolius plants on grassland on the experimental farm in Tänikon. The cleaned soil was used in situ to refill the holes created. The weight of both the excavated and cleaned soil was recorded. A RTK-GPS device enabled the exact position of plants to be located. Three months after treatment, the treaded places had been evaluated. In 160 cases (92 %) where Rumex plants had been removed at the same positions no plants regrew. The used standard adjustment could separate 55 to 80 % of the total excavation, depend on field condition. Disadvantages are the transport of 1. 2 kg of soil and root material per plant in average and high efforts on machine construction...|$|E

50|$|The most {{significant}} employment of tank destroyers in Normandy was in early August, {{at the battle}} of Mortain, where the 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion (towed 3-inch guns) was on the defensive alongside the 30th Infantry Division. The division, which was in temporary positions and not prepared for a defensive engagement, was attacked by elements of four panzer divisions on 6 August, under heavy fog. The 823rd put up a strong defense—knocking out fourteen tanks—but took heavy losses, being mostly overrun and losing eleven guns. This served to reinforce misgivings about the effectiveness of the towed units, and a report delivered to the Pentagon in December recommended they be phased out in favor of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train may consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a <b>self-propelled</b> multiple <b>unit</b> (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while {{at about the same time}} <b>self-propelled</b> multiple <b>unit</b> vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.|$|R
