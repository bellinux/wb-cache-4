5|$|Before the 2006 season, Westerman was {{involved}} in a car accident with teammates Willie Foster and Corey Hyman. Westerman and Foster were uninjured while Hyman required two stitches in his forehead. On September 29, against South Florida, Westerman sacked quarterback Matt Grothe for a five-yard loss. After the month of September, Westerman had eight tackles and two and a half <b>sacks.</b> Through eight games, Westerman was the team leader in <b>sacks</b> with six. Against Connecticut, Westerman blocked a punt and recovered a fumble by Connecticut quarterback D. J. Hernandez. Both the punt and fumble recovery were returned for a touchdown. Westerman also recorded two and a half <b>sacks</b> in the game. By the final game in the season, Westerman and defensive end William Beckford had a combined 59 tackles, 16 tackles for a loss with 10 <b>sacks.</b> In the Texas Bowl against the Kansas State Wildcats, Westerman sacked quarterback Josh Freeman twice and recovered a Freeman fumble. Westerman was named second–team All–Big East following the season along with teammates Brian Leonard, Cameron Stephenson, Pedro Sosa, Jeremy Ito, Ramel Meekins, Devraun Thompson, Ron Girault and Courtney Greene.|$|E

Outside linebackers Lamarr Houston (8), Willie Young (6.5) and Pernell McPhee (6) recorded a combined 20.5 <b>sacks,</b> becoming one of only five defensive trios with at least six <b>sacks</b> per player in 2015. Houston, coming off a season-ending ACL injury in 2014, converted from defensive end to outside linebacker; he did not play much during the early portion of the season until Jared Allen was traded. He played only four snaps against the Vikings, but recorded 28 tackles, five <b>sacks</b> and six TFLs in from week nine to fourteen. In the final nine games, he had seven <b>sacks,</b> the sixth-most in that stretch. Young, who also switched from DE to OLB, recorded a sack in five consecutive games (weeks eleven to fifteen), the third player in franchise history to do so after Steve McMichael and Brian Urlacher. In the first seven games of 2015, McPhee recorded five <b>sacks,</b> 42 tackles and seven TFLs, while Sam Acho had 60 tackles, three TFLS, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Meanwhile, inside linebackers Christian Jones and Shea McClellin had the second- and third-most tackles for the Bears with 96 and 96, respectively.

5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 <b>sacks</b> {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ <b>sacks.</b> In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ <b>sacks</b> and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career <b>sacks</b> and led the Rams in <b>sacks</b> nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

40|$|Control Protocol (TCP) {{selective}} acknowledgment (<b>SACK),</b> every <b>SACK</b> block needs 8 bytes {{to carry}} {{information about the}} received packets, back to the sender.

Under some error conditions, this limitation can force the TCP sender to retransmit packets that have already been received successfully by the receiver. This paper puts forward a proposal to modify the present <b>SACK</b> implementation, in order to prevent these unwanted retransmissions. We show that the proposed implementation of <b>SACK</b> mechanism increases the throughput of <b>SACK</b> enabled TCP connections...|$|R

5|$|The Seminole {{defense was}} led by nose guard Corey Simon, who {{accumulated}} 48solo tackles, four <b>sacks,</b> and one interception. For his accomplishments during the regular season, Simon earned consensus first-team All-America honors. Despite his accomplishments, Simon was not the Seminoles' leading tackler.

In total, Florida State's defense was No.1 in college football in terms of <b>sacks</b> (43) and 15th in tackles for loss (7.2 per game). Florida State placed a priority on containing Tyrod Taylor and preventing him from scrambling for extra yardage. The Seminoles were 39th nationally in total defense, allowing an average of 341 yards per game.|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} defined {{behavior for}} a standards-compliant Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) selective acknowledgment (<b>SACK)</b> sender, upon a retransmission timeout (RTO), is to infer that all previously-received <b>SACK</b> information is invalid. As all <b>SACK</b> information is advisory, {{it may be}} discarded at any time by either endpoint; however, discarding <b>SACK</b> information may have a detrimental impact on the connection’s ability to recover without unnecessary retransmissions. In this thesis, we analyze traces from actual Internet traffic to determine the behavior of <b>SACK</b> TCP endpoints, to determine {{the frequency with which}} they renege. We show that an inference between retransmission timeouts and <b>SACK</b> reneges is not valid in the majority of instances, and propose a mechanism for detecting invalid <b>SACK</b> state. Such a mechanism would allow senders to maintain <b>SACK</b> information beyond an RTO, while still allowing a receiver to discard out-of-sequence data when necessary. Furthermore, we claim that using such a detection mechanism may improve the recovery of connections after a retransmission timeout. Approved...|$|R

5|$|Wool {{and hides}} were the major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 <b>sacks</b> of wool and 36,100 leather hides. The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 <b>sacks</b> of wool and 17,900 hides. The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 <b>sacks,</b> but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 <b>sacks.</b> The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|E

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship.

The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
