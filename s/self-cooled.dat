50|$|Beal Aerospace {{initially}} {{considered a}} rocket that used kerosene and liquid oxygen, but soon switched to kerosene fuel {{in combination with}} high concentration hydrogen peroxide oxidizer. This combination was selected {{in order to avoid}} the expense and complexity of cryogenic storage, and to reduce development costs. Kerosene was injected into the hot steam and oxygen exhaust products of catalytically decomposed hydrogen peroxide, resulting in spontaneous ignition. The original BA-1 launch vehicle design was intended to service the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite constellation launch market, but was replaced by the much larger BA-2 design when it was decided to concentrate on the more stable Geostationary satellite launch market as the LEO constellations became financially unsound. All three stages of the BA-2 vehicle were to be pressure-fed using high-pressure helium storage to replace the expense and complexity of turbopumps.

50|$|Small {{dry-type}} and liquid-immersed transformers {{are often}} <b>self-cooled</b> by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|E

They offer the possibility to design mechani-cally simple blanket segments, employ a high-temperature, low-pressure coolant, allow for a high power density, and as consequences of these, achieve high efficiency and availability with relatively low cost. A major concern with <b>self-cooled</b> blankets is the high chemical reactivity of lithium with water. A secondary heat transport loop is usually required between the primary lithium loop and the steam:water loop of the Rankine cycle in the power conversion.

40|$|The <b>self-cooled</b> lithium-vanadium fusion blanket {{concept has}} several {{attractive}} operational and environmental features. In this concept, liquid lithium works as the tritium breeder and coolant to alleviate issues of coolant breeder compatibility and reactivity.

However, this concept has poor attenuation characteristics and energy multiplication for the DT neutrons. An advanced <b>self-cooled</b> lithium-vanadium fusion blanket concept has been developed to eliminate these drawbacks while maintaining all the attractive features of the conventional concept. An electrical insulator coating for the coolant channels, spectral shifter (multiplier, and moderator) and reflector were utilized in the blanket design to enhance the blanket performance.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} the most promising liquid breeder blankets currently proposed for testing in ITER. The critical MHD issues for <b>self-cooled</b> and dual coolant LM systems are the MHD pressure drop and flow distribution with ideal and imperfect insulator barriers/coatings, ideal and imperfect flow channel inserts, and complex geometry flow elements like expansions, contraction, manifolds, etc. Separately cooled LM systems still must circulate the LM for tritium removal, and similar MHD issues may limit flow velocity and influence tritium permeation due to creation of stagnant regions and other non-ideal flow distribution effects. Molten salt breeder/coolants have significantly reduced electrical conductivity as compared to LMs, and MHD pressure drop is not considered a serious issue. However, MS also has much lower thermal conductivity, and the heat transfer to/from the structure depends on turbulent convection. The degradation of convective heat transfer by MHD turbulence modification/suppression is of great interest for both <b>self-cooled</b> MS systems where first wall cooling may need to be enhanced, and dual coolant MS systems where heat transfer from the hot breeder to the cooler wall needs to be suppressed. These issues are discussed in detail and development plans specifically for the dual-coolant PbLi concept, up to and including integrated testing in ITER, are presented. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{power plant}} {{conceptual}} study (PPCS) {{has been conducted}} {{in the framework of}} the European fusion programme with the main objective to demonstrate the safety and environmental advantages and the economic viability of fusion power. Power plant models with limited (''near term concepts'') and advanced plasma physics and technological extrapolations (''advanced concepts'') were considered. Two near term plant models were selected, one employing a water cooled lithium-lead (WCLL), and the other one a helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) blanket.

40|$|The dual-coolant (DC) blanket - {{characterized}} by its simple construction, simple function, and high thermal efficiency - {{is one of}} the EU advanced blanket concepts to be investigated {{within the framework of the}} power plant conceptual study (PPCS). Its basic concept is based on the use of helium-cooled ferritic steel structure, a <b>self-cooled</b> Pb- 17 Li breeding zone, and SiC_f/SiC flow channel inserts serving as electrical and thermal insulators. The present PPCS stage III is largely based on the preparatory study on fusion plant availability (PPA) carried out in 1999 with the objective to perform the conceptual design of the DC blanket (model C). Some details are to be selected in accordance with the overall strategy, which allows an extrapolation of the present knowledge between the near-term blanket concept solutions: water-cooled lead-lithium (WCLL, model A), helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB, model B), and the very advanced concept of <b>self-cooled</b> Pb- 17 Li SiC_f/SiC (SCLL, model D). In the PPCS the electrical reactor power is normalized to a typical value of commercial reactors of 1, 500 MW, which requires iterative calculations between the blanket layout and the system code analysis.

40|$|Two {{types of}} GaAs-based microcoolers have been {{demonstrated}} for the first time. One has a 2 μm thermal barrier made from a 100 -period Al 0. 10 Ga 0. 90 As - Al 0. 20 Ga 0. 80 As superlattice. Another has a thermal barrier made from a 5. 2 μm Al 0. 10 Ga 0. 90 As layer. Microcoolers of these two types with a size of 60 μm x 60 μm show maximum cooling temperatures around 0. 8 °C and 2 °C at heatsink temperatures of 25 °C and 100 °C respectively. The microcoolers have potential to provide in situ cooling for semiconductor devices. ^ As an application of in situ cooling, a unipolar <b>self-cooled</b> laser structure is proposed and has been fabricated. The structure integrates a graded-index (GRIN) separate confining heterostructure (SCH) strained-layer InGaAs quantum well (QW) laser unit and a single-layer AlGaAs cooler using an Esaki tunnel junction as a connector. In this scheme, cooling exists on {{two sides of the}} tunnel junction. Broad-area lasers of this structure with a cavity length of 500 μm have an average threshold current density around 212 A/cm 2. A preliminary method is proposed to evaluate the cooling effect of the integrated cooler. With this method, cooling can be estimated from the movement of the spectrum of the laser, excited by pulsed current, as the pulse width varies. Using this method, potential 2 ∼ 4 °C temperature reduction {{as a result of the}} integrated cooler is found in the active layer of the <b>self-cooled</b> laser. ^ Some technological platforms have been built-up to support the investigations on the microcoolers and <b>self-cooled</b> laser structure. Firstly, some primary MOCVD technologies such as controlling compositions, fabricating high quality interfaces, and doping have been developed for the MOCVD system itself and the compound semiconductor group. Secondly, annealing parameters—temperature and time—have been optimized for making ohmic contacts in a homemade carbon-stripe furnace. Thirdly, the SiH 4 flow rate for doping the n-side of GaAs tunnel junction has been optimized to obtain a tunnel junction with low zero-bias tunnel resistance. A low zero-bias specific tunnel resistance of 9. 59 × 10 − 5 Ω·cm 2 has been achieved, which is the best reported result for the tunnel junction grown at normal growth temperatures. Theoretical evaluation and experimental results indicate that tunneling of the tunnel junction with the n-side doped with optimal SiH 4 flow rate is mainly defect-assisted. Finally, a nominal- 980 -nm In 0. 2 Ga 0. 8 As GRIN-SCH strained-layer QW laser has been grown, fabricated, and characterized. ...|$|E

The facility consists of an outer cryostat containing a superconducting NbTi dipole magnet with a bore of 56 mm and a maximum operating field of 9. 5 T. The current through the magnet is supplied by an external 16 kA power supply and fed into the cryostat using <b>self-cooled</b> leads.

This approach makes it possible to change samples while keeping the background magnet cold, and thus decreasing the helium consumption and cool-down time of the samples. The cable samples are connected through <b>self-cooled</b> leads to an external 32 kA power supply. The lower bath of the inner cryostat, containing the sample holder, is separated by means of a so called lambda-plate from the upper bath and can be cooled down to 1. 9 K.

40|$|The second Japan/US Program on Irradiation Tests for Fusion Research (JUPITER-II) {{began on}} April 1, 2001. Part of the {{collaborative}} research centers on {{studies of the}} molten salt 2 LiF 2 –BeF 2 (also known as Flibe) for fusion applications. Flibe has been proposed as a <b>self-cooled</b> breeder in both magnetic and inertial fusion power plant designs over the last 25 years. The key feasibility issues {{associated with the use}} of Flibe are the corrosion of structural material by the molten salt, tritium behavior and control in the molten salt blanket system, and safe handling practices and releases from Flibe during an accidental spill. These issues are all being addressed under the JUPITER-II program at the Idaho National Laboratory in the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) facility. In this paper, we review the program to date in the area of tritium/deuterium behavior, Flibe mobilization under accident conditions and testing of Be as a redox agent to control corrosion. Future activities planned through the end of the collaboration are also presented...|$|E
