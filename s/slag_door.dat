50|$|AC {{furnaces}} usually {{exhibit a}} pattern of hot and cold-spots around the hearth perimeter, with the cold-spots located between the electrodes. Modern furnaces mount oxygen-fuel burners in the sidewall {{and use them to}} provide chemical energy to the cold-spots, making the heating of the steel more uniform. Additional chemical energy is provided by injecting oxygen and carbon into the furnace; historically this was done through lances (hollow mild-steel tubes) in the <b>slag</b> <b>door,</b> now this is mainly done through wall-mounted injection units that combine the oxygen-fuel burners and the oxygen or carbon injection systems into one unit.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the scrap}} has {{completely}} melted {{down and a}} flat bath is reached, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace and melted down, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. After the second charge is completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A foaming slag is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the <b>slag</b> <b>door</b> into the slag pit. Temperature sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a [...] "chill" [...] sample—a small, solidified sample of the steel—is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer.|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{temperature}} and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through tilting the furnace. For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer. Often, a few tonnes of liquid steel and slag is left in the furnace in order to form a [...] "hot heel", which helps preheat the next charge of scrap and accelerate its meltdown. During and after tapping, the furnace is [...] "turned around": the <b>slag</b> <b>door</b> is cleaned of solidified slag, the visible refractories are inspected and water-cooled components checked for leaks, and electrodes are inspected for damage or lengthened through the addition of new segments; the taphole is filled with sand at the completion of tapping. For a 90-tonne, medium-power furnace, the whole process will usually take about 60-70 minutes from the tapping of one heat to the tapping of the next (the tap-to-tap time).|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a numerical model to investigate the heat and mass transport in an EAF freeboard. Some of the challenges presently faced by European steelmakers are increasing costs for raw materials and energy, as well as strict environmental policies. These can be addressed by improving the energy efficiency of the EAF steelmaking process by reducing off-gas and cooling losses. This can be achieved by increasing the degree of combustion of CO and H 2 in the furnace freeboard. A better understanding of the mechanisms that cause unwanted emissions during the steelmaking process can also help to develop new methods to reduce pollutants. The long term motivation behind the topic of this thesis is therefore to create a numerical EAF model with which the influence of process innovations on the fluid flow field, energy transport and chemical reactions within the freeboard of an electric arc furnace can be analysed. At this stage, the main objective is to qualitatively investigate the influence of the arc region on the amount of post-combustion within the freeboard. The effect of a change in the foamy slag height on the resulting amount of post-combustion is also investigated. The numerical EAF model represents the power-on/flat-bath stage of the steelmaking process in an exemplary AC electric arc furnace for quasi-steady state heat loss conditions. The AC EAF has a capacity of 100 tons of steel, a transformer rating of 90 MVA and and an inner vessel diameter of 6. 1 m. A simplified time-averaged arc model based on the channel arc model was developed in order to include the influence of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. The plasma arcs {{are not part of the}} solution domain, but are represented as segmented cylindrical surfaces extending from each electrode tip to the bath surface. In contrast to previous models, this simplified arc model includes not only the energy input due to the intense thermal radiation, but also the kinetic energy input due to the arc in- and outflow as well as the energy input due to the heating of the entrained furnace atmosphere in the arcs. The graphite electrodes are part of the solution domain, whereby the Joule heating due to the AC current flowing through the electrodes is taken into account. For the energy balance of the solution domain the energy input from the arc region plus the Joule heating in the electrodes represents the electric power input from the secondary circuit. This energy contribution is much smaller than the true electric power input, as it equates the amount needed, in addition to the other energy inflows, to cover the stationary power losses. The discrete ordinates thermal radiation model available in the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT (Version 14. 5) was chosen to model the thermal radiation exchange, whereby the thermal radiation absorption coefficient of the furnace atmosphere is calculated with the weighted-sum-of-grey-gases-model. Species transport with volumetric reactions and the finite-rate/eddy dissipation turbulence chemistry interaction is used to calculate the mass transfer and chemical reactions within the freeboard. The furnace atmosphere is defined to be a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2 O, N 2 and O 2. The post combustion of CO to CO 2 is simulated according to the gas-shift reaction available for the oxidation of CO in FLUENT. The realizable k-ε model with standard wall functions for the near wall treatment was selected to simulate the turbulent viscous flow. The geometry of the EAF model extends from the uppermost layer of the metal bath to the beginning of the off-gas extraction downstream of the post-combustion gap. The foamy slag is modelled as a solid layer and the top layer of the bath, also considered as a solid, is included. These two layers allow the simulation of downward absorption and redistribution of energy from the arc region, which is reflected by the resulting temperature distribution at the foamy slag layer surface. Burners, lances or injectors are not included at present. The decarburization of the molten metal bath is taken into account by the definition of a homogenous source of CO at the surface of the foamy slag layer. An average value for the graphite electrode consumption is modelled by a corresponding CO source and O 2 sink at the electrode surfaces. Ingress air is defined to enter the freeboard through the <b>slag</b> <b>door,</b> roof gap and electrode gaps and air flows in at the post-combustion gap. It is assumed that a small amount of steam enters the vessel through the electrode gaps due to electrode cooling. The upper vessel, roof, exhaust elbow and exhaust extraction are cooled by water cooled panels. The walls of the lower vessel, balcony and roof delta zone are defined to consist of refractory material and are cooled by natural convection and thermal radiation to the ambient on the outside of the vessel. The results obtained with the numerical EAF model are used to evaluate the influence of the inclusion of the energy input due to the heating and increase in momentum of the furnace atmosphere drawn into and flowing out of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. Furthermore, the impact of the arc region flow on the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 in the freeboard for a free-burning arc length of 230 mm is compared to that for a free-burning arc length of only 50 mm. The modelling of the arc region has a large influence on the flow field, temperature distribution and post-combustion. The results show that due to the inclusion of the arc in- and outflow a total increase in the simulated energy input within the vessel of 4. 42 MW results. This is due to the correspondingly higher temperatures and circulation leading to an increase in the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 within the freeboard. The inclusion of the arc in- and outflow should therefore not be neglected in future EAF models. An increased slag height not only protects the cooling panels from the thermal radiation of the arcs. It also leads to a reduction in the interaction between the flow in the arc region and in the freeboard. This in turn reduces the amount of mixing of CO from the slag layer with the ingress air and therefore also the amount of post-combustion in the freeboard. As a result a decrease in the free-burning arc length from 230 mm to 50 mm leads to a reduction in the total energy input within the solution domain of 3. 22 MW. The numerical EAF simulation model developed during this thesis delivers valuable information which helps one to understand the heat and mass transfer processes taking place within the EAF freeboard. Furthermore, several important insights were gained concerning necessary future developments of the model...|$|E
