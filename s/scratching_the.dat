5|$|The EO-13 crew {{departed}} on 22 July, {{and soon}} after Mir passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on Mir for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along Kristall {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, <b>scratching</b> <b>the</b> exterior of Kristall.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to crossfade between the two songs, and <b>scratching</b> <b>the</b> recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, scratching, or inserting music samples into the mix. The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high score for each mix, earning the player a star rating from one to five, which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly <b>scratching</b> <b>the</b> side of his leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched {{and ran into the}} outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or <b>scratching</b> <b>the</b> body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E

25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of direct-drive turntables.

It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.|$|E

25|$|Although fully mineralized and {{containing}} no water—and {{therefore not}} subject to dehydration and subsequent crazing as seen in opal—ammolite is often damaged due to environmental exposure. The thin, delicate sheets in which ammolite occurs are also problematic; for these reasons, most material is impregnated with a clear epoxy or other synthetic resin to stabilize the flake-prone ammolite prior to cutting. Although the tessellated cracking cannot be repaired, the epoxy prevents further flaking and helps protect the relatively soft surface from <b>scratching.</b> <b>The</b> impregnation process was developed {{over a number of}} years by Korite in partnership with the Alberta Research Council. Impregnated and epoxy-coated ammolite first entered the market in 1989 and the treatment significantly increased the availability and durability of the gem.|$|E
25|$|T. longicaudatus is {{the most}} {{widespread}} notostracan species, and {{may be found in}} western North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, and several Pacific Islands. It is most active at a temperature of approximately , and is usually found <b>scratching</b> <b>the</b> mud at the bottom of pools, searching for benthic food. Triops collect food particles by straining the water with hairs on their limbs. Loose food particles are collected in a groove running down the underside of the body lengthwise, and held together by a sticky secretion until they are swallowed by their very small (2mm wide) mouth. The tiny mouth is deep in its underbelly, and while the animal is capable of breaking up plant roots or dead fish, it is incapable of chasing down and eating prey larger than it is.|$|E

At <b>the</b> same <b>scratching</b> depth, <b>the</b> normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different scratching directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions.
