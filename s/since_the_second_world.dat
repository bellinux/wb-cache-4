5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War as the two clubs have rarely {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the two sides are separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} plans <b>since</b> before <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War for a {{motorway}} {{network in the}} United Kingdom.

5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E

The history of childhood emerged as a sub-discipline of history during the 1960s, and other disciplines such as the study of ancient medicine have been influenced by feminist approaches to the classics.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} four medals were won, one gold, two silver and one bronze. UK Athletics {{performance}} director Dave Collins stood down after the Games. This was {{due in part to}} the team's failure to meet the UK Sport target of winning five medals,. Ironically, a series of retests ordered in the wake of the Russian doping scandal in 2015 and 2016 found that Great Britain athletes had been deprived of medals in a further four events by athletes later confirmed to have doped – the women's heptathlon (Kelly Sotherton), the men's and women's 4 x 400-metre relay teams and women's javelin (Goldie Sayers). When these medals are redistributed, Great Britain's 2008 athletics total of eight medals will be its most successful <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>world</b> war, and 75% over target.|$|E
50|$|The World Cup was a French initiative. Led by Paul Barrière, who {{donated the}} Rugby League World Cup trophy himself, {{they had been}} campaigning for such a tournament <b>since</b> before <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War.
