25|$|Tangent and secant lines (standard lines) are {{represented}} undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, {{it is called}} a <b>standard</b> <b>parallel.</b> The central meridian is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written λ) and a parallel of origin (usually written φ) are often used to define {{the origin of the}} map projection.|$|E
25|$|The various specializations of the {{cylindric}} equal-area projection differ only in {{the ratio}} of the vertical to horizontal axis. This ratio determines the <b>standard</b> <b>parallel</b> of the projection, which is the parallel at which there is no distortion and along which distances match the stated scale. There are always two standard parallels on the cylindric equal-area projection, each at the same distance north and south of the equator. The standard parallels of the Gall–Peters are 45°N and 45°S. Several other specializations of the equal-area cylindric have been described, promoted, or otherwise named.|$|E
2500|$|When {{making a}} conic map, the map maker {{arbitrarily}} picks two standard parallels. [...] Those standard parallels may be visualized as secant lines where the cone intersects the globe—or, if the map maker chooses the same parallel twice, as the tangent line where the cone is tangent to the globe. [...] The resulting conic map has low distortion in scale, shape, and area near those standard parallels. [...] Distances along the parallels {{to the north}} of both standard parallels or to the south of both standard parallels are stretched; distances along parallels between the standard parallels are compressed. [...] When a single <b>standard</b> <b>parallel</b> is used, distances along all other parallels are stretched.|$|E
50|$|The {{projection}} has {{the useful}} property that distances along the meridians are proportionately correct, and distances are also correct along two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> that the mapmaker has chosen. The two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> are also free of distortion.|$|R
50|$|The Albers equal-area conic {{projection}}, or Albers projection (named after Heinrich C. Albers), is a conic, equal area {{map projection}} that uses two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels.</b> Although scale and shape are not preserved, distortion is minimal between the <b>standard</b> <b>parallels.</b>|$|R
50|$|By scaling the {{resulting}} map, two parallels {{can be assigned}} unit scale, with scale decreasing between the two parallels and increasing outside them. This gives the map two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels.</b> In this way, deviation from unit scale can be minimized within a region of interest that lies largely between the two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels.</b> Unlike other conic projections, no true secant form of the projection exists because using a secant cone does not yield the same scale along both <b>standard</b> <b>parallels.</b>|$|R

40|$|Conic map {{projections}} {{are appropriate}} for mapping regions at medium and large scales with east-west extents at intermediate latitudes. Conic projections {{are appropriate for}} these cases because they show the mapped area with less distortion than other projections. In order to minimize the distortion of the mapped area, the two <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> of conic projections need to be selected carefully. Rules of thumb exist for placing the <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> based on the width-to-height ratio of the map. These rules of thumb are simple to apply, but do not result in maps with minimum distortion. There also exist more sophisticated methods that determine <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> such that distortion in the mapped area is minimized. These methods are computationally expensive and cannot be used for real-time web map- ping and GIS applications where the projection is adjusted automatically to the displayed area. This article presents a polynomial model that quickly provides the <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> for the three most common conic map projections: the Albers equal-area, the Lambert conformal, and the equidistant conic projection. The model defines the <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> with polynomial expressions based on the spatial extent of the mapped area. The spatial extent {{is defined by the}} length of the mapped central meridian segment, the central latitude of the displayed area, and the width-to-height ratio of the map. The polynomial model was derived from 3825 maps-each with a different spatial extent and computa- tionally determined <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> that minimize the mean scale distortion index. The resulting model is computationally simple and can be used for the automatic selection of the <b>standard</b> <b>parallels</b> of conic map projections in GIS software and web mapping applications...|$|R
