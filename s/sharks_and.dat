5|$|In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its {{significant}} and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit.

40|$|Catches of <b>shark</b> <b>and</b> ray are {{considered}} important in Indonesian fisheries. Anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} these fisheries may be over-exploited, but catches of <b>shark</b> <b>and</b> ray may be critical to their economic viability and the welfare of fishing communities dependent on them. Through {{a case study in}} Cilacap, Central Java, this paper assesses the potential economic and social impact on fishers and their households of restrictions on <b>shark</b> <b>and</b> ray catch. It reveals that <b>shark</b> <b>and</b> ray rep resent a minor component of this fishery's total catch, so the likely impact on the cash profitability of individual boats and the cash flow of fishing households would be minimal. However, inclusion of non-monetary costs in the analysis reveals that net returns to boat owners are negative. <b>Shark</b> <b>and</b> ray catch reductions will add further losses, and downstream activities such as processing of <b>shark</b> <b>and</b> ray products could imply an amplified aggregate impact. ...|$|R

5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. Angel <b>sharks</b> <b>and</b> wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|E

5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue <b>sharks),</b> <b>and</b> smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, <b>sharks</b> <b>and</b> rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|In {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish the}} eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive {{little or no}} nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk.

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of <b>sharks</b> <b>and</b> mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines.
