After they go their separate ways Rose uses the Internet to look up Bob’s address. Thanks to Rose they meet again outside his house by [...] "coincidence" [...] and go agree to out together. Over dinner, Bob has to take his outer shirt off after the waitress <b>spills</b> a dirty <b>plate</b> on it. This reveals a gay-themed T-shirt and Rose reacts. After the meal, they continue talking and decide to return to Bob's house, where they hit the drinks. Later she spends the night in Bob’s bed on a drunken sleep-over until she notices he is aroused and she leaves in a taxi. Just before the taxi arrives, Bob and Rose are standing outside and spontaneously, they embrace and kiss passionately.

5000|$|Dr. Stanislaus Pyckle, (a {{play of the}} actor's name, Stan Laurel), {{successfully}} {{separates the}} good and evil of man's nature {{with the use of}} a powerful drug -- [...] "Dr. Pyckle's 58th Variety", a spoof of [...] "Heinz's 57". Transforming into the personality of Mr. Pride (again Laurel), he terrorizes the town with unspeakable acts including stealing a boy’s ice cream, cheating at marbles, and popping a bag behind a lady pedestrian. The townspeople track him down where Mr. Pride locks himself in the laboratory and transforms back at Dr. Pyckle. The doctor assures the townspeople that he hasn't seen the [...] "fiend" [...] they were after. While he talks, the drug used for the transformation <b>spills</b> in the <b>plate</b> of food of the doctor's dog. Dr. Pyckle confronts the fiendish dog when he locks the door and the townspeople leave. But once again, Mr. Pride emerges and brings havoc to the town, and again is chased down by the townspeople. He enters the lab and transforms back into Pyckle, and again assures the townspeople he hasn't seen the fiend. His assistant (Julie Leonard) begs the doctor to open and comfort him, but he transforms back into Mr. Pride. He opens the door to the assistant and locks it again. She screams seeing Pride and the townspeople hurry back, before the assistant can knock Pride down.|$|R
