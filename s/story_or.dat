5|$|My <b>Story</b> (<b>or</b> Mon histoire) is a tell-all memoir by Canadian Julie Couillard. It {{was first}} written in French, then during summer 2008, {{translated}} into English. Both versions were published across Canada in October 2008.|$|E
5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to <b>story</b> <b>or</b> customization. The mobile phone version is similarly restricted.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the <b>story</b> <b>or</b> moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

5|$|Chocobo Racing borrows {{themes and}} {{elements}} from Final Fantasy I to Final Fantasy VI. The Story Mode is narrated by Cid and includes nine chapters in a pop-up book fashion with FMVs. To progress, the player needs {{to defeat the}} chapter's respective challenger. Before each chapter begins, the player is given the option of viewing the <b>story</b> <b>or</b> skipping to the race except when playing the Story Mode for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell a <b>story</b> <b>or</b> event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's life <b>story</b> <b>or</b> some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain {{the most elaborate}} telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, {{has been the most}} popular and widely studied part of this text.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, with {{praise for}} its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, {{the game was}} criticized {{for the lack of}} a compelling <b>story</b> <b>or</b> innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the game's release.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular <b>story,</b> <b>or</b> if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the <b>story</b> <b>or</b> use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3s <b>story</b> <b>or</b> {{campaign}} mode can {{be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. Instead of having each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a <b>story</b> <b>or</b> conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the <b>story</b> <b>or</b> provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E

5|$|Sung jwé, jwé chanté or chanté kont, {{is mostly}} {{part of the}} funeral wake tradition. A jwé chanté leader uses {{pantomime}} to enact scenes from a <b>story,</b> <b>or</b> sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The gém (game song) are based around a leader who uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. Jwé dansé includes four traditional dances. The solo is a couple dance, and the débòt, yonbòt and jwé pòté are all circle dances. The blòtjé is a musical movement found in all jwé dansé styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the débòt dance.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} include iconic {{aspects of the}} Batman mythos, and decided early on in production to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin reprise their roles in Dini's Batman: The Animated Series as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, respectively. Hamill has thousands of lines of dialogue in the game, and Conroy has relatively few in comparison. After seeing character models of the Joker's Arkham Asylum appearance, Hamill decided to portray the character as dark and gritty while retaining a clownish and playful nature. Although the game features references to plot events in both The Animated Series and Batman comics, the story does not directly follow any singular <b>story</b> <b>or</b> depiction of the character.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written into the <b>story,</b> <b>or</b> vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the <b>story</b> <b>or,</b> alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her <b>story</b> <b>or</b> by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main {{characters}} in Doom 3. The player assumes {{the role of}} an anonymous space marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC's Mars base. The player's non-commissioned officer in-charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who gives the player objectives and advice over the player's radio {{for the first half of}} the game. The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger, head scientist of the UAC's enigmatic Delta Labs division, who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity. Betruger's demonic voice, provided by Philip L. Clarke, frequently taunts the player as the game progresses. The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell. Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC's board of directors, sent to check up on Betruger's research as well as investigate the rising number of accidents on the Mars base after a request for assistance from a whistleblower. He is almost always accompanied by Campbell, another space marine who acts as Swann's bodyguard and is armed with a BFG 9000. Campbell is voiced by Andy Chanley. Swann and Campbell are often shown in the game to be a few steps ahead of the player, but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game. The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the <b>story</b> <b>or</b> assist the player in certain segments. The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base, as well as fellow marines and security guards. Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen.|$|E
