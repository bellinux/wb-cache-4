40|$|The {{chemical}} industry of today is under increased pressure to develop novel green materials, bio-fuels {{as well as}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemicals</b> for the {{chemical industry}}. Indeed, the endeavour is to move towards more eco-friendly cost efficient production processes and technologies and chemical transformation of renewables has a central role considering the future <b>sustainable</b> supply of <b>chemicals</b> and energy needed for societies. In the Nordic countries, the importance of pulping and paper industry has been particularly pronounced and the declining European demand on these products {{as a result of}} our digitalizing world has forced the industry to look at alternative sources of revenue and profitability. In this thesis, the production of levulinic and formic acid from biomass and macromolecules has been studied.

Microreactors {{are used to}} study enzyme-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone to polycaprolactone. A novel microreactor design developed by Bhangale et al. [...] enabled to perform heterogeneous reactions in continuous mode, in organic media, and at elevated temperatures. Using microreactors, enabled faster polymerization and higher molecular mass compared to using batch reactors. It is evident that similar microreactor based platforms can readily be extended to other enzyme-based systems, for example, high-throughput screening of new enzymes and to precision measurements of new processes where continuous flow mode is preferred. This is the first reported demonstration of a solid supported enzyme-catalyzed polymerization reaction in continuous mode.|$|E

30|$|Reflecting {{five years}} experiences, we see options for some improvements. Among other suggestions, the most {{important}} is to strengthen the role of ECHA: As a last measure for incomplete registration dossiers, the option to deny a registration should be given to ECHA. We also suggest extending the possibility to access the information stored in the REACH databases in Helsinki to include information on research issues – with the exception of core confidential business information. This may be a great opportunity for the chemical industry to accept the challenge of discussing their research results with the scientific community and a great chance to improve our knowledge on <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemicals.</b>|$|R

This thesis utilizes all three to study the metabolism of methane and methanol-utilizing microbes. Both pure cultures (Chapter 2) and complex natural (Chapter 3) communities are studied. The potential to leverage statistical and machine learning for large meta-omics datasets is also explored (Chapter 4). Overall, we are able to make strong conclusions when high- quality isolate genomes are available, however, these inferences are much more difficult in the case for complex microbial communities with unknown underlying genomic composition...|$|R

40|$|Renewable {{materials}} are desirable for many applications {{due to the}} finite fossil resources and environmental issues. Plant oil {{is one of the}} most promising renewable feedstocks. Plant oils and functionalized oleo-chemicals including functionalized soybean oils have become attractive <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemicals</b> for industrial applications. Especially, epoxidized oleo-chemicals such as epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) are one of the most well-known readily available inexpensive functionalized plant oils. In this study, novel polymers and nanocomposites for sustainable materials applications were designed and prepared via ring-opening of epoxide in plant oils, and their chemical and physical properties were characterized. The novel transparent elastomers derived from functionalized plant oils have a great potential as flexible electronic and biological applications with their inherent low toxicity. Especially, their rheological properties showed a potential for pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The dominant thermal stability and transparency were obtained via green processing: one pot, single step, fast reactions in moderate conditions, or solvent-free UV curing conditions.

40|$|Screening of {{chemical}} reaction pathway {{appears to be}} one of the most critical tasks in new chemical process development. Various methods for synthesis {{of chemical}} reaction pathway such as logic-centered, direct associative methods and optimization-based approaches have been proposed.

40|$|This {{research}} article presents {{a method for}} the fabrication of inorganic porous hollow fibers, using ecologically benign feed materials instead of organic solvents and harmful additives. Our method is based on ionic cross-linking of an aqueous mixture of sodium alginate, inorganic particles, and a carbonate. The mixture is spun into an acidic coagulation bath, where the low pH triggers the dissociation of the carbonate into multivalent cations and carbon dioxide. The multivalent cations cross-link the alginate, thereby consolidating the 3 D structure and arresting the inorganic particles. In a subsequent thermal treatment, the polymer is removed, and the particles are sintered together. Adequate gelation requires a sufficiently low pH of the acid bath and a sufficing buffering capacity of the acid. In addition, to facilitate thermal treatment, {{it appears to be}} crucial that the acid has a conjugated base with limited propensity for complexing cations. The environmentally safe and sustainable lactic acid and acetic acid are shown to be convenient acids. The fibers prepared via our method have outstanding properties, such as high mechanical strength, homogeneous morphology, and sharp distribution of small pores. In addition, they are prepared using <b>sustainable</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as lactic acid and calcium carbonate...|$|R
