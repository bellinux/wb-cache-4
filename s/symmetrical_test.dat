In order to eliminate the problem of phase uncertainty, three different precise (known) reflection standards or one known reflection standard plus one known transmission standard should be used to calibrate <b>symmetrical</b> <b>test</b> fixtures. For the asymmetrical cases, three known standards, including at least one transmission standard, should be used. The thru-open-match (TOM) and thru-short-match (TSM) techniques are the simplest methods, and they have no bandwidth limitation. When the standards are imprecise (unknown), it is recommended to use any suitable technique, such as the thru-reflect-line, line-reflect-line, thru-short-delay, thru-open-delay,line-reflect-match, line-reflect-reflect-match, or multiline methods, to accurately determine the values of the required calibration terms and, in addition, to use the TOM or TSM method with the same imprecise standards to resolve the phase uncertainty...|$|E

In this study <b>symmetrical</b> <b>test</b> structures with different emitter profiles on highly doped and lowly doped substrates have been investigated. The samples were analyzed by injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (IDLS) with the contactless measurement of the photoconductance. For highly injected substrates, the model for the Auger recombination of Kerr et al. can be used for a wider range of excess carrier densities resulting in a more conservative estimation than with the models of Schmidt et al., Glunz et al. and Sinton et al [...] With the Auger parameterisation of Kerr et al. at low injections the same observations as in high injection regime have been made.

40|$|Throughout the {{evolution}} of silicon solar cell, various technologies {{have been developed to}} improve the solar cell efficiency, including the introduction of diffusion technique, development of passivation technology and minimization of contact recombination. Based on the advanced technology, this thesis aims at proposing a limited area junction solar cell design and investigating whether this structure can achieve higher voltage. The thesis starts with reviewing the recombination and lifetime mechanisms in the silicon materials and investigating their effects on the output voltage. It is concluded that reducing the recombination from the bulk, surface, emitter and contact will be the key for improving the voltage. A PC 1 D simulation study is then introduced to resolve the recombination along the depth of the solar cell. Based on that, the major recombination location can be identified and the optimization plan of the layer limiting the voltage can be proposed. For the structures with optimized bulk lifetime, surface passivation and contact recombination, emitter recombination would be the limitation for the voltage. To further improve the voltage of such solar cell, the limited area junction structure was proposed. Quokka simulation studied the limited area junction solar cell structures with different emitter recombination and the result indicated that the structure can help improve the open circuit voltage when the emitter recombination is higher than that of front non-emitter area. Moreover, obvious voltage improvement can be achieved when the emitter area dominates the recombination. While doing the baseline experiment fabrication, the J 0 component from each layer is extracted from the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>test</b> structure, which allows a more realistic estimation of an upper limit of the open circuit voltage that can be achieved with present experiment facilities. Based on the simulation results and the baseline experiment technologies, the practical limited area junction solar cell was designed and fabricated. The line emitter unit cells, square emitter unit cells and the complete large cells are the three different limited area junction solar cells that were investigated. The voltage of line emitter and square emitter unit cells showed increasing trend against the reducing emitter area ratio. However, the measured voltage is not as high as the modelled one. The mismatch was determined by fitting the measured curve of voltage against the emitter area ratio. Based on the loss analysis and result discussion, the future work is also proposed...|$|E

40|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} plays {{a dominant}} {{role in the}} passivation of crystalline silicon surfaces by layers of amorphous silicon. In order to research into this role, this thesis presents the method of hydrogen effusion from thin amorphous films of silicon (a-Si:H) and silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H). The oxygen concentration of the sub-stoichiometric a-SiOx:H films ranges up to 10 at. -%. The effusion experiment yields information about the content and thermal stability of hydrogen and about the microstructure of the films. A mathematical description of the diffusion process of atomic hydrogen yields an analytical expression of the effusion rate depending on the linearly increasing temperature in the experiment. Fitting of the calculated effusion rates to measured effusion spectra yields the diffusion coefficient of atomic hydrogen in a-SiOx:H. With increasing oxygen concentration, the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in the a-SiOx:H films decreases. This is attributed to an increasing Si-H bond energy due to back bonded oxygen, resulting in a higher stability of hydrogen in the films. This result is confirmed by an increasing thermal stability of the p-type c-Si passivation with a-SiOx:H of increasing oxygen concentrations up to 5 at. -%. The passivation reaches very low recombination velocities of below 10 cm/s at the interface. However, for higher oxygen concentrations up to 10 at. -%, the passivation quality decreases significantly. Here, infrared spectroscopy of Si-H vibrational modes and hydrogen effusion show an increase of hydrogen-rich interconnected voids in the films. This microstructure results in a high amount of molecular hydrogen (H 2) in the layers, which is not suitable for the saturation of c-Si interface defects. Annealing of the films at temperatures around 400 °C leads to a release of H 2 from the voids, {{as a result of}} which Si-Si bonds in the material reconstruct. Subsequently, hydrogen migration in the films is dominated by the diffusion of atomic hydrogen being suitable for the saturation of interface defects. This shows in a distinct increase of the passivation quality of annealed films. The heterostructure back contact for solar cells on p-type c-Si consists of an undoped, full area passivation film, followed by a boron doped p-type contact layer. If highly doped, this layer generates a back surface field effect which decreases the recombination by reflecting minority charge carriers from the defect rich interface. An undoped passivation layer of a-Si:H improves the passivation by saturating interface defects. Effusion measurements on stacks of undoped and doped layers show an increase of the hydrogen diffusion in the undoped layer due to the presence of the doped layer. The doped layer shifts the Fermi level of the undoped layer towards the valence band edge. This shift increases the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen due to an effective reduction of the Si-H bond energy. As a consequence, the presence of the doped contact layer increases the mobility of atomic hydrogen in the passivation layer, with atomic hydrogen being necessary for the passivation of interface defects. The thickness of the passivation layer critically affects both the passivation and the electrical conductance of the back contact. Whereas the passivation quality steadily improves with increasing thickness, the conductance drops when exceeding a critical thickness in a range of 4 nm to 8 nm. Temperature dependent measurements yield a thermal activation of the conductance with an activation energy of approximately 0. 5 eV, which is attributed to the valence band offset between a-Si:H and c-Si. This high barrier requires a tunneling process for majority charge carriers and explains the abrupt decrease of conductance with increasing passivation layer thickness. Passivation layers of a-SiOx:H form a blocking junction on p-type c-Si, which is explained by an oxygen induced n-type conduction of a-SiOx:H. Therefore, full area contacts require local through-connections of the a-SiOx:H layers. However, these films offer themselves as passivating interlayers at the solar cell front side between p-type base and n-type emitter. <b>Symmetrical</b> <b>test</b> structures on p-type c-Si allow for studying two-stage emitter structures consisting of undoped and phosphorous doped a-SiOx:H layers. Low and thermally stable emitter saturation current densities result, allowing for high open circuit voltages of above 700 mV in solar cells. However, the efficiency of solar cells with these emitter structures is limited by a high contact resistance between n-type a-SiOx:H and ZnO:Al at the front side as well as a non-optimized back contact...|$|E

Radiation pressure pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the scatter force, but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light. The transverse force on the particles is the lift force.

For specimens aged at 160 °C (UA) and 200 °C (PA), respectively, the cyclic deformation is characterized by planar slip which is less pronounced for PA specimens. UA specimens showed heavy strain burst effects where the plastic strain reaches up to 10 times the desired amplitude. These strain bursts are induced by the nucleation of planar slip bands and are typical for UA specimens which tend to very extreme planar slip behaviour. Specimens aged at 220 °C showed no planar slip, but some short PSBs with their typical extrusions were observed by SEM. The diminution of planar slip with increasing ageing temperature indicates that the degree of strain localization is dependent on the average size of the δ' precipitates in the investigated Al-Li alloy...|$|R
