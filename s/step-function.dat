These navigational computations are performed with carefully designed electronic circuits {{in harmony with}} precision electromechanical components. The electronic parts are the Accelerometer Restoring Amplifier which give a voltage that {{is proportional to the}} acceleration. Ranging from micro-G's to units of G they span a very impressive dynamic range. Also the Servo Amplifiers, picking off the tiny Gyro signals and amplifying this to control the platform gimbal motors, have tight specifications. The actual integration of the accelerometer signal to a velocity signal is performed by an electronic amplifier which controls a velocity-motor which drives a capacitance tachometer. This cap-tach feedback provides the basic integrator signal since the speed of the cap-tach is proportional to acceleration input. The feedback nulls the acceleration input to stop the motor. The motor positions the velocity shaft to pick off the appropriate potentiometer signal which represents velocity. A dead zone network drives the velocity motor in steps which are smoothed to provide the integrated acceleration (= velocity) signal.The velocity integrators operate in a similar manner to the acceleration integrators, except that the output signal is not smoothed because the so-called M-transmitters are <b>step-function</b> devices.

40|$|McClelland and Patterson’s Opinion article [1] largely {{hinges on}} whether the regular past tense is {{acquired}} instantaneously and applied perfectly, which {{they consider to be}} hallmarks of symbolic models. McClelland and Patterson take gradedness in behavioral data as evidence for the connectionist approach. We believe this framing sidesteps the key issue in the past-tense debate: whether human language uses mechanisms that are combinatorial and sensitive to grammatical structure and categories. Symbolic models of cognition [2] and our approach to language in particular (see [3] Chap. 5; and [4] pp. 130 – 136) have always invoked combinatorial operations (‘rules’) that are acquired gradually and can be applied probabilistically. Less-than- 100 % application of a regular inflection can occur for many reasons: intermediate stages in acquisition, partial blocking by weak irregulars, phonotactic naturalness, depth of processing of the grammatical structure, uncertainty as to whether a rule’s conditions have been met, and the noisiness of neural computation.

40|$|Abstract—Prior {{work has}} shown that {{resilience}} of random P 2 P graphs under dynamic node failure can be improved by age-biased neighbor selection that delivers outbound edges to more reliable users with higher probability. However, making the bias too aggressive may cause the group of nodes that receive connections to become small in comparison to graph size. As they become overloaded, these peers are forced to reject future connection requests, which leads to potentially unbounded join delays and high traffic overhead. To investigate these issues, we propose several analytical models for understanding the interplay between resilience and degree. We formulate a Pareto-optimal objective for this tradeoff, introduce new metrics of resilience and degree, analyze them under Pareto lifetimes, and discover that traditional techniques can be highly suboptimal in this setting. We then show evidence that optimization can be solved by a family of <b>step-functions,</b> which connect outgoing edges to uniformly random users whose age exceeds some threshold. I...|$|R
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} method for elucidating neutrino mass from beta decay is studied. It {{is based upon}} the solutions of transformed Fredholm and Volterra integral equations. In principle, theoretical beta-particle spectra can consist of several neutrino-mass eigenvalues. Integration of the theoretical beta spectrum with a normalized instrumental response function results in the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. This equation is transformed {{in such a way that}} the solution of it is a superposition of the Heaviside <b>step-functions,</b> one for each neutrino mass eigenvalue. A series expansion leading to matrix linear equations is then derived to solve the transformed Fredholm equation. Another approach is derived when the theoretical beta spectrum is obtained by a separate deconvolution of the observed spectrum. It is then proven that the transformed Fredholm equation reduces to the Abel integral equation. The Abel equation has a general integral solution, which is proven in this work by using a specific function for the beta spectrum. As an example, a numerical solution of the Abel integral equation is also provided, which has a fractional sensitivity of about 0. 001 for subtle neutrino eigenvalue searches, and can distinguish from experimental beta-spectrum discrepancies, such as shape and energy nonlinearities.

40|$|Extraordinary Hall effect (EHE) in bilayer F/S(N) was {{investigated}} theoretically. The conductivity tensor σ_αβ is calculated in the Kubo formalism with Green functions found as the solutions of the Gorkov equations. We considered diffuse transport in the ferromagnetic layer, {{taking into account}} as a main mechanism of electron resistivity s-d scattering. In this model Gorkov equations for s-electrons in the ferromagnetic layer remain linear and are solved easily. It is shown that Hall field E^H for both F/S and F/N contacts are <b>step-functions</b> of the coordinate perpendicular to the planes of the layers and have zero value in S(N) layer. The Andreev reflection increases the value of Hall constant R_s for F/S case. The value of the Hall constant is R_H^F/S = R_H^bulk (σ^↑ + σ^↓) ^ 2 / 4 σ^↑σ^↓, where σ^↑ and σ^↓ are conductivities of electrons with up and down spins, and R_H^bulk is the Hall constant in the bulk ferromagnetic metal. In fact, R_H^F/S coincides with EHE constant of the bilayer of two ferromagnetic metals with equal thickness and opposite directions of their magnetizations. So {{we can make a}} conclusion, that the ideal interface between ferromagnetic metal and superconductor may be considered like a mirror with inversion in spin space.

The statistical characteristics of the examined series have significant impact on the measured efficiencies, thus it is difficult to obtain an unambiguous picture of the efficiencies, relying only on numerical tests. In this study the historical methodological development with focus on the homogenisation of surface temperature observations is presented in order to view the progress {{from the side of the}} development of statistical tools. The main stages of this methodological progress, such as for instance the fitting optimal <b>step-functions</b> when the number of change-points is known (1972), cutting algorithm (1995), Caussinus – Lyazrhi criterion (1997), are recalled and their effects on the quality-improvement of homogenisation is briefly discussed. This analysis of the theoretical properties together with the recently published numerical results jointly indicate that, MASH, PRODIGE, ACMANT and USHCN are the best statistical tools for homogenising climatic time series, since they provide the reconstruction and preservation of true climatic variability in observational time series with the highest reliability. On the other hand, skilled homogenizers may achieve outstanding reliability also with the combination of simple statistical methods such as the Craddock-test and visual expert decisions.

40|$|We {{address in}} this paper the {{following}} two closely related problems: 1. How to represent functions with singularities (up to a prescribed accuracy) in a compact way? 2. How to reconstruct such functions from {{a small number of}} measurements? The stress is on a comparison of linear and nonlinear approaches. As a model case we use piecewise-constant functions on [0, 1], in particular, the Heaviside jump function Ht = χ [0,t]. Considered as a curve in the Hilbert space L 2 ([0, 1]) it is completely characterized by the fact that any two its disjoint chords are orthogonal. We reinterpret this fact in a context of <b>step-functions</b> in one or two variables. Next we study the limitations on representability and reconstruction of piecewise-constant functions by linear and semi-linear methods. Our main tools in this problem are Kolmogorov’s n-width and ɛ-entropy, as well as Temlyakov’s (N, m) -width. On the positive side, we show that a very accurate non-linear reconstruction is possible. It goes through a solution of certain specific non-linear systems of algebraic equations. We discuss the form of these systems and methods of their solution, stressing their relation to Moment Theory and Complex Analysis. Finally, we informally discuss two problems in Computer Imaging which are parallel to the problems 1 and 2 above: compression of still images and video-sequences on one side, and image reconstruction from indirect measurement (for example, in Computer Tomography), on the other.
