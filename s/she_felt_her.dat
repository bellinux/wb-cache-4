5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents, Christman felt {{conflicted}} in her activities, because she supported freedom of speech and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> activities constituted censorship. The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her via email on July 14, 2000. The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site. Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of free speech, and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS. She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust (LMT) who were based in Clearwater, Florida. The LMT was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, Lisa McPherson.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999, Kusanagi again {{released}} a farewell appearance, the photobook Jun, and a calendar {{for the year}} 2000. Two years later, with Playboy photographer, Kim Mizuno, Kusanagi produced an 80-page, hardcover volume entitled Dangerous Curve which was released in April 2001. In her diary she expressed disappointment that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> career had failed. It {{could be due to}} a combination of bad business decisions, {{and the fact that she}} had passed her prime so quickly. Another retirement from public life during the first half of the 2000s followed, during which time the Alice Japan, Atlas21 and MAX-A labels released several compilations of scenes from Kusanagi's previous work, as well as re-issues of the original videos.|$|E

To cause tension between the friends Mercedes discovered Riley's relationship with Lynsey.

She explained that Mercedes' plan was [...] "more destructive than winning him back", and that she was [...] "playing a game. The old Mercedes will be back shortly".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, M.I.A. filmed {{from her}} Bed Stuy {{apartment}} window and posted on YouTube an incident involving {{a black man}} being apprehended by white policemen, which {{in light of the}} Sean Bell shooting incident, elicited commentary debating the force used for the arrest. She has spoken of the combined effects that news corporations and search engine Google have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> son's generation would need in order to ascertain truth. She told Nylon magazine that social networking site Facebook and Google's development [...] "by the CIA" [...] was harmful to internet freedom. Some criticised the claim as lacking detail.|$|E

500|$|Presley also {{disagreed}} with having {{children with the}} singer. Imagining the future and {{what would happen if}} the marriage ended, Presley saw a [...] "custody battle nightmare". In addition, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired. He explained, [...] "My friend Debbie [...] said she will get pregnant and have my baby. If you won't do it, then she will. How about that?" [...] Unmoved, Presley replied that it was fine by her.|$|E
500|$|Although Carey {{had heard}} the hook used in several other songs over the years, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> use {{of the sample was}} done in a more {{innovative}} way. [...] "We built the song from there and I wrote the lyrics and the melody and Dave ended up liking it," [...] she continued. After having completed the song, Hall complimented Carey's work ethic and form of writing, calling her a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "very professional." [...] He explained that they incorporated the hook, a melody, and the sample into the song over the course of one night. The song's title was not added until the end of production. Hall said Carey works in a unique fashion, usually developing the song's instrumentals and hook prior to the lyrics and title. Carey describes the songwriting process: ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2007, Suzuki {{started her}} [...] "join" [...] project and {{released}} her fifth studio album Connetta, which featured {{a variety of}} collaborators and producers. Although it was noted for its experimental adaption of musical genres, Suzuki went on to perform club-oriented remixes and songs at night clubs around Japan. Her staff at Avex Trax, who attended her performances, noticed her engagement with club music and wanted to pair her with a musician that dealt with electronic dance music. Eventually, Avex contacted Japanese producer and Capsule member Yasutaka Nakata, in June 2007, to work with Suzuki on her next album, which he accepted. Suzuki was aware of Nakata's work prior to their collaboration, but because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> [...] "join" [...] project embraced musical styles from different collaborators, she intended to experiment her sound with Nataka.|$|E

500|$|As a youngster, Anna Mae sang in {{the church}} choir at Nutbush's Spring Hill Baptist Church. When she was 11, her mother ran off without warning, seeking freedom from her abusive {{relationship}} with Floyd Bullock. Zelma relocated to St. Louis to live with Anna Mae's great-aunt. As a preteen, Anna Mae worked as a domestic worker for the Henderson family. [...] When Anna Mae was 13, her father married another woman and moved to Detroit. Anna Mae and her sister were sent {{to live with their}} grandmother Georgeanna in Brownsville, Tennessee. Anna Mae later stated in her memoir, I, Tina, that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> mother had not loved her, and that she [...] "wasn't wanted", stating further that her mother had planned to leave her father when pregnant with Anna Mae. [...] "She was a very young woman who didn't want another kid", Anna Mae wrote. [...] Her relationship with her mother remained estranged until Bullock's death in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Six weeks later, in May 2010, {{she asked}} Swivel {{to work on}} the entire project. Concerning his working {{relationship}} with Beyonc√©, he commented, [...] "There was no 'We're doing this today.' It was a very kind of open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>her</b> mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording [...] "I Care", [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Rather Die Young", and completed [...] "Party". They recorded the songs [...] "Schoolin' Life", [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] at Jungle City Studios in New York.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Anything Goes" [...] / [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] mash-up {{was widely}} acclaimed. Respers France named Pearce's {{performance}} the best {{moment of the}} episode, {{and found that the}} character positively reminded her of [...] "Glee of old". The song was also a favorite of Lee's, who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character's disposition. West, Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an [...] "A"; the former called it an [...] "outstanding rendition" [...] which [...] "felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big-screen musical", and the latter two praised her vocal talent, which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee. Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally, and eagerly anticipated future competition between them. Urban called Pearce's performance merely [...] "serviceable". Though <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> acting was a weak point, she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals. Criticism came from New York Lindy West, who did not understand Rachel's humiliation, as New Directions [...] "sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode". She elaborated, [...] "This is a thing that drives me crazy about Glee. As a viewer, there's no knowing whether a performance was 'good' like 'Anything Goes,' or 'bad' like 'We've Got the Beat,' until Rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti." ...|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. {{called the}} new project [...] "schizophrenic", and spoke of the Internet {{inspiration}} that {{could be found in}} the songs and the artwork. She also said that the album centred on her [...] "not being able to leave [...] for 18 months" [...] and feeling [...] "disconnected". She summed up the album's main theme as information politics. During the recording of the album, she spoke of the combined effects that news corporations and Google have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> son's generation would need to ascertain truth. Maya was made to be [...] "so uncomfortably weird and wrong that people begin to exercise their critical-thinking muscles". M.I.A. said [...] "You can Google 'Sri Lanka' and it doesn't come up that all these people have been murdered or bombed, it's 'Come to Sri Lanka on vacation, there are beautiful beaches' ... you're not gonna get the truth till you hit like, page 56, and it's my and your responsibility to pass on the information that it's not easy anymore". Following these comments, M.I.A. received death threats directed at her and her son, which she also cited as an influence on the songs on the album. She summed up the album as a mixture of [...] "babies, death, destruction and powerlessness". The singer revealed that going into recording the album, she had still not accepted that she was a musician, saying [...] "I'm still in denial, listening to too much Destiny's Child". With Maya, she stated [...] "I was happy being the retarded cousin of rap... Now I'm the retarded cousin of singing." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the next}} few years, the Lanes {{continued}} to live a nomadic lifestyle, including stays in Missouri, Ohio, New York and Maine {{to work together and}} separately on various promotional and advertising projects. While letters to her parents described a happy-go-lucky existence, Lane's subsequent diary entries and numerous autobiographical magazine articles later described her mindset at this time as depressed and disillusioned with her marriage. [...] <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> intellectual interests did not mesh with the life she was living with her husband.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Moulton {{began to}} publish the work which she had written {{for the past eight}} years. It would be {{difficult}} to say what it was that inclined her to a literary life as she had no literary friends. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> movements had to be secret as if she were committing a crime when she sent off her first verses to a daily paper published in Norwich, Connecticut. It was on her way from school one day that she happened to take the paper from the office; and, when she opened it, there were the lines she had written. Three years later, Messrs. Phillips, Sampson and Company, of Boston, published for her [...] "This, That, and the Other," [...] a collection of stories and poems which had appeared in various magazines and newspapers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, Thomas {{signed with}} Triangle Pictures. Shortly after, news broke of her {{engagement}} to actor Jack Pickford, {{whom she had}} married a year prior. Thomas and Pickford, who was the younger brother of Mary Pickford, kept the marriage secret because Thomas did not {{want people to think}} her success in film was due to her association with the Pickfords. Her first film for Triangle, Madcap Madge, was released in June 1917. Thomas' popularity at Triangle grew with performances in Indiscreet Corrine (1917) and Limousine Life (1918). In 1919, she portrayed a French girl who poses as a boy in Toton the Apache. Thomas later said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> work in Toton was [...] "the first real thing I've ever done."
