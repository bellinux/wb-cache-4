50|$|In EMI applications, {{the main}} focus of a scanner system is on {{localization}} of real electromagnetic interference (EMI) sources distributed in a DUT. Accordingly, the <b>scanning</b> <b>surface</b> is located in the highly reactive region of the DUT to enable a relative spatial localization of the electric charges and current surface densities directly from the mapped pattern of probe signals. Typically the separation between the <b>scanning</b> <b>surface</b> and the DUT is much smaller as the largest geometrical dimension of the DUT. Exemplarydistances are 1 mm for scanning of PCBs and 30 μm for scanning of integrated circuits on a die level. In order to quickly localize field emission in frequency domain, time domain detection techniques together with signal processing based on fast Fourier transform could be employed, e.g. utilizing a digital storage oscilloscope as a signal receiver.|$|E
50|$|Whether in a {{scanning}} or {{a stationary}} optical system, combinations of lenses and mirrors {{are used to}} project the original image on the platen (<b>scanning</b> <b>surface)</b> onto the photoconductor. Additional lenses, with different focal lengths or zooming lenses are utilized to enlarge or reduce the image. The scanning system, though, must change its scanner speed to adapt to elements or reductions.|$|E

It is an inverted flat-bed scanner {{which raises the}} specimen up to the <b>scanning</b> <b>surface.</b> This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a copy stand {{to achieve the same}} effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} 3 D scanned data is {{influenced}} by many factors, such as <b>scanned</b> <b>surface</b> color, glossiness, geometry, ambient light, scanner resolution, proper selection of <b>scanned</b> segments, etc. <b>Surface</b> color and glossiness are important sources of errors, and this paper studies their effects on a specific commercial scanner. Preparatory phase of digitizing process includes selecting proper combination of scanner's sensor aperture and shutter time, depending {{on the characteristics of}} <b>scanned</b> <b>surface.</b> This paper investigates a relationship between the color of <b>scanned</b> <b>surface,</b> the glossiness of <b>scanned</b> <b>surface</b> and the 3 D laser scanning quality...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experimental}} data comparing the accuracy obtained for 2 D and 3 D <b>scanning</b> <b>surfaces</b> using CLEAN-SC deconvolution of beamformed acoustic maps. A spherical array {{is used to}} obtain recordings from a dense point cloud of sound source locations. Beamform-ing and CLEAN-SC acoustic maps are generated using traditional 2 D <b>scanning</b> <b>surfaces</b> and 3 D <b>scanning</b> <b>surfaces</b> corresponding to the surface geometry of an object being acous-tically imaged. Results for the 3 D method show improved accuracy of measured positions and magnitudes of sound sources under a range of circumstances. The most benefit, in regard to position error, is for frequencies above 5 kHz and sound sources located less than a metre from the array. In these circumstances, the three-dimensionality is more dominant. ...|$|R

50|$|First {{scanners}} {{were built}} in the 1950s to map probe signal variations in front of microwave antennas. Determination of a far-field radiation pattern constitutes the primary application of antenna near-field scanners. This novel technique offered an attractive alternative to conventional open area test sites for measurements of high gain, electrically large antennas or antenna arrays (gain > 20 dBi, diameter > 5λ) in an indoor, controlled and all-weather capability environment. Among well recognized and analyzed errors of the near-field measurements, multiple reflections between an antenna under test (AUT) and an electromagnetically non-transparent field detection system (scatterer) belong to the most contributing errors when the AUT has a high gain. Therefore, the <b>scanning</b> <b>surface</b> is recommended to be located outside the reactive near-field region of the AUT.|$|E
50|$|Flatbed {{scanners}} {{often come}} in contact with {{at least part of the}} object to be scanned. They also require books to be fully opened most of the time (there are some exceptions where the <b>scanning</b> <b>surface</b> ends at the edge of the flatbed scanner, so that a book can be opened partially). Both practices can damage rare books; For example, opening a book 180 degrees can be damaging to its spine. These scanners are also implemented to scan other fragile documents such as old maps. However, planetary scanners that allow the book to open to a full 180 degrees have special features that protect the book binding from being damaged. Many of those scanners are equipped with self-balancing book cradles, gaps for the binding to be placed in, and pressure-sensitive glass controls. It is argued that by opening the book to a full 180 degrees and using scan glass, the scanner is able to capture further into the binding than those using a V cradle.|$|E
50|$|Laser {{scanning}} {{describes the}} general method to sample or <b>scan</b> a <b>surface</b> using laser technology. Several areas of application exist that mainly {{differ in the}} power of the lasers that are used, and in the results of the scanning process. Low laser power is used when the <b>scanned</b> <b>surface</b> doesn't have to be influenced, e.g. when it only has to be digitised. Confocal or 3D laser scanning are methods to get information about the <b>scanned</b> <b>surface.</b> Another low-power application uses structured light projection systems for solar cell flatness metrology, enabling stress calculation throughout in excess of 2000 wafers per hour.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new adaptation-based method is {{presented}} to reconstruct animatable facial models of human individuals from scan data. An anatomy-based generic control model serves {{as the starting point}} for our adaptation algorithm. Based on a series of measurements between the specified 3 D landmarks, a global adaptation is carried out to align the generic control model to the <b>scan</b> <b>surface.</b> A local adaptation then deforms the geometry of the generic model to fit all of its vertices to the <b>scan</b> <b>surface.</b> The high-resolution geometry of the <b>scan</b> <b>surface</b> is represented as a displacement map which is generated using an offsetenvelope mapping. Reconstruction of high-resolution geometry on the adapted generic mesh is achieved by hierarchical refinement using a surface subdivision scheme with resampling of the displacement map...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 2014 The <b>scanning</b> <b>surface</b> {{harmonic}} microscope {{is a local}} probe {{method in}} which a mi-crowave signal is applied across a tip-sample tunneling gap generating higher harmonics, which can then be detected. Thus this microscope is sensitive to nonlinearities in the tip-sample junction. In Si and other semiconductors it is sensitive to nonlinearities in the tip-sample capacitance voltage char-acteristics (C/V). Such a local C/V {{has been used to}} delineate regions of different dopant type and concentration in n+/p silicon gratings.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} effect of three {{important}} parameters in planar time-domain (TD) near-field (NF) to far-field (FF) transformation. These parameters are the NF spatial sampling, NF measurement distance and <b>scan</b> <b>surface</b> truncation. The effect of these parameters over the TD FF accuracy are difficult to predict for Ultra Wide Band antennas. In this paper we aim to choose the optimum NF measurement parameters guaranteeing accurate calculation of the time-domain far-field. This allows the optimization of the computation time and memory requirements. Computations using analytic array of elementary dipoles radiation pattern are used to study the impact of each parameter in time-domain near-field antenna measurement. The comparison of the far-field results are presented in time and frequency domains. In particular, it is shown that {{the choice of the}} measurement distance {{and the size of the}} <b>scan</b> <b>surface</b> decide predominantly on the frequency band of accurate FF calculation.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of realistic precise surfaces {{is required in}} many different applications. To date, terrestrial laser scanning offers 3 D input data which are suitable for surface generation but are lacking in photo-realistic appearance. Texture for <b>scanned</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be provided by orthophotos generated from photographs that are acquired from almost the same viewpoint as the incident laser beam.

Analysis of experimental data with large height variations demonstrates the success of the algorithm which produces an orthophoto in near real-time.
