When the glass cooled off, the clay was chipped out of the inside leaving just the hollow glass vessel. This glass was very thin as the fire was not as hot as modern day furnaces. The blowpipe was invented around 1 B.C. This allowed molten glass to be gathered {{on the end of}} the blow pipe and blown into the other end to create a hollow vessel.

40|$|Abstract: Changes to a {{software}} system during implementation and maintenance {{can cause the}} architecture of a system to deviate from its documented architecture. If design documents are to be useful, maintenance programmers {{must be able to}} easily evaluate how closely the documents conform to the code they are meant to describe. Software architecture recovery, which deals with the extraction and analysis of a system’s architecture, has gained more tool support in the past few years. However, there is little research on developing effective and efficient architectural conformance methods. In particular, given the increasing emphasis on patterns and styles in the software engineering community, a method needs to explicitly aid a user in identifying architectural patterns. This paper presents a <b>semi-automatic</b> method, <b>called</b> ARM (Architecture Reconstruction Method), that guides a user in the reconstruction of software architectures based on the recognition of patterns. Once the system’s actual architecture has been reconstructed, we can analyze conformance of the software to the documented design patterns. 1...|$|R

50|$|Mannlicher {{designed}} two <b>semi-automatic</b> rifles both <b>called</b> Model 93, {{one based}} on his turn-bolt rifle and the other based on his straight-pull rifle. The rifles had a recoil spring housing behind the bolt and the bolt locking lugs were angled, so the bolt started turning on firing, essentially a hesitation lock or delayed blowback much like the later Thompson Autorifle utilising the Blish lock. In this system there was no recoiling barrel nor gas piston as with other rifle-caliber autoloading designs, so the mechanism was simple, but ejection of fired cartridge casings was so fierce as to be hazardous to bystanders.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{began selling}} the 1169 cc (70 in³) {{transversely}} mounted inline-four engine Civic for about US$2,200. The Civic was largely {{developed as a}} new platform, and {{was the result of}} taking the previous Honda N600 and increasing the length, width, height, and wheelbase. The engine displacement was almost double the previous N600 (599 cc) at 1,170 cc, with two more cylinders added. The car produced roughly 50 hp (37 kW) and included power front disc brakes, vinyl seating, reclining bucket seats, and a woodgrain-accented dashboard which has many similarities to the later Rover SD1. The hatchback version added a fold-down rear seat, an AM radio, and cloth upholstery. The car had front and rear independent suspension. A four-speed manual transmission was standard. Options for the Civic were kept to a minimum, consisting of air conditioning, a two-speed <b>semi-automatic</b> transmission <b>called</b> the Hondamatic, radial tires, and a rear wiper for the hatchback. The car could achieve 40 mpg on the highway, and with a small 86.6 in wheelbase and 139.8 in overall length, the vehicle weighed 1,500 pounds (680 kg).|$|R
40|$|AbstractImage {{segmentation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} involved topics of research in the area of Computer Vision and has attracted a lot of attention from the researchers. The goal of image segmentation is to change the representation of the image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. In this process an image is partitioned into multiple segments by assigning label to pixels of the image so that the pixels sharing the same label can be characterized as a distinct object present in that image. Several automatic and semi-automatic approaches have been designed in order to segment an image. In this paper we will focus on a <b>semi-automatic</b> approach <b>called</b> the Random Walker approach which was first introduced by Leo Grady and we will contribute several improvements which leads to better segmented images compared to the image segmentations achieved by the ideas involved in the above said paper.

40|$|The {{structured}} programming literature provides methods and {{a wealth of}} heuristic knowledge for guiding the construction of provably correct imperative programs. We investigate these methods and heuristics {{as a basis for}} mechanizing program synthesis. Our approach combines proof planning with conventional partial order planning. Proof planning is an automated theorem proving technique which uses high-level proof plans to guide the search for proofs. Proof plans are structured in terms of proof methods, which encapsulate heuristics for guiding proof search. We demonstrate that proof planning provides a local perspective on the synthesis task. In particular, we show that proof methods can be extended to represent heuristics for guiding program construction. Partial order planning complements proof planning by providing a global perspective on the synthesis task. This means that it allows us to reason about the order in which program fragments are composed. Our hybrid approach has been implemented in a <b>semi-automatic</b> system <b>called</b> BERTHA. BERTHA supports partial correctness and has been tested {{on a wide range of}} non-trivial programming examples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractElectrocardiogram (ECG) {{analysis}} is the method for cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis. Cardiac arrhythmia {{is a group}} of diseases in which the heart beat shows irregularities. The classification of the correct type of Arrhythmia is a necessary and critical issue which becomes difficult in certain cases. In certain cases the Atrial Electrical Activity(AEA) signals are hidden in some other waves and they cannot be detected and classified easily from surface. This paper presents a method by which classification of cardiac arrhythmia is done by processing the ECG. The procedure is done by identifying the QRS complex and thus its position in the preprocessed digitised ECG. The AEA signals in the ECG is identified using a <b>semi-automatic</b> method <b>called</b> Separation Using Maximum Energy Ratio (SUMER), which is found efficient in identifying the hidden waves. In SUMER, an energy ratio based cost function is created and maximized using the gradient ascent method. After identifying the first AEA, the precise positions of all the AEA waves are identified. The ratio between the QRS complex and the AEA waves is calculated and based on the ratio the arrhythmia type is identified. The proposed method would help in better and easy classification of arrhythmia at its early stage...|$|R

At each moment, the multidimensional (MD) schema needs to satisfy the set of information requirements posed by the business users.

To cope with such an inevitable complexity (both {{at the beginning of the}} design process and when potential evolution events occur), in this paper we present a <b>semi-automatic</b> method <b>called</b> ORE, for creating DW designs in an iterative fashion based on a given set of information requirements.
