The purpose of the paper is to study deep <b>sea</b> <b>container</b> services in Italian ports and the feeder connections from Tyrrhenian ports towards the hub ports of Gioia Tauro and Cagliari and vice versa, {{as well as from}} Adriatic ports towards the hub ports of Gioia Tauro and Taranto and vice versa, in order to highlight the transhipment phenomenon in the overall Italian maritime scenari...|$|E
