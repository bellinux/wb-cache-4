5|$|By {{overlaying}} {{a square}} grid of side length c onto the Pythagorean tiling, {{it may be}} used to generate a five-piece dissection of two unequal <b>squares</b> of sides a and b into a single square of side c, showing that the two smaller <b>squares</b> have the same area as the larger one. Similarly, overlaying two Pythagorean tilings {{may be used to}} generate a six-piece dissection of two unequal <b>squares</b> into a different two unequal <b>squares.</b>|$|E
5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of <b>squares</b> of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 <b>squares,</b> 2-by-2 <b>squares,</b> 3-by-3 <b>squares,</b> 4-by-4 <b>squares,</b> 6-by-6 <b>squares</b> or 12-by-12 <b>squares.</b> Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 <b>squares,</b> with two <b>squares</b> along one edge (24/12=2) and five <b>squares</b> along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by <b>squares</b> of two {{different}} sizes that is both unilateral (no two <b>squares</b> have a common side) and equitransitive (each two <b>squares</b> {{of the same size}} can be mapped into each other by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E

5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} <b>squares</b> must include two <b>squares</b> that meet edge-to-edge.

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the <b>squares</b> in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of <b>squares</b> in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of <b>squares</b> to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} <b>squares,</b> rather than the number and length of the blocks of <b>squares.</b> An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
