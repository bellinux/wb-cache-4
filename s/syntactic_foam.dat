Two compositions of <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> are studied for quasi-static and high strain rate compression. In addition, dynamic mechanical analysis is conducted to study the temperature dependent energy dissipation and damping capabilities of these materials. The thermal characterization includes study of the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE). A 356 /SiCHP <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> are not strain rate sensitive as the compressive strength displayed little variation between the tested strain rates of 0. 001 – 2100 s− 1. Microscopic analysis of the high strain rate compression tested specimens showed that the fracture is initiated by the failure of hollow particles {{at the onset of the}} plastic deformation region. This is followed by plastic deformation of the matrix material and further crushing of particles. The <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> showed decrease in storage modulus with increasing temperature and the trend was nearly linear up to 500 °C. The alloy shows a similar behavior at low temperature but the decrease in storage modulus increases sharply over 375 °C. The loss modulus is very small for the tested materials because of lack of viscoelasticity in metallic materials. The trend in the loss modulus is opposite, where the matrix alloy has lower loss modulus than <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> at low temperature. However, over 250 °C the matrix loss modulus starts to increase rapidly and attains a peak around 460 °C. <b>Syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> have higher damping parameter at low temperatures than the matrix alloy.

40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{developing}} functionally graded <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> (FGSFs) {{based on a}} layered co-curing technique. The FGSFs were characterized for compressive and flexural properties and compared with plain <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams.</b> The {{results showed that the}} specific compressive modulus was 3 - 67 % higher in FGSFs compared to plain <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams.</b> FGSF exhibited 5 - 34 % and 34 - 87 % higher specific modulus and strength, respectively in flexural mode. The microscopic examinations of comparative responses of the filler and matrix to deformation suggest that the failure is dominated by the matrix. The gradient in the composition of <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> helps in effectively distributing the stress throughout the microstructure and results in improved mechanical performance of <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams.</b> From the microscopy studies, it is evident that, the failure mechanism in the FGSF under flexural loading is governed by a crack that initiated on the tensile side of the specimen and propagated through the thickness to cause complete fracture. The microscopic observations further clearly demonstrate the existence of seamless interfaces between the layers and a clear difference in the cenosphere concentration across the interface, affirming the gradation in the prepared samples. The results show that appropriate compositions of FGSFs can be selected to develop materials with improved mechanical performance. POLYM. COMPOS., 36 : 685 - 693, 2015.

However, uniform dispersion {{is difficult to}} achieve because they must be mixed with liquid resin prior to foam expansion. New approaches aiming to overcome such problem have been developed at USC's Composites Center. Fiber-reinforced <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> with long fibers (over 6 mm in length) manufactured at USC's Composites Center have achieved promising mechanical properties and demonstrated lower density relative to conventional composite foams.; Fiber-reinforced <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> were synthesized from thermosetting polymeric microspheres (amino and phenolic microspheres), as well as thermoplastic PVC heat expandable microspheres (HEMs). Carbon and/or aramid fibers were used to reinforce the <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams.</b> Basic mechanical properties, including shear, tensile, and compression, were measured in <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> and fiber-reinforced <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams.</b> Microstructure and crack propagation behavior were investigated by scanning electron microscope and light microscopy. Failure mechanisms and reinforcing mechanisms of fiber-reinforced <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams</b> were also analyzed.; As expected, additions of fiber reinforcements to foams enhanced both tensile and shear properties. However, only limited enhancement in compression properties was observed, and fiber reinforcement was of limited benefit in this regard. Therefore, a hybrid foam design was explored and evaluated {{in an attempt to}} enhance compression properties. HEMs were blended with glass microspheres to produce hybrid foams, and hybrid foams were subsequently reinforced with continuous aramid fibers to produce fiber-reinforced hybrid foams. Mechanical properties of these foams were evaluated. Findings indicated that the production of hybrid foams was an effective way to enhance the compressive properties of <b>syntactic</b> <b>foams,</b> while the addition of fiber reinforcements enhanced the shear and tensile performance of syntactic foams.; Another approach to produce ultralight sandwich core materials was explored in which towpreg (fiber bundles impregnated with resin) were configured to produce 3 D pyramidal truss structures. The composite truss structures were subsequently filled with foam to improve resistance to buckling. Mechanical properties of the foam-filled truss structures were measured and contrasted with analytical predictions based on simple truss theory.
