5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created.

Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E

5|$|After the inactivation, the Regiment {{was broken}} up and its {{subordinate}} elements were redesignated. The regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company and <b>Service</b> <b>Company</b> were reorganized on 25 February 1949 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 411th Engineer Brigade, allowing them a larger staff {{with the ability}} to take command of more subordinate units. The regiment's 1st Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 25 February 1949 as the 928th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 15 March 1949 as the 929th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 3rd Battalion disbanded on 9 July 1953. The two separated battalions retained separate lineage from this point and the 355th Engineer Regiment ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never {{received}} a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. The {{reason was that}} the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a competing route. Skaunfelt eventually split his activity in two, demerging the aviation school and renaming it Den Norske Luftfartsskole, which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 percent of the shares. Penguin Air <b>Service</b> <b>company</b> bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun. In 1975, Bugge Supplyship also joined the joint venture and a second aircraft was bought. Most of the traffic was for the oil industry to Stavanger.|$|E

5|$|In October 1940, {{as part of}} a {{reorganisation}} of the Commando formations, {{the unit}} was amalgamated with No. 8 (Guards) Commando into a single special service battalion known as the 4th Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock. As a part of this organisation, the unit's name was changed to 'A' Special <b>Service</b> <b>Company.</b> At the end of 1940, the special service battalions were reorganised into a headquarters and two Commandos {{and the name of the}} unit reverted to No. 3 Commando. In January 1941 the special service battalions were broken up, the Commandos were delinked and raised back to full battalion-sized units themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in {{the period}} between the {{discovery}} of oil and the legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on. The challenges were ended by approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in late 1973. When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. Alyeska Pipeline <b>Service</b> <b>Company</b> alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright. Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight <b>service</b> <b>company,</b> witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to see clearly the aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial left turn onto a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. The tail light was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|IT <b>services</b> <b>companies</b> are {{delivering}} {{similar or}} same solutions in different vertical industry segments {{again and again}} at no cost and with no schedule differentiation {{over a period of}} time!! The hyper competition in the market place, coupled with reduced capability or skill set differentiation between the <b>services</b> <b>companies,</b> is not only making sustainable growth a challenge for <b>services</b> <b>companies</b> but also making it difficult for customers to choose the right services partner. Many <b>services</b> <b>companies</b> have initiated programs under different themes such as innovation, reuse, etc., that lead either to partial or no success. Given this scenario, this paper discusses the obstacles within a <b>services</b> <b>company</b> for creating a decisive differentiation that would help augment further growth. Major Challenges For the last few decades, big <b>services</b> <b>companies</b> have themselves either developed small reusable components and huge products, perhaps accidentally, or they have inherited products via acquisitions. Some of these products are highly successful, {{and some of them are}} kept in cold storage. Revenue growth from these successful products from the past is fast declining for various reasons, such as the architecture being old (client-server based, for example), not havin...|$|R
5|$|Tulsa High School {{opened in}} 1906 {{on the same}} block {{formerly}} occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was a three-story cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed Central High School. The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922. This building remained in this service until 1976, when it {{was replaced by a}} new building on West Edison Street. The old building was taken over by the Public <b>Service</b> <b>Company</b> of Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes were seen making {{reconnaissance}} flights over Miri. The Brooke government decided on a complete destruction of oilfields and airfields in Miri. Shell company officials received orders {{to carry out the}} Denial Scheme on 8 December 1941. In the evening on the same day, the task was completed. All producing oil wells were sealed up with vital equipment and machinery dismantled and shipped off to Singapore. Skilled workers and important company papers also went along with the equipment and sent to Singapore. The Punjab Regiment and several officials were sent to guard Kuching. On 16 December 1941, 9 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese troops consisting of 10,000 men landed on Tanjung Lobang Beach, Miri without much resistance. However, on 19 December 1941, a Dutch flying boat from Tarakan Island attacked the Japanese destroyer Shinonome (under the command of Hiroshi Sasagawa) off Miri. The ship was sunk along with the entire crew of 228. Another flying boat X-33 also damaged a Japanese transport ship. After the fall of Singapore on 15 January 1942, skilled workers that went into hiding with their equipment were sent back to Miri by the Japanese. They were immediately put to work for Japanese oil supply <b>service</b> <b>company</b> named Nen Ryo Hai Kyu. Much of the Japanese oil drilling and refinery equipment was portable. A total of 0.75 million barrels were produced during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{draws on}} the {{experiences}} of Z Special Unit, M Special Unit, the Independent Companies and the Coastwatchers which operated in the South West Pacific Area against the Japanese during World War II. These units had been disbanded soon after the war {{as part of the}} demobilisation of the Australian military; however, after observing the operations of the British Special Air Service during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s the Australian Army decided to raise its own SAS unit. The 1st Special Air <b>Service</b> <b>Company</b> was established on 25 July 1957 at Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, with a strength of 16 officers and 144 other ranks. In 1960, the company became part of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) and was given the responsibility for commando and special forces operations. As part of the pentropic organisation adopted by the Australian Army at the time, the regiment's primary wartime role was divisional-level reconnaissance. On 20 August 1964, the SAS gained regimental status and was expanded to two sabre squadrons and a headquarters, severing the link with the RAR. The raising of a third squadron was approved on 30 April 1965 as part of an overall expansion of the Australian Army.|$|E
