40|$|A {{crystalline}} hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was deposited using {{gas tunnel}} type plasma <b>spraying</b> at different <b>spraying</b> distances. In this study, the microstructure, adhesion and microhardness {{of the resulting}} coatings were investigated to clarify {{the effect of the}} <b>spraying</b> distance on the features of <b>sprayed</b> coatings. The results showed that the <b>spraying</b> distance greatly affects the microhardness, adhesion, and crystallinity of the <b>sprayed</b> HA coatings. Microhardness value was increased as the <b>spraying</b> distance was decreased, mainly due to the formation of dense coating with lower porosity. Adhesion was increased, as the <b>spraying</b> distance was decreased due to a good mechanical bonding between the first apatite layer and the substrate.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded <b>sprayed</b> {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (<b>Sprayed</b> GFRP) in shear strengthening of RC beams under quasi-static loading is investigated.
