40|$|The Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Anti-Dumping Agreement) {{permits the}} {{imposition}} of anti-dumping duties for as long {{and to the extent}} necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury, subject to the proviso that they must be terminated after five years unless a <b>sunset</b> <b>review</b> has been initiated. A <b>sunset</b> <b>review</b> has the purpose of either permitting or terminating the continuation of an anti-dumping duty. This is significant because if the <b>sunset</b> <b>review</b> is not initiated prior to the expiry of the five-year period, the anti-dumping duties will be terminated. Therefore, this places an emphasis on the determination of the precise date of commencement of the anti-dumping duties. This is because an incorrect determination of the date of {{the imposition of}} the anti-dumping duty has obvious financial implications for the interested parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has delivered two salient judgments in this regard: firstly, in Progress Office Machines CC v SARS 2008 2 SA 13 (SCA) (POM), and then more recently, in Association of Meat Importers v ITAC 2013 4 All SA 253 (SCA) (AMIE). This paper contends that these two judgments are in conflict and are riddled with inconsistencies. Secondly, the paper contends that the SCA has in the recent AMIE case virtually rewritten its earlier judgment of Progress Office Machines. Lastly, the paper shows that the approach of South African courts to whether the Anti-Dumping Agreement is binding on South African law is fraught with uncertainty and ambivalence.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on United States-Anti-Dumping Measures on Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) from Mexico (WT/DS 282 /AB/R 2 November 2005). This dispute {{concerns}} the disciplines {{imposed by the}} Anti-Dumping Agreement on WTO Members seeking to extend their anti-dumping measures beyond the original five-year period through a so-called <b>sunset</b> <b>review.</b> Our analysis focuses on the Appellate Body's finding {{in this case that}} no causation analysis is required in sunset reviews, and addresses the AB's approach towards the legal instrument that provides for the US policy in terms of sunset reviews, the Sunset Policy Bulletin. We conclude that the Anti-Dumping Agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in this and other similar cases, imposes only minimal disciplines of a general nature on Members wishing to extend the anti-dumping measure beyond its original five-year period. We argue that the ‘textual' argument relied on to support this deferential approach is weak and has resulted in undermining the practical effect of, what was considered to be, one of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round Anti-Dumping Agreement: limiting the life span of an anti-dumping measure to five years. From an economic perspective, Panels and the Appellate Body are simply debating the wrong type of questions. The prospective nature required by a <b>sunset</b> <b>review</b> analysis raises questions such as why exporters engaged in dumping in the first place, and what the conditions of the industry were so that the dumped imports caused injury. At the moment, sunset reviews seem adrift as panels and the Appellate Body fail to give guidance to Members on how to do a more economically sound and informed revie...|$|E

40|$|Tomato {{trade between}} the U. S. and Mexico has grown {{significantly}} during the past decade, and market structure suggests increased market integration. This study examines fresh tomato price relationships between two major North American shipping points (Sinaloa, and Florida) and several major terminal markets in the U. S. and Mexico to infer whether business strategies vary by supply region or the geography of consumer markets. The results show some evidence of inefficient pricing behavior among some markets, and suggest that Mexican shipping point prices are less integrated with Mexico's own terminal markets than the closest U. S. market, Los Angeles. Moreover, perfectly competitive price behavior is less likely in a terminal market (Chicago) where Sinaloa and Florida compete during winter months. These results are the basis of discussion {{on the role of}} strategic behavior and trade policy influence in these markets. A Comparison Between Mexican and US Markets The growing year round demand for fresh fruits and vegetables stimulated trade between developed and developing countries in the last decade, due to increasing demand {{for a wide variety of}} produce and counterseasonal production patterns. In the case of fresh tomatoes, trade flows between Mexico and the U. S. increased considerably during the 1990 s, partly due to trade liberalization and partly due to market dynamics (Padilla).

40|$|The voluminous {{literature}} on the U. S. antidumping laws has a curious lacuna. There is little in this literature {{about the effects of}} antidumping duties on the volume of subject imports. One reason this key question has not frequently been investigated is the lack of data. U. S. antidumping duties are firm specific, while information about U. S. imports is collected by commodity and country, but not by firm. This paper avoids this problem by examining a sample of U. S. antidumping orders for which the duties were the same for all firms from a given country, or for which there was only one foreign firm exporting the product from the foreign country in question. Using this sample, the present paper is the first study of which the author is aware that investigates the relation between antidumping duties and subject imports using accurate information about the level of antidumping duties. The paper is also unique in accurately measuring the quantity of imports affected by the antidumping duties. The study uses import quantity data reported by the USITC in its <b>Sunset</b> <b>Review</b> reports, rather than using ten-digit HTUSA categories, which sometimes do not match antidumping product definitions precisely. The price of using this unique dataset is that the current study is restricted to a sample of only 32 of the approximately 350 antidumping orders originating during the relevant years, of which about 188 are still in effect. Some evidence is presented suggesting that the sample of orders used may be representative of the larger universe. For the sample examined, the paper finds an elasticity of subject imports with respect to U. S. antidumping duties of roughly 0. 9. The paper also finds some evidence that age of the antidumping order may be a factor in explaining reduction in volume of subject imports. Study of this effect may be {{complicated by the fact that}} the initial level of all U. S. antidumping duties was lower during the early 1980 s than in the early 1990 s; so older orders tend to have lower duties. The study finds inconclusive evidence about the effect of antidumping orders on the price received by the foreign suppliers of subject imports. ...|$|E
