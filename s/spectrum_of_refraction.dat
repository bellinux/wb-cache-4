The neutrino energy <b>spectrum</b> and index <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> are obtained for neutral and charged media in the strong-field limit (M_W≫√(B) ≫ m_e,T,μ,| p|) using the lowest Landau level approximation. The results found within the lowest Landau level approximation are numerically validated, summing in all Landau levels, for strong B≫ T^ 2 and weakly-strong B ≳ T^ 2 fields. The neutrino energy in leading order of the Fermi coupling constant is expressed as the sum of three terms: a kinetic-energy term, a magnetic-field neutrino-induced-magnetic-moment interaction term, and a rest-energy term. The leading radiative correction to the kinetic-energy term depends linearly on the magnetic field strength and is independent of the chemical potential. The other two terms are only present in a charged medium. For strong and weakly-strong fields, it is found that the field-dependent correction to the neutrino energy in a neutral medium is much larger than the thermal one. Possible applications to cosmology and astrophysics of the results are considered...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{and precise}} {{interpretation}} of radio occultation soundings of planetary atmospheres requires understanding the signal amplitude and phase variations caused by random perturbations {{in the complex}} index <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> caused by atmospheric turbulence. This research focuses on understanding the turbulence {{and its impact on}} these soundings. From aircraft temperature, pressure and humidity measurements we obtained a parametric model for estimating the strength of the atmospheric turbulence in the troposphere. We used high-resolution balloon measurements to understand the spatial <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> turbulence in the vertical dimension. We also review and extend electromagnetic scintillation theory to include a complex index <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> <b>of</b> the propagating medium. In contrast to when the fluctuations in only the real component of the index <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> are considered, this work quantifies how atmospheric turbulent eddies contribute to the signal amplitude and phase fluctuations and the amplitude frequency correlation function when the index <b>of</b> <b>refraction</b> is complex. The generalized expressions developed for determining the signal's amplitude and phase fluctuations can be solved for planar, spherical or beam electromagnetic wave propagation. We then apply our mathematical model to the case of a plane wave propagating through a homogenous turbulence medium and estimate the amplitude variance for signals at various frequencies near the 22 GHz and 183 GHz water vapor absorption features. The theoretical results predict the impact of random fluctuations in the absorption coefficient along the signal propagation path on the signal's amplitude fluctuations. These results indicate that amplitude fluctuations arising from perturbations of the absorption field can be comparable to those when the medium has a purely real index <b>of</b> <b>refraction.</b> This clearly indicates that the differential optical depth approach devised by Kursinski et al.

We also show that refraction can result in temporal variations in the transit transmission spectrum which may provide a way to obtain altitude-dependent <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> exoplanet atmospheres.
