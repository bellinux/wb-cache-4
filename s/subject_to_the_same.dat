5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis is <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general {{threats that}} corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the}} first corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis, or sea ginger, is {{a species}} of colonial fire coral with a {{calcareous}} skeleton. It is found on shallow water coral reefs in the tropical west Atlantic Ocean. It shows {{a variety of different}} morphologies depending on its location. It feeds on plankton and derives part of its energy requirements from microalgae found within its tissues. It is an important member of the reef building community and <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> threats as other corals. It can cause painful stings to unwary divers.|$|E

The society files paperwork with Georgia Tech administration and the Student Government Association, holds elections for each of its four mandatory officer positions (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary) and is formally advised by a Georgia Tech faculty member. The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. As of 2007, the society's current faculty advisor is Gary S. May, {{the dean of the}} College of Engineering and an ANAK member since 1985.|$|E

5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E

40|$|W. E. Ricker has {{recently}} {{shown that the}} failure of present day salmon fisheries to maintain historically high yields may be due in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that different stocks, which are <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fishing pressure, have different biological productivities, and the equilibrium maximum sustained yield may cause smaller less productive stocks to reach very low levels or even go extinct.
