An endonuclease has been isolated from uninfected E. coli that cleaves these long RNAs at five specific sites to generate RNA molecules essentially the same as the early T 7 RNAs observed in vivo. This <b>sizing</b> <b>factor,</b> which may be RNase III, can act during or after RNA synthesis. Synthesis of early RNA chains has been shown to start at three strong initiators, spaced about 150 - 200 base-pairs apart near the left end of T 7 DNA. Thus, the five cleavages by <b>sizing</b> <b>factor</b> generate the five early messenger RNAs of T 7 plus three overlapping RNAs from the promoter region. RNA chains that are started at two of the strong initiators begin with A; those started at the third begin with G.

40|$|ABSTRACT FILTER SCHEDULING FUNCTION MODEL IN INTERNET SERVER: RESOURCE CONFIGURATION, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND OPTIMAL SCHEDULING by MINGHUA XU August 2010 Advisor: Dr. Cheng-Zhong Xu Major: Computer Engineering Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Internet traffic often {{exhibits}} a structure with rich high-order statistical properties like selfsimilarity and long-range dependency (LRD). This greatly complicates {{the problem of}} server performance modeling and optimization. On the other hand, popularity of Internet has created numerous client-server or peer-to-peer applications, with most of them, such as online payment, purchasing, trading, searching, publishing and media streaming, being timing sensitive and/or financially critical. The scheduling policy in Internet servers is playing central role in satisfying service level agreement (SLA) and achieving savings and efficiency in operations. The increasing popularity of high-volume performance critical Internet applications is a challenge for servers to provide individual response-time guarantees. Existing tools like queuing models in most cases only hold in mean value analysis under the assumption of simplified traffic structures. Considering {{the fact that most}} Internet applications can tolerate a small percentage of deadline misses, we define a decay function model characterizes the relationship between the request delay constraint, deadline misses, and server capacity in a transfer function based filter system. The model is general for any time-series based or measurement based processes. Within the model framework, a relationship between server capacity, scheduling policy, and service deadline is established in formalism. Time-invariant (non-adaptive) resource allocation policies are design and analyzed in the time domain. For an important class of fixed-time allocation policies, optimality conditions with respect to the correlation of input traffic are established. The upper bound for server capacity and service level are derived with general Chebshev 2 ̆ 7 s inequality, and extended to tighter boundaries for unimodal distributions by using VysochanskiPetunin 2 ̆ 7 s inequality. For traffic with strong LRD, a design and analysis of the decay function model is done in the frequency domain. Most Internet traffic has monotonically decreasing strength of variation functions over frequency. For this type of input traffic, it is proved that optimal schedulers must have a convex structure. Uniform resource allocation is an extreme case of the convexity and is proved to be optimal for Poisson traffic. With an integration of the convex-structural principle, an enhance GPS policy improves the service quality significantly. Furthermore, it is shown that the presence of LRD in the input traffic results in shift of variation strength from high frequency to lower frequency bands, leading to a degradation of the service quality. The model is also extended to support server with different deadlines, and to derive an optimal time-variant (adaptive) resource allocation policy that minimizes server load variances and server resource demands. Simulation results show time-variant scheduling algorithm indeed outperforms time-invariant optimal decay function scheduler. Internet traffic has two major dynamic factors, the distribution of request size and the correlation of request arrival process. When applying decay function model as scheduler to random point process, corresponding two influences for server workload process is revealed as, first, <b>sizing</b> <b>factor</b> [...] interaction between request size distribution and scheduling functions, second, correlation factor [...] interaction between power spectrum of arrival process and scheduling function. For the second factor, it is known from this thesis that convex scheduling function will minimize its impact over server workload. Under the assumption of homogeneous scheduling function for all requests, it shows that uniform scheduling is optimal for the <b>sizing</b> <b>factor.</b> Further more, by analyzing the impact from queueing delay to scheduling function, it shows that queueing larger tasks vs. smaller ones leads to less reduction in <b>sizing</b> <b>factor,</b> but at the benefit of more decreasing in correlation factor in the server workload process. This shows the origin of optimality of shortest remain processing time (SRPT) scheduler...|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic {{generator}} is {{a device}} that converts solar radiation originated from the Sun into electrical energy. Power electronics are used to feed this electrical energy into the grid. In {{the design of a}} converter that is connected to the photovoltaic generator, {{it is important to know}} the maximum values of the generator output: Maximum output power, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, which are dependent on the amount of incident radiation and the value of ambient temperature. Maximum value for short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were found based on the year-round irradiation and temperature measurement data. In this thesis, two boost-power-stage converters were designed. Design of the first converter was based on the conventional method that was introduced in the literature. In that method, the inductor and semiconductors were sized by using current that was derived by dividing input power of the converter by input voltage. Value of the converter input power was calculated by multiplying the standard test condition output power of the selected photovoltaic generator by conventional <b>sizing</b> <b>factor,</b> which is the ratio of the converter nominal input power to the nominal output power of the photovoltaic generator. The second converter was designed by using the information about the real maximum output current of the selected photovoltaic generator, which is the short-circuit current. The converters were designed in such a way that both have the same amount of switching frequency input voltage ripple and equal ability to prevent the low frequency output voltage ripple from affecting the input voltage. Even if the converters are electrically similar, the conventional design method leads to higher input capacitance, larger inductor core size and more uneven temperature distribution of the power semiconductors at the maximum power point than the new design method. Thus, the conventional design method leads to unnecessary oversizing. Significant cost savings can be achieved by applying the new design method, which is presented in this thesis for the first time. The results were verified by experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the production and consumption of Kuwait electrical energy, installed capacity and peak loads is presented in this research. The results show that Kuwait has a serious problem because of insufficient electrical energy installed and load peaking, which is considered unacceptable. The research also identifies and analyses the geographical and temporal variability of solar energy inside Kuwait. The fundamental solar models are modified to estimate and identify daily and hourly global (direct-beam) and total solar radiation (SR) on horizontal surfaces {{on the basis of}} the more readily available meteorological data such as latitude angle, longitude angle, clearness index, solar time and corresponding hour angle. The presented results demonstrate that Kuwait has an abundance of solar energy capability in terms of almost cloudless atmosphere for nine months and twelve hours solar time a day throughout the year. The daily global and monthly averaged solar intensity have been computed. This research shows that the knowledge of SR data is essential for design and sizing of the photovoltaic (PV) systems. A specific type of PV module has been modelled and its characteristics such as I-V and P-V curves for each month of the year have been calculated and analysed using MATLAB/Simulink to determine the amount of DC current, voltage and power. These results form the basis of the grid-connected PV system (GCPV) design from array construction to the reliability of electrical supply. A technical sizing procedure based on sizing algorithm using iterative manual approach (SAIMA) for meeting specific amount of GWh output required by a potential PV system sponsor in Kuwait is presented. SAIMA has been implemented to determine the configuration of the PV array, inverter-to-PV array <b>sizing</b> <b>factor</b> and efficiency of the system according to previous PV module and inverter database. A novel methodology for approximating Pareto front multi-criteria cost-efficiency optimization problem for a proposed GCPV system has been constructed using system planning constraints. The proposed algorithm is based on bi-objective weighted-sum (BoWS) method to maximize the system efficiency and minimize the system cost. A main objective function of both GCPV system cost and efficiency has been stated as function of PV output power and inverter rated power. The proposed function is performed with the Sequential Quadratic Programing (SQP). The results presented in this research have been acquired through simulation of the proposed GCPV to a specific section of Alsabyia generation station part of Kuwait national grid with efficient maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm incorporated into a DC-DC boost converter. The simulations were performed using Power Simulation Software (PSIM). The analytical model of the PV module has been combined with a ‘perturb and observe’ (P&O) method so that MPP is achieved with the external temperature and SR also considered. An inverter is used to track the output voltage of the converter and interface the PV array with the grid. The results show that the model not only achieves the MPP function but also improves the output of the inverter by reducing the ripples in the sine waveforms. Moreover, this research involved using the software package ERACS to analyze the impact of penetrating approximately 100 MW of the proposed PV generation to a part of the generation unit at Alsybia electrical station in Kuwait. The one-line diagram of the network was modeled in ERACS and it’s used to conduct power flow and fault studies. Four network locations were chosen as potential sites to connect the PV system. Power flow studies were conducted on the network for every hour that the PV array contributed power to the network and for 35 different network configurations for each daylight hour. Computer programs were created to conduct all of these power flow studies and to help analyze the data. Fault studies were then carried out on the network, with the PV array connected at all of the potential locations. There were a few faults that caused a fault level greater than 40 kA to flow through the 13. 8 kV busbars...|$|E
