However subsurface sites are significantly stabilised when a sufficient amount of O adatoms is present on the surface. At high enough O coverage on the Ag(2 1 0) surface the mixed on-surface + subsurface O adsorption is energetically favoured {{with respect to the}} on-surface only adsorption. Instead, on the Ag(4 1 0) surface, at the coverage we have considered (3 / 8 ML), the existence of stable terrace sites makes the subsurface O incorporation less favourable.

Recently, it has been observed that when the two honeycomb crystals are close to perfect alignment, <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> develop in graphene due to the moiré adhesion landscape. Simultaneously a gap opens at the Dirac point. Here we derive a simple low energy model for graphene carriers close to alignment with the substrate, taking into account spontaneous strains at equilibrium, pseudogauge fields and deformation potentials. We carry out a detailed characterisation of the modified band structure, gap, local and global density of states, and band topology in terms of physical parameters.

All the MnRh thin films thus fabricated {{are found to}} be of the CsCl type structure, and exhibit the ferromagnetism at room temperature. The coercivity of about 1. 1 kOe was observed at 5 K for films grown onto SiO 2 substrates, while coercivity measured at 300 K in all the films were less than 200 Oe. The temperature dependence of magnetization shows thermal hysteresis for all the samples ranging from 150 K to 250 K that varies with the substrates used. The maximum of exchange bias field of 270 Oe and unidirectional magnetic anisotropy constant of 0. 35 erg/cm 2 at 5 K was observed for films grown onto SiO 2 substrates better than that observed for the films grown onto MgO substrates.

40|$|The elucidation of {{the role}} that {{injected}} cations play {{in the creation of}} electrochromic (EC) color centers in hydrated W 03 films is presented. The electron and cation contributions to the lattice distortion upon film coloration have been eval-uated. The evolution of the fundamental absorption edge and vibrational bands of crystalline hydrate films of the W 03 n(H 20) (n = 2, 1 / 3) was monitored in situ in a spectroelectrochemical cell during the coloration process by visible and Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy. The electrochromic performance and film stability were studied using cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemistry. Isotopic effects of blue shift of the fundamental absorption edge and vibra-tional band shifts upon film coloration with Ht and Dt cations at the same charge density have been found. The analysis of vibrational band shifts during electrochromic coloration with Ht and Dt cations indicates that along with the lattice polarization induced by injected electrons forming polarons, a <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> generated by inserted cations is occurring as well. An explanation of the origin of the blue shift of optical gap energy upon coloration by three different effects of the electronic structure rearrangement is proposed.

Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) analyses suggested that at 400 and 600 ºC oxygen from perovskite is transferred to Feº to produce an oxygen deficient perovskite, LaMnO 3 -d, and highly dispersed iron oxides, mainly Fe 3 O 4 and FeO. XRD lattice parameters and crystallite size showed that LaMnO 3 suffers a <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> after reaction but no collapse of the perovskite structure. Reactivity studies pointed to a special interface effect of Feº/LaMO 3 towards two reactions with H 2 O 2, the decomposition to O 2 and the oxidation of the model molecule, the methylene blue dye. As the treatment temperature of the Feº/LaMnO 3. 15 increased, the activity for H 2 O 2 decomposition decreased, whereas the activity for the dye oxidation increased. These results are discussed in terms of a decrease in the concentration of Mn 4 +surf and Mn 3 +surf species, active for the H 2 O 2 decomposition, with the formation of Mn 2 +surf and Fe 2 +surf species, active for the Fenton reaction...|$|E
40|$|We present two {{different}} theories for Raman scattering and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) {{in the low}} temperature ferromagnetic phase of YTiO$_ 3 $ and compare this to the available experimental data. For description of the orbital ground-state and orbital excitations, we consider two models corresponding to two theoretical limits: one where the $t_{ 2 g}$ orbitals are degenerate, and the other where <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> split them. In the former model the orbitals interact through superexchange. The resulting superexchange Hamiltonian yields an orbitally ordered ground state with collective orbital excitations {{on top of it}} - the orbitons. In the orbital-lattice model, on the other hand, distortions lead to local dd-transitions between crystal field levels. Correspondingly, the orbital response functions that determine Raman and RIXS lineshapes and intensities are of cooperative or single-ion character. We find that the superexchange model yields theoretical Raman and RIXS spectra that fit very well to the experimental data.

In this study, the local structure of a FeCoNiCrPd HEA is quantitatively analyzed with X-ray total scattering and extended X-ray absorption fine structure methods.

Involvements of and competitions between different degrees of freedom and energy scales present considerable difficulties for understanding these problems. In this thesis, I have used home-built variable-temperature high resolution (spatial and energy) spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopes (SI-STM) to study the topography and the local single-particle tunneling spectroscopy in a family of two-dimensional charge-density wave (2 D-CDW) materials (TaSe 2, TaS 2, and NbSe 2) and in a newly discovered 5 d Mott insulator Sr 2 IrO 4 with strong spin-orbit coupling. In the 2 D-CDW materials, we have shown the <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> and weak electron modulation accompanying CDW transition, directly opposite to Peierls mechanism. We have also discovered that the 2 D-CDW transitions in TaSe 2 and TaS 2 show involvement of the orbital degree of freedom, shedding light on a long standing puzzle with their electrical resistivity anomalies.

Unusual temperature-dependent and x-dependent spectral changes are observed in the entire valence band region. Since Pr doping does not introduce carriers into the system but brings about <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> effects which exert significant influence on the p–d hybridization, the degree of mixing between Mn 3 d and O 2 p levels is considered to be the major factor responsible for the spectral weight transfers with temperature and Pr doping level. The observed changes are not consistent with the results of local-density-approximation (LDA) band calculation, but can be understood by the density-of-states from the LDA þ U calculation or configuration-interaction cluster calculations. This implies that a strong correlation effect between d electrons {{plays an important role in}} these manganites. High resolution spectra near the Fermi level shows a clear metallic edge at low temperature for low Pr concentration sample ðx 0 : 13 Þ; but the metallic Fermi edge disappears at higher Pr doping levels (x 0 : 3 and 0. 4) even at the temperature below Tc where the bulk metal–insulator transition occurs.

40|$|Veins {{occurring}} {{at the edge}} of the dextral Indian Islands Fault (Newfoundland) are folded in response to a fault-parallel, ductile shear. The veins, which locally constitute a penetrative fabric element at outcrop scale, are composed mainly of calcite and have a narrow rim of quartz and chlorite. Both the calcite and quartz are generally fibrous and lattice distortion in the calcite is not commensurate with the observed degree of fibre curvature. This observation supports the popular view that curved fibres grow curved as they track the vein opening vector. It is demonstrated, however, that the curvature in the material described here is due to deformation and that the lack of <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> is due, in part, to polygonization and to recrystallization. All observations are consistent with both the calcite and the quartz fibres having grown perpendicular to the vein walls. The chlorite orientation is controlled by the orientation of mica grains in the country rock. In some veins, markers make it possible to define the net opening direction and, in all examples, it is demonstrated that the direction has not been tracked by the fibres. Since this conclusion may be more generally applicable. caution should be exercised in interpreting kinematics on the basis of fibre geometry. Where vein density is high, the veins and country rock screens separating them form a multilayer sequence that is folded into fairly harmonic folds. The folds appear to have a cleavage transected relationship to the regional cleavage, but the cleavage is shown to predate the folds...|$|E

40|$|First-principles {{calculations}} {{to study}} the electronic and magnetic properties of bulk, oxygen-deficient SrTiO$_ 3 $ (STO) under different doping conditions and densities have been conducted. The appearance of magnetism in oxygen-deficient STO is not determined solely {{by the presence of}} a single oxygen vacancy but by the density of free carriers and the relative proximity of the vacant sites. We find that while an isolated vacancy behaves as a non-magnetic double donor, manipulation of the doping conditions allows the stability of a single donor state, with emergent local moments coupled ferromagnetically by carriers in the conduction band. <b>Strong</b> local <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> enhance the binding of this state. The energy of the in-gap local moment can be further tuned by orthorhombic strain. Consequently we find that the free-carrier density and strain are fundamental components to obtaining trapped spin-polarized electrons in oxygen-deficient STO, which may have important implications in the design of optical devices.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{two different}} magnetic materials: epitaxial yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and heteromorphous CoFeB-SiO 2 films. YIG films were grown by pulse laser deposition (PLD) techniques onto gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates of (111) and (001) crystal orientations. Using stoichiometric and overstoichiometric ablative targets, we developed {{two types of}} YIG submicron films. The films grown from overstoichiometric targets have magnetic properties slightly different from standard liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) YIGs. They also demonstrate good substrate matching and approximately 6 % nonstoichiometry. In contrary, films grown from stoichiometric targets posses surprisingly high values of uniaxial anisotropy, meanwhile cubic anisotropy is reduced several times. These films also reveal <b>strong</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> and nonstoichiometry around 17 %. Employing Weiss molecular field theory and single-ion anisotropy model we determined the preferential occupancy of the octahedral [a] positions in the YIG cubic lattices by Fe 3 + vacancies. The vacancies {{were found to be}} preferentially oriented along the growth direction perpendicular to the film surface. We called this effect “deformation blockade”. Different magnetostatic surface wave (MSSW) filters were also demonstrated. The filters employ high uniaxial anisotropy in YIG submicron films with magnetic losses ΔH ~ 1 Oe.  Heteromorphous CoFeB-SiO 2 films were deposited onto glass substrates employing carrousel magnetron sputtering. This novel technique allows amorphous films fabrication with record high in-plane anisotropy. The induced anisotropy fields here are approximately dozen times greater the values achieved using conventional growth technique when external bias field is applied during deposition process. Interesting observations were made studying CoFeB-SiO 2 magnetization dynamics in the wide frequency range from 500 kHz up to 15 GHz.   Two different anomalies of the magnetic susceptibility were found at the field of in-plane anisotropy Hp and critical field Hcr (0 < Hcr < Hp). We explained the anomalies appearance by sequence of the domain walls transformations so that Néel-Bloch-Néel domain wall transition stands for the instability at H = ±Hcr and transition from the uniformly magnetized state to the domain state with Néel domain wall and vice versa is responsible for the instability at H = ±Hp.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the electronic and magnetic structure of Sr_ 3 -xCa_xRu_ 2 O_ 7 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) {{on the basis}} of the double-layered three-dimensional multiband Hubbard model with spin-orbit interaction. In our model, <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> is implemented as the modulation of transfer integrals or a crystal field. The most stable states are estimated within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, in which the colinear spin configurations with five different spin-quantization axes are adopted as candidates. The obtained spin structures for some particular <b>lattice</b> <b>distortions</b> are consistent with the neutron diffraction results for Ca_ 3 Ru_ 2 O_ 7. Also, some magnetic phase transitions can occur due to changes in <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion.</b> These results facilitate the comprehensive understanding of the phase diagram of Sr_ 3 -xCa_xRu_ 2 O_ 7.
