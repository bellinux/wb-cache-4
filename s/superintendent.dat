Logistic regression was used and found doctoral degree, years of educational service, years in the district, large suburbs and large cities, API, and student enrollment total were the seven predictors show significance for women <b>superintendents.</b> Cross-tabulation was then applied to test whether the predecessor's sex influences the successor's sex, ÷² (1) = 1120. 361, p =. 000 <. 05, revealing that the association between <b>superintendent's</b> sex before turnover was significant. That is, if districts had women <b>superintendents</b> before, it is easier for women successors to enter these districts again. One repeated, one within ANOVA was used to test whether <b>superintendent's</b> sex influence the percentage of female district staff. The results found it was not significant to determine the rate of increase based on <b>superintendent's</b> sex. Women <b>superintendents</b> did not increased the percentages of female district office staff; rather, women were more likely to enter districts with larger female principal percentages than men. The percentages of female principals and student services staff increased overtime for both women and men <b>superintendents,</b> but the rate of increase was not significant.

This study describes and analyzes the social and professional networking that exists among <b>superintendents</b> within the state of Illinois. All Illinois <b>superintendents</b> {{were asked to respond to}} a survey that was divided into four sections. The first section requested respondents to name up to five <b>superintendents</b> who were their closest personal friends or most respected colleagues. The second section asked for age, gender, ethnicity, frequency of contact, length of association, and professional organizations where they had contact with these colleagues. The third section asked respondents their perception of how networking may have aided career advancement, what topics were discussed during networking, and what methods were used to network. The concluding section asked for demographic information. Sociograms visually portray the networking that existed among <b>superintendents</b> within each of the 21 regions of the state of Illinois. Frequencies, percentages, and crosstabulations were utilized to describe the network and those who network. A determination of any significant differences between specific variables was made by using the chi-square statistic. The findings indicate the presence of identifiable networks among Illinois <b>superintendents.</b> Sociograms illustrate the path and clusters formed by these <b>superintendents.</b> There are <b>superintendents</b> within each region who have multiple contacts (stars) and those who are isolated (isolates). These <b>superintendents</b> are predominately white males with 27 years in education, 8 years as <b>superintendents,</b> and 5 years as <b>superintendents</b> in their present districts. Most of these <b>superintendents</b> hold advanced or doctoral degrees and belong to the Illinois Association of School Administrators. The responding <b>superintendents</b> named the maximum allowed five <b>superintendents</b> as colleagues three-fourths of the time and typically have known these individuals for more than 5 years. The university from which these individuals received their most recent degree was not a factor in the naming of <b>superintendents</b> with whom they networked. The issues discussed most frequently by networking <b>superintendents</b> were school finance and superintendent/board relations. <b>Superintendents</b> talked with their colleagues mainly on a monthly basis using the telephone or face-to-face contact. The use of technology was almost nonexistent. Lastly, this study indicates that a majority of these <b>superintendents</b> perceived that networking either helped or possibly helped them with career advancement...|$|R

This study examined Illinois public school <b>superintendents</b> to determine if there were differences between <b>superintendents</b> appointed from within their districts and <b>superintendents</b> appointed from outside of their districts on selected professional and demographic characteristics. The benchmark research of Richard O. Carlson found significant differences between <b>superintendents</b> appointed from within their school districts, labeled "place-bound" by Carlson, and <b>superintendents</b> appointed from outside of their districts, labeled "career-bound" by Carlson. Carlson's theories have been widely cited in educational administration textbooks. The findings of this study found differences in the characteristics of Illinois public school <b>superintendents</b> appointed from within when compared to <b>superintendents</b> appointed from outside their districts. This study found the 29. 1 % of Illinois <b>superintendents</b> appointed from within their districts {{were more likely to have}} been: employed in larger, suburban or urban school districts; older when they became superintendents; employed by fewer districts for fewer years as superintendents; employed more years in their present position; and earning a higher salary. <b>Superintendents</b> appointed from within were less likely to: be employed in smaller and rural districts, and to have earned a doctorate degree. The findings of this study confirmed Carlson's research in several areas, but also found differences from Carlson's research. Contrary to Carlson's findings, this study found that there were no differences between <b>superintendents</b> appointed from within and <b>superintendents</b> appointed from outside in: membership in professional organizations, age when they become building administrators, and age when graduate degrees were earned. No differences were found in superintendents' evaluation ratings and preferred job responsibilities. Differences were found in the two groups of superintendents' choices of the most influential factors in seeking their first superintendency, but no differences were found in superintendents' choices of the most influential factors in seeking their next superintendency.
