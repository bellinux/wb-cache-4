After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new forecasting technique that estimates energy demand by applying a Bayesian approach to forecasting. We introduce our Bayesian Heating Oil Forecaster (BHOF), which forecasts daily heating oil demand for individual customers who {{are enrolled in}} an automatic delivery service provided by a heating oil sales and distribution company. The existing forecasting method is based on linear regression, and its performance diminishes for new customers who lack historical delivery data. Bayesian methods, on the other hand, respond effectively in the <b>start-up</b> <b>situation</b> where no prior data history is available. Our Bayesian Heating Oil Forecaster uses forecasters ’ past performances for existing customers to adjust the current forecast for target customers. We adapted a Bayesian approach to forecasting combined with domain knowledge and original ideas to develop our Bayesian Heating Oil Forecaster, which forecasts demand for target customers without relying on their historical deliveries. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our Bayesian Heating Oil Forecaster shows increased performance over the existing forecasting method whe...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that during start-up, a PEM fuel cell experiences a transient {{that can lead}} to carbon oxidation in the cathode catalyst. During the transient, a hydrogen rich area near the anode inlet drives the cell voltage high. In open circuit operation, a positive current in this region is matched by a negative current in the hydrogen depleted region at the anode outlet. This negative current includes carbon oxidation at the cathode. Capacitance effects {{have been shown to be}} significant in such <b>start-up</b> <b>situations.</b> In this work, a simple model is presented that describes the start-up phenomena described above including capacitance effects. Numerical simulations of the model are performed. Qualitative agreement with current density and electrochemical potential measurements for the transient are obtained.

Most existing approaches in the literature are for monitoring location parameters. They may not be effective with a change of distribution over time in many applications. This paper develops a new distribution-free control chart based on the integration of a powerful nonparametric goodness-of-fit test and the exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control scheme. Benefiting from certain desirable properties of the test and the proposed charting statistic, our proposed control chart is computationally fast, convenient to use, and efficient in detecting potential shifts in location, scale, and shape. Thus, it offers robust protection against variation in various underlying distributions. Numerical studies and a real-data example show that the proposed approaches are quite effective in industrial applications, particularly in <b>start-up</b> and short-run <b>situations...</b>|$|R

This paper develops a new mul-tivariate self-starting methodology for monitoring location parameters. It is based on adapting the multivariate spatial rank to on-line sequential monitoring. The weighted version of the rank-based test is used to formulate the charting statistic by incor-porating the exponentially weighted moving average control (EWMA) scheme. It is robust to non-normal data, easy to construct, fast to compute and also very efficient in detecting multivariate process shifts, especially for small or moderate shifts when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. As it avoids the need for a lengthy data-gathering step before charting and it does not require knowledge of the underlying distribution, the proposed control chart is particularly useful in <b>start-up</b> or short-run <b>situations.</b> A real-data example from white wine production processes shows that it performs quite well in the real application...|$|R
40|$|Enterprise systems hold a large {{promise for}} organisations {{to enhance their}} {{strategic}} position. However, adoption and implementation of enterprise systems is not without problems. Many problems {{have been reported in}} the literature with implementation of new technology, many of which seem to recur over and over again. It seems difficult for organisations to learn from previous experience and successfully organise and manage complex dynamic projects like an enterprise system implementation project. Although current project and change management methods offer support in organising and managing complex projects, more is needed to increase insight into the specific situation at hand. In this chapter, research is presented aimed at collecting knowledge on the dynamics of enterprise system implementation projects. The knowledge can serve to increase awareness of potential risks and pitfalls in specific new enterprise system implementation situations. To make the knowledge accessible a tool has been developed for assessing a <b>start-up</b> <b>situation</b> of an enterprise system implementation project in an organisation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the factors involved in the <b>start-up</b> <b>situation</b> and the first seven years ’ development on the subsequent high growth of firms. On the basis of former literature and models of entrepreneurial behaviour three models of new firm performance will be tested with logistic regression method. First, new venture performance, measured by high growth of the firm, will be explained by entrepreneurial characteristics (entrepreneur’s personality, strategic control orientation and skills of entrepreneur). The second model explains relative growth by using entrepreneurial team and interaction between the firm and environment as explanatory variables. The third model combines these two models. Doubling of turnover will be used as the criterion of high growth. The longitudinal study follows up 200 SMEs from Finnish metal products manufacturing and business service firms established in 1990 up to the year 1997. The sample consists of 138 firms from the branch of manufacturing of metal products and 62 business service firms.

40|$|A {{computer}} {{model has been}} developed to simulate the waste combustion process in a moving grate furnace. The {{computer model}} describes the main processes occurring both in the waste layer on the grate, and in the gas phase in the furnace. The boiler section and the flue gas cleaning equipment are {{also included in the}} model. The computer simulation program can be used for the design of new and advanced control concepts, for the evaluation or optimization of present control concepts, and for the effectiveness of new sensors of key parameters in the control concept. For operator training purposes, the simulation program is extended with a graphic interface. Operators can thus be trained in normal and emergency <b>situations,</b> <b>start-up</b> and shut-down, and alarm diagnosis. The computer simulation program is based on first principles. The description of the underlying physics of the combustion model has been validated against experiments in a laboratory grate furnace. In this furnace a lot of experiments with different types of waste and various process conditions have been carried out. Furthermore the model is validated against data from full-scale incinerators. The above described computer simulation program is used in practice for process optimization and the design of a new control system. The program is continuously modified, refined and extended. The state-of-the-art and the latest results of the computer simulation program and also the main results of the experimental research program will be described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The restart of a {{pipeline}} containing gelled waxy crude oil after shutdown is simulated using a two-fluid displacement model. The model {{assumes that the}} gelled oil is to be displaced by pumping in another fluid under constant pressure and that the incoming fluid displays Bingham plastic behaviour. The rheological behaviour of the gelled oil is characterised by a time-dependent constitutive equation with a yield stress, based on modelling of a North Sea waxy crude oil. The start-up flow model {{takes into account the}} compressibility and longitudinal variations in physical and rheological properties of both fluids as they flow along the pipeline. The effects of yield stress and the compressible nature of the gelled oil are effectively handled by introducing the concept of a propagating yield front and initial compression flow, that precede viscous flow of the gelled oil for a successful start-up. The model predicts that start-up flow is subjected to two delay times, one due to the transient yield stress behaviour of the gelled oil and the other due to the compressibility effects. Oil compressibility has a positive effect on flow rate, movement of the fluid–oil interface and the time taken to clear the gelled oil from the pipe. The effects of other factors such as start-up pressure, initial compression time and liquid hold-up on flow after restart are also examined. The model produces a more realistic prediction of the <b>start-up</b> <b>situation</b> than a previous model developed for incompressible fluids. Malcolm R. Davidson, Q.

40|$|Most small new firms face {{problems}} in surviving the gestation process and achieving a viable performance thereafter {{because of the}} very fact of their smallness and newness. Due {{to a lack of}} internal resources, entrepreneurs of small new firms find it necessary to seek resources from outside the firm through their external social network. The theory of social capital that prescribes valuable resources are embedded in social relations is, thus, particularly relevant to the small business <b>start-up</b> <b>situation.</b> The embedded resources within an external network are hypothesized to {{have a positive impact on}} the business performance of these new firms. The main objective of the present study is to empirically investigate the impact of external networks, and in particular the initial social network of entrepreneurs, to the success of small firm start-up in Hong Kong. The second objective is to determine whether there is any interaction effect of the entrepreneur’s networking capability with the external network structure on the start-up success of small Hong Kong firms. To carry out the research, this study offers a conceptual model linking initial network start-up success to initial network structure of start-up, and including an interaction effect from the entrepreneur’s networking capability. The study operationalizes social capital in four types of network constructs: network size, trustworthiness, network support and network diversity. A series of hypotheses relating to these four dimensions asserting external network determinants of the start-up success of small firms is posited. Other hypotheses which assert the interaction effect between an entrepreneur’s networking capability and the initial network structure on the success of small firm start-up, are also posited. A field survey, administered to 1, 000 small Hong Kong firms of various industries, is used to gather the data. The questionnaire survey was developed in two languages – Chinese and English – to ensure a good level of understanding in the bilingual business environment of Hong Kong. Of the 1, 000 questionnaires dispatched, a final sample of 89 small firms was used to empirically test the hypotheses using multiple regression analysis and multiple hierarchical regression analysis. Control variables such as entrepreneurs’ experiences and education prior to the firm start-up are included. Empirical results indicate that the verification of social capital theory’s prescription for start-up success cannot be supported unequivocally. The results suggest that some initial network conditions such as initial size of strong tie network, network support and network diversity are positively associated with some measures of start-up success, but trustworthiness of network ties and the size of weak tie network do not figure among them. No evidence is found to support that entrepreneurs’ networking capability can positively enhance the effect of the initial network structure on start-up success. Overall, the study raises some questions on the positive linear relationship of certain operationalized constructs such as network size and trustworthiness of social capital with start-up success. Following the findings of this research, future studies may choose to further investigate social capital theory on small start-up success by refining the operationalization of social capital, and verify other interaction effects of entrepreneurs’ networking capabilities...|$|E
