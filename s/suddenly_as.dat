5|$|Hollamby died <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of heart disease at Red House on 29 December 1999; he was the third owner to die while in residence. His funeral was held on 21 January 2000 in Eltham, with a secular humanist service {{conducted}} by Barbara Smoker. The Friends of Red House took over the public openings at this point. Amid ill health, Doris left Red House and moved into a care home in 2002; she died in April 2003. With the aid of an anonymous benefactor, the house was purchased and gifted to The National Trust in 2003, who {{turned it into a}} visitor's attraction, with tours continuing to be organised by the Friends of Red House.|$|E
25|$|Priming {{is often}} {{considered}} {{to play a}} part in the success of sensory branding of products and connected to ideas like crossmodal correspondencies and sensation transference. Known effects are e.g. consumers perceiving lemonade <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> sweeter when the logo of the drink is more saturated towards yellow.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{report of}} a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded {{up and down the}} aisle, as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished as <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had appeared.|$|E

25|$|Cray {{set up a}} new company, SRC Computers, {{and started}} the design of his own massively {{parallel}} machine. The new design concentrated on communications and memory performance, the bottleneck that hampered many parallel designs. Design had just started when Cray died <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> a result of a car accident. SRC Computers carried on development and specialized in reconfigurable computing.|$|E
25|$|After that, Popov hears a human baby crying. Popov {{tries to}} locate {{the source of the}} sound but the crying stops as <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it started. Since infants are not allowed to leave Earth, Popov assumes he had an {{auditory}} hallucination. Popov carries on his work with the robots. Now, he hears a female voice pleading for help from somebody named Shura. Popov cannot locate the source of the voice either.|$|E
25|$|The party begins. A {{march is}} played. Presents are given {{out to the}} children. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>as</b> the owl-topped {{grandmother}} clock strikes eight, a mysterious figure enters the room. It is Drosselmeyer, a local councilman, magician, and Clara's godfather. He is also a talented toymaker who has brought with him gifts for the children, including four lifelike dolls who dance {{to the delight of}} all. He then has them put away for safekeeping.|$|E
60|$|Behind {{their backs}} {{was a small}} window, with a wheel {{ventilator}} {{in one of the}} panes, which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling sound, <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> stop, and <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> start again.|$|R

25|$|On 28 October 1956, President Sánchez Pizjuán died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>As</b> an {{appreciation}} to the deceased leader under whose chairmanship Sevilla had won three Copas del Rey, the fans {{decided that the}} club's planned new stadium was to be named in his honour. In the 1956–57 season, the team were Liga runners-up behind Real Madrid, ensuring qualification {{for the first time}} to the European Cup. Herrera left the club at the end of the season. The club needed a victory on the final day of the next season to avoid relegation, but reached the quarterfinals of the European Cup before being knocked out by holders and eventual champions Real Madrid.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, the French era ended <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> Trier {{was taken}} by Prussian troops. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Franco-German borders of 1792 were {{restored}} in the 1814 and 1815 Paris peace treaties. The city was proclaimed part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 and made part of the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine, with six administrative districts. Trier became seat of one these district administrations, the Regierungsbezirk Trier. Because of the new political situation and the new customs frontiers in the West, the economy of Trier began a steady decline that was to last until 1840. The Province of the Lower Rhine was merged into the Rhine Province in 1822.|$|E
25|$|As <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> they appeared, the {{tourists}} vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but {{the tourists}} reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, while Greenfield was Premier, Elizabeth died <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of routine surgery. [...] He {{remarried}} in 1926, to Marjorie Greenwood Cormack, who brought two {{children of her own}} into the marriage.|$|E
60|$|A light showed; it {{flared up}} <b>suddenly,</b> to be <b>as</b> <b>suddenly</b> extinguished, {{and it had}} its source {{in the window of}} Lady O'Moy's dressing-room, which Samoval was facing.|$|R

500|$|Amphistium is a 50-million-year-old fossil fish {{identified}} as an early relative of the flatfish, and as a transitional fossil In Amphistium, {{the transition from the}} typical symmetric head of a vertebrate is incomplete, with one eye placed near the top-center of the head. Paleontologists concluded that [...] "the change happened gradually, in a way consistent with evolution via natural selection—not <b>suddenly,</b> <b>as</b> researchers once {{had little choice but to}} believe." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} no factors {{inhibiting}} the development of Celia, the storm unexpectedly weakened again later on June23. The storm's eye rapidly dissipated and the central dense overcast became asymmetric. Forecaster Todd Kimberlain at the NHC referred to the unexplained shifts in strength as [...] "puzzling." [...] However, as <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> the weakening took place, strengthening ensued. Very strong convection formed over {{the center of the}} storm, with some cloud tops being as cold as , but no eye had reformed by the morning of June24. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized, with the eye fully reforming and the structure becoming more symmetrical. Rapid intensification soon followed as the storm reached Category4 status, becoming {{one of only a handful}} of tropical cyclones to do so during the month of June in the eastern Pacific. That evening, the storm further intensified into a Category5 hurricane, the second storm to reach this strength during June in the Eastern Pacific basin on record. Hurricane Celia attained its peak intensity around 0000UTC, with sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). The storm also displayed a well-defined eye estimated to be [...] in diameter.|$|E

500|$|With the June issue, {{the title}} was changed to Amazing Detective Tales. [...] Gernsback merged Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories into Wonder Stories at the same time; he was {{concerned}} that the word [...] "Science" [...] was putting off some potential readers, who assumed that the magazine was, in his words, [...] "a sort of scientific periodical". [...] It {{is likely that the}} same reasoning motivated Scientific Detective Monthlys new title. [...] In the following issue, Grey was replaced as editor by David Lasser, who was already editing Gernsback's other sf titles, and an attempt was made to include more stories with science fiction elements. [...] Gernsback continued the magazine for five issues under the new title; the last issue was dated October 1930. [...] The decision to cease publication was apparently taken <b>suddenly,</b> <b>as</b> the October issue included the announcement that the format would change in November from large to standard pulp size, and listed two stories planned for the November issue. [...] Gernsback sold the title to Wallace Bamber, who published at least five more issues, starting in February 1931; no issues are known for June or July 1931, or after August.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the poem came when Boberg was walking home from church near Kronobäck, Sweden, and listening to church bells.

[...] Astoria assisted in putting up a protective barrage over Lexington at the outset, and after the task forces separated, she shifted to the anti-aircraft umbrella over Yorktown. Her gunners claimed to have splashed at least four enemy planes in the attack that [...] "seemed to end as <b>suddenly</b> <b>as</b> it had started." ...|$|E
