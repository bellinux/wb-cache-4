When his performance in Israel didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well, however, he walked off the stage, went to his dressing room, and took some LSD. He then heard the audience clamoring for his reappearance by singing to him in Hebrew, and {{under the influence of}} the psychedelic, he returned to finish the show. Additionally, in 1973 he played a special performance for a group of IDF soldiers in the outposts of Sinai during the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
500|$|The {{space between}} the rails was , and the {{carriages}} overhung the outside rails by [...] Pressed {{against the side of}} the carriage, the remaining gap was just enough for Huskisson and Holmes to escape without injury, but Huskisson misjudged the distance. According to Edward Littleton, the Duke of Wellington said to Huskisson [...] "We <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on—you had better step in!". Huskisson tried to clamber into the carriage, but those inside failed to reach him to pull him in. Holmes, still pressed against the carriage, shouted [...] "For God's sake, Mr Huskisson, be firm", but Huskisson grabbed the door of the carriage. With Holmes still pressed {{against the side of the}} carriage, the door, with Huskisson hanging on to it, swung out directly into the path of Rocket. Rocket collided with the door and Huskisson fell onto the track in front of the locomotive.|$|E
500|$|The {{forecast}} {{track for}} Debby was shifted {{significantly to the}} east late on June24, and {{it was predicted that}} the storm would move northward and make landfall near Panama City, Florida. Based on a dropsonde estimate, Debby attained its minimum barometric pressure of [...] at 0000UTC on June25. However, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear, drier air, and upwelling of cold water, caused by Debby's slow movement. It was initially composed of multiple small swirls, but consolidated into one well-defined low-level circulation by early on June25. Due to its excessively slow movement and no prediction for acceleration, the National Hurricane Center remarked that, [...] "the cyclone does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> anywhere anytime soon." [...] A burst in deep convection occurred later on June25, though adverse environmental conditions prevented re-intensification. Debby began curving east-northeastward and began to speed up on June26, in response to a mid-latitude trough digging into the western Atlantic Ocean. While approaching the Florida Big Bend, Debby produced only a small area of deep convection on satellite imagery.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world {{beyond the realm of}} the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E
500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that things <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well for me at the moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E
500|$|Qs Mat Snow called Achtung Baby U2's [...] "heaviest {{album to}} date. And best." [...] Snow praised {{the band and}} its {{production}} team for making [...] "music of drama, depth, intensity and, believe it, funkiness". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt the record [...] "shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations". He praised Lanois' production and said that due to the Edge's guitar playing, [...] "U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, Boy". Kot concluded his review by calling the album [...] "a magnificent search for transcendence {{made all the more}} moving for its flaws". Niall Stokes of Hot Press wrote, [...] "Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times." [...] The New Zealand Herald found it [...] "pretty damn good" [...] and its sound [...] "subdued, tightly controlled, [...] introverted". However, it said that too many [...] "downbeat moments where songs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> nowhere" [...] prevented it from being a [...] "truly wondrous affair". In Spin, Jim Greer was more critical of the album, calling it an [...] "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group [...] "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, and in 1994, he reflected on this sentiment: [...] "After many, many tries, Achtung Baby still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's musical transformation as [...] "thorough", [...] "effective", and [...] "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have [...] "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} of the British August offensive was to seize Chunuk Bair, a high point in the Sari Bair mountain range. The New Zealand and Australian Division would provide the attacking force. The initial attack was to clear the Turks from the foothills; this task {{was given to the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, reinforced by the Maori Pioneer Battalion. The regiment, together with the Otago Mounted Rifles, was to clear Chailak Dere valley, then advance to Aghyl Dere in the north. They also had to capture Taylor's Hollow and Walden's Point, then turn east to capture Beauchop Hill. To reduce noise and maintain stealth, they were ordered to use only their bayonets. At 20:00 on 5 August, the 296 men of the regiment moved forward to No.2 Post in preparation for the attack, which was due to start at 21:00 the next night. Their assault started on time, with the 1st and 10th Squadrons forward, followed by the 8th Squadron and Machine-Gun Section in reserve. The leading men met and killed four Turks in an observation post. Then with still around [...] to go, a destroyer's searchlight beam lit up the advancing men, and a Turkish machine-gun opened fire on them. The 10th Squadron charged straight into the Turkish trench, while the 1st Squadron managed to manoeuvre around and attack the machine-gun from the rear. They achieved this without firing a shot or making a sound, and then advanced towards their last objective, Beauchop Hill. The hill was also captured, and the survivors started to dig in. Although it had taken all its objectives, the regiment had around forty per cent casualties, including the commanding officer, who was wounded, and the second in command, Major Overton, who had been killed. While digging in they were able to observe the rest of the battle, which did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> well. By the next day, 7 August, Turkish reinforcements were arriving at Chunuk Bair and the attack had failed. Since the start of the battle they had lost twenty-four men dead and sixty men wounded. Now commanded by Major Hutton, from the 10th Squadron, the regiment remained on Bauchop Hill in defence until 15 August, when they moved back to the entrance of Aghyl Dere, then later moved forward [...] and occupied an old Turkish trench.|$|E
