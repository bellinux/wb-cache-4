The State of the Tropics 2014 Report launched by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi demonstrates that while tropical nations have made significant progress across a broad range of development indictors they face a suite of challenges that demand focused attention (State of the Tropics 2014). A regional perspective, driven from within, that recognises the diversity and dynamism of the tropics, but acknowledges and embraces the shared challenges and opportunities the region faces, is essential for promoting long-term sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development</b> relevant to tropical regions. In this brief, we highlight some of the more pressing shared issues facing the nations of the tropics...|$|E

Though often the initial catalyst of revitalization in a community, artists are frequently forced out of neighborhoods as economic activity increases and property values rise. This project aims to develop a proposal for the Mass Ave Arts District and the Circle City Industrial Complex in Indianapolis, Indiana, utilizing culture and the arts as economically sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development</b> tools.

40|$|The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), {{taking the}} lives of {{thousands}} in poor farming communities in Sri Lanka, is commonly seen as a problem peculiar to the island’s north central dry zone agricultural region. The prevailing bio-medical focus is on identifying one or more “environmental nephrotoxins. ” While delineating important controversies on the etiology of the disease, this article seeks to broaden the discourse on the hitherto neglected political economy of CKD in Sri Lanka. In so doing, it seeks to bring together the bio-medical debate on the impact of widespread and unregulated use of agrochemicals on public health and kidney disease with broader global interdisciplinary perspectives on the industrialization of agriculture and the consolidation of food production by transnational agribusiness corporations.

As a favourable policy for development {{by a number of}} major donors and finance institutions, the integration of cadastral surveying and land registration services is recognised as both strategic and essential for improving the livelihoods of societies living in developing countries. Land management and land administration reform is a common approach in the mobilisation of a fundamental resource – land – so that it can provide a foundation for sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> economic <b>development.</b> No country’s context and issues are replicated elsewhere and so neither are reform designs and approaches. However, in the complex environment of land administration systems, while solutions may not be the same, a common framework can be applied for assessing the situation and identifying areas of improvement using guiding principles. Using this framework for comparison helps to identify areas of effective and efficient land administration systems and vice versa. Key lessons learnt and trends that appear in these comparisons are useful for shaping reform strategies. Using a set of recently developed comparative indicators and guiding principles this paper analyses regional experiences i...|$|R

Past investigations on multifunctional agriculture have mostly focused on the economy of multiple functions. There is scarce knowledge on structural relationships of multifunctional agriculture, notably in rural areas. To fill this gap, we used an analytical actor network to identify the structural relationships. Results show that the average income of farmers increased by 20  % in multifunctional agriculture networks. Results also show that the actor network reached a state of equilibrium. We also build a structural equation model using interviews and participatory observations. Here, we incorporated data from 366 tourists, constituting 87. 5  % of those surveyed, and 52 local residents in Dalishu Village of Liaoning Province, China. Networking methods improved the efficiency of multifunctional agriculture by bridging ecology, tourism, society, and land use...|$|E

40|$|A {{common factor}} that {{explains}} why agriculture causes too much environmental degradation, grows too slowly, and has been ineffective in reducing rural poverty is the generalized tendency by governments to under invest in public goods despite the high rates of return to such investments. A large share of rural public expenditures is deviated to private goods (mostly subsidies to the wealthy), which generally have low or even negative rates of return. Behind such an obviously aberrant choice are political economy forces; a highly unequal political lobby market leads to government policies that are biased in favor of economic elites and detrimental for both the environment and rural development. Globalization may affect this important distortion on the allocation of government expenditures in various ways. One such way is by restricting the ability of governments to repress the political mobilization of the poor to counter the almost unchallenged power of the elites in the lobby market. This may contribute toward creating conditions that are more consistent with sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development.</b> Copyright 2005 International Association of Agricultural Economics. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Energy spurs {{social and}} {{economic}} development and has multiple effects on the ecological and social environment of societies. Energy access for <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development,</b> energy security for sustainable economic growth, and the mitigation of climate change all represent issues of long-term developments, whose effects are not fully reflected in considerations of actors maximizing short-term profits in energy markets. Consequently, this paper will distinguish six forms of market failures in energy markets impeding the sustainability of social, environmental and economic development. International governance mechanisms are supposed to overcome those long-term problems. At the same time governance mechanisms must allow to consider short-term interests of various actors in order to incentivize and enable these actors to comply. Strategies for long-term policies, therefore, have to build in flexibility in governance mechanisms and include actors {{from the private sector}} and civil society as well. The Johannesburg World Summit 2002 produced a number of partnerships between state and non-state actors committed to sustainable development. Based on research on five sustainable energy-related global policy networks and conducted expert interviews, this paper will analyze the effectiveness of policy networks and aim to identify political, organizational, and economic instruments of effective global environmental governance. Hence, the paper will draft a strategy ho...|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} of Evo Morales {{is emblematic of}} the new left governments in Latin America that emerged {{at the beginning of}} the 21 st century. Growing out of a crisis of the neoliberal project in Latin America as a whole and Bolivia in particular, Morales’ government has overseen a period of economic and political stability in a country not known for either. Globally, Morales has become associated with the ‘rights of nature’ discourse and radical environmentalism, being named the ‘World Hero of Mother Earth’ by the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the same time, however, the model of development pursued by his government has continued to rely on the extractive industries to produce economic growth. This has produced fractures within the social movements on whose behalf Morales claims to govern. My argument in this dissertation is that it is only possible to understand the contradictions of environmental policy in the Morales era by reflecting on the particular features of Bolivian society. During his tenure, the ‘defence of Mother Earth’ has been vitiated by a commitment to territorial sovereignty and national development, which the government has justified by reference to what I call the ‘right to develop’. It is only by understanding the interaction of these two competing ‘rights’, I will claim, that we can analyse the nature of Morales’ project thus far and assess its prospects for long term political and environmental sustainability. I also argue that critical assessment of the Bolivian experience under Morales can illuminate wider challenges facing political movements committed to elaborating an environmentally sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development</b> model in the 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the controversy over airport-generated noise at Brussels airport as an environmental issue on the national political agenda coincided with the inauguration of Belgium’s first ‘purple-green’ government in 1999. The new government announced explicitly the dawning of a new political age in which old controversies and adversarial left-right politics were relegated to the dustbin of history. From now onwards, the interests of market actors, environmental concerns and social objectives would be negotiated and reconciled {{in the interest of}} all within the framework of a common and consensually agreed objective of achieving environmentally sustainable, <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> and market-based <b>development.</b> The controversy over DHL’s night flights at Brussels Airport would prove {{to be one of the}} first real test cases of this ‘Third Way’ post-political approach to policing socio-environmental affairs. However, after several years of acrimonious argument, successive attempts to negotiate a compromise with all relevant partners, and increasingly more entrenched antagonistic dispute, DHL abandoned Brussels Airport as its main European hub. This sequence belied the initial optimism with the government’s post-political approach and, we argue in this paper, stands emblematically for the failure of such post-political mode of policing socioenvironmental affairs. The objective of this paper is to explore, both theoretically and empirically, the contradictions and tensions associated with the post-political model. First, we shall situate theoretically the emergence and consolidation of post-political modes of governing and the colonisation of the space of the political by forms of consensual depoliticised governance. Second, we shall analyse how urban socio-environmental governance procedures associated with the problem of noise at Brussels airport express the attempts to institute post-democratic modes of governance while exploring the contradictions of this model. In a final part, the failure of post-democratic and postpolitical arrangements will be discussed, arguing for an urgent need to re-politicise urban socio-ecological relations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Human ecology {{studies the}} ecology of our species: some would say the inter-relationships between population, resources, {{environment}} and development. The Centre for Human Ecology at the University of Edinburgh was established in 1972 by the then Principal of the University and an influential group of futuristic thinkers. Some of these, most notably the Centre's first director, Professor C H Waddington, {{had been involved in}} commissioning the Club of Rome's seminal 'Limits to Growth ' report. This drew attention to the planetary dangers of escalating growth in consumption and population. It laid the foundations for today's debate about sustainable and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development,</b> which is the primary focus of our research and teaching. Seen as a lighthouse of transformation by some and a den of subversion by others, the Centre has struggled on negligible resources over the past twenty-one years to raise awareness of socio-environmental problems and point to possible ways forward. It is consulted by environmentalists, industrialists, religious leaders, community workers, civil servants and politicians of all hues. The 1990 s have seen a fresh affirmation of the Centre's role within the University. A recent report paraphrases the Senior Vice-Principal as saying: 'The Centre for Human Ecology today finds itself at the hub, its "alternative" views no longer peripheral, but at the core of common concern for the environment and the University's integrated approach which leads the way for others in higher education.

40|$|Aid {{is one of}} the is one of {{the primary}} {{determinants}} for the use of natural resources in the South Pacific islands region. In many cases, aid has negative environmental and social impacts in this ecologically fragile region. This study is concerned with assessing the effectiveness of the New Zealand Overseas Development Assistance (NZ ODA) programme in terms of promoting sustainable development in the region. To do so NZ ODA policies and practice are viewed in the context of development theory. The concept of sustainable development is explained to provide criteria by which to judge the effectiveness of NZ ODA. Development is judged to be sustainable if it does not result in environmental degradation and if it serves to promote greater social equity. Analyses of the motivations underlying the distribution of NZ ODA and of the institutional structure through which New Zealand aid is administered, as well as a case study of NZ ODA forestry projects show that, in many cases, NZ ODA does not contribute to sustainable development. Instead, NZ ODA is primarily geared towards the achievement of short term economic and political goals. NZ ODA is first and foremost a foreign policy tool used to increase New Zealand's influence and prestige internationally and to promote New Zealand's economic interest. Foreign policy and economic goals conflict with the achievement of ecologically sound and <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development.</b> Despite "basic needs" and "sustainable development" rhetoric NZ ODA practice is primarily informed by modernization theory with its emphasis on the achievement of economic growth as the main developmental goal. The study concludes with a discussion of changes necessary to make the NZ ODA programme more conducive to the requirements for sustainable development in recipient countries. Changes include modifications to the existing aid 'tool kit', such as improvements to the existing social and environmental impact procedures. More fundamentally, changes to staff attitudes and composition as well as a possible reorganization of the institutional structure through which aid is administered are required...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{biofuels}} are {{fossil fuel}} replacements {{in the form}} of fuel ethanol and biodiesel. Advocates of biofuels highlight their potential to mitigate climate change from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and socio-economic benefits for countries that achieve a higher degree of self-reliant energy supply. Critics emphasise social drawbacks from biofuel production and suggest that crop-based biofuels could jeopardise food security. The cultivation of biofuel feedstock has furthermore been reported to promote agricultural expansion and thus pose threats to biodiversity. Intense agricultural practices, coupled with land transformation, have also led to question {{as to whether or not}} biofuels reduce the carbon footprint of transportation fuels. The South African government established a biofuels strategy in 2007. Besides having declared self-imposed renewable fuel targets, the policy paper encourages the participation of black people in this emerging industry. The proposed fuel ethanol plant in Cradock, Eastern Cape, is likely to be the first operational bioethanol project in the country. As one of the first biofuels-related Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) programmes, 25 Cradock farms have already been purchased and allocated to black emerging farmers. The intention of this initiative is to enable part of the ethanol plant feedstock to be produced by these emerging farmers. The present dissertation aims to determine the magnitude and relevance of concerns highlighted in the global biofuels debate for fuel ethanol production at the proposed Cradock plant. This incorporates environmental impacts from agriculture, greenhouse gas emissions during the biofuel production chain, food security impacts, and the performance of <b>socially</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>development.</b> A total of 44 face-to-face interviews were held, comprising 22 commercial farmers, 12 emerging farmers, and representatives from the governmental, commercial and research sectors. The interviewees were questioned on the various socioeconomic, environmental and agricultural aspects of the Cradock fuel ethanol project.
