5|$|Bird {{designed}} the distinctive dust jacket– {{a collage of}} newspaper articles in four languages– to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news. The frontispiece is a woodcut portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining {{more than half the}} print run <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell. The rest were sent to reviewers and friends.|$|E
5|$|Carson bequeathed her {{manuscripts and}} papers to Yale University, to take {{advantage}} of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> 22 families {{remained in the}} city. After an epidemic of plague in 1498–1500, the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled the island at that time, expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be baptized. In the next two decades, the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} a long-held {{assumption}} {{that the majority of}} stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{competition}} was open to {{children between the ages}} of 8 and 15, however in 2007 the age range was narrowed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> children aged 10 to 15 on the day of the contest were allowed to enter. In 2016 the age range was changed again. From now on children aged 9 to 14 on the day of the contest are allowed to enter.|$|E
5|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{operates}} with seven stadium-style seating X-Car trains. Each train has two cars that can hold six riders each {{for a total}} of twelve riders per train. On the head rest of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been designed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> the rider's selected music track will be audible. On the restraint is a small touch screen where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured lights that can be seen during the night.|$|E

With the support of Lieutenant Malcolm Reed, a small squad of MACOs, led by Major Hayes, {{transports}} on board to extract Sato. With the space battle ongoing, the transporter system is damaged <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> two personnel can beam out at one time. Hayes sends one of his men and Sato out first, {{and then the rest}} of the team. Hayes, now alone, is forced to retreat and just as he is beaming out, a Reptilian soldier fires through his chest. Back on board Enterprise, he collapses on the transporter platform, and soon dies of heart-failure in Sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5000|$|A bureaucrat is {{a member}} of a {{bureaucracy}} and can compose the administration of any organization of any size, although the term usually connotes someone within an institution of government. Some usages restrict the term <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it <b>only</b> embraces lower-ranked staff members in an agency, excluding higher-ranked managers, or <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it <b>only</b> signifies officials who perform certain functions, such as those who work [...] "desk jobs" [...] (the French word for [...] "desk" [...] being bureau, though bureau can also be translated as [...] "office").|$|R

5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Mercenaries may aid {{the player}} in their campaigns in the New World. Mercenaries are not trained like {{standard}} units; instead {{they can be}} shipped from the Home City or hired from saloons for much coin, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively. Incidentally, along with hero/explorer units, Mercenaries were vulnerable to assassin units such as spies, agents and ninjas. In most cases, a selection of Native American tribes populate game maps, and support their own brand of military units that can be trained once an alliance has been formed. Some Native American military units use mêlée weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows or atl-atls, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E

5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>only</b> enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E
