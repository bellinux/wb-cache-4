5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming speed. In contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> dry land.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{forecast}} that Odile would track westward {{and avoid}} land {{as it would}} curve out to sea. Accordingly, the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts. Precautionary measures on the Baja California Peninsula began in earnest after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula. Several municipalities {{declared a state of}} emergency, opening 164shelters with a total capacity of 30,000people. Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile, approximately 26,000foreign tourists were <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> the peninsula at the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E

5|$|While La Salle was gone, six {{of those}} who had {{remained}} on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors {{did not know how to}} sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} {{mechanical}} problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.|$|E

5|$|Another fleet {{operation}} {{took place}} on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage the III Squadron was diverted {{to assist in the}} recovery of a pair of U-boats <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including König Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron. König Albert saw no major operations {{in the first half of}} 1917, and on 18 August she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 23 September.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Henstridge portrays Simmons, and {{is joined}} by guest star Dillon Casey as another {{survivor}} <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> the planet. Series regulars Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, and Iain De Caestecker also briefly appear. The episode was {{a departure from the}} norm for the series, focusing on a single character rather than the usual ensemble, and taking place on an alien planet. The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used to make it appear to be night on the planet, as its sun rarely rises. The episode took inspiration from multiple science fiction films, and bears similarity to The Martian, which was released close to the episode's airing.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> {{the wrong side of the}} Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In June 1982, the Steven Spielberg–directed {{science fiction}} film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was {{released}} to cinemas. Created by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures (then {{a subsidiary of}} MCA Inc.), it starred Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore and Peter Coyote. The film {{tells the story of}} Elliott, a boy who befriends a good-natured extraterrestrial called E.T., who is <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Upon its release, the film became a blockbuster and surpassed Star Wars to become the highest-grossing film released to that point. Critics lauded it as a timeless story of friendship, and the American Film Institute ranks it as the third greatest science fiction film ever produced in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the mound, and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was <b>stranded</b> <b>on</b> first after hitting a single.|$|E
