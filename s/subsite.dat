40|$|A {{fluorescence}} {{technique for}} comparative studies of substrate-binding <b>subsites</b> in serine proteinases is described. It consists of: selective labelling of the corresponding <b>subsites</b> with a fluorescent group by using N alpha-dansyl(5 -dimethylaminonaphthalene- 1 -sulphonyl) ated peptide chloromethanes containing different numbers of amino acid residues, and probing the immediate {{environment of the}} <b>subsites</b> by quenching experiments using ionic and neutral quenchers. Intramolecular distances between the <b>subsites</b> and particular chromophores can be also determined. The technique is of general applicability to all serine proteinases. The above mentioned approach was applied to two proteinases: subtilisin Novo and mesentericopeptidase. It was concluded that the substrate-binding site of mesentericopeptidase is considerably more polar than that of subtilisin Novo. Intramolecular distances between the labelled <b>subsites</b> and tryptophan residues in the two proteinases were determined...|$|R
40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the fourth most common cancer, in terms of {{incidence}} throughout the world. There are some differences for risk factors involved {{in the incidence of}} tumor in different anatomical <b>subsites</b> of large bowel. However, most investigations have not studied the association between dietary factors and colorectal cancer <b>subsites.</b> Thus the current ecological study investigates the potential association between dietary factors and occurrence of cancer in different <b>subsites</b> of large bowel. Materials and methods: Data on colorectal cancer incidence and dietary factors was obtained by the <b>subsites</b> of colorectal cancer for the 32 countries were estimated between the years 1988 and 1992. The association between alcohol, dietary factors and cancer in different <b>subsites</b> of large bowel was then analyzed by using linear regression. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between red meat consumption and proximal colon cancer incidence (p= 0. 02). In contrast, there was a significant association between alcohol consumption and distal colon cancer in men (p= 0. 03) and rectal cancer in both men and women (p= 0. 01 and p= 0. 04 respectively). Conclusion: Investigation on the incidence of cancer in anatomical <b>subsites</b> of large bowel separately might help us to identify etiological factors and preventive ways of this cancer...|$|R

25|$|Zaleplon has a {{pharmacological}} profile {{similar to}} benzodiazepines, {{characterized by an}} increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine α1 receptor located on the GABAA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α2 and α3 subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar chemical structure nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects via α2 and α3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α5 <b>subsite),</b> as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{oligomerization}} of PA63, {{molecules of}} EF and/or LF rapidly and simultaneously bind to the PA prechannel. This binding occurs because after removing the PA20 domain, a large hydrophobic surface is uncovered on domain 1 of PA63. Domain 1 provides a large surface that the {{interacts with the}} N-terminus of EF and LF, which is almost completely homologous for the first ~36 residues and similar in tertiary structure for the first ~250 residues. Studies on the binding region of LF and EF demonstrated that a large surface area contacts with domain 1 of two adjacent PA63 molecules when in the heptamer conformation. This large binding area explains why previous studies could only bind up to three molecules on a PA63 heptamer. The co-crystal structure of the PA octamer in complex with N-terminal LF revealed that the binding interaction is, in fact, two discontinuous sites. One site, termed the C-terminal <b>subsite,</b> resembles a classic [...] "hot-spot" [...] with predicted salt-bridges and electrostatic interactions. The other site, termed the alpha-clamp <b>subsite,</b> is a deep cleft that nonspecifically binds the N-terminal alpha helix and short beta strand of LF, guiding the N-terminus of the substrate towards the PA prechannel lumen. In this manner, the alpha clamp aids in protein translocation, nonspecifically binding and subsequently unfolding secondary structure as it unfurls from the substrate. The LF/EF binding site is now being utilized for delivery of therapeutics via fusion proteins.|$|E

The overall structure {{was similar to that}} of other known cysteine proteases and apparently identical to the mature region of procathepsin L. The electron density for E- 64 is clearly visible except for the guanidinobutane moiety. From comparison of the active sites of cathepsin L and B, we found the following: (1) The S′ <b>subsites</b> of cathepsin L and B are totally different because of the `occluding loop' lying {{on the end of the}} S′ <b>subsites</b> of cathepsin B. (2) The S 2 pocket of cathepsin L is shallow and narrow compared to that of cathepsin B. (3) The S 3 <b>subsites</b> of the two enzymes are more similar than the other <b>subsites,</b> but cathepsin L may accommodate a more bulky group at this site.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In January 1991, Medicare {{extended}} its mammography benefit to reimburse {{for breast cancer}} screening mammograms. In 1991 and again in 1993, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC) conducted a survey {{to test the hypothesis}} that this benefit would increase mammography use among women over the age of 65. METHODS: The authors analyzed data on non-Hispanic white women ages 65 to 74 living in 11 geographic areas targeted by the BCSC for an earlier study [...] six that had received cancer screening educational interventions and five control <b>subsites</b> [...] to measure the impact of the newly adopted Medicare benefit on the use of mammography and use of Medicare to reimburse mammography costs. RESULTS: The data show little overall increase between 1991 and 1993 in reported mammography use among respondents to the survey. However, in six intervention and five control <b>subsites</b> there was an increase in the percentage of women who reported using public payment sources to at least partially reimburse the cost of mammograms. In three intervention <b>subsites,</b> the increase from 1991 to 1993 in the percentage of women using public sources of payment was greater than in the corresponding control <b>subsites.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that public health interventions are more likely to succeed when educational promotion accompanies a financial benefit...|$|R
