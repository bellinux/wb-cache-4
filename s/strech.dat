6000|$|Suppose {{that the}} man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid, and that he {{attaches}} a body to the free end of the rope. The result of this will be to <b>strech</b> the rope so that it will hang [...] " [...] vertically [...] " [...] downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope, {{the man in the}} chest will say: [...] "The suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the suspended body." [...] On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus : [...] " [...] The rope must perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the inertial mass of the body." [...] Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of both {{plasticizer}} and <b>streching</b> strain on the percolation transition in polyisoprene-carbon nanocomposites (PCNC) is reported. The orthopositronium (oPs) accessible free volume sites in the unstreched and <b>streched</b> PCNC without plasticizer as well as with plasticizer have been measured by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The lifetime of oPs,  3, is related {{to the size of the}} free volume, and the intensity, I 3, to the number concentration of free volume sites. It was found that <b>streching</b> decreases the number of free volume cavities independent of the both mass parts carbon nano-particles (CNP) and plasticizer. The free volume cavity size has maximum value in the region of percolation transition. Percolation threshold was determined by electric resistance measurements (ERM). Both PALS and ERM show that the percolation threshold shifts to greater values of mass parts of CNP under <b>streching</b> strain. An opposite shift of percolation threshold was found under adding plasticizer. It is interesting that adding of CNP increases mean free volume cavity size at mass parts percolation threshold. It means that filling of cavities occurs above the percolation threshold. The fatigue of tenso-resistive effect for PCNC samples, containing 10 m. p. of CNP with plasticizer added and without plasticizer has been examined...|$|R

40|$|As L. Light {{company made}} biliverdin {{was hard to}} dissolove in the usual solvents, spectrochemical studies were made in which {{characteristic}} infrared absorption spectra were noted. L. Light company made biliverdin was dissolved in 5 % potassium hydroxide alcohol and was acidified at about pH 4. 6 with N/ 10 hydrochloric acid after 5 "s waterbath, and thus an ether extractable substance was obtained. This green colored ether extractable substance proved qualitative reaction for biliverdin and exhibited the absorption maximum at 700 and 375 mμ. in the glacial acetic acid. In the infrared absorption spectra of the ether extractable biliverdin, the following features were observed with that of L. Light company made biliverdin. 1) The OH, NH <b>streching</b> vibration (VOH, NH) was observed at 2. 90 and 3. 11 μ. 2) The C=O <b>streching</b> vibration of the carbonyl group ((v) C=O) was observed at 5. 83. μ. 3) The C=C <b>streching</b> vibration of the vinyl group ((v) C=C) was observed at about 6. 4 μ. 4) Absorption band due to conjugated double bond aromatic ring vibration was observed at about 6. 20 μ.
