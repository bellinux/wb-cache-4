This project was started by India during the early 1980s to develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. [...] Its design was based on <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> Vehicle. ISRO did not have sufficient funds for both the Polar <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> Vehicle programme and the ASLV programme {{at the same time}} and the ASLV programme was terminated after the initial developmental flights.

40|$|Low {{earth orbit}} {{satellite}} (LEOS) systems promise to provide global communication. A LEOS system {{consists of a}} large number of satellites in low orbits. A satellite has a limited life of approximately five to eight years. Therefore, frequent satellite replenishments are required, and the LEOS systems will be facing annual replenishment costs in the range of several hundred million dollars. This paper considers static <b>satellite</b> <b>launch</b> policies for LEOS systems. The <b>satellite</b> <b>launch</b> problem is formulated and a solution method based on dynamic programming is proposed. Lexicographic ordering is used to reduce the search space of the dynamic program to a moderate size. An algorithm for calculating optimal static policies is used to demonstrate the potentially significant economic impact of <b>satellite</b> <b>launch</b> policies on system maintenance costs.
