40|$|The {{employment}} relationship is governed largely by contract, {{but with a}} heavy overlay of “rights”: minimum terms and individual rights that are established by external law and typically non-waivable. But some terms of employment are governed neither by ordinary contract nor by ordinary rights, nor even by ordinary waivable rights. Consider the two most controversial instruments in employment law today: non-compete covenants (NCCs) and mandatory arbitration agreements (MAAs). Both {{take the form of}} written contracts that waive important employee rights (the right to compete post-employment, the right to litigate future claims); both are subject to <b>substantive</b> criteria of <b>validity</b> that are set by external law. Both bodies of law may be usefully described as recognizing “conditionally waivable” rights. This paper aims first to show structural parallels between NCCs and MAAs that place them at a distinct intermediate point along the spectrum between non-waivable rights and ordinary contract that I call “conditional waivability. ” Second, it seeks to uncover a common logic underlying the law’s choice of this particular hybrid of rights and contract. The linchpin of that common logic lies in the the threat that unregulated waiver of one right (the right to compete or to litigate future claims) poses to an adjacent employee right that the law deems non-waivable. Third, the paper deploys that underlying logic to offer a critical assessment of the law governing NCCs and MAAs. Finally, the paper tentatively explores the broader potential usefulness of conditional waivability as a way of regulating some terms of employment. The intriguing potential of conditional waivability lies in its injection of some of the virtues of contract – especially flexibility and variability in the face of widely divergent and changing circumstances – into the pursuit of public goals and the realization of rights in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|The {{legislative}} {{supremacy of}} Parliament, a dominant {{characteristic of the}} Westminster system of government, has {{for a long time}} been the basic norm of South African constitutional law. In line with the Westminster prototype, the South African judiciary did not have the power to review the <b>substantive</b> <b>validity</b> of legislation. The creation of a new order, based on a supreme Constitution which entrenches fundamental rights and gives the courts the power to review not on! y the procedural validity but also the <b>substantive</b> <b>validity</b> of legislation, has brought about a significant change. This thesis examines the role of the South African judiciary during the transition from a system of legislative supremacy to one of constitutional supremacy and judicial review. The thesis is based on the interim Constitution of 1993. The entrenchment of fundamental human rights in the Constitution implies a greater role for the judiciary. The judiciary has to apply and interpret the human rights provisions vigorously and fearlessly. The human rights provisions have to be applied and interpreted with a keen awareness that a system of constitutional supremacy differs materially from one of legislative supremacy. In a system of legislative supremacy the intention of the legislature is paramount; in a system of constitutional supremacy the Constitution is supreme and overrides all laws, including Acts of Parliament, which are in conflict with it The doctrine of legislative supremacy has in the past led to a literalist and mechanical application of law; this has had a negative impact on the constitutional role of the South African judiciary. The provisions of a Constitution, especially its human rights provisions, are framed in wide and open ended terms; these need to be elaborated before they can be applied; the nature of these provisions, their purpose and the larger objects of the Constitution are important. The interpretation of the provisions of a supreme Constitution is incompatible with a literalistic and mechanical approach. A purposive and liberal or generous approach is called for. A framework and approach to the interpretation and application of South Africa's Bill of Rights are suggested in the thesis. Constitutional International and Indigenous LawLL. D...|$|E

To validate the use of scores of the Lebanese National Examinations (LNE) in Chemistry for student certification, this study investigated content and <b>substantive</b> evidence of <b>validity</b> of the LNE in Chemistry for Grade 12 Life Sciences section over three years. To collect the two types of validity evidence needed, the degree of alignment in content and cognitive demands between the first sessions of the 2004, 2005 and 2006 of the Chemistry National Exams (CNE) and the Grade 12 Chemistry Curriculum (G 12 CC) were evaluated. The scores of the LNE are also used interchangeably; so that failing students can retake the exams. To evaluate the appropriateness of using the scores of the CNE interchangeably, evidence of comparability was collected by investigating the consistency of CNE in content and cognitive demands over a three-year period, from 2004 to 2006. The Webb alignment model was employed in the study. Nine experts in Chemistry reviewed the G 12 CC and the three CNE to judge their alignment. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered in this document-based research study where expert review and survey questionnaires were used to collect data. The results of the study have shown that the Webb alignment model is not appropriate for Lebanon and some European countries (e. g. France and England), the CNE do not measure the content of the G 12 CC adequately enough, the G 12 CC does not specify the cognitive processes or thinking skills that the CNE should measure, and the CNE are not consistent in their cognitive demands from year to year.

What aspects of examinee performance improve on the assessment exercises? rguments favoring the use A of performance assessments make two related but distinct claims. Performance assessments are ex-pected, first, to provide better mea-surement and, second, to improve teaching and learning. Although any measuring device is corruptible, per-formance measures have the poten-tial for increased validity because the performance tasks are themselves demonstrations of important learn-ing goals rather than indirect in-dicators of achievement (Resnick & Resnick, 1992). According to Fred-eriksen and Collins (19891, Wiggins (19891, and others, performance as-sessments should enhance the valid-ity of measurement by representing {{the full range of}} desired learning out-comes, by preserving the complexity of disciplinary knowledge domains and skills, by representing the con-texts in which knowledge must ulti-mately be applied, and by adapting the modes of assessment to enable students to show what they know.

40|$|Content validity, {{the extent}} to which a {{measurement}} reflects the specific intended domain of content, is a basic type of validity for a valid measurement. It was usually examined qualitatively and relied on experts’ subjective judgments, not on respondents’ responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to introduce and demonstrate how to use quantitative methods to examine the content validity for a certain measurement from respondents’ viewpoint with quantitative methods. In the current study, content validity of the WHOQOL-BREF was examined with quantitative methods among 102 undergraduate students and 128 community adults. They were asked to rate the appropriateness of each item with the four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF respectively and also asked to sort the items into the four domains.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the merit of}} the Clinical Audit Project (CAP) in an assessment program for undergraduate medical education using a systematic assessment validation framework. Methods: A cross-sectional assessment validation study at one medical school in Western Australia, with retrospective qualitative analysis of the design, development, implementation and outcomes of the CAP, and quantitative analysis of assessment data from four cohorts of medical students (2011 - 2014). Results: The CAP is fit for purpose with clear external and internal alignment to expected medical graduate outcomes. <b>Substantive</b> <b>validity</b> in students’ and examiners’ response processes is ensured through relevant methodological and cognitive processes. Multiple validity features are built-in to the design, planning and implementation process of the CAP. There is evidence of high internal consistency reliability of CAP scores (Cronbach’s alpha 3 ̆e 0. 8) and inter-examiner consistency reliability (intra-class correlation 3 ̆e 0. 7). Aggregation of CAP scores is psychometrically sound, with high internal consistency indicating one common underlying construct. Significant but moderate correlations between CAP scores and scores from other assessment modalities indicate validity of extrapolation and alignment between the CAP and the overall target outcomes of medical graduates. Standard setting, score equating and fair decision rules justify consequential validity of CAP scores interpretation and use. Conclusions: This study provides evidence demonstrating that the CAP is a meaningful and valid component in the assessment program. This systematic framework of validation can be adopted for all levels of assessment in medical education, from individual assessment modality, to the validation of an assessment program as a whole...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a framework for the area comprising strategic performance objectives of operations. Design/methodology/approach – The framework derived from a theoretical and empirical basis. The empirical method involved a Delphi study with 11 experts with recognised knowledge in the area of international logistics and supply chain. The framework was validated through a <b>substantive</b> <b>validity</b> test conducted in a pilot study with 20 managers from organisations operating in a major international seaport overseas. Findings – The study developed a framework structured by critical operations performance factors operationalised in terms of trade {{and transport}} facilitation aspects. Research limitations/implications – The framework was pre-tested in a specific context in Brazil. Its construct validity and reliability require further testing and refinement. Practical implications – The framework provides reference for the definition of priorities and targeted initiatives in specific areas of trade and transport operations at border-crossing levels. The initiatives can be aligned with relevant strategic performance objectives of operations in general. Originality/value – The theoretical, empirical, and practical issues addressed in the research provide an insightful basis for future research and managerial initiatives. The framework defined in the study offers robust measures that allow academics and practitioners to understand and address critical aspects inherent in the operational dimension of trade and transport facilitation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} collect {{evidence}} on the structural and <b>substantive</b> <b>validity,</b> and test-retest reliability of the Chinese version of the Oswestry Disability Index (CODI). Seventy-nine patients suffering from chronic low back pain were assessed with the CODI. The results of explorative factor analysis primarily suggested a single-factor structure with nine out of 10 items (factor loading = 0. 66 - 0. 79). The sex life item was found to load on a different factor. The Cronbach's alpha of all 10 items was 0. 81 (p < 0. 05). When the sex life item {{was removed from the}} analysis, the alpha value was increased to 0. 89 (p < 0. 05). The test-retest reliability was estimated based on 56 participants who completed two administrations of CODI in 48 hours. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) computed for the total CODI scores was 0. 86 (95 % C. I. = 0. 81 - 0. 91). The reliability estimated for the item scores using Kappa statistics ranged from a high of k = 0. 80 for the sitting item to a low of k = 0. 49 for the traveling item. Kappa statistics were not available for three items. The Chinese version of the Oswestry Disability Index demonstrated satisfactory validity and test-retest reliability, and so could be considered as an appropriate instrument for assessing chronic back pain-related disability in Chinese patients in Hong Kong. Further research should address the cross-cultural and measurement issues in regard to sex life in order to further improve the test content of the instrument.

40|$|The {{just-in-time}} purchasing literature resoundingly endorses long-term, cooperative buyer-supplier relationships. Significant anecdotal {{and descriptive}} {{evidence indicates that}} such relationships are rare in practice, raising questions as to the performance consequences of this gulf between theory and practice. Using an accepted theoretical model of the buyer-supplier relationship, transaction cost economics, {{this study examined the}} purchasing performance implications {{of the nature of the}} buyer-supplier relationship under just-in-time exchange. The focal purpose of the study was to examine the performance consequences of crafting long-term, cooperative relationships. The research design employed was a cross-sectional field study, involving a static-group comparison, implemented through the use of a mail survey. A dual-stage cluster sample of eight hundred purchasing managers and professionals employed in the two digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 36, Electronic and Other Electrical Equipment and Components, was provided by the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM). The questionnaire was pretested and the <b>substantive</b> <b>validity</b> of the measurement scales assessed. Scales were purified via correlational and reliability analyses. Criterion-related and construct validity were established via correlational, exploratory factor, and confirmatory factor analyses. The three hypotheses of the study, involving extant tests of the association between the nature of the buyer-supplier relationship and purchasing performance (i. e., as reflected by transaction costs), were tested via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. All three hypotheses were supported by the data to varying degrees. The confirmation of the theoretical model of the study provides empirical evidence to researchers and practitioners as to the superiority, in exchange efficiency terms, of cooperative relationships under conditions of just-in-time exchange. It may not be presumed, however, that cooperative exchange will enhance efficiency in all exchange environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{construct}} a reliable indicator of the 5 functions of identity proposed by Adams and Marshall (1996). Following Loevinger’s (1957) method of test construction, 2 related studies were completed to test the substantive, structural, and external validity of the Functions of Identity Scale. Study 1 provides support for the <b>substantive</b> <b>validity</b> (factor structure, internal consistency, and con-struct validity). Results of Study 2 reveal evidence for 4 functions of identity and sup-port for the external validity of the scale. As predicted, the complexity of identity status (diffusion, foreclosure, moratorium, and achievement) was positively corre-lated with the functions of identity, except for the measure of harmonious goals. These findings also support the conceptualization of the process of identity formation based on the distinctions of active and passive identity. Passive identity (diffusion and fore-closure) was associated with lower scores on the Functions of Identity Scale than was active identity (moratorium and achievement). In a measurement scheme of identity, Marcia (1966) drew on two dimensions of Erikson’s (1968) theory of identity formation: crisis (exploration) and commit-ment. Exploration (crisis) refers to an examination of alternatives with the inten-tion to make a commitment. Commitment refers to dedicating oneself to an action, goal, ideal, value, or belief. The measurement process detects four types of iden-tity, and this conceptualization is known as the Identity Status Paradigm. The least complex status is identity diffusion, in which youth have not made, and often avoid, ideological commitments; nor do diffuse youth perceive a need to actively explore alternatives. Those who are identity foreclosed have made commitments (usually adopting the beliefs and values of their parents), but have not actively ex...|$|E
