40|$|Supply Chain Management, {{which is}} {{concerned}} with material and information flows between facilities and the final customers, has been considered the most popular operations strategy for improving organizational competitiveness nowadays. With the advanced development of computer technology, it is getting easier to derive an acceptance <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> satisfying both the producer's and consumer's quality and risk requirements. However, all the available QC tables and computer software determine the <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> on a noneconomic basis. In this paper, we design an economic model to determine the optimal <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> in a two-stage supply chain that minimizes the producer's and the consumer's total quality cost while satisfying both the producer's and consumer's quality and risk requirements. Numerical examples show that the optimal <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> is quite sensitive to the producer's product quality.

30|$|In {{advanced}} manufacturing processes, supplier production is frequently continuous, so {{the quality of}} preceding and/or successive lots {{is expected to be}} homogeneous and dependent (Kuraimani and Govindaraju 1992). But the single <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> and the two stage <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> only consider the present state of a lot, that is, they accept or reject a lot based on the present lot quality. In order to compensate for this weaknesses, Wortham and Baker (1976) introduced the multiple dependent state (MDS) <b>sampling</b> <b>plan,</b> which examines a lot based on not only the sample information from the current lot but also the quality of preceding lots. So the MDS <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> can be used in the case that lots are submitted for inspection serially. Recently, Balamurali and Jun (2007) proposed MDS <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> by variables for the assessment of normally distributed quality characteristics. Aslam et al. (2015) proposed a mixed MDS <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> using the process capability index, and Aslam et al. (2014) considered MDS sampling {{for the development of a}} new attribute control chart. To the best of our knowledge, there exist no studies about the MDS plan based on the CV. Therefore, assuming that the quality characteristic follows the normal distribution, we will develop the MDS <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> using the CV with expectation that it is more efficient than the single plan proposed by Tong and Chen (1991) in this article.|$|R
