30|$|The {{geometry}} of the cross section was examined after treatment with the <b>sodium</b> chloride-calcium <b>acetate</b> compound; some crystals were observed on the surface, while many crystallization products were evenly distributed for calcium acetate. The crystallization products showed smaller crystal sizes and a more uniform distribution than sodium chloride; therefore, surface reformation is likely caused by the generation of complexes, not surface etching.|$|R

25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. <b>Sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> {{is used in}} {{the textile}} {{industry}} to neutralize sulfuric acid waste streams and also as a photoresist while using aniline dyes. It is also a pickling agent in chrome tanning and helps to impede vulcanization of chloroprene in synthetic rubber production. In processing cotton for disposable cotton pads, <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> is used to eliminate the buildup of static electricity.|$|E

It is shown that in the case of nanocrystals depolarization is mainly defined by the quantum dimensional changes of dielectric function and does not depend on parameters of surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Various {{conditions}} of storage {{have been tested}} for stability of ethyl acetate in whole blood. Ethyl acetate (5 μg/ml) was spiked to whole blood, and kept at room temperature or at 4 ℃ for various intervals in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>sodium</b> fluoride. Ethyl <b>acetate</b> and ethanol were simultaneously measured by our cryogenic oven trapping gas chromatography. Ethyl acetate was found stable at room temperature for 3 days in the presence of 10 mg sodium azide and 50 mg sodium fluoride in 1 ml whole blood. The compound was also very stable at 4 ℃ for at least 14 days under the same additive conditions. Without <b>sodium</b> fluoride, ethyl <b>acetate</b> was readily decomposed. Ethanol could not be used as an indicator of the preexistence of ethyl acetate in whole blood.

40|$|Abstract. Titanium doped {{hollow glass}} {{microspheres}} (HGMs) with atom ratio of Ti to Si (Ti/Si) from 2 % to 20 % were fabricated by dried gel method. Effects of titanium concentration on elements distribution and properties of gels and HGMs were investigated. Results show that elements in both gels and HGMs distribute uniformly when Ti/Si {{is no more}} than 5 %. On the contrary, sodium chlorides separate out and acetic acids volatilize from gels with a higher titanium concentration and the elements distribution becomes nonuniform. Furthermore, loss of <b>sodiums</b> and <b>acetate</b> ions results in insufficient blowing and refining during the HGMs fabrication process and further leads to the decrease of quality on morphology, geometry and uniformity of spheres...|$|R
25|$|Potassium {{chloride}} {{has also}} been used to produce heat packs which employ exothermic chemical reactions, but these have mostly been discontinued {{with the advent of}} cheaper and more efficient methods, such as the oxidation of metals ('Hot Hands' one-time-use products) or the crystallization of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> (multiple-use products).|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is {{performed in the}} presence of an organopalladium catalyst. The halide (Br, Cl) or triflate is an aryl, benzyl, or vinyl compound and the alkene contains at least one hydrogen and is often electron-deficient such as acrylate ester or an acrylonitrile.The catalyst can be tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), palladium chloride or palladium(II) acetate. The ligand is triphenylphosphine, PHOX or BINAP. The base is triethylamine, potassium carbonate or <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{acetic acid}} (or the acetate ion) can cause {{additional}} problems. One {{study found that}} injecting <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> into rats caused them to have nociceptive behavior (headaches). In addition, there is a biochemical explanation for this finding. High acetate levels cause adenosine to accumulate {{in many parts of}} the brain. But when the rats were given caffeine, which blocks the action of adenosine, they no longer experienced headaches.|$|E
40|$|Base {{hydrolysis}} {{in combination}} with hydrothermal processing has been proposed as an environmentally acceptable alternative to open burning/open detonation for degradation and destruction of high explosives. In this report, the authors examine gaseous and aqueous products of base hydrolysis of the HMX-based plastic bonded explosive, PBX- 9404. The authors also examine products from the subsequent hydrothermal treatment of the base hydrolysate. The gases produced from hydrolysis of PBX- 9404 are ammonia, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen. Major aqueous products are <b>sodium</b> formate, <b>acetate,</b> nitrate, and nitrite, but not all carbon products have been identified. Hydrothermal processing of base hydrolysate destroyed up to 98 % of the organic carbon in solution, and higher destruction efficiencies are possible.

25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2. The Taxol ring (D) was added by an {{intramolecular}} nucleophilic substitution involving this hydroxyl group to give oxetane 6.3. After acetylation, phenyllithium {{was used to}} open the carbonate ester ring to give alcohol 6.5. Allylic oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate,</b> and celite gave ketone 6.6, which was subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride to give secondary alcohol 6.7. This was the last compound before {{the addition of the}} amide tail.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{oxidation}} {{yields the}} corresponding aldehyde, which can then undergo a Prins reaction with the neighboring alkene.

The robustness of PCC as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis (Scheme 3).

500|$|Conant's {{investigations}} {{helped in}} the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of acids and bases. He investigated the properties of certain acids which were many times stronger than mineral acid solutions in water. Conant christened them [...] "superacids" [...] and laid the foundation for the development of the Hammett acidity function. These investigations used acetic acid as the solvent and demonstrated that <b>sodium</b> <b>acetate</b> behaves as a base under these conditions. [...] This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (published in 1923) but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including acetophenone, phenylacetylene, fluorene and diphenylmethane. Conant can be considered alongside Brønsted, Lowry, Lewis, and Hammett as a developer of modern understanding of acids and bases.|$|E
40|$|This project {{reveals the}} {{proliferation}} in {{the awareness of}} acetate and other carbonyl corrosion on bronze artifacts in archaeological collections. Blue and blue-green carbonyl corrosion of bronze is a recent discovery {{in part due to}} its mistaken attribution over the years to bronze disease, chalconatronite, and azurite. This project examines sources of acetic acid, and evaluates the environmental conditions in which acetate corrosion develops and the influence of alloyed lead and sodium contaminants in this process. Case studies identifying corrosion by XRD on predominantly Egyptian archaeological bronzes, with a focus on Saqqara, revealed a preponderance of a <b>sodium</b> copper carbonate <b>acetate</b> and copper <b>sodium</b> formate <b>acetate.</b> These were identified on the majority of Saqqara bronzes sampled in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Ashmolean Museum, Liverpool Museum, Petrie Museum and British Museum. Unknown compounds not included in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) catalogue were also discovered. Due to the novelty of this discovery, the conservation of bronze with carbonyl corrosion is as yet an unexplored area. This project examines passive and active means of conservation. Solubility and cleaning tests were carried out on the Saqqara bronzes. Solubility of carbonyl corrosion is discussed in terms of removability, influence on cleaning methods, and stabilization of corrosion by means of environmental control. Two coatings, the acrylate Incralac®, and the polyethylene wax emulsion Poligen® ES 91009, underwent corrosion testing on leaded and unleaded bronze with promising results as protective coatings against attack by volatile acetic acid...|$|R

40|$|Most {{methods for}} the {{colorimetric}} estimation of sodium {{depend upon the}} pre-cipitation of the metal as <b>sodium</b> zinc uranyl <b>acetate,</b> a reaction first proposed by Barber and Kolthoff (1928).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to study the use of reactive extrusion for the chemical modifications of starch and cellulose. A carboxymethyl derivative of starch and carboxymethyl and acetate derivatives of cellulose were prepared using reactive extrusion. ^ Carboxymethyl starch with rapid swelling properties in water was prepared using reactive extrusion. This was achieved by controlling the gelatinization and {{through the use of}} NaOH by controlling the water/ethanol ratio. The effects of NaOH, H 2 O, temperature, ethanol, <b>sodium</b> mono chloro <b>acetate,</b> <b>sodium</b> tripolyphosphate, citric acid, epichlorohydrin and extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution of carboxymethyl starch were studied. ^ The physical, chemical and morphological properties of sodium starch glycolate (cross-linked carboxymethyl starch) prepared using reactive extrusion were characterized and compared with those of VIVASTAR®P. The liquid (water and 0. 1 N HCl) uptakes by sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion were lower than those by VIVASTAR®P. This may have been because of gelatinization of starch and insufficient cross-linking in sodium starch glycolate prepared using reactive extrusion. Carboxymethyl starches with high degrees of substitutions also were prepared using reactive extrusion. The effects of SMCA:starch ratio, aqueous ethanol:(starch+SMCA) and the extruder screw configuration on the degree of substitution and reaction efficiency were studied. ^ Further, the use of reactive extrusion for the chemical modification of a non-thermoplastic material like cellulose was demonstrated. The effects of water:ethanol ratio and amounts of NaOH used, on the degree of substitution, degree of crystallinity, cellulose-II crystalline fraction, saline uptake, saline absorption and surface morphology were studied. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that carboxymethyl cellulose prepared using 100 % H 2 O had higher degree of crystallinty and cellulose-II crystalline fraction. Saline uptake by this carboxymethyl cellulose was comparable with that of <b>sodium</b> polyacrylate. ^ <b>Acetate</b> derivatives of cellulose also were prepared by a solvent-less reactive extrusion process with the use of iodine catalyst. The effects of the acetic anhydride:cellulose ratio and iodine concentration on the degree of substitution, crystalline structure, oligomer formations and surface microstructure were studied. ...|$|R
