The SLOG device is only used for writing apart from when recovering from a <b>system</b> <b>error.</b> It can often be small (for example, in FreeNAS, the SLOG device only needs to store the largest amount of data likely to be written in about 10 seconds (or the size of two 'transaction groups'), although {{it can be made}} larger to allow longer lifetime of the device). SLOG is therefore unusual in that its main criteria are pure write functionality, low latency, and loss protection – usually little else matters.|$|E

40|$|Inertial <b>system</b> <b>errors</b> in case {{of using}} the new {{structural}} correction method have been determined. Inertial <b>system</b> <b>errors,</b> which determine the kinematic parameters of aircraft movement, are finally generated in the computing circuit. This {{is the part of}} inertial system structure which is presented as a closed loop with a feedback. The forward circuit of the main loop consists of several velocity and distance integrators connected in series. Accelerometer signal corrections are calculated in the feedback loop. New corrective circuits have been introduced to the inertial system structure. And the errors of the changed system have been determined. The structural corrective circuits got signals from exterior onboard navigation systems. The conducted research has shown that the use of structural corrective circuits in some cases leads to a considerable decrease of inertial <b>system</b> <b>errors.</b> It means that the new structural method of inertial system correction provides positive results. Further research of inertial <b>system</b> <b>errors</b> should be conducted for the case of its full structure...|$|R

The test persons could operate the system, using different input modalities, such as natural or command speech as well as head and hand gestures, or classical tactile paradigms. In various situational contexts, we scrutinized the interaction patterns the test participants applied to overcome different operation tasks. Moreover, we evaluated individual user behavior concerning modality transitions and individual fallback strategies in case of <b>system</b> <b>errors.</b> Two different <b>error</b> types (Hidden <b>System</b> <b>Errors</b> and Apparent <b>System</b> <b>Errors)</b> were provoked. As a result, we found out that initially, i. e. with the system working properly, most users prefer tactile or speech interaction. In case of Hidden <b>System</b> <b>Errors,</b> mostly changes from speech to tactile interaction and vice versa occurred. Concerning Apparent <b>System</b> <b>Errors,</b> 87 % of the subjects automatically interrupted or cancelled their input procedure. 73 % of all test persons who continued interaction, when the reason for the faulty system behavior was gone, strictly kept the selected modality. Regarding the given input vocabulary, none of the subjects selected head or hand gesture input as the leading fallback modality...|$|R

The effects of these errors can be massively compounded during emergency situations. Crew Resource Management (CRM) is an important process aircrews can utilize to minimize risks and enhance assessments.

Suggestions can be made to further prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future utilizing historical aeronautical records.

Previous work has shown that tailored, scannable paper forms (adaptive turnaround documents, ATDs) can achieve the benefits of computer-based clinical decision support at low cost and minimal disruption of workflow. ATDs are highly accurate under controlled circumstances, but accuracy {{in the setting of}} busy clinics with untrained physician users is untested. We recently developed and implemented such a system and studied rates of errors attributable to physician users and <b>errors</b> in the <b>system.</b> Prompts were used in 63 % of encounters.

40|$|In {{bioluminescence}} tomography (BLT), {{reconstruction of}} internal bioluminescent source distribution {{from the surface}} optical signals is an ill-posed inverse problem. In real BLT experiment, apart from the measurement noise, the <b>system</b> <b>errors</b> caused by geometry mismatch, numerical discretization, and optical modeling approximations are also inevitable, which may lead to large errors in the reconstruction results. Most regularization techniques such as Tikhonov method only consider measurement noise, whereas the influences of <b>system</b> <b>errors</b> have not been investigated. In this paper, the truncated total least squares method (TTLS) is introduced into BLT reconstruction, in which both <b>system</b> <b>errors</b> and measurement noise are taken into account. Based on the modified generalized cross validation (MGCV) criterion and residual error minimization, a practical parameter-choice scheme referred to as improved GCV (IGCV) is proposed for TTLS. Numerical simulations with different noise levels and physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of TTLS combined with IGCV for solving the BLT inverse problem...|$|R
