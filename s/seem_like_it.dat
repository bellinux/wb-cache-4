5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt that it should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists {{may also}} {{work on a}} diverse set of campaigns known broadly as {{psychological}} warfare. Psychologically warfare chiefly {{involves the use of}} propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> originates from a different source. The CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD. The U.S. military used the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), part of Information Operations (IO). Psychologists are sometimes involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, though this has sometimes been denied by those involved and sometimes opposed by others.|$|E

[...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} several songs relate to Duff's {{experiences}} between the releases of Hilary Duff and Dignity. The songs [...] "Stranger" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Woman", despite speculation {{that they were}} written about Madden's then-new girlfriend Nicole Richie, were actually written about Duff's father's affair. She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom must feel around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was about a relationship I was in, because I didn't {{want people to know}} about my parents. But I've realized that so many people can relate to what I've gone through." [...] The album's title track has also been reported to be about Richie, though Duff did not deny rumors that it was. [...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely about people in Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Professor Gary Segura, a {{political}} scientist at Stanford University, said that no other minority groups in America— including undocumented aliens— have been the target of more restrictive ballot initiatives than gay men and lesbians. He accused Proposition 8 of being the type of social stigma that makes [...] "gay and lesbian social progress <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> comes at expense of other people and organizations and it makes the hill steeper". Under cross-examination, defense witness David Blankenhorn revealed that he believed the principle of equal human dignity applied to gay and lesbian Americans, and that [...] "we would be more American on the day we permitted same-sex marriage than we were on the day before".|$|E
2500|$|Getty, {{who went}} through a three-hour {{transformation}} to become Sophia, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to look the part. The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young. Disney's Michael Eisner explains, [...] "Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could be a contemporary, young show." [...] As surprising as it may sound, Estelle Getty continuously battled her stage fright. During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2015, FEMM {{confirmed}} {{in a press}} release through Avex Group Inc. that they would release their debut physical album, which was revealed to be entitled Pow!/L.C.S..

In late January 2016, FEMM announced through a press release with Avex Group Inc. that they would release a double album in late February 2016 that included a physical copy of Femm-Isation. Regarding the material, FEMM agent Honey-B stated [...] "The original order of the songs was already carefully mapped out, but this time round we got to put in segues in between songs which made a big difference.

60|$|The {{feeling that}} fills the {{traveller}} may be faintly suggested thus; that here, in this legendary land between Asia and Europe, {{may well have}} happened whatever did happen; that through this Eastern gate, if any, entered whatever made and changed the world. Whatever else this narrow strip of land may <b>seem</b> <b>like,</b> <b>it</b> does really seem, to the spirit and almost to the senses, like the bridge that may have borne across archaic abysses the burden and the mystery of man. Here have been civilisations as old as any barbarism; to all appearance perhaps older than any barbarism. Here is the camel; the enormous unnatural friend of man; the prehistoric pet. He is never {{known to have been}} wild, and might make a man fancy that all wild animals had once been tame. As I said elsewhere, all might be a runaway menagerie; the whale a cow that went swimming and never came back, the tiger a large cat that took the prize (and the prize-giver) and escaped to the jungle. This is not (I venture to think) true; but it is true as Pithecanthropus and Primitive Man and all the other random guesses from dubious bits of bone and stone. And the truth is some third thing, too tremendous to be remembered by men. Whatever it was, perhaps the camel saw it; but from the expression on the face of that old family servant, I feel sure that he will never tell.|$|E
