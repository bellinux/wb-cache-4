50|$|Aldermaston Lock {{was built}} between 1718 and 1723 under the {{supervision}} of the engineer John Hore of Newbury. It was originally turf-sided, but enlarged in the mid-eighteenth century and given scalloped brick walls. It was altered in 1984 when the walls were raised to the full height of lock as part of its restoration. The original height of the <b>scalloped</b> walls is <b>marked</b> by a line of blue bricks.|$|R
40|$|Objectives : To {{develop a}} method to mark {{hatchery}} reared saucer scallops to distinguish them from animals derived from wild populations. Outcomes achieved : Juvenile saucer scallop (Amusium balloti) shells have been successfully marked en masse using 3 chemicals, namely alizarin red S, calcein and oxytetracycline (OTC). Considering spat survival, mark quality and mark duration collectively, the most successful chemical was OTC. Scallop spat immersed for three days in 200 or 300 mg L- 1 OTC resulted in good mark incorporation and high survival. Tris was {{an effective means of}} buffering pH change during OTC treatment, with no apparent adverse effects to the <b>scallops.</b> The <b>marks</b> from OTC treatment were still visible in live scallops for at least 10 months, even with exposure to natural filtered light during that period. A second discernible shell mark was added 27 days after the first with no evident toxicity to the scallops. A simulated seabed system was designed which provide <b>marked</b> improvements in <b>scallop</b> juvenile survival and growth. Advice on shell marking has been given to QSS by DPI&F, and the first commercial trials have now commenced, with initial results showing successful <b>marking</b> of juvenile <b>scallops</b> at QSS. This research will allow the industry to monitor the survival, growth and movement of specific cohorts of deployed scallops. This will provide valuable feedback to assess the value of the ranching venture, to optimise release strategies, and to develop improved species management plans...|$|R
5000|$|The {{carving of}} the cartouches {{was done on}} granite {{directly}} {{on the surface of}} the stone at the ground, on all four sides. It is not known what technique was employed for carving the granite from the quarry bed-rock and there are very unusual regularly-spaced [...] "scallop" [...] cuts all down the cut surfaces which cannot be explained by the current, frequently repeated, but yet unproven statement that they were [...] "pounded out" [...] by hitting with small balls of diorite. No scientific explanation of these <b>scalloped</b> cut <b>marks</b> has ever been published. Once the sides were cut down into the rock, the stone piece had to be separated from the bedrock. A series of cuts were made, again using the unknown scallop-cutting process. The existence of the hundreds of nearly-perfectly spherical diorite balls, and almost all of the same size, led to the erroneous conclusion that they were used as [...] "pounders", but the most probable use of these balls were for [...] "ball bearings" [...] to roll the obelisk around for movement and transportation, not for pounding. Obelisks made out of softer rock (i.e. sandstone) were extracted from the bedrock by first drilling holes in the rock and then driving in wooden spikes. The wood was then wetted with water until saturated. The wood expanded with the water thus preferentially cracking the rock along the line of the wooden spikes. Many residues left at the rock beds and measuring nearly the size of many famous obelisks (for example the Cleopatra's Needle) are now known to exist at the Unfinished Obelisk open-air museum.|$|R
40|$|Maerl {{beds are}} mixed sediments {{built by a}} surface layer of slow-growing, unattached coralline algae that are of {{international}} conservation significance because they create areas of high biodiversity. They are patchily distributed throughout Europe (to ∼ 30 m depth around the British Isles and to ∼ 120 m depth in the Mediterranean) and many are affected by towed demersal fishing. We report the effects of Newhaven scallop dredges on a previously unfished maerl bed compared with the effects on similar grounds that have been fished commercially in the Clyde Sea area, Scotland. Sediment cores were taken to assess the population density of live maerl thalli prior to <b>scallop</b> dredging on <b>marked</b> test and control plots. These plots were then monitored biannually over a four-year period. Live maerl thalli were sparsely distributed at the impacted site, and experimental dredging had no discernible effect on their numbers. The previously unfished ground had dense populations of live maerl and scallops (both Aequipecten opercularis and Pecten maximus). While counts of live maerl remained high on the control plot, scallop dredging led to a > 70 % reduction {{with no sign of}} recovery over the subsequent four years. The vulnerability of maerl and associated benthos (e. g., the delicate bivalve, Limaria hians) is discussed in relation to towed demersal fishing practices. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} {{the potential of}} Antarctic bivalve shells as biomonitors for environmental and climatic variations in polar marine areas, we developed a growth model for juvenile Adamussium colbecki Smith, 1902 based {{on the use of}} in situ temporal calcein markings to calibrate growth patterns in the external striae formation. To minimize scallop stress caused by excessive handling, in situ benthic chambers were used for the marking experiment, during an exposure time of 6 h. Once <b>marked,</b> <b>scallops</b> remained on site in a benthic cage and were collected 18, 26, and 41 days later. Apart from a few specimens affected by possible calcein toxicity effects, the detectable mark in all shells revealed a higher austral summer growth rate for A. colbecki compared to other Antarctic bivalves. Using calcein labeling, we identified a near 14 -day periodicity in the striae formation associated with the fortnightly seawater level regime. Striae counting and increment width measurements showed an annual cycle, with no clear cessation of growth in juvenile specimens, allowing age determination. Because of the relatively high growth rate for a polar species and easily recognizable sclerochronological calendar in the shell striae formation, A. colbecki is an appropriate species for high-resolution (infra-monthly) geochemical sampling. Comparison between LA-ICP-MS analyses (Li, B, Mg, Mn, Co, Sr, Ba, Pb) from one shell and hydrological parameters (sea level, temperature, salinity) measured in seawater suggests, however, that more work is needed to calibrate the trace element proxies. Nevertheless, the shell of the Antarctic scallop A. colbecki has tremendous potential for recording environmental conditions from time periods covering months to a few years in polar waters, notably the ice melting date...|$|R
40|$|The {{periodicity}} of striae {{formation in}} the tropical scallop Comptopallium radula (Indo-West Pacific Ocean) was investigated with an in situ marking technique, using the calcein fluorochrome. To minimize scallop stress caused by excessive handling, in situ benthic chambers were used for marking experiments. Once <b>marked,</b> <b>scallops</b> (shell height range: 38. 4 - 75. 8 mm) remained on site in a large benthic enclosure and were collected at regular time intervals to count new striae formed after marking, {{over a period of}} 3 months. A 3 -h exposure period with calcein (150 mg l(- 1)) was sufficiently long to create a detectable mark in nearly shells. It was, however, impossible to count the striae in 48. 2 % of the shells (mainly large specimens) because of a very small growth after marking. Lack of significant mortality during the experiments indicated that tested calcein concentrations were not lethal. A decrease in shell growth rate was observed after marking but the respective impacts of calcein toxicity and changes in environmental conditions could not be discriminated. Our results suggest that in situ calcein marking inside benthic chambers is suitable for shell growth studies of scallops, provided the latter are not too old. After marking, the juvenile C. radula formed an average of one stria every 2. 1 days in summer. Reports of 2 -day periodicity in biological rhythms are rare. Striae formation in C. radula may be controlled by an endogenous oscillator, synchronized by an environmental cue acting as a zeitgeber, such as seawater temperature or sea level pressure, both of which exhibit 2 -day variations in the Pacific Ocean. As in many other scallop species, C. radula forms striae periodically under natural conditions, but this study shows that in pectinid juveniles, this periodicity can deviate from a daily cycle. These results suggest that C. radula shells have tremendous potential for recording environmental conditions during periods ranging from months to a few years and with a resolution of 2 days...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} have a better {{understanding}} of recessing in great scallop, Pecten maximus and consequently the causes of mortality at reseeding, this study has monitored, at different seasons, the dispersion and recessing of different sizes of juveniles (about 15, 30 and 45 mm, called small, medium and large) after seeding. Moreover, the aim was to see when small spat (15 mm) could be seeded, and thus reduce the costs of intermediate culture. Three monitoring approaches were used together: (1) continual observations by remote video camera, of a defined area (less than 1 m 2) containing 10 scallops from each size group; (2) daily monitoring of behaviour with divers along three bottom lines, with 20 × 1 m 2 plots each and nine <b>marked</b> <b>scallops</b> per plot; and (3) the biochemical content of the muscle: adenylic energetic charge and storage of energy reserves (glucides, proteins, lipids). The video monitoring identified but did not quantify predator behaviour, particularly at night. The role and behaviour of spiny crab, Maia squinado, and of small predators has clearly been shown, such as: (a) small crustaceans, Inachus sp., breaking the edges of scallop valves; and (b) small gobies, Pomatoschistus pictus, pecking the tentacles of the scallop mantle. For the monitoring by divers, filtering appeared much too difficult to look at for it was very disturbed by divers, and anyway the resumption of filtering came immediately after seeding. On the other hand, diver monitoring of dispersal and recessing was quite easy to do with a minimum of practice. On the basis of dispersal, the best seasons for seeding appear to be spring or summer. In autumn, two-thirds of small and medium juveniles are missing 3 days after seeding, but we could not observe whether they had been eaten by predators or had just moved and recessed farther. There was no experiment in winter owing to adverse conditions for scallop seedings. Biochemical analyses confirmed the unsuitability of autumn for scallop seeding, because of very low glucide content in this season. The adenylic energetic charge in the smooth part of the muscle showed that stress before seeding (aerial exposure, handling), and post-seeding behaviour (swimming, recessing) have a high energetic cost for scallops. In summer and autumn, 3 days after seeding, none of the three size batches recovered their initial vitality...|$|R
