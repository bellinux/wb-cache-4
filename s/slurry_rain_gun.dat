30|$|The {{tendency}} {{to rely on}} standing water {{during the growing season}} as to exploit rice yields has led to poor water use efficiency. Numerous studies on Pakistan revealed that 13 – 18  cm of water is applied per irrigation, which is considerably higher than the consumptive use of around 8  cm between irrigation events (Kahlown et al., 2001). Additionally, farm irrigation efficiency ranges between 23 and 70 % (Clyma and Ashraf, 1975; Kahlown et al., 1998; Kijne and Kuper, 1995). Furthermore, the use of a pressurized irrigation method has allowed planting of rice and wheat in different countries. Sprinkler irrigation, such as portable <b>rain,</b> <b>guns</b> can be used to add water depth, and sprinklers have been used under prevailing climatic conditions on the Indian subcontinent to improve farm irrigation efficiency by up to 80 %.|$|R

The Americans had lost a second ship, name unknown; the Hermann had been damaged in covering the Barbarossa.... Kurt fretted like an imprisoned animal about the airship, now going up to the forward gallery under the eagle, now down into the swinging gallery, now poring over his maps. He infected Smallways with a sense of the immediacy of this battle that was going on just over the curve of the earth. But when Bert went down to the gallery the world was empty and still, a clear inky-blue sky above and a rippled veil of still, thin sunlit cirrus below, through which one saw a racing drift of rain-cloud, and never a glimpse of sea. Throb, throb, throb, throb, went the engines, and the long, undulating wedge of airships hurried after the flagship like a flight of swans after their leader. Save for the quiver of the engines it was as noiseless as a dream.

Para a avaliação do programa, foi utilizado o aplicativo computacional SIMULASOFT e dados de ensaios de campo de sistemas autopropelidos de irrigação. As lâminas aplicadas, geradas pelo programa SIMULASOFT, foram para o aspersor PLONA-RL 250 (bocal = 20 x 6 mm; pressão = 490 kPa), em deslocamento linear com velocidade de 50 m h- 1, e quatro ângulos de giro distintos (180; 270; 330 e 360 º). As lâminas aplicadas, observadas nos ensaios de campo, em condições de vento menores que 1, 5 m s- 1, foram para o aspersor PLONA-RL 250, operando na pressão de 392 kPa e sob as condições: i) bocal de 14 mm, ângulo de giro de 240 º e velocidade de 30 m h- 1; ii) bocal de 14 x 6 mm, ângulo de giro de 270 º e velocidade de 55 m h- 1. O perfil radial gerado pela rotina computacional com as lâminas aplicadas, geradas com SIMULASOFT, foi igual ao perfil radial obtido em ensaios de laboratório, revelando que o procedimento de cálculo está correto. Uma boa semelhança entre os perfis radiais do aspersor, determinados em ensaios de laboratório e gerados pela rotina computacional, com as lâminas obtidas nos ensaios de campo, foi observada, mostrando que ensaios de campo de sistemas autopropelidos de irrigação podem ser utilizados para a obtenção do perfil radial de aspersores. This paper {{presents}} a computational algorithm, in Visual Basic 6, to determine <b>rain</b> <b>gun</b> radial water distribution patterns, based on catch can data collected at standard tests of traveller irrigation machines. The algorithm was evaluated by using both simulated and measured data input. The simulated data input {{were obtained by}} running a software, named SIMULASOFT, in order to generate catch can data of a traveller irrigation machine transect section. Simulated values were computed considering the PLONA-RL 250 sprinkler (nozzle = 20 x 6 mm; pressure = 490 kPa) working with four wetted sector angles (180 º, 270 º, 330 º and 360 º) and a 50 m h- 1 linear traveling speed. The measured catch can data were obtained at field tests, held under wind speeds lower than 1. 5 m s- 1, of a traveler irrigation machine working with the PLONA-RL 250, at 392 kPa, under the following conditions: i) nozzle = 14 mm; sector angle 240 º, and traveling speed = 30 m h- 1; ii) nozzle = 14 x 6 mm, sector angle = 270 º, and traveling speed = 55 m h- 1. Comparisons among radial water application profiles measured at the test bench and the ones generated by the algorithm indicated that computed profiles based on simulated data were more accurate than the computed profiles based on field measured data. A great similarity obtained with simulated input data demonstrate the numerical accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The reasonably good resemblance of radial patterns generated by the algorithm, when using experimental input values, demonstrates that catch can transect values collected during standard field test of traveller irrigation machines {{may be used in}} order to determine <b>rain</b> <b>gun</b> radial water distribution pattern...|$|R

The CFT-Potato can be used by growers to calculate the actual costs of one ton of potato in terms of kg CO 2 and explore the repercussion of altered management options. Here the comparison of four potato production systems in the Netherlands is shown: seed potatoes (115 kg of CO 2 /t), table potatoes (77), starch potatoes (71) and organic potato (82). Based on potato dry matter, however, starch potato has the lowest footprint mainly due to the extensive use of pig slurry of which the production and transport CO 2 costs are attributed to the pig production chain.

30|$|Witness reports {{suggest that}} the depositional {{condition}} was relatively dry at the initial phase. Relatively dry conditions can give rise to dry aggregates such as loosely bound particle clusters, characterized by low densities and irregular morphologies (e.g., Sorem 1982). Moisture, electrostatic attraction, or mechanical interlocking {{may play a role}} in the formation of such dry aggregates (Carey and Sigurdsson 1982). With time, water may arise from the condensation of the water vapor directly onto the ash particles in the eruption plume, or from liquid drops ejected with the rock fragments. The growth of wet aggregates depends critically on the ability of the dynamics of these liquid bridges that dissipate the kinetic energy of particle collisions and promote the capture of finer particles (Iveson and Litster 1998). In the later phases of the Ontake eruption, the products changed to show a feature of wet deposition as exemplified by the mud rain. When water is present, the mixture becomes oversaturated and the aggregates collapse into structureless <b>slurry</b> or mud <b>rain</b> (e.g., Van Eaton et al. 2012) rather than form individual solid spherical particles such as accretionary lapilli. It is unlikely that accumulation of slurry generates distinct textures; however, the grain-size characteristic of the grains composing the aggregates may be reflected in the entire deposit characteristics as FP.|$|R

40|$|Losses of {{phosphorus}} (P) from {{soil and}} slurry during episodic rainfall events {{can contribute to}} eutrophication of surface water. However, chemical amendments {{have the potential to}} decrease P and suspended solids (SS) losses from land application of slurry. Current legislation attempts to avoid losses to a water body by prohibiting slurry spreading when heavy rainfall is forecast within 48 h. Therefore, in some climatic regions, slurry spreading opportunities may be limited. The current study examined the impact of three time intervals (TIs; 12, 24 and 48 h) between pig slurry application and simulated rainfall with an intensity of 11. 0 ± 0. 59 mm h- 1. Intact grassed soil samples, 1 m long, 0. 225 m wide and 0. 05 m deep, were placed in runoff boxes and pig slurry or amended pig slurry was applied to the soil surface. The amendments examined were: (1) commercial-grade liquid alum (8 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 88 : 1 [Al/total phosphorus (TP) ] (2) commercial-grade liquid ferric chloride (38 % FeCl 3) applied at a rate of 0. 89 : 1 [Fe/TP] and (3) commercial-grade liquid poly-aluminium chloride (10 % Al 2 O 3) applied at a rate of 0. 72 : 1 [Al/TP]. Results showed that an increased TI between slurry application and rainfall led to decreased P and SS losses in runoff, confirming that the prohibition of land-spreading <b>slurry</b> if heavy <b>rain</b> is forecast in the next 48 h is justified. Averaged over the three TIs, the addition of amendment reduced all types of P losses to concentrations significantly different (p< 0. 05) to those from unamended slurry, with no significant difference between treatments. Losses from amended slurry with a TI of 12 h were less than from unamended slurry with a TI of 48 h, indicating that chemical amendment of slurry may be more effective at ameliorating P loss in runoff than current TI-based legislation. Due to the high cost of amendments, their incorporation into existing management practices can only be justified on a targeted basis where inherent soil characteristics deem their usage suitable to receive amended slurry. peer-reviewedIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) - EMBARK Scholarshi...|$|R
60|$|DEAR MR. STEAD,--Peace by compulsion. That seems {{a better}} idea than the other. Peace by persuasion has a {{pleasant}} sound, but I think {{we should not be}} able to work it. We should have to tame the human race first, and history seems to show that that cannot be done. Can't we reduce the armaments little by little--on a pro rata basis--by concert of the powers? Can't we get four great powers to agree to reduce their strength 10 per cent a year and thrash the others into doing likewise? For, of course, we cannot expect all of the powers to be in their right minds at one time. It has been tried. We are {{not going to try to}} get all of them to go into the scheme peaceably, are we? In that case I must withdraw my influence; because, for business reasons, I must preserve the outward signs of sanity. Four is enough if they can be securely harnessed together. They can compel peace, and peace without compulsion would be against nature and not operative. A sliding scale of reduction of 10 per cent a year has a sort of plausible look, and I am willing to try that if three other powers will join. I feel sure that the armaments are now many times greater than necessary for the requirements of either peace or war. Take wartime for instance. Suppose circumstances made it necessary for us to fight another Waterloo, and that it would do what it did before--settle a large question and bring peace. I will guess that 400,000 men were on hand at Waterloo (I have forgotten the figures). In five hours they disabled 50,000 men. It took them that tedious, long time because the firearms delivered only two or three shots a minute. But we would do the work now as it was done at Omdurman, with shower <b>guns,</b> <b>raining</b> 600 balls a minute. Four men to a gun--is that the number? A hundred and fifty shots a minute per man. Thus a modern soldier is 149 Waterloo soldiers in one. Thus, also, we can now retain one man out of each 150 in service, disband the others, and fight our Waterloos just as effectively as we did eighty-five years ago. We should do the same beneficent job with 2,800 men now that we did with 400,000 then. The allies could take 1,400 of the men, and give Napoleon 1,400 and then whip him.|$|R
40|$|Two upper North Bosque River {{segments}} {{were designated}} as impaired in 1998 due to point source and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of phosphorus (P) to these {{segments of the}} watershed. As a result, two Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) were applied which called for the reduction of annual loading and annual average soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations by about 50 %. Under Clean Water Act (Section 319 (h)), a new technologies demonstration project {{was funded by the}} USEPA Region 6 and administered by the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board (TSSWCB) for reducing water pollution associated with dairy animal production systems. As part of this demonstration, the efficacy of a prospective new technology (i. e. L 4 DB? microbial treatment system) was evaluated, which may aid dairy farmers in reducing P from lagoon effluent. In many cases, this effluent is applied to waste application fields (WAFs) as irrigation water; thus reducing P in the effluent can have a direct impact on NPS pollution in the watershed. Beginning in May 2006 a dairy?s anaerobic lagoon was treated with L 4 DB? microbes at an average application rate of 65 gallons (246 L) of microbial solution/month for a period of 12 months. Lagoon samples were collected monthly or bi-monthly from two different profiles: lagoon supernatant (LS, sampled from top of the liquid level to 2 ft (61 cm) depth) and lagoon profile (LP, sampled from the entire depth of the lagoon) using a sludge judge (a sampling tube with a check valve at the bottom to take lagoon sample at different depths). For each LP and LS, 30 samples (3 samples per location ? 10 locations) were collected during each sampling event. A set of 15 LP and 15 LS samples were mixed separately to get two composites of each for nutrients including P, solids, pH, conductivity and metals. In addition, 60 samples of lagoon effluent (hereafter IR) used to irrigate a nearby pasture were collected bi-monthly from a riser located just upstream from the big gun irrigation unit. Fifteen IR subsamples were grouped together to get four IR composite samples. The IR composite samples were also analyzed for the above mentioned physical and chemical constituents. L 4 DB? microbial treatment reduced average sludge depth by 24 % as compared to its pre-treatment level (however, this reduction was 16 %, when sludge measurement anomaly in August 2006 was excluded). The microbial treatment also reduced averaged total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS) by 43 and 45 %, respectively, for the LP, and 60 and 71 %, respectively, for LS. Conversely, these values increased by 124 % for IR effluent over times. This microbial treatment system was effective in reducing average total phosphorus (TP) by 27 and 52 % for the LP and LS, respectively, but not effective in reducing TP concentration for IR effluent. Overall, no clear soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) reduction trends were observed for any sampling locations. Similar to the effect on TP, the L 4 DB? treatment was effective in reducing total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) from the LP (36 %) and LS (48 %), but not effective in reducing potassium (K) for LP and LS. No clear trend of reducing these nutrients from IR effluent was observed over time. This microbial treatment system was effective in reducing metals concentration as well. The average concentration reductions of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, and Mn for LP were over 50 %, while the reduction seen in Mg was only 22 %. Similarly, the concentration reductions observed in LS samples were over 60 % for the same suite of elements while Mg was reduced by about 42 %. No clear metal concentration reduction trends were observed for IR effluent. As a result, it can be inferred that most of these solids, nutrients, and metal reductions were likely due to microbial treatment, dilution of lagoon <b>slurry</b> by excessive <b>rain</b> and runoff as well as settling of dead and degraded bacterial mass accumulated at the bottom of lagoon. Additional measurements of lagoon sludge accumulation rate and constituents are warranted to assess possible increase in nutrients and solids due to accelerated solids settling and increased accumulation of microbial mass at the lagoon bottom...|$|R
