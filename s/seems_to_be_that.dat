5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū, a {{collection}} of stories published in the late Heian period, contains {{some of the earliest}} tales of tengu, already characterized as they would be for centuries to come. These tengu are the troublesome opponents of Buddhism, who mislead the pious with false images of the Buddha, carry off monks and drop them in remote places, possess women in an attempt to seduce holy men, rob temples, and endow those who worship them with unholy power. They often disguise themselves as priests or nuns, but their true form <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of a kite.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{intramuscular}} {{injections of}} H. influenzae suis <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> precipitate swine influenza virus infections {{in a group}} of apparently normal swine. The most likely explanation of the phenomenon <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the animals, though healthy and susceptible, harbored the virus in some unknown manner. The factors possibly determining the phenomenon were explored experimentally but without success...|$|R
30|$|The person {{detection}} algorithm {{explained in}} the previous section worked robustly when the persons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tracked were walking normally. However, when we applied this method to the players when playing the game, the algorithm often failed to detect the players or misdetected a player’s arm as the human body. The biggest reason <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the posture of the persons <b>was</b> different from <b>that</b> of persons when walking normally.|$|R
25|$|A late idea of Tolkien <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Orcs had a {{mixed origin}} of Elves and Men.|$|E
25|$|Although {{controversy}} still continues {{about the}} neuronal fate of polydendrocytes, the consensus {{from a number}} of recent genetic fate mapping studies described above <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> polydendrocytes do not generate a significant number of neurons under normal conditions, and that they are distinct from neural stem cells that reside in the subventricular zone.|$|E
25|$|Vijnana Bikshu (ca. 1550-1600) {{proposes a}} six-stage model, {{explicitly}} rejecting Vacaspati Misra's model. Vijnana Bikshu regards joy (ananda) {{as a state}} that arises when the mind passes beyond the vicara stage. Whicher agrees that ananda is not a separate stage of samadhi. According to Whicher, Patanjali's own view <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> nirvicara-samadhi is the highest form of cognitive ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|Dementieva had no {{particular}} favorite surface, as her playing ability {{allowed her to}} adapt easily on each surface although her best results were on hard courts, while her two Grand Slam finals were on hard court and clay. While her heavy groundstroking baseline game did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> suited <b>to</b> grass, her athleticism and improved serve, in particular her slice serve, led to two consecutive semi-final appearances at Wimbledon.|$|R
50|$|He led {{the league}} in hits for the second {{straight}} season in 2000, and had the second highest batting average in the Central League, but suddenly announced his retirement in the off-season after eight seasons in NPB. The main reasons for his abrupt retirement <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> his family wanted to return to the United States, and the BayStars did not want to continue paying his hefty contract.|$|R

25|$|Conclusion: The La Venta {{site was}} used from (approximately) 800- 400 BCE, during the Formative Period. Complex A {{at the site}} was built and rebuilt during this period and this date range comes from carbon samples from {{construction}} fills. Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck asserts that the Olmec concentration at La Venta occurred from 1200 – 400 BCE and the overriding point <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> an exact chronology {{has proved to be}} elusive.|$|E
25|$|Fitzwalter was {{implicated in}} the baronial {{conspiracy}} of 1212. According to his own statement the king had attempted to seduce his eldest daughter, but Robert's account of his grievances varied from time to time. The truth <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he was irritated by the suspicion with which John regarded the new baronage. Fitzwalter escaped a trial by fleeing to France. He was outlawed, but returned under a special amnesty after John's reconciliation with the pope.|$|E
25|$|The {{main point}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> when Enlil granted eternal life {{it was a}} unique gift. As if to {{demonstrate}} this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh falls asleep, and Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake {{a loaf of bread}} on each of the days he is asleep, so that he cannot deny his failure to keep awake. Gilgamesh, who is seeking to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep. After instructing Urshanabi the ferryman to wash Gilgamesh, and clothe him in royal robes, they depart for Uruk.|$|E

50|$|After a short while, Dr. Fleuriot {{enters the}} shop. He {{recognises}} that the shop girl must be Dolly's sister, as the resemblance is really remarkable. It's {{love at first}} sight for him, and the sister doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> rich, given that she's working in a shoe shop. He immediately invites her for a glass of wine in the evening and is delighted when she does not reject him. Dolly cannot believe how well her plan is working.|$|R
25|$|On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel {{nominated}} Reform {{party leader}} Andrus Ansip as Prime Minister designate {{and asked him}} to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.|$|E
25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} sputtering would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E
25|$|The popular idea <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the Title {{is among}} the ranking factors and the {{description}} {{is more of an}} advertising for the searcher looking at the search results. In other words, while the Title tag is one of the factors determining if a page will rank for a certain keyword, the meta description will only help a search result stand out (or not, depending upon how well-written it is). If more people click on a result with a good description, it may reasonably be expected that Google will reward that same result with a higher ranking. This, of course, if visitors to the link do not immediately leave the page after visiting - that would indicate misleading or poor content. This, in fact, would be likely to demote the result on SERP (Search Engine Results Page).|$|E

50|$|All {{supposed}} kting voar specimens <b>that</b> <b>were</b> subject <b>to</b> DNA {{analysis to}} date have turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> artificially shaped cattle horns (Hassanin et al., 2001; Thomas, Seveau, and Hassanin, 2001; Hassanin, 2002). The most likely explanation, given the DNA testing results and the unusual spotted fur (which {{is well known in}} domesticated, but unknown in wild cattle), <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> modern specimens at least are cattle horns shaped by a complicated technique in order to serve as anti-snake talismans.|$|R
25|$|Trichotillomania {{and skin}} picking {{disorder}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disorders <b>that</b> primarily involve motor impulsivity, {{and will likely}} be classified in the DSM-V within the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders category.|$|R
25|$|A {{discovery}} in gamma-ray astronomy {{came in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s from a constellation of military defense satellites. Detectors on board the Vela satellite series, designed to detect flashes of gamma rays from nuclear bomb blasts, began to record bursts of gamma rays from deep space rather than {{the vicinity of the}} Earth. Later detectors determined that these gamma-ray bursts are seen to last for fractions of a second to minutes, appearing suddenly from unexpected directions, flickering, and then fading after briefly dominating the gamma-ray sky. Studied since the mid-1980s with instruments on board a variety of satellites and space probes, including Soviet Venera spacecraft and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, the sources of these enigmatic high-energy flashes remain a mystery. They appear to come from far away in the Universe, and currently the most likely theory <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> {{at least some of them}} come from so-called hypernova explosionssupernovas creating black holes rather than neutron stars.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem in}} most {{scenarios}} of abiogenesis {{is that the}} thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is {{in the direction of}} separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO4−3. Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A key issue <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of Nevada residents vary, {{but the majority}} appears to support the status quo of prostitution: they support laws allowing licensed brothels {{in the rural areas}} but oppose the legalization of prostitution in Las Vegas. A poll conducted in Nevada in 2002 found that 52% of the 600 respondents favored the existing legal and regulated brothels, while 31% were against laws that allow prostitution and the remainder were undecided, preferred fewer legal constraints on prostitution, or did not offer an opinion. The trend <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> new arrivals to Nevada tend to oppose legal prostitution while long-time Nevadans tend to support it. However, nearly 60% of Nevada residents oppose the legalization of brothels and prostitution in Las Vegas (59% oppose this idea, 35% support it and 6% don't know or didn't answer). Again, support is stronger in the rural areas (where most people were born in Nevada) and weaker in Clark County and Washoe County; women are more opposed to the idea than men.|$|E

50|$|And {{there was}} a {{recording}} contract. The Thompsons owed Island Records an album. The compromise <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> the album <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have a strong spiritual aspect.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} historians and {{linguists}} including Peter Heather and Karl Heinrich Menges {{feel that the}} proper names only allow the Hunnic language <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positioned in the broad group of Altaic languages. Heather argued that [...] "opinions differ even over their linguistic affiliation, but the best guess would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the Huns <b>were</b> {{the first group of}} Turkic, as opposed to Iranian, nomads to have intruded into Europe". Although Menges was also reserved towards the language evidence, his view of the Huns <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "there <b>are</b> ethnological reasons for considering them Turkic or close to the Turks".|$|R
500|$|Regarding the plough and Gefjon, Davidson {{concludes that}} [...] "the {{idea behind the}} taking of the plough round the {{countryside}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> it brought good fortune and prosperity, gifts of a benevolent goddess. Gefjon and her plough thus fit into a large framework of the cult of a goddess associated with fertility of both land and water." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{argument}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> because [...] "the individual's {{rights to}} live and own property" [...] are arguably rights against which [...] "an excise cannot be imposed," [...] the federal income tax on income from labor should therefore be unconstitutional. However, Redfield v. Fisher is an Oregon Supreme Court case, not a federal case. No issues involving the validity of federal income tax laws were decided by the court.|$|E
500|$|For Anita Gates in the New York Times, [...] "the film's strongest message" [...] is [...] "a {{questioning}} of the actor's trade." [...] For Gates, the film comes to sympathize with Harry's notion that prostitutes are in fact actors, or perhaps vice versa: [...] "Mr. Lewis's point <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> it's all the same. What's the big difference, he asks, between acting out the fantasies of one rich old man or those of a few million ticket buyers?" ...|$|E
25|$|In a small {{proportion}} of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form helice. The pale form helice does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> distinct as intermediates exist and the variation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's clouded yellow (Colias sareptensis) and the rarer Pale clouded yellow (Colias hyale). Even the palest C. croceus tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings.|$|R
30|$|As in Green and McIntosh (2007), {{in model}} 3, we {{introduce}} over- and underskilling {{to see whether}} the coefficient for overeducation is reduced. However, the reason that the overeducated earn less does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> not using their skills and abilities to the same extent than matched workers with the same education. On the contrary, we find that these skill mismatching variables leave the educational mismatching variables almost unaffected. Over- and undereducated workers earn approximately 22.6 [*]% less and 14 [*]% more, respectively, than correctly matched workers, when controlling for the extent of skill under- and overutilization.|$|R
