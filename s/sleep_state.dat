25|$|In the Mandukya Upanishad, {{part of the}} Veda scriptures of Indian Hinduism, a {{dream is}} one of three states that the soul {{experiences}} during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and the <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another major {{theory is}} that the neural {{functions}} that regulate sleep are out of balance {{in such a way that}} causes different sleep states to overlap. In this case, cholinergic sleep on neural populations are hyper activated and the serotonergic sleep off neural populations are under-activated. As a result, the cells capable of sending the signals that would allow for complete arousal from the <b>sleep</b> <b>state,</b> the serotonergic neural populations, have difficulty in overcoming the signals sent by the cells that keep the brain in the <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b> During normal REM sleep, the threshold for a stimulus to cause arousal is greatly elevated. Under normal conditions, medial and vestibular nuclei, cortical, thalamic, and cerebellar centers coordinate things such as head and eye movement, and orientation in space.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{breathing}} patterns vary with infant <b>sleep</b> <b>states.</b> However, development of an automated sleep scoring tool based on conventional statistical analysis of breathing patterns has proven problematic. Recent work has demonstrated that non-linear properties of breathing patterns vary with <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> and that analysis with nonlinear tools such as recurrence plot analysis allows the accurate discrimination of <b>sleep</b> <b>states.</b> In this work we propose using a combination of statistical and non-linear analysis measures to automate the identification of infant <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> using only breathing dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Sleep is {{important}} for the development of preterm infants. During sleep, neural connections are formed and the development of brain regions is triggered. In general, various rudimentary <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> can be identified in the preterm infant, namely active sleep (AS), quiet sleep (QS) and intermediate sleep (IS). As the infant develops, <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> change in length and organization, with these changes as important indicators of brain development. As a result, several methods have been deployed to distinguish between the different preterm infant <b>sleep</b> <b>states,</b> among which polysomnography (PSG) is the most frequently used. However, this method is limited by the use of adhesive electrodes or patches that are attached to the body by numerous cables that can disturb sleep. Given the importance of sleep, this review explores more unobtrusive methods that can identify <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> without disturbing the infant. To this end, after a brief introduction to preterm <b>sleep</b> <b>states,</b> an analysis of the physiological characteristics associated with the different <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> is provided and various methods of measuring these physiological characteristics are explored. Finally, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each of these methods are evaluated and recommendations for neonatal sleep monitoring proposed...|$|R
40|$|Sleep is essential. Unfortunately, a {{significant}} portion of the population experiences altered <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> that often result in a multitude of health-related issues. The regulation of sleep and sleep-wake cycles is an area of intense research, and many options for treatment are available. The following review summarizes the current understanding of normal and abnormal sleep-related conditions and the available treatment options. All clinicians managing patients must recommend appropriate therapeutic interventions for abnormal <b>sleep</b> <b>states.</b> Clinicians’ solid understanding of sleep physiology, abnormal <b>sleep</b> <b>states,</b> and treatments will greatly benefit patients regardless of their disease process...|$|R
25|$|Human sleep needs vary {{by age and}} amongst individuals, {{and sleep}} is {{considered}} to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy, and those affected with <b>sleep</b> <b>state</b> misperception may typically report having slept only four hours despite having slept a full eight hours.|$|E
25|$|Various Vajrayana {{practices}} {{involve the}} recognition of this aspect of mind in different situations, such as during sleep. In this case, the practitioner trains to consciously enter the deep <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b> If one {{has the ability to}} remain conscious during deep sleep, one will be able to recognize the luminosity of death and gain Buddhahood. This is called the meeting of mother and child luminosities, resulting in the state of thuktam at death.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{important}} questions in sleep research is clearly defining the <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b> This problem arises because sleep was traditionally defined as a state of consciousness {{and not as a}} physiological state, thus there was no clear definition of what minimum set of events constitute sleep and distinguish it from other states of partial or no consciousness. The problem of making such a definition is complicated because it needs to include a variety of modes of sleep found across different species.|$|E

25|$|Computer {{virtualization}} {{refers to}} the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM mainframe operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for x86-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b> Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. Intel Corporation and AMD have also built proprietary virtualization enhancements to the x86 instruction set into each of their CPU product lines, {{in order to facilitate}} virtual computing.|$|E
500|$|The game begins {{near the}} end of a Central Code cycle, while mankind has learned about the {{impending}} disaster and built [...] "Arks", flying stations intended to float in the sky and house most of them in a deep <b>sleep</b> <b>state</b> {{for the duration of the}} Reborn. The operation works for one hundred years before objects falling from the Central Code hit the Arks and cause them to crash to the surface. Its passengers die or awake, now at the mercy of those who remained on the ground as well as the Otellos; a new, warped species which arose from the dropped pieces of the Central Code. The Otellos seek humans to turn them into mindless puppets named [...] "Coded", although the mutation fails on people from the Arks and results in free and extremely evolved hybrids called [...] "Warheads".|$|E

This is performed {{in the context of}} a partitioned scheduling approach and a realistic power model, which improves over some of the simplifying assumptions often made in the state-of-the-art. The developed heuristic consists of two phases, in the first phase, tasks are allocated to minimise their active energy consumption, while the second phase trades off a higher active energy consumption for an increased ability to exploit savings through more efficient <b>sleep</b> <b>states.</b> Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach...|$|R

2500|$|According to God Speaks, in the {{evolution}} of consciousness, before the Soul has any consciousness of anything or itself, there is an infinite, impressionless unconscious tranquil state. Meher Baba calls this state [...] the Eternal Beyond-Beyond State of God (or Paratpar Paramatma), which has no experience of Self, nor of any of its Infinite latent attributes. Latent in this Infinite state is the undifferentiated and unmanifested Everything. Meher Baba says that the state of the man's consciousness during sound sleep is literally the same original divine sound <b>sleep</b> <b>state</b> of God. Synopsizing this concept in God Speaks biographer Charles Purdom writes, [...] "In the beginningless beginning, in the beyond the beyond, God Is in absolute sound sleep." ...|$|E
2500|$|When REM sleep episodes were timed {{for their}} {{duration}} and subjects were awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting {{of their dreams}} could take place, subjects accurately reported {{the length of time}} they had been dreaming in an REM <b>sleep</b> <b>state.</b> Some researchers have speculated that [...] "time dilation" [...] effects only seem to be taking place upon reflection and do not truly occur within dreams. This close correlation of REM sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly rather than occasional phenomenon, and is correlated with high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60–90 minutes in all humans throughout the lifespan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{demands on}} {{datacenter}} com-puting prompts research in energy-efficient warehouse scale systems. In one approach, server activation policies invoke low-power <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> {{but the power}} state transition latency must be small to produce effective energy savings. Chrome OS and Arch Linux require 50 ms and 650 ms, respectively, to enter <b>sleep</b> <b>states.</b> These states consume merely 4 − 6 % of nominal power. By analyzing the critical path, we propose strategies for selecting hardware components and optimizing kernel resume sequences to make datacenter server activation viable. With fast transitions, server activation can pro-vide better performance at lower energy than dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.

40|$|PURPOSE: Nonlinear {{time series}} {{analysis}} techniques {{have been used to}} analyze physiological signals such as EEG and heart rate. In this paper we illustrate the application of dimensional analysis (DA) to assess neonatal <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> at increasing gestational ages up to fullterm age. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen EEG-polygraphic recordings were performed on 55 neonatal subjects between 28 and 43 weeks gestational age from which state assignments were initially scored by visual analysis. A single channel of EEG (ie. FP 1 -C 3) was selected for dimensional analysis. Two tailed T-tests were used to test for differences in the correlation dimension (CD) between active and quiet <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> for both preterm and fullterm neonates as a function of maturation. RESULTS: 1) A significant difference in CD between active and quiet <b>sleep</b> <b>states</b> (p < 0. 001) was noted for the fullterm infant. 2) A positive correlation between CD and increasing conceptional age was noted (p <. 001). 3) DA showed an increase in the complexity for both active and quiet sleep as the preterm infant matured toward...|$|R
