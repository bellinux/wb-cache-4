40|$|Bis(7) -tacrine {{has been}} shown to prevent glutamate-induced {{neuronal}} apoptosis by blocking NMDA receptors. However, the characteristics of the inhibition have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we further characterize the features of bis(7) -tacrine inhibition of NMDA-activated current in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The results show that with the increase of extracellular pH, the inhibitory effect decreases dramatically. At pH 8. 0, the concentration-response curve of bis(7) -tacrine is shifted rightwards with the IC 50 value increased from 0. 19 +/- 0. 03 mu M to 0. 41 4 +/- 0. 04 mu M. In addition, bis(7) -tacrine shifts the proton inhibition curve rightwards. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of bis(7) -tacrine is not altered by the presence of the NMDA receptor proton <b>sensor</b> <b>shield</b> spermidine. These results indicate that bis(7) -tacrine inhibits NMDA-activated current in a pH-dependent manner by sensitizing NMDA receptors to proton inhibition, rendering it potentially beneficial therapeutic effects under acidic conditions associated with stroke and ischemia.

Today, data fusion can be found in many applications such as tracking and surveillance system as well as on mobile applications. In this project, 9 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) composed of 3 -axis Magnetometer, 3 -axis Accelerometer, and 3 -axis Gyroscope are processed to yield the object’s rotations in 3 dimensions.

40|$|Dissertation (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a data collection system for a small unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight. The following three facets comprise of a UAV system: (1) a UAV aircraft; (2) onboard avionics; and (3) a ground control station subsystem (Taha et al., 2010 : 1). In this project, the UAV aircraft is based on the low-cost autonomous quad-rotator system named “Arducopter Quad”, where the onboard avionic system utilizes both an ArduPilot Mega (APM) on-board controller and IMU <b>sensor</b> <b>shield,</b> while the “Mission Planner” software operates as GCS software to gather essential flight data (Xiang & Tian, 2011 : 176). The approach provides the UAV system structure and both hardware and software with a small UAV data collection system, which is examined throughout the study. And introduce the concept of Arducopter dynamics for better understanding with its flight control. The study also considers the communication process between the UAV and the ground control station. The radio wave is an important aspect in the UAV data collection system (Austin, 2010 : 143). The literature review introduced the basis of the radio wave in respect of its travelling speed, and its characteristics of propagation, including how different frequencies will affect radio wave propagation. The aim of this project was to develop a platform for a small UAV real-time data collection system. The pendulum system was involved to simulate the “Roll” movement of the small UAV, while real-time IMU sensor data was successfully collected at ground control station (GCS), both serial communication and wireless communication, which was applied in the data collection process. The microwave generator interference test proves that the 2. 4 GHz XBee module is capable of establishing reliable indoor communication between the APM controller and the GCS. The work of this project is towards development of additional health monitoring technology to prevent the safety issue of the small UAV. The data collection system can be used as basis for the future research of real-time health monitoring for various small UAVs...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : THEMES AND ISSUESInternational audienceThe U. S. President’s Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative {{calls for}} the {{deployment}} of sensors to help protect federal enterprise networks. Because of the reported cyber intrusions into America’s electric power grid and other utilities, {{there is the possibility}} that sensors could also be positioned in key privately-owned infrastructure assets and the associated cyberspace. Sensors provide situational awareness of adversary operations, but acting directly on the collected information can reveal key sensor attributes such as modality, location, range, sensitivity and credibility. The challenge is to preserve the secrecy of sensors and their attributes while providing defenders with the freedom to respond to the adversary’s operations. This paper presents a framework for using deception to <b>shield</b> cyberspace <b>sensors.</b> The purpose of deception is to degrade the accuracy of the adversary’s beliefs regarding the sensors, give the adversary a false sense of completeness, and/or cause the adversary to question the available information.

Experiments were carried out by applying magneticpermeability measurements (Maxwell-Wien bridge), magnetic after effects, resistivity (four points probe),magnetostriction coefficient (infrared optical sensor) and magnetization (magnetic balance and fluxmeter).

Design/methodology/approach: For annealed samples (1 h, Ta ranging from 300 K to 800 K) at roomtemperature magnetic permeability was measured by applying Maxwell-Wien bridge (frequency about 1030 Hzand magnetic field H= 0. 5 A/m). Magnetostriction coefficients – parallel and perpendicular were determined byapplying infra-red magneto-dilatometer. Magnetization in saturation versus temperature was measured by makinguse of magnetic balance (field 0. 5 T). Findings: It was shown that alloying additions in the examined alloys cause a decrease of the Curie temperature,an increase of magnetic permeability and magnetization in saturation. The observed ESMP (enhancement of softmagnetic properties) effect in the examined alloys {{can be attributed to}} the so-called relaxed amorphous phase freeiron nanograins.

40|$|Flow regime {{identification}} {{in industrial}} systems {{that rely on}} complex multi-phase flows is crucial for their safety, control, diagnostics, and operation. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to develop and demonstrate objective and minimally-intrusive flow regime classification methods for gas/water/paper pulp three-phase slurries, based on artificial neural network-assisted recognition of patterns in the statistical characteristics of pressure fluctuations. Experiments were performed in an instrumented three-phase bubble column featuring vertical, upward flow. The hydrodynamics of low consistency (LC) gas-liquid-fiber mixtures, over a wide range of superficial phase velocities, were investigated. Flow regimes were identified, gas holdup (void fraction) was measured, and near-wall pressure fluctuations were recorded using high-sensitivity pressure sensors. Artificial neural networks of various configurations were designed, trained and tested for the classification of flow regimes based on the recorded pressure fluctuation statistics. The feasibility of flow regime identification based on statistical properties of signals recorded by a single sensor was thereby demonstrated. The transportability of the developed method, whereby an artificial neural network trained and tested with a set of data is manipulated and used for the characterization of an unseen and different but plausibly similar data set, was also examined. An artificial neural network-based method was developed that used the power spectral characteristics of the normal pressure fluctuations as input, and its transportability between separate but in principle similar sensors was successfully demonstrated. An artificial neural network-based method was furthermore developed that enhances the transportability of the aforementioned artificial neural networks that were trained for flow pattern recognition. While a redundant system with multiple sensors is an obvious target application, such robustness of algorithms that provides transportability will also contribute to performance with a single <b>sensor,</b> <b>shielding</b> effects of calibration changes or sensor replacements.

40|$|Magnetic {{materials}} have various uses in applications, {{depending on how}} their magnetization reverses against applied fields. This behavior may be grasped {{in the form of}} hysteresis loops, from which global quantities are extracted such as coercivity, remanence, susceptibility, losses; and the thermal and frequency dependence of these quantities. For example permanent magnets and data storage rely on remanence and coercivity, <b>sensors</b> and <b>shielding</b> on susceptibility, transformers on susceptibility and low losses, etc. Therefore understanding magnetization reversal, with a view to further engineering it, is a central task in applied magnetism. Magnetization reversal is a complex process as a huge number of degrees of freedom is at play with multiscale and non-linear effects, not speaking of microscopic details (microstructure and defects) of real systems which often are not known precisely. Real systems can therefore be handled analytically only at the expense of simplifying assumptions. Grasping the essential aspects of magnetization reversal is crucial for selecting the assumptions to be made and retaining only the parameters most relevant in a given situation. Only this allows one to deliver accurate understanding and predictions using simple models. Magnetization reversal is determined by the several sources of energy characterizing magneti...|$|R

Easily operable, portable filters and amplifiers have been adapted from nonbiological applications, and user-friendly signal analysis software has been written to process and identify insect-generated sounds. In a recent field study, a new, handheld system was tested for its capability to detect late-instar black vine weevil grubs, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, in nursery plant containers in a moderately noisy background. These devices show considerable promise as research instruments and as tools for targeting subterranean insect infestations that would otherwise remain hidden from pest managers...|$|R
