5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur in {{relation}} to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> despite marked abuse and neglect.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their <b>social</b> <b>relationships,</b> while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It {{is not yet clear}} whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.|$|E

5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of <b>social</b> <b>relationships,</b> social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional <b>social</b> <b>relationships,</b> which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in <b>social</b> <b>relationships.</b> Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Personality (Big Five and self-esteem) {{effects on}} <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> quality (perceived support and conflict) {{and vice versa}} were {{longitudinally}} studied during emerging adulthood. Rank-order stability correlations of personality and <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> quality were investigated. Subsequently, the mechanisms that may underlie personality development across emerging adulthood were examined. Results from path analyses showed that <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> quality {{at the age of}} 17 years, in particular perceived conflict, predicted change in personality from the age of 17 years to 23 years, while the reverse pattern was not found. These findings indicated that, during emerging adulthood, personality may still be in flux, and, despite its higher stability as compared to the stability of <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> quality, may be influenced by the environment...|$|R
40|$|Social {{networked}} applications {{have been}} more and more popular, and have brought great challenges to the network engineering, particularly the huge demands of bandwidth and storage for social media. The recently emerged content clouds shed light on this dilemma. Towards the migration to clouds, partitioning the social contents has drawn significant interests from the literature. Yet the existing works focus on preserving the <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> only, while an important factor, user access pattern, is largely overlooked. In this paper, by examining a large collection of YouTube video data, we first demonstrate that partitioning the network entirely based on <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> would lead to unbalanced partitions in terms of access. We further analyze the role of <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> in the <b>social</b> media applications, and conclude that user access pattern {{should be taken into}} account and <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> should be dynamically preserved. We formulate the problem as a constrained k-medoids clustering problem, and propose a novel Weighted Partitioning Around Medoids (wPAM) solution. We present a dissimilarity/similarity metric to facilitate the preservation of the <b>social</b> <b>relationship.</b> We compare our solution with other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the preliminary results show that it significantly decreases the access deviation in each cloud server, and flexibly preserves the <b>social</b> <b>relationship...</b>|$|R

5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her <b>social</b> <b>relationships,</b> but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

5|$|While {{disagreeing with}} Nehru about socialist {{economic}} model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that {{was driven by}} endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism {{at the cost of}} other human needs such as spirituality and <b>social</b> <b>relationships.</b> To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.|$|E
5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining <b>social</b> <b>relationships,</b> and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} combines phenomenological {{and sociological}} research {{for an investigation}} of the <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> of “friendship”. From a phenomenological perspective, it focuses on the epistemological basis, on the subjective constitution of the phenomenon of “friendship”. The social construction of friendship however, is described from a sociological research perspective with reference to concrete empirical expressions of this specific <b>social</b> <b>relationship.</b> The key for the reflections on friendship is the adaptation of Edmund Husserl’s method of phenomenological reduction for the analysis of social phenomena, based on the argumentations of Alfred Schutz and Aron Gurwitsch. This leads to the assumption that friendship is symbolically constituted with reference to everyday transcendent ideas which substantially define the specific expression of this <b>social</b> <b>relationship.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of location-based services (LBS) and {{the ubiquity of}} sensor device have resulted in rich spatiotemporal data. A large number of human behaviors had been recorded including cooccurrence which refers to the phenomenon that two people {{have been to the}} same places at the same time. These data enable attackers to infer people’s <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> based on their cooccurrences and many attack models were proposed. However, current attack models still cannot effectively address the following two challenges: How to distinguish cooccurrences between acquaintances and strangers? What kind of cooccurrence contributes to strong social strength? In this paper, we present a novel <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> attack model—the Mobility Intention-based Relationship Inference (MIRI) model—which can solve the above two issues. Firstly, we extract mobility intentions and adopt them to characterize cooccurrences. A classification model is trained for attacking <b>social</b> <b>relationship.</b> The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIRI model can properly differentiate cooccurrences by simultaneously considering spatial and temporal features. The comparison results also indicate that MIRI model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art <b>social</b> <b>relationship</b> attack models...|$|R
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and <b>social</b> <b>relationships</b> despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
