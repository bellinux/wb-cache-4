25|$|In 1988, NEC {{released}} a kit called PS98-145-HMW for Unix enthusiasts. The kit contained a V60 processor board {{that could be}} plugged into select models of the PC-9800 computer series and a 15-floppy disk distribution of their PC-UX/V release 2.0. The suggested retail price for this kit was 450,000 Yen. NEC themselves included a V60 processor in their 1991 Bungo mini 5SX, 7SX, and 7SD word processor computers, where the V60 was used as fast outline font processor, while the main <b>system</b> <b>processor</b> was a 16MHz NEC V33.|$|E

2500|$|The AP-3C upgrade {{improved}} the Orions' radar, intelligence-gathering and computing systems. The upgrade included fitting each aircraft {{with a new}} Elta EL/M-2022(V)3 radar, a nose-mounted Star Safire III electro-optical and infrared system, [...] "highly capable" [...] signals and electronic intelligence (SIGINT/ELINT) equipment, the UYS 503 acoustic system, a new automatic information <b>system</b> <b>processor,</b> a new navigation system based on two Honeywell H764G Embedded GPS/INUs, a new communications system and other improvements.

50|$|WLM {{controls}} the access {{of the work}} to the <b>system</b> <b>processors,</b> the I/O units, the system storage and starts and stops processes for work execution. The access to the <b>system</b> <b>processors</b> for example is controlled by a dispatch priority which defines a relative ranking between the units of work which want to execute. The same dispatch priority is assigned to all units of work which were classified to the same service class. As already stated the dispatch priority is not fixed and not simply derived from {{the importance of the}} service class. It changes based on goal achievement, system utilization and demand of the work for the <b>system</b> <b>processors.</b> Similar mechanisms exist for controlling all other system resources. This way of z/OS Workload Manager controlling the access of work to system resources is named goal oriented workload management and is in contrast to resource entitlement based workload management which defines a much more static relationship how work can access the system resources. Resource entitlement based workload management is found on larger UNIX operating systems for example.|$|R

5000|$|IBM offered many Model Groups {{and models}} of the 4300 family, ranging from the entry level 4331 to the 4381, {{described}} as [...] "one {{of the most powerful}} and versatile intermediate <b>system</b> <b>processors</b> ever produced by IBM." ...|$|R
50|$|Such caches {{are used}} in <b>systems</b> where many <b>processors</b> or {{computers}} share the same memory and each have their own cache. In such <b>systems</b> <b>processor</b> 'A' may read a value from memory, then processor 'B' does the same. If either of the processors now change the value by writing back to memory they will invalidate the other processor's cached value.|$|R
50|$|HiperDispatch is a {{workload}} dispatching feature {{found in}} the newest IBM mainframe models (the System z10 and IBM zEnterprise <b>System</b> <b>processors)</b> running recent releases of z/OS. HiperDispatch was introduced in February, 2008. Support was added to z/VM in its V6R3 release in July 26, 2013.|$|R

50|$|Later, SGI Altix 512-processor {{systems were}} officially {{supported}} using an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with {{the launch of}} SLES 9 SP1. Besides full support of SGI Altix on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, a standard and unmodified Red Hat Enterprise Linux was also fully supported starting with SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 with RHEL 4 and RHEL 5 with <b>system</b> <b>processor</b> limits defined by Red Hat for those releases.|$|E
50|$|Designers use XPS (Xilinx Platform Studio) to {{configure}} {{and build the}} hardware specification of their embedded <b>system</b> (<b>processor</b> core, memory-controller, I/O peripherals, etc.) The XPS converts the designer's platform specification into a synthesizeable RTL description (Verilog or VHDL), and writes a set of scripts to automate {{the implementation of the}} embedded system (from RTL to the bitstream-file.) For the MicroBlaze core, the EDK normally generates an encrypted (non human-readable) netlist, but the processor description (written in VHDL) can be purchased from Xilinx.|$|E

50|$|The HP 64000, {{introduced}} circa 1980, is a {{tool for}} developing hardware and software for products based on commercial microcomputers. The earliest commercial 64000 development systems contain from one to six 64100A Development Stations sharing a hard drive and line printer. This arrangement allowed up to six designers and engineers to use their workstations together, sharing the HPIB instrumentation bus and a hard drive and a line printer. This was an innovative feature of the 64000 development system since other systems of the era used a timesharing system with a single <b>system</b> <b>processor</b> and memory, making for a more expensive and less flexible development system.|$|E
50|$|Ireland : Captec Ltd., {{based in}} Malahide, {{provided}} the independent validation of mission critical software (independent software validation facility or SVF) and developed the {{software for the}} communications interface between the orbiter and the lander. Captec also provided engineering support to the prime contractor for the launch activities at Kourou. Space Technology Ireland Ltd. at Maynooth University has designed, constructed and tested the Electrical Support <b>System</b> <b>Processor</b> Unit (ESS) for the Rosetta mission. ESS stores, transmits and provides decoding for the command streams passing from the spacecraft to the lander and handles the data streams {{coming back from the}} scientific experiments on the lander to the spacecraft.|$|E
