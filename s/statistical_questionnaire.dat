Using these 32 criteria, an evaluation was performed, aimed at assessing the implementation of EVM in the F- 22 program. The goal: to academically appraise the program's use of EVM in managing Spiral 2, an F- 22 avionics software modernization effort. To accomplish this goal a detailed evaluation of how the program meets the 32 criteria was conducted along with analysis of program data, interviews of subject matter experts and a <b>statistical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> conducted with F- 22 personnel.

We surveyed AMS prevalence and potential risk factors in trekkers crossing a 5400 -m pass in Nepal and compared the results with those of 2 similar studies conducted 12 and 24 years earlier. METHODS: In April 2010, 500 surveys were distributed to English-speaking trekkers at 3500 m {{on their way to}} 5400 m, of which 332 (66 %) surveys were returned complete. Acute mountain sickness was quantified with the Lake Louise Scoring System (LLSS, cutoff ≥ 3 and ≥ 5) and the Environmental <b>Statistical</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> III AMS-C score (ESQ-III, cutoff ≥ 0. 7). We surveyed demographics, body mass index (BMI), smoking habit, rate of ascent, awareness of AMS, and acetazolamide use. RESULTS: Prevalence of AMS was 22 %, 23 %, and 48 % (ESQ-III ≥ 0. 7, LLSS ≥ 5, and LLSS ≥ 3, respectively) lower when compared with earlier studies. Risk factors for AMS were younger age, female sex, higher BMI, and smoking habit. Forty-two percent had elementary knowledge about the risk and prevention of AMS. Forty-four percent used acetazolamide. Trekkers took longer to climb from 3500 to 5400 m than in earlier studies. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of AMS continued to decline over a period of 24 years, likely as a result of slower ascent and increased use of acetazolamide. The AMS risk factors of younger age, female sex, and high BMI are consistent with prior studies. Awareness of risk and prevention of AMS remains low, indicating an opportunity to better educate trekkers and potentially further reduce AMS prevalence...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Purpose of the Study The basic {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the attitudes and {{opinions}} of community college personnel toward faculty involvement in policy formulation. Procedures The statistical and subjective data for this study were obtained from two major sources. (1) A <b>statistical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was developed to identify and obtain the present faculty involvement and the "desired" faculty involvement in policy formulation in three selected public community colleges of Oregon and was distributed to community college administrators and full-time teaching faculty, and (2) A personal on-campus visitation and interview was conducted by the writer with each respondent to obtain additional subjective data pertaining to faculty involvement. Findings Statistical data indicated that within the present community college organizational structure, faculty do have opportunity to be involved in and to become more involved in policy formulation. Subjective data supported the statistical findings and also revealed that faculty are in the process of changing from their "traditional" no-involvement role to one of becoming increasingly more active in community college governance. Recommendations The study recommends that changes be made in the internal organizational pattern of community college operations if faculty are to be further involved and are to realize their potential in more meaningful policy formulation. The community college is on the "cutting edge" of education and because of this, must help to modify or change the "traditional" beliefs in education that have tended to hinder and to slow down the progress of and to cloud over the creative thoughts and deeds of educational personnel.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of district heat supply using the realistic example of the KRB Gundremmingen boiling-water reactor. In its final construction this nuclear power plant is layed out to produce a total power output of 2870 MW$_{gross}$ with comprising blocks A, Band C; block A of a capacity of 250 MW has been operating since 1967. The area to be supplied {{is located in the}} Federal State of Bavaria, situated to the right and left of the Danube river, and comprises the districts of Dillingen and Günzburg. It involves 8 placesi the total number of population amounts to 55, 000. Maximum straight-line distances from the nuclear power station are around 10 km in north-east direction, and around 15 km in southwest direction. The following was made use of to calculate the heat demand for the area considered:a <b>statistical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to determine the annual heat consumption and the connection data for residential buildings, official buildings, commercial buildings and industrial plants to be filled in by the various communities; town-maps; the Bavarian Municipal Statistics of 1970 with the results of a building and dwelling census taken on October 25, 1968, results of a non-agricultural workplace census taken on May 27, 1970, and results of a population census taken on May 27, 1970, as weil as a final local inspection. The results show that some places indicate characters that are in favour of district heat supply. However, the heat price is adversely affected by the narrow road configuration in the ancient town centers, the low consumption of heat resulting from the small number of inhabitants, as weil as the large distances from the power station. The advanced projection of blocks B and C does no longer permit a thermodynamically meaningful extraction of heat from the power station, so that the advantage of cheap nuclear heat thus is partly lost again. Added to this is the fact that, due to the activity in the direct-cycle unit of the boilingwater reactor, the heat exchangers for district heat extraction fall into the controlled area, thus eventually impeding the licensing procedure. According to the calculations and estimated carried out, the heat price for residential heating expected at present are above those of individual central heating plants...|$|E
