40|$|At {{the heart}} of Oakton’s new {{strategic}} plan is the challenge of change. It’s the challenge of a world that changes so fast, so daily, and so profoundly all around us. It’s also the change that has been called for by this College community in and {{through the process of}} self-study. During the 2006 - 2007 academic year, we embarked in a new direction— reflecting, listening, and speaking about what matters most {{to the life of the}} College. The result is this <b>strategic</b> plan—a <b>blueprint</b> that is brave, courageous, bold, and responsive to the many challenges of change that confront us as a learning community. Approved by the Board of Trustees in March 2007, the nine overarching goals, with their accompanying objectives, spell out the priorities we will share for the next five years. Each of the strategic goals calls us, in its own way, to be more mindful and, informed by fresh perspective, either to do new things or to do old things in new ways. As the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once noted, “The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order. ...|$|R

Since 1995, GAO has designated the department's business systems modernization efforts as high risk. One key to effectively modernizing DOD's systems environment and satisfying relevant legislative requirements is ensuring that business system investments comply with an enterprisewide <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint,</b> commonly called an enterprise architecture. For DOD's business systems modernization, it is developing and using a federated Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), which is a coherent family of parent and subsidiary architectures. GAO was requested to determine whether key Department of the Navy business systems modernization programs comply with DOD's federated BEA. To determine this, GAO examined the BEA compliance assessments, certifications, and approvals for selected Navy programs against relevant guidance. ...|$|E
40|$|Yun Sun {{argues that}} China’s policy {{failures}} on Myanmar in 2011 {{are rooted in}} several strategic post-election misjudgements. Following President Thein Sein’s inauguration in March 2011, the Sino–Myanmar relationship was initially boosted by {{the establishment of a}} “comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership,” and China sought reciprocation for its long-time diplomatic support in the form of Myanmar’s endorsement of China’s positions on regional multilateral forums. A series of events since August have frustrated China’s aspirations, however, including Myanmar’s suspension of the Myitsone dam and the rapid improvement of its relationship with the West. Several strategic misjudgements contributed to China’s miscalculations, including on the democratic momentum of the Myanmar government, on the U. S. –Myanmar engagement and on China’s political and economic influence in the country. China’s previous definition of Myanmar as one of China’s “few loyal friends” and the foundation of its <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint</b> has been fundamentally shaken, and China is recalibrating its expectations regarding future policies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis speaks {{directly}} to the literature that assess the links between distinctive political regimes and the media. But rather than using normative expectations or current afflictions from the political regime or the emerging media system in new democracies as a entry point into the study, this research builds {{on the notion of}} ‘political-media complex’ (Swanson 1992, 1997) to centre the analysis on three institutional factors: (1) the rules that institutions enforce to give order; (2) the organizational dynamic that institutions impose over individuals’ roles, and; (3) the patterns of change and tendencies that institutions take from but also inflict on historical rules and practices. Drawing on the analysis of interviews with government communicators that served {{at the outset of the}} Mexican democracy (2000 - 2006) and on a supportive document research of official documents, the thesis shows that ‘thinking institutionally’ about the state-media relation allows a better understanding of how formal rules, bureaucratic structures, managerial strategies and certain professionalization patterns of the political communication mould this interaction. Less evident but equally relevant is the influence that informal arrangements impose on this interaction. It cannot simply be assumed that proscriptions (statutory regulation, formal rules and written norms) always dictate the behaviour of those involved in the state-media relation. Beliefs, attitudes and common practices are also relevant to disentangle the links between rules and actions. Similarly, budgets, organizational charts and <b>strategic</b> communications <b>blueprints</b> set certain parameters for government communicators. But it cannot be expected that these can be implemented without hesitation. Past routines, practices and understandings also influence the way in which Mexican governing cadres manage their relationships with the media. But as seen in this thesis, the past marks the present in a variety of ways contesting the broad and traditional conception about the burden that authoritarianism imposes over new democracies...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{management}} {{and the development of}} the destination’s capacity of the intellectual skills needed to use tourism as an effective tool in the search for regeneration and development are central themes explored within this paper. The authors have lived and worked with the problems inherent in short term funding of special projects designed to achieve or facilitate tourism development. We have witnessed with growing sadness the results – and the lack of them – as funding cycles end and staff with experience move away. Development processes require multi-stakeholder involvement at all levels, bringing together governments, NGOs, residents, industry and professionals in a partnership that determines the amount and kind of tourism that a community wants (Sirakaya et al., 2001). Planners need to provide knowledge sharing mechanisms to residents, visitors, industry and other stakeholders in order to raise public and political awareness. We note an absence of literature relating to the capacity of communities to learn from short-term funded projects that inherently are destined to provide a <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint</b> for destination development and in most cases regeneration through community-based tourism action. ...|$|E
40|$|Joe Sax {{made his}} ideas matter. He had {{consequential}} ideas that shaped an entire field—in his case, environmental law—both {{in theory and}} in practice. His scholarship was first rate and has enduring significance in academia, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that two of his law review articles are among the 100 most frequently cited articles of all time. Others are more competent to review the importance of his scholarship; my experience in environmental advocacy is more pertinent to evaluating his impact on environmental policymaking. Here, his ideas have had a greater impact than any other legal academic. As the New York Times observed in the opening sentence of its obituary for Professor Sax, he “helped shape environmental law in the United States and fueled the environmental movement. ” As environmental law historian Richard Lazarus put it, Sax “provided much of the <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint</b> followed by the environmental public interest groups,” which is still followed more than fifty years after he began his career at the University of Colorado Law School in 1962. How did a self-effacing, erudite, bookish professor come to have such an impact...|$|E
40|$|Although the Modi Government {{is seeking}} to enhance its {{strategic}} position with the defence budget’s focus on military modernisation, this paper argues that it effectively preserves the status quo by continuing to focus its strategic orientation on Pakistan. Summary The Modi Government is trying to advance its strategic position by enhancing its diplomatic reach, but internally, the defence allocation has focussed on Foreign Direct Investment, modernising the armed services and fine-tuning their priorities. In the early 2000 s, the government saw {{the need to have}} a <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint</b> for defence spending and planning. To achieve this, it announced such policy initiatives as a Defence Procurement Procedure in 2002, a Defence Offsets Policy in 2006, a Long-Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP) in 2009 and a Defence Production Policy in 2011. Eight committees/task forces were set up to look into various aspects of national defence, but no White Paper was ever produced. It is a situation that continues to this day. Key points 	The July 2014 Union Budget sets the military’s allocation at US$ 38. 35 billion and raises the foreign investment limit in the domestic defence industry from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, to boost modernisation. 	The defence budget accounts for 1. 78 % of GDP and 12. 76 % of total central government expenditure. 	Although the Modi Government {{is seeking to}} enhance its strategic position with the defence budget’s focus on military modernisation, it effectively preserves the status quo by continuing to focus its strategic orientation on Pakistan. 	Without some attempt to sketch a Defence White Paper, the defence budget is not able to explicitly reflect India’s strategic orientation and priorities...|$|E
40|$|Aim/Purpose: Countries today {{strategically}} pursue {{regional development}} and economic diversification {{to compete in}} the world market. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are at the crux of this political strategy. The paper reviews how HEIs can propel regional socio-economic growth and development by way of research innovation and entrepreneurship. Background: Offering an academic perspective about the role of HEIs using the Penta Helix innovation network for business and social innovation, the paper discusses opportunities and challenges in gestating an innovation culture. It likewise seeks, identifies and details strategies and workable programs. Methodology: Best-practice innovation campaigns initiated by Omani HEIs in collaboration with capstone programs organized by the government were parsed from selected local and international literature. The study includes a causal analysis of innovation information contained in 40 out of 44 published OAAA Quality Audit reports about HEIs from 2009 to 2016. The best-practice programs serve as success indicators and will be used as a field metric effect a Penta Helix blueprint for innovation. Contribution: The paper discusses how HEIs can engender, nurture, drive, and sustain innovation and entrepreneurial activity by using an innovation <b>strategic</b> <b>blueprint</b> like the Penta Helix model. It gathers together the recent historical attempts at promoting innovation by HEIs. It likewise suggests the creation of a network channel to allow key players in the innovation network to share innovation information and to collaborate with each other. Furthermore, it contributes to the development of innovation culture in HEIs. Findings: Expectations run high in academia. For one, universities believe that all innovations embryonically begin within their halls. Universities–too–believe it is naturally incumbent on them to stimulate and advance innovation despite that most innovation programs are initiated by the government in Oman. HEI engagement is perceivably still weak. HEIs have yet to come out as a strong leading force in promoting systems of innovation. There is clear awareness of the need to adopt leading-edge practices in innovation strategy and management, curriculum and assessment, staff support and reward systems, funding and ICT infrastructure, research commercialization and IP management, and community engagement. Recommendations for Practitioners: There is need to conduct more in-depth analyses about the synergy and partnerships between key players of the Penta Helix model. A large-scale survey will help completely reveal the status and impact of innovation practices in the region and among HEIs. Recommendation for Researchers: 	There is need to conduct more in-depth analyses about the synergy and partnerships between key players of the Penta Helix model. A large-scale survey will help completely reveal the status and impact of innovation practices in the region and among HEIs. Impact on Society: The paper hopes to influence policy. It fully intends to convince policymakers increase the adoption of strategic interventions. The paper is not a theoretical description of the problem. It suggests several concrete courses of action. Future Research: The paper has seen the need to measure the effectiveness of the current innovation practices among key players in the innovation network and how these practices advance Oman’s knowledge economy. We propose a Likert-based bottom-up engagement metric...|$|E
