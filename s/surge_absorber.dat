40|$|Their {{combination}} of large continuous energy ratings and very large time constants allows supercapacitors {{to be used}} in surge protection circuits. This fact, supported by recent research publications and laboratory tests, has assisted the authors to propose a new surge protection circuit topology known as the supercapacitor-assisted <b>surge</b> <b>absorber</b> (SCASA). This technique utilizes a multi-winding transformer, common surge protector devices such as metal oxide Varistors (MOV) and/or semiconductor types combined with a supercapacitor sub-circuit to absorb part of the surge energy usually expected to dissipate within the MOV or the semiconductor. The paper presents design details and test results for a differential mode surge protector based on the SCASA technique where the test device was subjected to lightning-type surges defined in international standards for Class-A and Class B type protectors. The performance of a prototype based on Class-B waveforms of up to 6. 6 kV surges generated from a lightning surge simulator are discussed in the paper. Its performance is compared with two commercially available surge protectors...|$|E
50|$|After {{the death}} of his elder brother, Vincent became heir apparent. When he {{returned}} from military service in 1921, Vincent joined Ferranti as a manager in the transformer department. Vincent jointly developed and patented <b>surge</b> <b>absorbers</b> to protect transformers from lightning strikes, which aided Ferranti's ability to produce high voltage transformers for export. In 1904 Dr Ferranti lost control of his company when it went into voluntary receivership, and after restructuring in 1905 he only held 10% of the shares.This resulted in him being effectively excluded from company business by the receiver managers until 1922, when a share restructuring meant that he and Vincent held 29% of the total equity allowing them to regain control of the company. However, it wasn't until 1928 that Dr Ferranti became chairman again.|$|R
40|$|Surge voltage {{distribution}} {{across a}} power transformer winding due to appearance of very fast rise transient overvoltages (VFTO) such as lightning surges consists of high voltage oscillations and the voltage distribution {{along the length}} of the winding can be highly non-uniform. In order to make the voltage distribution more uniform {{along the length of}} winding under these conditions, a method has been explored as an alternate to the conventional methods that are being used presently. This method consists of providing suitably designed metal oxide varistors (metal oxide <b>surge</b> <b>absorbers)</b> across sections of winding. The voltage - current characteristic of metal oxide varistor (MOV) is given by V = KIβ, where K and β are the constants of MOV. Experimental investigations have been carried out on a transformer model winding with MOVs provided across fifty percent and hundred percent of winding length to investigate surge voltage performance of these types of windings for appearance of lightning overvoltage (full impulse voltages) at line terminal of the model winding. Transformer windings with α values 5. 6, 11. 8 and 18. 9 have been analyzed. The oscillographic records obtained with presence of identical MOVs (MOVs having similar characteristic constants K and β) or non-identical MOVs (MOVs having different K value and similar β) across transformer winding sections show appreciable reduction in surge voltages across sections of winding as compared to that obtained without MOVs...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and study of materials exhibiting nonlinear electrical properties, known as varistors. The primary function of these materials is to sense and limit transient voltage surges {{in the range of}} kV and to do so repeatedly without being destroyed. However, one of the characteristics of present large-scale integrated technology is its low voltage operation. The working voltages of electronic devices are being lowered in order to reduce energy consumption. This means that <b>surge</b> <b>absorbers</b> for low voltage operation are necessary for stable operation of these devices. Thus, it is of fundamental importance the development of new materials with nonlinear resistance in the range of volts. For this purpose, we focused on the development of materials exhibiting a sandwich structure of ZnO/glass/ZnO. This particular structure comprises an alternative method for investigating a single grain boundary. The ZnO/ glass /ZnO samples were prepared by heating a sandwich structure with small amounts of borate glass powder between two Co-doped ZnO single crystals. The Co-doped ZnO single crystals were obtained by introducing Co-ions into undoped ZnO crystals by solid-state diffusion: the ZnO crystals were placed between two cobalt oxide ceramic pellets and heated at 950 ?C for 24 h. Bismuth, xBi 2 O 3 -(1 -x) B 2 O 3, and lead borate, xPbO-(1 -x) B 2 O 3, glasses were prepared from reagent grade powders of dried Bi 2 O 3, B 2 O 3 and PbCO 3, respectively, in a wide composition range 0 ? x ? 0. 80 by melt quenching technique. ZnO crystals and glasses were studied employing infrared and Raman spectroscopies. Analysis of mid infrared and Raman spectra provided information about the role of Βi 2 Ο 3 and PbO in the borate network. Meanwhile, analysis of the far infrared confirmed that both PbO and Βi 2 Ο 3 behave as network formers and network modifiers, which explains the extended glass forming ability of these glasses. Based on the results of the structural investigation, glasses with the following compositions were used for the preparation of the bicrystals: 0. 6 Bi 2 O 3 - 0. 4 B 2 O 3 0. 75 Bi 2 O 3 - 0. 25 B 2 O 3 and 0. 6 PbO- 0. 4 B 2 O 3. The first results of the electrical characterization showed that ZnO single crystals, and thus the bicrystals, were exhibiting linear electrical properties. However, the appearance of the desired nonlinearity was accomplished after Co-doping the single crystals. In the last part the electrical characterization of glasses and sandwich structures took place through impedance spectroscopy. The results for glasses showed that for contents lower than 50 mol%, they can be regarded as pure insulators. The electrical properties of ZnO varistors were studied through dc techniques. For all the varistors measured, the I-V characteristics revealed that breakdown behavior could be observed at the bias voltage of 3 V. Moreover, most of the sandwich structures exhibited asymmetric I-V relationships, probably due to the formation of asymmetric potential barriers at the ZnO grain boundary. In conclusion, all composites materials developed during this study are characterized by chemical durability and reproducibility. Furthermore, these structures could be used as <b>surge</b> <b>absorbers</b> for low voltage operation which is the primary objective of this work. ...|$|R
