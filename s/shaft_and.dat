5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|The motmots have {{colorful}} plumage and long, graduated tails {{which they}} display by waggling back and forth. In {{most of the}} species, the barbs near {{the ends of the}} two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off, leaving a length of bare <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> creating a racket-shaped tail.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ef: The First Tale, a manga based on the overall story was {{serialized}} between 2005 and 2015 starting in Dengeki Comic Gao, but later transferred to Dengeki Daioh. In addition, a light novel was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq from July 2006 to July 2008. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled Ef: A Tale of Memories was produced by <b>Shaft</b> <b>and</b> aired between October and December 2007. A second season of the anime titled Ef: A Tale of Melodies aired 12 episodes between October and December 2008.|$|E

5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road <b>Shaft),</b> <b>and</b> underneath the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. In addition, {{in preparation for the}} tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three-passenger branches.

5|$|Calhoun regains {{consciousness}} at {{the bottom}} of the <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek <b>Shaft</b> <b>and</b> the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both hangars, damaged one propeller <b>shaft,</b> <b>and</b> gave her a 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} suffered substantial damage {{during the}} 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor twisted in a corkscrew fashion. On {{the top three}} floors, 80percent of the perimeter walls were damaged. A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor. An elevator <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured. There were no injuries but {{it was estimated that}} the repairs would cost $6million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{then went}} to Maine and the Virginia Capes for battle practice, after which {{she went into the}} Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, Connecticut emerged on 15 January 1915 and steamed south to Cuba, where she {{conducted}} training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> forcing her return to Philadelphia for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the United States Marine Corps for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August as part of the US occupation of Haiti. Connecticut delivered supplies to amphibious troops in Cap-Haïtien on 5 September and remained near Haiti for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from Connecticut under the command of Major Smedley Butler. After departing Haiti, Connecticut arrived in Philadelphia on 15 December and was placed into the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.|$|E

Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive <b>Shaft,</b> <b>and</b> that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method where, after glutaraldehyde fixation, human hair <b>shafts</b> <b>and</b> insect cuticles are treated with ammonium thioglycolate (ATG) to improve ultrastructural staining. Conventional transmission electron microscopic (TEM) preparations do not distinguish the A-layer and the exocuticles of hair shafts. However, after ATG treatment, the A-layer appears in higher contrast. ATG treatment has also been used to observe the fibrillar structure in the cortex. In the cuticle of beetles, the epicuticle is stained by ATG. Alth ough the human hair <b>shaft</b> (keratin) <b>and</b> insect cuticle (chitin) are composed of different materials, both can be reduced by the ATG solution. The ammonium in the ATG solution reacts with hair <b>shafts</b> <b>and</b> insect cuticles, causing a reduction of swelled cuticles. Therefore, ATG not only stains, but also reduces human hair <b>shafts</b> <b>and</b> the cuticles of beetles. </p...|$|R
