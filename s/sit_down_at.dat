25|$|Mormarevi Brothers {{started their}} {{collaboration}} writing feuilletons for Starshel (Hornet) newspaper, a Bulgarian weekly paper of humour and satire. Their work method was to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{a table in}} Yomtov's small kitchen and figure out subjects and characters while playing cards. Afterwards, they would alternate on the typewriter, but often Stoychev did more of this work.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot by}} {{director}} Yuri Kanchiku. It depicts miwa {{in a dark room}} with several free-standing doorways. Whenever miwa travels through one of the doorways, she comes into the same room set up differently. The first time, it is set up for a frivolous banquet, with many different people dressed formally. The second time she enters it, the room is set up {{as if it were a}} busy park sidewalk, with many people dressed in work clothes ignoring her. She decides to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a park bench. miwa later finds a birdcage, and the scene switches to depicting her trapped inside the birdcage, with the floor littered with sheet music.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E

500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, {{and no one would}} know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{began to}} write and record new {{material}} at the sessions. According to Hudson, [...] "We were doing seven, eight, ten, sometimes fifteen songs a day. Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along. ... We'd play the melody, he'd sing a few words he'd written, and then make up some more, or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along. It's a pretty good way to write songs." [...] Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "Bob and Robbie, they would come by every day, five to seven days a week, for seven to eight months." [...] Hudson added, [...] "It amazed me, Bob's writing ability. How he would come in, <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the typewriter, and write a song. And what was amazing was that {{almost every one of}} those songs was funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my table with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E

500|$|Melissa Rosenberg {{had been}} working on {{adapting}} the novel prior to Twilights release and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilights opening weekend in November 2008. [...] "I would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> ten o'clock in the morning and work on ... until six o'clock in the evening." [...] Rosenberg spent the months of October though June 2008 alternating between writing for the Showtime television series Dexter, and writing New Moon on weekends. She and Meyer kept in touch during this five-month period. One of the key changes the screenwriter made while adapting the book was the decision to take Edward's voice in Bella's head and make it visual. This change caused the first confrontation between the two main characters, one an [...] "apparition", to be emotional. For the screenplay, the four men who Bella approaches needed to create a significant and dangerous situation, and so Rosenberg gave these men motorcycles. [...] "I added the motorcycles, [...] because... they became an important part of [...] relationship with Jacob." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her last}} years, Bond entertained wounded World War I servicemen, {{playing the piano}} and singing at a south coast home for {{disabled}} soldiers and sailors. [...] An obituary in The Evening Standard reported: [...] "Every day {{for more than a}} year, until just recently, she was taken out in her wheelchair. [...] After a breath of sea air ... she would always go into her favourite hotel for a drink and would often <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the piano and entertain the company with some of her old Gilbert and Sullivan tunes. [...] She often used to go to a home for wounded ex-servicemen of the last war [...] would give an impromptu entertainment, playing and singing her old songs. [...] She liked to go to parties and would always play and sing." [...] The Worthing Gazette stated that Bond continued to be much loved in her later years, and people came to see her from all over Britain to pay homage in her old age. The Worthing Herald wrote: [...] "Despite her great age, Miss Bond preserved a quick and active mind, and hated to be fussed over." ...|$|E
500|$|The Simpson family {{visits a}} home and garden show where they decide to {{purchase}} a hot tub. They spend hours soaking in the tub and become so relaxed that they forget to visit Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson at a family event. Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub, scolding them for ignoring him. Homer decides {{to make up for}} their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now yuppies who have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the pub and start drinking while Marge, Bart and Lisa visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, the Guinness brewery and Dublin.|$|E

Both drummer Don Powell and Holder rate it as their favourite Slade long player. In a 1987 interview, Holder said: [...] "That {{is the only one}} I can really <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> home and listen to from start to finish." [...] In a 1976 interview, Lea said: [...] "I am really proud of the album and believe it is the best album we have ever done. I have no especial favourite track on the album - I love them all. I'm sure you will see quite an American influence on a lot of the tracks and we believe the hard work we put in, in America had paid dividends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christmas {{dinner is}} the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table.

After that, the family members kiss {{each other on the}} cheek saying, [...] "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." [...] The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the pečenica. During the dinner, the head of household proposes a toast to his family with a glass of wine, several times. A traditional toast from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina goes like this: ...|$|E

2500|$|Caroline {{was brought}} up with an extreme degree of {{seclusion}} from contact with the opposite sex even for her own time. She was reportedly constantly supervised by her governess and elder ladies, restricted to her room when the family was entertaining guests and ordered to keep away from the windows. She was normally refused permission to attend balls and court functions, and when allowed, she was forbidden to dance. Abbé Baron commented {{during the winter of}} 1789–90: [...] "She is supervised with the greatest severity, as they claim she is already aware of what she is missing. I doubt if the torches of hymen will illuminate for her. Although always attired with style and elegance, she is never allowed to dance", and that as soon as the first dance begun, she was forced to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the whist table with three old ladies. A rare occasion was the wedding of her elder brother Charles, when she was finally allowed to dance, though only with her brother, the groom, and her new brother-in-law, the Prince of Orange – she was, however, still forbidden to dine alone with her brother.|$|E
