5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E

Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming." [...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... really don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E

60|$|Many <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{were told}} in the cave, but they found no credit with Why-Why. When he was but ten years old, his inquiring spirit showed itself in the {{following}} remarkable manner. He had always been informed that a serpent {{was the mother of}} his race, and that he must treat serpents with the greatest reverence. To kill one was sacrilege. In spite of this, he stole out unobserved and crushed a viper which had stung his little brother. He noticed that no harm ensued, and this encouraged him to commit a still more daring act. None but the old men and the warriors were allowed to eat oysters. It was universally held that if a woman or a child touched an oyster, the earth would open and swallow the culprit. Not daunted by this prevalent belief, Why-Why one day devoured no less than four dozen oysters, opening the shells with a flint spear-head, which he had secreted in his waist-band. The earth did not open and swallow him as he had swallowed the oysters, and from that moment he became suspicious of all the ideas and customs imposed by the old men and wizards.|$|E
60|$|Brothers, that slave {{who carried}} the arm into the {{presence}} of the master was my father. He was a brave man. And even as his mother secretly taught him to read, so did he teach me. Because he died shortly after from the pick-handle beating, Roger Vanderwater took me out of the slave pen and tried to make various better things out of me. I might have become an overseer in Hell's Bottom, but I chose to become a story-teller, wandering over the land and getting close to my brothers, the slaves, everywhere. And I tell you <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> secretly, knowing that you will not betray me; for if you did, {{you know as well as}} I that my tongue will be torn out and that I shall tell stories no more. And my message is, brothers, that there is a good time coming, when all will be well in the world and there will be neither masters nor slaves. But first you must prepare for that good time by learning to read. There is power in the printed word. And here am I to teach you to read, and as well there are others to see that you get the books when I am gone along upon my way--the history books wherein you will learn about your masters, and learn to become strong even as they.|$|E

50|$|Thus, an original, {{and perhaps}} the most famous cephalophore is Denis, patron saint of Paris, who, {{according}} to the Golden Legend, miraculously preached with {{his head in his hands}} while journeying the seven miles from Montmartre to his burying place. Although St Denis is the best known of the saintly head-carriers, there were many others; the folklorist Émile Nourry counted no less than 134 examples of cephalophory in French hagiographic literature alone. Given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval Europe, <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> in which a saint clearly indicates his or her chosen burial site, may have developed as a way of discouraging such acts of furta sacra.|$|E
5000|$|One of the anecdotal and {{possibly}} apocryphal tales told {{in support of}} Mountbatten pink {{was the story of}} the cruiser HMS Kenya (nicknamed [...] "The Pink Lady" [...] at the time due to her Mountbatten pink paint), which during Operation Archery covered a commando raid against installations on Vågsøy Island off the Norwegian coast. The Germans fired on the Kenya for several minutes with coastal guns but she sustained only minor damage from near misses. This was attributed to her Mountbatten pink camouflage blending in with the pink marker dye the Germans were using in their shells, preventing German spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and the ship. <b>Stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and personal experience of ships with the colour disappearing from view, made crews of ships with the colour notable supporters.|$|E

But as long as such legends remain in these hermit lives, told with as much gravity as any other portion of the biography, and eloquently lauded, as this deed is, by Bishop Theodoret, as proofs of the holiness and humanity of the saint, an honest author is bound to notice some of them at least, and not to give an alluring and really dishonest account of these men and their times, by detailing every anecdote which can elevate them {{in the mind of}} the reader, while he carefully omits all that may justly disgust him.|$|R
50|$|The reliefs there {{range from}} whole stories to just simple depictions of {{everyday}} life. Three {{of the major}} reliefs on the building were the Arjunawiwaha, Sri Tanjung, and Babuksha and Gagang Aking. Some smaller stories were usually ones with morals and quick lessons. A couple examples would be “Crocodile and Bull,” “Heron, Fish, and Crab,” and “Frog and Snake.” In the “Heron, Fish, and Crab” story, the characters learn a very valuable lesson. The bird in the story is wearing a headdress to try to disguise himself as a shaman {{so that he can}} go and catch fish. He starts examining three fish when he is attacked by the crab that starts to pinch his neck. The crab sees that the heron has disguised himself to confuse the fish so he pinched him to death.

5000|$|Here is {{an example}} of a {{positive}} expertise prediction with a negative outcome and a positive remark: Nancy and her friend Jane were planning a trip to the beach. [...] "The weather should be nice tomorrow," [...] said Jane, who worked for a local TV station as a meteorologist. The next day was a cold and stormy one. As she looked out the window, Nancy said, [...] "This is certainly beautiful weather." [...] Participants read <b>stories</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> but also with no expertise predictions, negative predictions, or negative remarks. Glucksberg found that when the final remark matched the outcome, participants interpreted no sarcasm. Positive remarks about negative outcomes were interpreted as more sarcastic than negative remarks to positive outcomes, but the influence of an explicit victim was not reliably greater for negative remarks. This suggests that people judge remarks as sarcastic when it is obviously false to the speaker and listener.|$|E
