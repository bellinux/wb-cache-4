A lattice is distributive {{if and only if}} it doesn't have a sublattice isomorphic to M3 or N5.

25|$|The Mustang Bullitt {{returned}} in February 2008, {{a variant of}} the Mustang GT, the last version of which was produced in 2001. It is reminiscent of the Dark Highland Green GT-390 fastback Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. Available in Dark Highland Green or Black exterior paint without spoiler and GT fender emblems; the faux gas cap on the deck lid is replaced by a unique Bullitt version. The Mustang GT's standard fog light-equipped grille is replaced with a specially designed pony-less style grille highlighted by an aluminium accent. Dark Argent Gray 18-inch cast-aluminum euro-flange wheels are used with matching brake calipers and larger, 3.5inch exhaust tips replace the Mustang GT's standard 3 inch tips. Although side (quarter) window louvers (as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>picture)</b> are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E

25|$|The Nechacco (which {{would later}} be renamed the Chilco <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> at top of page) joined the Charlotte and the Quesnel in May 1909. She was built by Donald McPhee for the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company of South Fort George and was piloted by Captain John Bonser, an {{experienced}} swiftwater pilot from the Skeena River. The Nechacco {{would be the first}} sternwheeler to navigate the treacherous Grand Canyon of the Fraser. The Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company then built the Fort Fraser which pioneered the route to Tête Jaune Cache in 1910 and like the Chilco, she also made several trips on the Nechako River for Frank Swannell that summer. She would also be piloted by Captain Bonser, with Captain George Ritchie taking command of the Chilco for {{the latter part of the}} 1910 season of navigation. Unfortunately the Chilco would be lost in April 1911, torn apart in the icy waters of the Fraser near the Cottonwood Canyon. To compete against the BC Express Company's sternwheelers, the Fort George Lumber and Trading Company built a third sternwheeler, again by Donald McPhee in 1910, the Chilcotin. She was piloted by Captain Arthur Frances Dogherty.|$|E
2500|$|A proper Moribana design uses a flat, shallow container, {{sometimes}} referred to as suiban, which allows for [...] the spreading of floral and line materials sideways and away from the earlier classic vertical lines of the Rikka,Shoka,Oseika, and even Nageire. The complex design <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Picture</b> 1 is the definitive expression of Banmi Shofu Ryu, depicting the characteristic use of Filipino and Hawaiian driftwood in arrangements depicting nature. The entire composition tells a story. Here the two driftwood pieces, a hardwood and a bamboo, connect with each other representing friendship, and the tropical flowers accentuating the lines of the design with height, color, density, and position with other line and floral materials. The blue furoshiki (cloth used for wrapping gifts and items in Japan) represents the Pacific Ocean. Stories that come with Banmi Shofu designs can be expressed in haiku, and for this moribana kansuike, the haiku goes: [...] Osawa calm through thousand years flower acceptance free there not here… ...|$|E
