25|$|The first verse of the <b>Shema</b> is recited aloud, {{simultaneously}} by the hazzan and the congregation, which {{responds with}} the rabbinically instituted Baruch Shem ("Blessed be the Name") in silence before continuing {{the rest of}} <b>Shema.</b> Only on Yom Kippur is this response said aloud. The remainder of the <b>Shema</b> is read in silence. Sephardim recite {{the whole of the}} <b>Shema</b> aloud, except the Baruch Shem. Reform Jews also recite the whole of the first paragraph of the <b>Shema</b> aloud.|$|E
25|$|Roi Klein (d. 2006), a {{major in}} the IDF, said the <b>Shema</b> before jumping on a live grenade to save his fellow soldiers, in {{accordance}} with the traditional Jewish practice of reciting the <b>Shema</b> when one believes one is going to die.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Akiva patiently endured {{while his}} flesh was being torn with iron combs, and died reciting the <b>Shema.</b> He {{pronounced}} {{the last word}} of the sentence, Eḥad ("one") with his last breath (Talmud Berachot 61b). Since then, it has been traditional for Jews to say the <b>Shema</b> as their last words.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, {{women are}} not {{required}} to recite the <b>Shema</b> (as a command from the Torah), as with other time-bound requirements which might impinge on their traditional familial obligations, although they are obligated to pray at least once daily without a specific liturgy requirement and many fulfill that obligation through prayers like the <b>Shema.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>Shema</b> {{has also}} been {{incorporated}} in Christian liturgy, and is {{discussed in terms of}} the Trinity. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer in use in Canada since 1962, has included the <b>Shema</b> in its Summary of the Law. Since 2012, when the Anglican Use version of the BCP was adapted for use in Canada, it has been recited by Roman Catholics as well.|$|E

25|$|The exhortation by the Kohen ("priest") {{in calling}} Israel to arms against an enemy (which {{does not apply}} when the Temple in Jerusalem is not standing) also {{includes}} <b>Shema</b> Yisrael. (Deuteronomy 20:3; Talmud Sotah 42a).|$|E

25|$|Maimonedes {{warned that}} special objects (such as the mezuzah) and special prayers (such as the <b>shema)</b> are {{intended}} to remind people of love for God and his precepts and do not in themselves guarantee good fortune (they are not to become idols).|$|E
25|$|In Parade, {{a musical}} based on true events, the main {{character}} Leo Frank, wrongly accused {{of the murder of}} a child worker at the pencil factory he manages, recites the <b>Shema</b> Yisrael as a vigilante gang kidnap and hang him in the final scenes of the work.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the Talmud {{points out}} that subtle {{references}} to the Ten Commandments {{can be found in}} the three portions. As the Ten Commandments were removed from daily prayer in the Mishnaic period (70-200 CE), the <b>Shema</b> is seen as an opportunity to commemorate the Ten Commandments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Shema</b> Yisrael prayer also {{commands}} the Israelites to write God's commandments on their hearts (Deut. 6:6); {{the shape of}} the letter Shin mimics the structure of the human heart: the lower, larger left ventricle (which supplies the full body) and the smaller right ventricle (which supplies the lungs) are positioned like the lines of the letter Shin.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} of the tractate (Perek I-III) address {{the subject of the}} recitation of <b>Shema,</b> a biblical command that constitutes the acceptance of the yoke of Heaven, to be performed twice per day. Topics discussed include when to say it, how to say it and possible exemptions from the fulfillment of this mitzvah ("commandment").|$|E
25|$|Some {{also have}} the custom to read all three paragraphs, along with {{a whole list of}} {{sections}} from Psalms, Tachanun, and other prayers. Altogether this is known as the K'riat <b>Shema</b> she-al ha-mitah. According to Arizal, reading this prayer with great concentration is also effective in cleansing one from sin. This is discussed in the Tanya.|$|E
25|$|While the uncompromising {{theological}} monotheism at {{the heart}} of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major Christian denominations which subscribe to Trinitarian theology, Christian Unitarianism is analogous to the monotheistic concept of God in Judaism as declared in the <b>Shema</b> Yisrael, the Jewish declaration of faith. It is also analogous to Tawhid, the indivisible oneness concept of monotheism in Islam.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} common {{practice}} is {{the statement of}} the absolute unity of God, which Muslims observe in their five times daily prayers (salat), and Jews state at least twice (<b>Shema</b> Yisrael), along with praying 3 times daily. The two faiths also share the central practices of fasting and almsgiving, as well as dietary laws {{and other aspects of}} ritual purity.|$|E
25|$|Barechu, {{the formal}} public call to prayer, {{introduces}} {{a series of}} expanded blessings embracing the recitation of the <b>Shema.</b> This {{is followed by the}} core of the prayer service, the Amidah or Shemoneh Esreh, a series of 19 blessings. The next part of the service, is Tachanun, supplications, which is omitted on days with a festive character (and by Reform services usually entirely).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Shema</b> {{section of}} the Friday night service varies in some details from the weekday services—mainly in the {{different}} ending of the Hashkivenu prayer and the omission of Baruch Adonai le-Olam prayer in those traditions where this section is otherwise recited. In the Italian rite, there are also {{different versions of the}} Ma'ariv 'aravim prayer (beginning asher killah on Friday nights) and the Ahavat 'olam prayer.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the priests recited the Ten Commandments daily. The Gemara, however, taught that {{although}} the Sages wanted to recite the Ten Commandments along with the <b>Shema</b> in precincts outside of the Temple, they soon abolished their recitation, because the Sages {{did not want to}} lend credence to the arguments of the heretics (who might argue that Jews honored only the Ten Commandments).|$|E
25|$|The letter Shin {{is often}} {{inscribed on the}} case {{containing}} a mezuzah, a scroll of parchment with Biblical text written on it. The text contained in the mezuzah is the <b>Shema</b> Yisrael prayer, which calls the Israelites to love their God with all their heart, soul and strength. The mezuzah is situated upon all the doorframes in a home or establishment. Sometimes the whole word Shaddai will be written.|$|E
25|$|The new {{official}} Bulgarian {{system does}} not allow for unambiguous mapping back into Cyrillic, since unlike most other systems it does not distinguish between ъ and а (both rendered as a). It also does not distinguish between the digraph values of =ж>, =ш> and the value of the same Roman strings in rendering accidental clusters of separate Cyrillic letters =зх> and =сх>, as they occur in words like изход (izhod) or схема (<b>shema).</b>|$|E
25|$|Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire {{takes place}} in the land of Shapeir, in the world of Gloriana.

25|$|According to halakha, all {{individual}} {{prayers and}} virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the Mishnah mentions that the <b>Shema</b> need not be said in Hebrew A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the others are prayers {{that are to be}} said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a priest, or by a reigning King.|$|E
25|$|The church runs {{ministries}} providing help to poor neighborhoods, {{care for}} children in need, and general community services. In cooperation with Alaska Family Services, the Salvation Army, and other area churches, the Wasilla Assembly of God distributed baskets to 39 families in Wasilla during Thanksgiving of 2005. The church also supplies food to the annual free Thanksgiving meal hosted by <b>Shema</b> Christian Ministries. The church established a teen youth learning center called Rally Point in 2006. Rally Point {{is located in the}} church's original building at Knik-Goose Bay Road.|$|E
