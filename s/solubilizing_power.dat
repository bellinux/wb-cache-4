40|$|An {{intravenous}} {{solution is}} a dosage forms intended for administration into the bloodstream. This route {{is the most}} rapid and the most bioavailable method of getting drugs into systemic circulation, and therefore {{it is also the}} most liable to cause adverse effects. In order to reduce the possibility of side effects and to ensure adequate clinical dosage of the formulation, the primarily formulated composition should be optimized. It is also important that the composition should retain its therapeutic effectiveness and safety throughout the shelf-life of the product. This paper focuses on the optimization and stability testing of a parenteral solution containing miconazole and ketoconazole solubilized with a ternary solvent system as model drugs. Optimization of the solvent system was performed based on assessing the risk/benefit ratio of the composition and its properties upon dilution. Stability tests were conducted based on the EMEA (European Medicines Agency) “guideline on stability testing: stability testing of existing active substances and related finished products”. Experiments show that both the amount of co-solvent and surface active agent of the solvent system could substantially be reduced, while still maintaining adequate <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power.</b> It is also shown that the choice of various containers affects the stability of the compositions. It was concluded that by assessing the risk/benefit ratio of <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> versus toxicity, the concentration of excipients could be considerably decreased while still showing a powerful solubilizing effect.

40|$|Mixed solvency, a {{new concept}} of {{solubilization}} states that all substances whether solids, liquids or gases possess <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> and hence concentrated solution containing various dissolved substances in any liquid can also improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs. Mixed solvency technique can be employed in injection formulation of poorly soluble drugs {{in order to reduce}} concentration of individual solubilizer (used for solubility enhancement) to minimize the toxic effects of solubilizers. For example in most of the methods of aqueous solubilization, high concentration of an additive (hydrotropic agent/cosolvents/surfactants/cyclodextrins etc.) is required to produce an appreciable increase in solubility of a poorly water soluble drug. In this case, the solubilizing agent employed to give a desirable solubility for the poorly soluble drug may produce its own toxicity. Similarly, the presence of several oil soluble additives (each in small concentration) in oil, forming a concentrated solution may enhance the oil solubility of a poorly oil soluble drug efficiently.

Such variations may be used to alter the structural charge Z 0 of the polar headgroup from 0. 8 to 2 without altering the surfactant molecule. Small angle neutron scattering coupled with the Hayter-Penfold analytical technique was used to measure the aggregation number N and the effective charge Z. The micelles are small and spherical for Z 0 = 2, increasing to larger ellipsoids as Z 0 is decreased to unity. For Z 0 = 0. 8, highly anisotropic micelles are formed. The effective surface charge density values lie in the range of 5 to 8 μC/cm 2 and were found to be consistent with a theoretical Poisson-Boltzmann cell model calculation.

Improvement in KS value for ternary complexes (IRB–βCD–polymers) clearly proved the benefit on the addition of water-soluble polymer to increase complexation efficiency. The dissolution rate of the drug from ternary systems containing PEG 4000 and PVP K- 90 was higher as compared to the binary system. An optimum increase in the dissolution rate of the drug was observed at a polymer concentration of 5 % w/w for PVP K- 90 and 10 % w/w for PEG 4000.

40|$|International audienceSix dialkyl {{glycerol}} ethers {{with short}} alkyl chains have been synthesized, and their solvo-surfactant properties have {{been compared to}} those of the mono- and trisubstituted isomers. The dialkyl ethers are completely miscible with water at room temperature, and some of them show a cloud point. In aqueous solution, they are much better solubilizers of Disperse Red 13 hydrophobic dye than the trialkyl ethers. They also have much lower boiling points than the isomeric monosubstituted counterparts. These features make the dialkyl glycerol ethers attractive for aqueous extraction of hydrophobic material. Their volatility allows an easier recovery of solute compared to when nonvolatile nonionic surfactants are used, as in the standard cloud point extraction (CPE) process. The effectiveness of the novel hydrotropic cloud point extraction (HCPE) method proposed in this work is illustrated by extraction of piperine from black pepper using an aqueous solution of 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl glycerol ether that is an attractive candidate in the series because of its ease of synthesis, volatility, middle-range cloud point, and high <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} aimed at the {{influence}} of ethanol on the complex formation of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) with oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA), two insoluble isomeric triterpenic acids. Phase solubility {{studies were carried out}} to evaluate the <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> of HP-β-CD, in association with ethanol, toward OA and UA. A mathematical model was applied to explain and predict the solubility of OA and UA influenced by HP-β-CD and ethanol. The solid complexes were prepared by evaporating the filtrate of samples which was prepared in different complexing media. The solubility of OA is much higher than that of UA in all the tested aqueous solutions. The solubility of OA and UA can be increased over 900 and 200 times, respectively, by forming complex with HP-β-CD. Ethanol (0. 5 %, v/v) can help the formation of OA-HP-β-CD complex, but is harmful to the formation of UA-HP-β-CD complex. Increasing solubility in water can be achieved by adding ethanol into the complexing media, but the concentration of ethanol should be optimized.

Hydrotropes include sodium 4 -alkylbenzenesulfonates 2 a - e, sodium 4 -methoxybenzenesulfonate 2 f, sodium 4 -hydroxybenzenesulfonate 2 g, cesium benzenesulfonate 3, benzamidinium chloride 4, phenyltrimethylammonium bromide 5 a, and benzyltrimethylammonium bromide 5 b. All hydrotropes, except 2 g, induce strong rate-retarding effects, indicative of strong interactions with 1 and of remarkably strong hydrophobic interactions between aromatic moieties. Most hydrotropes show neither spectroscopic nor kinetic evidence for cooperative aggregation in the concentration range studied, i. e., from 0 to 1. 4 mol kg- 1. Cooperative aggregation is absent because the hydrophobic moieties are too small for hydrophobic interactions to overcome electrostatic repulsion. Lack of aggregation results in high availability of hydrophobic binding sites, thereby accounting for the high <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> characteristic for hydrotropes. However, sodium 4 -n-propylbenzenesulfonate 2 d and sodium 4 -nbutylbenzenesulfonate 2 e show cooperative self-association forming highly dynamic loose micellar-type structures. ...|$|E

We observed that the polymer exhibits lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior and that above the cloud point (cp) of 17 °C the block copolymer self-assembles in micelles with a diameter of 40 nm. Flow cytometry analysis and confocal microscopy show a dose-dependent cellular uptake of the micelles loaded with a hydrophobic dye.

Prepared formulations were evaluated for self-emulsifying ability and phase diagrams were constructed to optimize the systems. System (S 6), prepared from Triton/Acconon/Labrafac, attained highest drug solubilization capacity, hence, was selected for the preparation of SSEDDS by adsorption on different nano-structured carriers (Neusilin®, Fujicalin® and F-melt®) in different ratios.

Solid binary systems of aripiprazole with CDs were prepared by kneading, microwave irradiation and freeze-drying techniques at 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 (drug to CD) molar ratios. Drug-CD physical mixtures were also prepared in the same molar ratios for comparison. The dissolution of aripiprazole-binary systems was carried out to select the most appropriate CD type, molar ratio and preparation technique. Results: Phase solubility study indicated formation of higher order complexes and the complexation efficiency values was higher for HP-β-CD compared to β-CD. Drug dissolution study revealed that aripiprazole dissolution was increased upon increasing the CD molar ratio and, the freeze-drying technique was superior to the other studied methods especially when combined with the HP-β-CD. The cyclodextrin type, preparation technique and molar ratio exhibited statistically significant effect on the drug dissolution at P≤ 0. 05.

Solid binary systems were prepared at various drug-polymer ratios by mixing or coprecipitation, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and tested for dissolution behavior. Both carriers improved drug dissolution and their performance depended on {{concentration of the}} hydrophilic carrier in coprecipitates. Tris was more effective than PVP, despite the amorphizing power of PVP as revealed by solid state analyses. Complete drug amorphiztion was attained at 1 ∶ 3 (wt/wt) drug: PVP, 25 % (wt/wt) ND in PVP. According to thermal behavior of ND and Tris, ND-Tris systems present a eutectic behavior. The eutectic composition was 30 % ND- 70 % Tris at ∼ 129 °C. Amorphous ND-PVP and eutectic ND-Tris mixtures showed an improvement of 5. 55 and 6. 6 times of drug dissolution efficiency, respectively. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that administration of 60 mg/kg of drug coprecipitated with PVP or Tris resulted, respectively, in a 50 % and 94 % reduction of acetic acid-induced writhings in comparison with pure drug, which, instead, was statistically ineffective {{as compared with the}} control group. Moreover, the eutectic mixture of ND-Tris demonstrated antiwrithing potency 1. 88 times higher than amorphous ND-PVP coprecipitate.

The aim of this in vitro study was to compare effects of Ca (OH) 2 and NaOCl in single and combination usage for this purpose. Methods and Materials: In this experimental study, five groups of 40 pieces of human umbilical cord samples were placed in 10 ml of different solvents for 1 wk. The weight of samples was adjusted to 0. 03 g. Experimental solvents included: 1) Calcium hydroxide solution (0. 6 g per ml), 2) 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite, 3) 5 % sodium hypochlorite, and 4) calcium hydroxide solution for 1 wk and then 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, 5) Normal saline.

MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O), by investigating their interactions in solution and solid state. Phase solubility studies were carried out to evaluate the <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> of β-cyclodextrin, in association with various auxiliary substances, to determine the apparent stability constant (KC) and complexation efficiency (CE) of complexes. Improvement in KC values for ternary complexes clearly proves the benefit of the addition of auxiliary substances to promote CE. Of all the approaches used, the use of polymer Plasdone S- 630 was found to be the most promising approach in terms of optimum CE and KC. GFZ–β-CD (1 : 1) binary and ternary systems were prepared by kneading and lyophilization methods. The ternary systems clearly signified superiority over binary systems in terms of CE, solubility, KC, and reduction in the formulation bulk. Optimized ternary system of GFZ–β-CD–Plasdone S- 630 prepared by using lyophilization method indicated a significant improvement in intrinsic dissolution rate when compared with ternary kneaded system. Differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance were carried out to characterize the binary and optimized ternary complex.

40|$|The {{complexation}} {{of drugs}} with alpha, beta, gamma and hydroxyethyl beta cyclodextrins was investigated using the solubility method described by Higuchi and Connors. Beta cyclodextrin {{was shown to}} exhibit the most extensive complexation. The solubility isotherms of complexation were studied at different temperatures and at various pH conditions. The effect of ionization of drugs on complexation was thus evaluated for four drugs viz phenytoin, diazepam, ibuprofen and hydrochlothiazide. In the case of phenytoin and diazepam, both the non-ionized and the ionized species were shown to form a complex with cyclodextrins. The slope of complexation for ibuprofen and hydrochlorothiazide {{was found to be}} pH-independent. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation were determined using the temperature dependence method. In order to characterize more specifically the parameters of complexation, a novel computerized method was then developed. A non-linear regression software was used to evaluate the values of the complexation parameters as well as their standard deviation and 95 % confidence limit. The complexation of drugs with hydroxyethyl beta cyclodextrin showed that the substitution of the natural cyclodextrin affected the solubility of the complexing agent without altering its <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power.</b> A rule of prediction was then proposed, allowing the calculation of potential drug concentration upon complexation with the cyclodextrin derivative. The ratio of solubility of the two kinds of cyclodextrins was shown to correlate very well with the ratio of the concentration of drug complexed. The rule might be applied to all drugs at various pH values. The potential use of beta cyclodextrin as an additive in tableting was also evaluated.

Four SNEDDSs (I-IV) {{were developed}}. Going from SNEDDS I to IV lipid content and solubility of the model drug cinnarizine decreased, which was also the case for dispersion time and droplet size. Droplet size of all SNEDDS was evaluated at 1 % (w/w) dispersion under different conditions. Cinnarizine incorporation increased the droplet size of SNEDDSs I and II whereas for SNEDDSs III and IV no difference was observed. At low pH cinnarizine had no effect on droplet size, probably due to increased aqueous solubility and partitioning into the aqueous phase. Dispersion of the SNEDDSs in Simulated Intestinal Media (SIM) containing bile salts and phospholipids resulted in a decrease in droplet size for all SNEDDS, as compared to dispersion in buffer. Increasing the bile salt/phospholipid content in the SIM decreased the droplet sizes further. Mimicked digested SNEDDS with highest lipid content (I and II) formed smaller nanoemulsion droplet sizes upon dispersion in SIM, whereas droplet size from III and IV were virtually unchanged by digestion. Increasing the bile acid/phosphatidylcholine content in the SIM generally decreased droplet size, due to the <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> of the endogenous surfactants. Digestion of SNEDDSs II resulted in formation of vesicles or micelles in fasted and fed state SIM, respectively.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD thesis was to design new task-specific ionic liquids {{with the ability to}} {{dissolve}} metal compounds. Despite the large quantity of papers published on ionic liquids, not much is known about the mechanisms of dissolving metals in ionic liquids or about metal-containing ionic liquids. Additionally, many of the commercially available ionic liquids exhibit a very limited <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> for metal compounds, although this is for many applications like electrodeposition and catalysis one of the essential features. To enhance the ability of ionic liquids to incorporate metals in ionic liquids, functional groups that are able to coordinate to the metal ions are required. Task-specific ionic liquids combine, in the best case, a <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> that is comparable with organic solvents with the “green” character of ionic liquids, which makes them environmental friendly solvents. Before these compounds will be applicable on larger scale, these functionalized ionic liquids have to be cheap and easily accessible. Firstly, a protonated betaine bistriflimide, [Hbet][Tf 2 N], was introduced. This is a cheap and easily accessible functionalized ionic liquid with the ability to dissolve large quantities of metal oxides and metal hydroxides. The metal <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> of this compound is selective. Soluble are: oxides of the trivalent rare earths, uranium(VI) oxide, zinc(II) oxide, cadmium(II) oxide, mercury(II) oxide, nickel(II) oxide, copper(II) oxide, palladium(II) oxide, lead(II) oxide and silver(I) oxide. Insoluble or very poorly soluble are iron(III) and manganese(II) oxides, cobalt(II) oxides, as well as aluminium oxide. The metals can be stripped from the ionic liquid by treatment of the ionic liquid with an acidic aqueous solution. After transfer of the metal ions into the aqueous phase, the ionic liquid can be separated and recycled. Betainium bistriflimide forms one phase with water at high temperatures, whereas phase separation occurs below 55. 5 °C (“phase switching” behavior). The mixtures of the ionic liquid with water also show a pH-dependent phase switching behavior: two phases occur at low pH, whereas one phase is present under neutral or alkaline conditions. The structures, the energetics and the charge distribution of the betainium cation, the bistriflimide anion, {{as well as of the}} cation-anion pairs were studied by density functional theory calculations (DFT). Additionally, the crystal structures of two modifications of this ionic liquid were determined. A range of crystal structures of the metal complexes obtained from the above mentioned functionalized ionic liquid were examined. This study revealed a rich structural variety especially of oligonuclear complexes, whereas in the literature mainly monomeric or polymeric complexes with this type of ligands are known. Dimeric betaine bistriflimide structures were found for the dysprosium(III) compound; the europium(III) compound and for the copper(II) compound; a trimeric betaine bistriflimide structure for the cobalt(II) compound; a tetrameric betaine bistriflimide structure for the manganese(II) compound; a pentameric betaine bistriflimide structure for the nickel(II) compound;, a cluster formation for the lead(II) compound; and polymeric structures for the cadmium(II) compound; and the silver(I) compound. In the crystal structure of cobalt(II) betaine bistriflimide, pure ionic liquid [Hbet][Tf 2 N] co-crystallized. The cation-anion interaction found in the crystal structure of the pure ionic liquid remained in the metal complex. No hydrogen bonding between the ionic liquid and the metal complex could be observed. It was demonstrated that ionic liquids might be good media for crystal engineering. In order to modify the physical properties of the betainium ionic liquid, structural modifications have been introduced. Different kinds of cations, all bearing a carboxylic functional group, were applied. Six cations with a positively charged nitrogen ion – l-carnitine, pyrrolidinium, morpholinium, pyridinium, piperidinium, imidazolium and one with a positively charged phosphonium ion - tributylphosphonium, were studied. Despite the rich structural variation, surprisingly small differences in physical properties of these ionic liquids were observed. This can be explained by the strong and dominating influence of the carboxylic group on the physical properties. To study the influence of the carboxylic group, an ionic liquid with a hydroxyl group instead of the carboxylic group, choline bistriflimide, was introduced. Due to this hydroxyl group, the ionic liquid showed only a limited solubility towards metal compounds. This hydrophobic ionic liquid also shows a “phase switching” behavior; this occurred at higher temperatures than in the case of the betainium bistriflimide ionic liquid. Due to the absence of a conjugated system, this ionic liquid possesses a high UV-transparency. This can be an interesting property for the application of this choline bistriflimide ionic liquid as medium for photophysical reactions or as a solvent for spectroscopy. Choline saccharinate and choline acesulfamate are two examples of hydrophilic ionic liquids, which can be prepared from easily available starting materials (choline chloride and a non-nutritive sweetener). The (eco) toxicity of these ionic liquids in aqueous solution is very low in comparison with other types of ionic liquids. A general method for the synthesis and purification of hydrophilic ionic liquids has been demonstrated. The method implies a silver-free metathesis reaction, followed by the purification of the ionic liquids by ion-exchange chromatography. The crystal structures show a marked difference in hydrogen bonding between the two ionic liquids [Chol][Sac] and [Chol][Ace], although the saccharinate and the acesulfamate anions show structural similarities. The optimized structures, the energetics and the charge distribution of cation-anion pairs in the ionic liquids were studied by density functional theory (DFT). For a qualitative picture of the Lewis structure the occupation of the non-Lewis orbitals was considered. The calculated interaction energies and the dipole moments for the ion-pairs in the gas phase have been discussed. In the last chapter, a different strategy to incorporate metals into ionic liquids was introduced. A lanthanide thiocyanate anion was synthesized and used as component for an ionic liquid. By using this anion in combination with a 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium (C 4 mim) cation the first lanthanide-containing ionic liquids were obtained. These compounds have melting points ranging from 28 °C (Nd) to 39 °C (Y). The general formula for these compounds is [C 4 mim]status: publishe...|$|E

In complexant-water and surfactant-water systems free unionized drug [Dᵤ] and free ionized drug [Dᵢ] are present along with either complexed unionized drug [DᵤL] and complexed ionized drug [DᵢL], or micellar unionized drug [DᵤM] and micellar ionized drug [DᵢM], respectively. On the other hand, in cosolvent-water system the only species present are free unionized drug [Dcᵤ] and free ionized drug [Dcᵢ]. The equations developed show that a pH change favoring ionization of the drug not only increases the concentration of the ionized species in water, but also increases the concentration of the ionized species in cyclodextrins, micelles, or cosolvents. In fact, the concentration of the ionized species in the complexant, micelle, or cosolvent can be greater than those of the unionized species. The solubility data of flavopiridol and several other drugs reported in the literature support these conclusions. A mathematical model is also developed to describe the combined effect of cosolvency and complexation on non-polar drug solubilization. The total drug solubility is determined by the summation of three drug species present in the solution: free drug [D], drug-ligand binary complex [DL], and drug-ligand-cosolvent ternary complex [DLC]. The proposed equation describes the dependencies of these three species upon the intrinsic drug solubility, [Dᵤ], the cosolvent <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power,</b> sigma, the binary and ternary intrinsic complexation constants, K(b) ⁱⁿᵗ and K(t) ⁱⁿᵗ, and the cosolvent destabilizing powers for the binary and the ternary complexes, ρ(b) and ρ(t). The equation explains the decline in the solubility of fluasterone (a non-polar drug) produced by low cosolvent concentrations as well as the increase in the solubility produced by high cosolvent concentrations that are observed at all cyclodextrin concentrations...|$|E
40|$|La {{solubilisation}} des hydrocarbures par les solutions de tensio-actifs utilisés pour la récupération améliorée du pétrole est directement liée à l'efficacité interfaciale de ces solutions. D'autant plus élevée que la tension interfaciale entre la phase micellaire et l'huile est plus basse, elle dépend fortement de {{la nature}} de l'hydrocarbure. Dans certains cas, celui-ci est responsable de comportements de phase inhabituels. On examine d'abord dans cet article la méthodologie généralement utilisée pour caractériser les propriétés interfaciales des mélanges eau-huile-tensio-actifs. Elle est fondée, à partir des travaux de Winsor et de quelques auteurs après lui, sur le concept d'énergies de cohésion entre les diverses entités moléculaires présentes et sur le rapport entre ces énergies. Cette approche permet d'orienter le choix des paramètres pour optimiser les formulations du point de vue de la solubilisation et de la tension interfaciale. Les comportements de phase d'hydrocarbures modèles, alcanes et alkylbenzènes, sont ensuite comparés et discutés, ainsi que ceux d'huiles brutes de stockage. Il apparaît notamment que, dans les mélanges d'hydrocarbures, le paramètre d'optimisation (ici la masse moléculaire du tensio-actif) varie de façon non linéaire avec les proportions du mélange. Les performances obtenues avec les huiles brutes de masses moléculaires voisines dépendent sensiblement de la composition. Cependant l'influence propre de la structure et de la masse moléculaire des différentes espèces n'a pas encore été établie. A cet égard l'huile de Daqing constitue un cas intéressant : la solubilisation est extrêmement faible, bien que les tensions interfaciales soient relativement basses. D'après des essais préliminaires de fractionnement de ce brut, les résines pourraient être à l'origine de ce comportement. La poursuite des travaux vise à préciser l'effet des fractions lourdes des bruts (paraffines, résines, asphaltènes) sur les propriétés interfaciales, d'une part avec le brut de Daqing, pour effectuer des essais complémentaires, d'autre part avec des constituants modèles en solution dans un solvant approprié. Optimizing {{the formulation of}} micellar surfactant solutions used for enhanced oil recovery consists in obtaining interfacial tensions that are {{as low as possible}} in multiphase systems resulting from the mixing of the injected solution with formation fluids. The solubilization of hydrocarbons by the micellar phases of such systems is linked directly to the interfacial efficiency of surfactants. Indeed, as has been shown by numerous research projects such as the one by Reed and Healy [1], the amount of hydrocarbons solubilized by the surfactant is all the greater as the interfacial tension between the micellar phase and the hydrocarbons is low. This solubilization depends in particular, although to a great extent, {{on the nature of the}} hydrocarbons or, for the processes we are concerned with here, of the hydrocarbon mixtures encountered [181. Likewise, the criteria generally used in applying the process to a reservoir may also be fulfilled (temperature, salinity of the water, viscosity of the oil, nature and permeability of the rock), whereas the chemical nature of the oil turns out to be responsible for very mediocre efficiency. Hence this insufficiency of criteria is revealed for relatively heavy oils such as the oil in the Daqing field in China, for which production may still depend on this recovery method, a priori. The solubilization of this oil by the surfactants normally used is extremely reduced and may perhaps even by almost nil. This particularly unfavorable behavior has brought out the need of specifying selection criteria for fields from the standpoint of the nature of the oil, so as to be able to assess the quality of a crude oil and to detect possible difficulties in applying the process-diff iculties linked to the composition of the oil. Such research must result in the adapting of procedures, in searching for solutions and in setting limits to the process from this standpoint. This article describes the methodology and preliminary results leading to the comparing of the phase behavior of mixtures containing model hydrocarbons having different structures, normal alkanes and alkylbenzenes or stock-tank crudes. The methodology is based on the correlations worked out by Reed and Healy [1] between the, existence of low interfacial tensions and the obtaining of a phase diagram having a specific configuration said to be of the Winsor Type III [7]. In this configuration, the multiphase zone contains, in particular, a three-phase domain in which an intermediate micellar phase is in equilibrium with an aqueous phase and a hydrocarbon phase. When the affinity of the surfactant for the water and the hydrocarbon is the same, the micellar phase contains equal amounts of water and hydrocarbon. The system is then considered, by convention to be an optimal one. In mixtures of water, amphiphilic compounds (surfactant and alcohol) and hydrocarbons having different molecular weights and structures, the <b>solubilizing</b> <b>power</b> is measured at the reference point obtained by adjusting the molecular weight of the surfactant. However, all optimal systems are not equivalent. Solubilization is all the greater and hence the lowering of the interfacial tension is all the more marked as the energies of cohesion between the surfactant and the water and hydrocarbon are strong. This approach is fruitful for interpreting performance variations when some parameters of the system are modified, such as the molecular weight and structure of the hydrocarbon or the salinity of the water. During this study, we show that the optimal molecular weight of the surfactant varies linearly with that of the pure hydrocarbon (alkane or alkylbenzene), at least within the range of molecular weights examined here. Solubilization also varies linearly. This ideal behavior disappears for hydrocarbon mixtures. The different effects of alcohol on the phase behavior of micellar systems, due to its partitioning among the different phases, have been confirmed, and in particular the effect on solubilization. This solubilization is all the weaker as the alcohol concentration is great. The solubilization of crude oils depends strongly on their chemical composition. It may vary from single to double for crudes having exactly the same equivalent alkane, i. e. having similar molecular weights. Oil from Daqing has very weak solubilization, even though the interfacial tensions between the micellar phase and the excess oil are relatively low. According to tests of fractions extracted from the crude oil, resins might be responsible for such a behavior in an environment with high molecular weights. To achieve better control over the formulation of micellar fluids, further research will have to be done to determine the effect of heavy constituents (paraffins, resins and asphaltenes) on the interfacial properties of water/hydrocarbon/surfactant systems. Likewise, the interactions occurring between the hydrocarbon constituents and the surfactant raise problems concerning the choice of the surfactant. The use of surfactants having varying structures, mainly with regard to the lipophilic part (branching, aromaticity, etc)., should make it possible to indicate to what extent this structure can be adapted to the composition of the oil to make formulations as efficient as possible...|$|E
