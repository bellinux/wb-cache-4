5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, when he gets to the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
25|$|On 30 March, {{hoping to}} start a popular {{uprising}} against the Austrians, Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation calling all Italian nationalists to war. Although there were many Italians sympathetic to his cause, fearful of the increasing Austrian influence in Italy and longing for independence, most Italians saw Murat as <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> save his own crown rather than a figurehead for unification. The Austrians also quickly crushed any unrest {{and there would be}} no general insurrection so long as Austrian troops were stationed in Italy. Despite this, by early April, Murat has reached the Austrian border on the Po River. Across the border in Lombardy, there were reportedly around 40,000 Italian partisans, mostly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, waiting to join Murat's army as soon he arrived in Milan.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{marriage}} to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recuperate from exhaustion. [...] Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From {{the start of the}} new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. [...] The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by [...] The Variety Artistes' Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. During one demonstration, she recognised <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> enter and shouted, [...] "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." [...] The singer was Belle Elmore, later murdered by her husband, Dr. Crippen. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for The Courier noted [...] "Her bright smile and fascinating presence {{has much to do with}} her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the {{controversy}} in the moderated group sci.physics.research, Igor Bogdanov denied that their published papers were a hoax, but when asked precise questions from physicists Steve Carlip and John Baez regarding mathematical details in the papers, failed to convince any other participants that these papers had any real scientific value. [...] New York Times reporter George Johnson described reading through the debate as [...] "like watching <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> nail Jell-O to a wall", for the Bogdanovs had [...] "developed their own private language, one that impinges on the vocabulary of science only at the edges." ...|$|E

The way it's designed, it's an interesting kind of setup," [...] Nolan said. [...] "Because of the high value of targets they have there – on a world scale, whether it be a drug cartel or terrorists – they are as concerned with <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get in to break someone out as much as they are about inmates trying to escape.

2500|$|His non-fiction explores many of {{the themes}} found in his fiction. Essays such as [...] "The History of the Tango" [...] or his {{writings}} on the epic poem [...] "Martín Fierro" [...] explore Argentine themes, such as {{the identity of the}} Argentine people and of various Argentine subcultures. The varying genealogies of characters, settings, and themes in his stories, such as [...] "La muerte y la brújula", used Argentine models without pandering to his readers or framing Argentine culture as [...] "exotic". In fact, contrary to what is usually supposed, the geographies found in his fictions often do not correspond to those of real-world Argentina. In his essay [...] "El escritor argentino y la tradición", Borges notes that the very absence of camels in the Qur'an was proof enough that it was an Arabian work. He suggested that only <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> write an [...] "Arab" [...] work would purposefully include a camel. He uses this example to illustrate how his dialogue with universal existential concerns was just as Argentine as writing about gauchos and tangos.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzmaurice found [...] "Polish Girl" [...] to {{be similar}} to the song [...] "Reunion" [...] by Canadian band Stars, as both songs depict <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> recover, and yearning for, young love. Palomo asks {{questions}} in the song that are likely to be unanswered, such as [...] "Do I still cross your mind?/ Your face still distorts the time". Cooke noted the [...] "dazzling syncopated pulse" [...] {{to be similar}} to the coin sound effect in games from the Mario series, and has melodies that [...] "splash and slide around sickly-sweet flurries of arpeggios and a family-friendly feel-good beat". Blurt said that the song includes what sounds like samples from the game Super Mario World, and has the joyful energy of Cut Copy's album Zonoscope. Beats per Minute writer Aurora Mitchell said the song [...] "sounds like 80s disco distorted through an old computer", while AllMusic noted the song sounded more like Palomo's other project Vega than Neon Indian. [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] includes elements of alternative rock, grunge and garage rock. Club Fonograma writer Blanca Méndez said that [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] is about the [...] "staying-at-home-and-staring-at-ceilings early stage" [...] of a breakup, which is [...] "the one in which you allow yourself to wallow in the pain because you deserve at least that much". Méndez noted the song's [...] "tinny layers of sound" [...] and Palomo's [...] "breathy, almost frustrated vocals". The electro-shoegaze song [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] addresses an ex-girlfriend, and includes video game synth timbres similar to those on Psychic Chasms opener [...] "(AM)". Both [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] and [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] are filled with [...] "buzzsaw"-toned guitars, which BBC Music's John Aizlewood compared to the Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E

I had scarcely spoken the words before we were hailed for a rope; and in another minute these officers--both insensible from cold--were pulled on board.

A terrible sense of fatality robbed her of all feeling and thought. She knew he was gone out of the world, there was merely the same world, and absence, his absence. The night seemed large and vacuous. Lanterns swayed here and there, people were talking in an undertone on the launch and in the boats. She could hear Winifred moaning: 'OH DO FIND HER GERALD, DO FIND HER,' and <b>someone</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> comfort the child. Gudrun paddled aimlessly here and there.
