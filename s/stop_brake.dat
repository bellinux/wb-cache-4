Results from thermal imaging reveal a frictionally excited thermoelastic instability phenomenon called "banding" where the contact between brake block and wheel occurs only over a fraction of the block width. This condition results in locally high temperatures. The numerical analysis assesses ratcheting response of the wheel tread material under operational conditions corresponding to two types of banding patterns and also a case of uniform heating. Fatigue life predictions are estimated from the evaluated ratcheting response using a simplified accumulation rule.

40|$|The {{temperature}} rise of wheels and blocks due to frictional heating during railway tread braking {{along with the}} transfer of heat through the wheel–rail contact is studied in this paper. In particular, heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail for <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> cycles is considered. The wheels are of interest because they are a limiting factor for railway tread braking systems. Two types of thermal models are employed to investigate the maximum temperatures over the wheel tread. In a circumferential (plane) model of wheel, block and rail, the heat transfer problem is studied by use of a finite element formulation of the two-dimensional time-dependent convection–diffusion equation. The hot spot phenomenon is simulated by introducing a prescribed wheel-fixed contact pressure distribution between wheel and block. In an axisymmetric (axial) model of wheel, block and rail, the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact are studied. A general {{result is that the}} cooling effect provided by the rail is important when local temperatures on the tread are considered, but not when studying bulk temperatures created in a single <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> event. Furthermore, it is found from the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact that slow oscillations result in maximum temperatures over the wheel tread that are somewhat lower than for travelling on straight track (rolling at the rolling circle) ...|$|R

30|$|For {{the reasons}} of safety, the correct {{implementation}} of the double stage pressure ensuring that lower pressure is applied on cylinders for traveling speed of over 170  km/h is much more important. This is important because the energy dissipated during a <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> increases approximately with the square of train traveling speed and, as a consequence, a reduction of disk clamping forces may be fundamental to avoid the risk of excessive thermal loads. Furthermore, the adhesion limits imposed by [10] prescribe a linear reduction of the braking forces between 200 and 350  km/h, according to a linear law which corresponds to a reduction of the braking power of about one-third in the above-cited speed range.|$|R

The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated <b>stop</b> <b>braking.</b> The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, important aspects of the thermal capacity of tread braked railway wheels have been assessed in a literature survey. Then two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to standard design criteria for load cases of drag <b>braking</b> and <b>stop</b> <b>braking.</b> The influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. Simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential <b>stop</b> <b>braking.</b> A parametric study was done for analysing the influence of various loading levels and other important factors on temperatures, axial flange deflection, residual stresses and the fatigue life of the wheels. The model and the numerical results will be useful for assessing the thermal capacity of wheels and for developing new design rules and standards. It was found that the mechanical and thermal loadings have different influences on the web damage and on the estimated fatigue life depending on load cases and wheel design...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the stated}} {{advantages}} of electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid vehicles (HVs) is {{their ability to}} recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) would extend the working range of an EV or HV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce duty levels on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise brake pad wear. The objective {{of this paper is}} to define how much braking energy could be absorbed by a regenerative braking system (RBS) on a passenger car, hence defining the duty envelope of the friction brake. This will enable lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. In this paper, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) is used to analyse the availability of regenerative braking energy during a single <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> event. Secondly a computer simulation model based on Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) is used to simulate both single stop and drive cycle braking. Based on both sets of results it is shown how much of the total braking energy could be absorbed by the RBS of an example hybrid car in single <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> and drive cycle braking. Thermal performance is a key factor which is studied using FEA simulations. Ultimately a design method for lightweight brakes suitable for use on any car-sized hybrid vehicle will be developed.

Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag <b>braking</b> and <b>stop</b> <b>braking.</b> Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line.

The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{disc brake}} is a device for slowing or {{stopping}} {{the rotation of}} a wheel. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or <b>stop.</b> <b>Brakes</b> convert friction to heat, but if the brakes get too hot, they will cease to work because they cannot dissipate enough heat. This condition of failure is known as brake fade. Disc brakes are exposed to large thermal stresses during routine braking and extraordinary thermal stresses during hard braking. The aim of the present work is to model a disc brake used in Honda Civic. Coupled field analysis (Structural + Thermal) is done on the disc brake. The materials used are cast iron and aluminum. Analysis is also done by changing the design of disc brake. Actual disc brake has no holes, design is changed by giving holes in the disc brake for more heat dissipation.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle <b>stop</b> <b>braking,</b> drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated. The inclusion of heat transfer from wheel to rail means that the model is useful for comparing brake rig tests, where normally the chilling influence from the rail is not included, with in-field tests. Two companion papers with experimental results supplement the present numerical modelling. A brief numerical example demonstrates the heat partitioning and the influence of rail chill (about 30 per cent) for two braking configurations...|$|R
40|$|Wheel treads {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in tread profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale tread braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel tread profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the tread near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other tread area...|$|R
