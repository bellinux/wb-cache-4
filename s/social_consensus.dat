25|$|Western Europe's {{industrial}} {{nations in the}} 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a <b>social</b> <b>consensus</b> behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain {{under the leadership of}} Margaret Thatcher, the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations {{at the time of her}} death in 2013.|$|E
25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a socially shared knowledge, transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through which parents impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation to try to protect these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their revalidation can only be legitimized through a <b>social</b> <b>consensus.</b> Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the [...] "golden rule". [...] "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood.

Because of the staging, it is possible to compare the performance of the privatized and public utilities at that time. This comparison shows that from 1998 to 2001 private companies invested substantially more than public companies and - unlike the public companies - increased their labor productivity significantly. Tariffs increased for both types of companies, but more so for the privatized ones.

2500|$|The {{practical}} {{method of}} appointing liturgists arose from a <b>social</b> <b>consensus</b> arrived at by the wealthy amongst themselves, which was itself based on [...] "a competitive and luxurious ideology of aristocratic origin, {{developed in the}} archaic period, and maintained to its own advantage by the democratic city: [...] the liturgists, far from being manipulated by an administrative structure that forces them to pay, are the active forces in a system which they operate to their own advantage." [...] Specifically, the system was based primarily on [...] the voluntary nature of the role, [...] and the stratification of Athenian society: most of those Athenians to be included {{on the list of}} trierarchs had been so before, or were descendants of former trierarchs, with the result that the families providing the trierarchs tended to be the same ones from generation to generation. For the civilian liturgies, including the choregia, it does not appear that there was a similar list. However, [...] the wealthy were eager to volunteer their support, due to peer group pressure [...] and a desire for fame equivalent to their fortunes. [...] Wealthy citizens or resident aliens who were tempted to hide their wealth to escape their duties were deterred by the threat of the [...] "antidosis" [...] (a type of litigation in which a citizen nominated as liturgist tried to compel another to act in his stead), [...] and the harm to reputation that their reluctance to contribute to the public good would cause them within their city.|$|E

Reynolds and Ceranic identified some major limitations in these classic cognitive moral development theories. They sought {{to bring together}} the concept of moral identity and moral judgment, rather than studying them as separate contributors to moral behavior. This research suggests that moral identity and moral judgment work both separately and together in shaping moral behavior. In addition, they have researched the effects of <b>social</b> <b>consensus</b> on one's moral behavior. The study claims that depending {{on the level of}} <b>social</b> <b>consensus</b> (high vs. low), moral behaviors will require greater or lesser degrees of moral identity to motivate an individual to make a choice and endorse a behavior. Also, depending on <b>social</b> <b>consensus,</b> particular behaviors may require different levels of moral reasoning.

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} antecedents and {{consequences}} of group potency in self-managing teams in retail banking. Based on data collected from boundary-spanning service employees organized in 60 teams and their customers, our findings reveal a significant positive impact of group potency on customer-perceived service quality and {{a negative effect on}} service profitability. In addition, we find that team consensus regarding group potency positively moderates the effects of group potency, so that for teams with higher levels of potency consensus, the positive impact of group potency on customer-perceived service quality is stronger, whereas the negative impact of group potency on service productivity is weaker. Furthermore, we find significant positive effects of management and interteam support and functional diversity as well as a significant negative effect of team tenure on individual team member beliefs of group potency. Finally, <b>social</b> support <b>consensus</b> moderates the effects of management support, interteam support, and team tenure on group potency, so that the effects of these antecedents are weaker for teams with higher levels of <b>social</b> support <b>consensus.</b> Thus, we conclude that team confidence consensus increases the positive impact of group potency on customer perceptions of service quality and decreases the negative impact on profitability. Thus, team-member perceptual agreement on their team's potency should be stimulated. self-managing service teams, group potency, compositional models of aggregation, hierarchical linear modeling...|$|R

The work of a sorcerer is to reintegrate divergent expressions or feelings of patients into “patterns present in the group’s culture. The assimilation of such patterns is {{the only means of}} objectivizing subjective states, of formulating inexpressible feelings, and of integrating inarticulated experiences into a system.” The three examples that Lévi-Strauss mentions relate to magic, a practice reached as a <b>social</b> <b>consensus,</b> by a group of people including sorcerer and patient. It seems that people make sense of certain activities through beliefs, created by <b>social</b> <b>consensus,</b> and not by the effectiveness of magical practices. The community’s belief in <b>social</b> <b>consensus</b> thus determines social roles and sets rules and categories for attitudes. Perhaps, in this essay, magic is system of terminology, a langue, whereas, individual behavior is a system of attitude, parole. Attitudes make sense or acquire meaning through magic.

40|$|Burrell and Morgan's (1979) classic text Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis is as {{relevant}} {{now as it}} was when first published {{a quarter of a century}} ago. Central to Burrell and Morgan's thesis is the idea that "all theories of organisation are based upon a philosophy of science and a theory of society" (2003, p. 1). Either explicitly or implicitly, researchers base their work on a series of philosophical assumptions regarding ontology, epistemology, and human nature, which have methodological consequences. Within each of these assumptions, the extreme positions are reflected in "sociological positivism" (realist ontology, positivist epistemology, deterministic view of human nature, nomothetic methodologies) and, in opposition, "German idealism" (subjective ontology, antipositivist epistemology, voluntarist view of human nature, ideographic methodologies). Similarly, researchers hold differing views about the nature of society, underpinned by further assumptions, and reflected in Burrell and Morgan's distinction between regulation and radical change. Researchers adhering to the "regulation" perspective attempt to explain society in terms that emphasize its underlying cohesiveness. Their concerns are with the status quo, <b>social</b> order, <b>consensus,</b> <b>social</b> integration, solidarity, individual or system needs satisfaction, and actuality. In contrast, the "radical change" perspective is concerned with explaining structural conflict, modes of domination, contradiction, emancipation, deprivation, and potentiality...|$|R

I argue that this consensus, in the sense of overlapping policy preferences, never really existed; there has always been substantial conflict between the SPD and CDU/CSU concerning the content and direction of social policy, and that the specific design of German political institutions forced the two major parties to compromise. This social policy-making pattern continues to the present day.|$|R
