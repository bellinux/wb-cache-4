60|$|And it was peace. We {{learned the}} glad news {{when we had}} risen {{alongside}} the Juno, and the ringing cheers which greeted us had at last died away. Our orders were to report ourselves at once at Blankenberg. Then she passed on down Channel to collect the others. We returned to port upon the <b>surface,</b> <b>steaming</b> through the whole British fleet as we passed up the North Sea. The crews clustered thick {{along the sides of}} the vessels to watch us. I can see now their sullen, angry faces. Many shook their fists and cursed us as we went by. It was not that we had damaged them--I will do them the justice to say that the English, as the old Boer War has proved, bear no resentment against a brave enemy--but that they thought us cowardly to attack merchant ships and avoid the warships. It is like the Arabs who think that a flank attack is a mean, unmanly device. War is not a big game, my English friends. It is a desperate business to gain the upper hand, and one must use one's brain in order to find the weak spot of one's enemy. It is not fair to blame me if I have found yours. It was my duty. Perhaps those officers and sailors who scowled at the little Iota that May morning have by this time done me justice when the first bitterness of undeserved defeat was passed.|$|E

As the Culver Line was built on a nearly straight path from terminal to terminal, it was a popular choice for travelers to the Atlantic Ocean shore at Coney Island. Service to Neck Road opened June 19, and Coney Island June 27. In 1880 service began on the line to Union Station at 5th Avenue and 36th Street.|$|R
50|$|Sandwich steaming, {{which was}} {{developed}} in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and <b>surface</b> <b>steaming,</b> offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a deep steaming injection system, {{is covered with a}} steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30 mm water column arises underneath the cover.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>steaming</b> {{with special}} sheets (sheet steaming) {{is a method}} which has been {{established}} for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m² in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the steaming time significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m² can be steamed in 4-5 hours down to 25-30 cm depth / 90 °C. The usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5 mm thick, 500 gr / m², can reduce steaming time by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet {{after it has been}} laid out and weighted with sand sacks.|$|E

40|$|Two diffuse soil CO 2 flux {{surveys from}} the {{southern}} Lakki plain show that CO 2 is mainly released from the hydrothermal explosion craters.

30|$|In April 2015, {{a slight}} {{inflation}} {{of the volcano}} was observed by the GNSS network, and an earthquake swarm started within the caldera later that month. On May 3, a steam well (500  m in depth) in Owakudani, which was drilled to obtain steam to create artificial hot spring water, had an uncontrolled blowout. This intensification of steaming activity {{seems to have been}} caused by a pressure rise in the shallow hydrothermal system of the steaming area. Such a pressure rise in the hydrothermal system was also expressed by local uplifting (up to 6  cm in the area[*]<[*] 100  m in radius until May 7) around the steam well observed by satellite-based InSAR (Doke et al. 2015). Based on these observations, the local government of Hakone designated the area around the steam well as a ‘no-entry zone’ (Mannen et al. 2018). After late May, <b>surface</b> <b>steaming</b> activity became prominent within the uplifting area, and this observation also supports increased hydrothermal activity in this area. We thus assumed that the area around the steam well is the principal candidate for the eruption center in the future eruption.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{steaming}} is {{a promising}} preventive method for weed control in high-value cash crops, such as vegetables and flowers. A 2 -year experiment (20052006) {{was carried out}} to test the effect of five different systems of steam injection (surface or deep steam injection bar and three mixed systems at different steam distribution ratios between the surface and the deep bar: 1 : 2; 1 : 1 and 2 : 1) on an artificial infestation of Brassica juncea and on the natural weed seedbank. Treatments were carried out using steam alone or in association with two different exothermic compounds (KOH and CaO), distributed at two different rates (1000 and 4000 kg ha- 1). The effects of treatments on the seedbank were analysed by the seedling emergence technique at three different soil depths (07, 714 and 1421 cm). Non-linear dose-response curves were used to correlate weed emergence with soil temperature sum. <b>Surface</b> <b>steaming</b> was the most effective treatment (up to 100 % weed control) at 07 cm depth. Deep steaming depleted the weed seedbank up to 95 % in the deepest soil layer. The most homogeneous weed control effect across the soil profile was obtained with mixed systems, with differences depending on their distribution ratio. The new steam injection systems increased the versatility of this innovative soil steaming machine and confirmed its efficiency in reducing the weed seedbank, making it a promising replacement of methyl bromide fumigation before growing high-value crops...|$|E

40|$|<b>Surfacing,</b> <b>steaming</b> and {{freezing}} {{are widely used}} pretreatment methods to improve the drying rate and to reduce drying defects of wood.

In the case of steaming pretreatment, the observed drying rate was faster and drying strain was milder than control wood. However, there were almost no differences between control and pre–frozen wood regarding the drying behaviors. Tangential strain (e 2) of steam–treated wood was larger than that of control and freeze–treated wood. Moreover, the effect of pretreatment was not uniform over the entire wood specimen.

50|$|Since the {{effectiveness}} of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs in a low gear to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls {{in much the same way}} as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished <b>surface.</b> <b>Steam</b> rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as 'chip chasers' which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines.
