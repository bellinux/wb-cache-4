40|$|Mantled fruits as {{a result}} of somaclonal {{variation}} are often observed from the oil palm plantlets regenerated via tissue culture. The mantling of fruits with finger-like and thick outer coating phenotypes significantly reduces the seed size and oil content, posing a threat to oil palm planters, and may jeopardize the economic growth of countries that depend particularly on oil palm plantation. The molecular aspects of the occurrence of somaclonal variations are yet to be known, possibly due to gene repression such as DNA methylation, histone methylation and histone deacetylation. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), involved in eukaryotic gene regulation by catalyzing the acetyl groups are removal from lysine residues on histone, hence transcriptionally repress gene expression. This paper described the total protein polymorphism profiles of <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variants</b> of oil palm and the effects of histone deacetylation on this phenomenon. Parallel to the different phenotypes, the protein polymorphism profiles of the mantled samples (leaves, fruits, and florets) and the phenotypically normal samples were proven to be different.

EMB- 2 plants are characterized by profuse proliferation of shoot- and embryo-like structures on some leaves. We addressed the putative relationship between cytokinins and knox genes in EMB- 2 plants. A class I knox gene, HtKNOT 1, was isolated from H. tuberosus. A high level of HtKNOT 1 transcripts was detected in EMB- 2 epiphyllous leaves compared to non-epiphyllous (NEP) ones. In addition, epiphylly was related to a localized increases in zeatin and N-glycosylated cytokinins. As ectopic morphogenesis proceeded, HtKNOT 1 transcripts and zeatin co-localized and showed different patterns in ectopic shoot compared with embryo-like structures, consistent with the differential role of both cytokinin and knox genes in the two morphogenetic events. Notably, a massive shoot/embryo regeneration was induced in EMB- 2 NEP leaves by in vitro zeatin treatment. These results clearly indicate that localized cytokinin accumulation and ectopic expression of HtKNOT 1 are closely linked in the epiphylly of EMB- 2 plants...|$|E

Plants have two major groups of such MITEs: Tourist and Stowaway. Mobile MITEs have been reported previously in rice but no active MITEs have been found in dicotyledons. Here, we provide evidence that Stowaway MITEs can be mobilized in the potato and that one of them causes a change of tuber skin color as an obvious phenotypic variation. In an original red-skinned potato clone, the gene encoding for a flavonoid 3 ′, 5 ′-hydroxylase, which is involved in purple anthocyanin synthesis, has been inactivated by the insertion of a Stowaway MITE named dTstu 1 within the first exon. However, dTstu 1 is absent from this gene in a purple <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variant</b> that was obtained as a regenerated plant from a protoplast culture of the red-skinned potato.

All 111 cultivars with various unusual morphologies, such as dwarf, rumpled leaves, etc., had 2 n= 60 chromosomes, which was the same number as in wild plants. Only one individual obtained by tissue culture of the cultivar ‘Yukibeni-botan’ had exceptional chromosome number with 2 n= 59. In 14 cultivars with 2 n= 60 chromosomes examined, no abnormal chromosome behavior was observed through the microsporogenesis, and at the meiotic metaphase I, 30 bivalents were observed. Among the flowered 96 individuals in 95 cultivars, seven individuals had no pollen grains, and those having atrophied head, such as “SHISHI” and “KURUMA”, showed relatively low pollen stainabilities, 48. 3 and 23. 4 % in average, respectively, whereas the other cultivars had high stainability (91. 3 % in average).

40|$|Somaclonal {{variation}} {{arises in}} {{plants and animals}} when differentiated somatic cells are induced into a pluripotent state, but the resulting clones differ {{from each other and}} from their parents. In agriculture, somaclonal variation has hindered the micropropagation of elite hybrids and genetically modified crops, but the mechanism responsible remains unknown. The oil palm fruit 'mantled' abnormality is a <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variant</b> arising from tissue culture that drastically reduces yield, and has largely halted efforts to clone elite hybrids for oil production. Widely regarded as an epigenetic phenomenon, 'mantling' has defied explanation, but here we identify the MANTLED locus using epigenome-wide association studies of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis. DNA hypomethylation of a LINE retrotransposon related to rice Karma, in the intron of the homeotic gene DEFICIENS, is common to all mantled clones and is associated with alternative splicing and premature termination. Dense methylation near the Karma splice site (termed the Good Karma epiallele) predicts normal fruit set, whereas hypomethylation (the Bad Karma epiallele) predicts homeotic transformation, parthenocarpy and marked loss of yield. Loss of Karma methylation and of small RNA in tissue culture contributes to the origin of mantled, while restoration in spontaneous revertants accounts for non-Mendelian inheritance. The ability to predict and cull mantling at the plantlet stage will facilitate the introduction of higher performing clones and optimize environmentally sensitive land resources...|$|E

Transformation of the fertile or sterile androecium into carpel-like structures is observed in staminate and pistillate mantled flowers, respectively, resulting in lower oil yields in affected plantations. Given the epigenetic nature of the mantled condition, a gene expression-based approach was used rather than a genetic one to investigate its molecular basis. Suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) and macroarray hybridisation were used to compare transcriptome patterns between normal and mantled inflorescences. Two SSH libraries, enriched for complementary deoxyribonucleic acids (cDNAs) of either true-totype or <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variant</b> material, were generated. Bioinformatic analysis of these two libraries allowed the identification of 1, 350 unique sequences and their annotation by a gene ontology-based approach. Macroarray hybridisation {{was used to compare}} gene expression between normal and mantled inflorescences, and 32 genes were found to be differentially expressed. The temporal expression patterns of six genes were further investigated in more detail in relation to male and female inflorescence development. Full-length cDNAs were isolated and characterised for two of these genes, EgFB 1 and EgRING 1, both of which are down-regulated in the mantled inflorescences and both of which encode proteins associated with proteolytic signalling complexes. Our data shed light on gene expression changes associated with the mantled phenotype and have provided novel transcriptome markers which can help to distinguish the abnormal and wild-type inflorescences.

We have isolated a number of MADS box genes from oil palm inflorescences by a MADS box-directed mRNA display approach. The isolated partial cDNAs included genes that were likely to function at the initial stages of flowering as well as genes that may function in determination of the inflorescence and the identity of the flower whorls.

It was concluded that the ST and DT characteristics in the somaclonal variegated line resulted from the base changes in the salt- and drought-responsive genes rather than the changes in chromosome structure or the large duplication or deletion in the specific region of the genome...|$|E
40|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization has {{highlighted}} pineapple {{as one of}} {{the most}} important tropical fruits. Since classical pineapple breeding is difficult, biotechnology has emerged as an attractive instrument. We obtained two new pineapple somaclonal variants derived from in vitro culture of cv. Red Spanish Pinar: P 3 R 5 and Dwarf. The AFLP analysis revealed an existing genetic distance. So far 44 phenotype indicators selected due to their relation to a wide range of important agricultural, morphological and physiological processes have been evaluated. P 3 R 5 differed from the donor in 19 variables (19 / 44; 43. 18 %), while Dwarf varied in 31 indicators (31 / 44; 70. 45 %). The number of shoots was significantly different among the three plant materials. Dwarf showed two shoots per plant while P 3 R 5 and the donor did not form any shoots. We also observed that water use efficiency, chlorophyll b concentration, total chlorophyll concentration, transpiration rate, chlorophyll a concentration, thickness of leaf photosynthetic parenchyma, fruit mass with crown, content of free phenolics and superoxide dismutase specific activity were also very different among the three plant materials. The Euclidean distances of each <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variant</b> to the donor plant material taking into consideration the genotype (AFLP) and the phenotype evaluations were also calculated. Regarding the genotype information, P 3 R 5 is separated from cv. Red Spanish Pinar by 2. 83 units of Euclidean distance, and Dwarf by 3. 00 units. However, the phenotype indicators revealed higher differences: 3. 74 in P 3 R 5 and 4. 71 in Dwarf. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive analysis of pineapple somaclonal variants...|$|E
40|$|Variability of male {{fertility}} {{expression in}} the AS- 1 line, a <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variant</b> obtained from tissue culture of CMS-plant, and in the progeny of revenant ' 124 - 1 ' obtained from fertile tiller, which developed on CMS-plant transferred from the field to the greenhouse, was investigated. Both revertants were characterized by similar expression of male fertility during plant ontogenesis: the panicle on the main tiller was almost completely sterile whereas formation of fertile pollen grains and seed set were observed on the panicles of the shoot tillers. A clear basipetal gradient of male fertility was manifested on all panicles: the base had significantly higher per cent of fertile pollen grains {{in comparison with the}} middle part, while in the top the anthers were either absent or had few sterile pollen grains. Such an ontogenetically-regulated restoration of male fertility was controlled by nuclear genes and could be transferred through the pollen in crosses with progenitor CMS-line. Growing of AS- 1 plants in the growth chambers simultaneously under a long (16 / 8) and a short (12 / 12) daylength conditions demonstrated that differences of fertility level in different tillers was not caused by change of photoperiod during plant ontogenesis and functioning of photoperiod-sensitive fertility restoring gene. Whereas, the ontogenetically-regulated expression of male fertility in both revenants was temperature-dependent and was clearly manifested under relatively cool conditions during 2 -week period before the beginning of anthesis of the first panicle (average daily temperature 21 °C). The increase of the average daily temperature by 2 - 3 С resulted in sharp increase of male fertility level. Possibility of using AS- 1 line in a new "two-line system" of hybrid seed production, which require only two lines (sterile mutant and fertility restorer), is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) {{is widely}} used as a dwarfing {{rootstock}} for pearPyrus communis L.). The disadvantage of this rootstock is its inefficient uptake of Fe, resulting in leaf chlorosis. Application of tissue culture and gene transfer techniques may lead to production of quince clones with improved Fe efficiency. Pear may benefit from transformation by transfer of genes involved in disease resistance, insect resistance and delay of ripening. The objectives of this research were: 1) to determine the responses of two <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variants,</b> 1 E- 1 and 1 E- 2, to Fe-deficiency stress under greenhouse conditions; and 2) to establish transformation procedures for quince and pear. Two <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variants</b> of quince, 1 E- 1 and 1 E- 2, with tolerance to low-Fe conditions were isolated previously (Dolcet-Sanjuan et at., 1992). These two variants were compared to the original Quince A clone under various conditions in the greenhouse in 1993 and 1994. Whereas Quince A was chlorotic under conditions with high pH (low Fe availability), the variants displayed only little chlorosis. Under those conditions, the chlorophyll and Fe 2 ⁺ concentrations in the leaves were significantly higher in the variants than in Quince A. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer protocols for quince and pear were devised using leaves as explants. Efforts were directed at the following: improving the regeneration system, selecting the best antibiotic to eliminate Agrobacterium while maintaining a high regeneration frequency, and identifying a suitable selectable marker. Regeneration of Quince A was improved by replacement of agar with 1. 6 g/l gelrite. Regeneration of the pear rootstock RV. 113 was enhanced by cold treatment of the shoot cultures used as explants. The antibiotic timentin, which consists of ticarcillin and a β-lactamase inhibitor, was more effective in eliminating Agrobacterium and less inhibitory to regeneration than cefotaxime and carbenicillin. Vectors containing the bar gene (bialaphos resistance) were chosen for transformation experiments since bialaphos caused less damage to the leaf explants than kanamycin at effective concentrations for selection of transformants. GUS (β-glucoronidase activity) assays showed that under the proper conditions, transformed tissues were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Random amplified {{polymorphic}} DNA (RAPD) {{analysis using}} 10 -mer oligonucleotide primers efficiently differentiated sugarcane cultivars and proved suitable for detecting gross genetic change {{such as that}} which can occur in sugarcane subjected to prolonged tissue culture, for example in protoplast-derived callus. However, RAPD analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to detect smaller genetic changes that occur during sugarcane genetic transformation. The length of DNA scored for polymorphism per primer averaged 13. 2 kb, or 0. 0001 % of the typical sugarcane genome size of 1. 2 × 10 kb (2 C). RAPD analysis of sugarcane plants regenerated from embryogenic callus revealed very few polymorphisms, indicating that gross genetic change is infrequent during this tissue culture procedure, although epigenetic effects result in transient morphological changes in regenerated plants. More sensitive variations on the RAPD technique may increase the practicality of DNA-based screening of regenerated plant lines to reveal <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the yearly}} {{increase}} {{in the numbers of}} new potato varieties obtaining Plant Breeders’ Rights the reliable maintenance of large culture collections of reference varieties for DUS testing {{is becoming more and more}} difficult, as accidental mix ups might occur. Efficient identification methods and databases can act as an aid to overcome this problem. Identification of cultivars by morphological characteristics is a highly skilled and time-consuming task, and for these reasons a rapid and robust method for variety differentiation has become extremely desirable. By use of a set of nine microsatellite (SSR) markers we can differentiate over 1, 000 cultivars, including the majority of varieties on the European Union Common Catalogue, but excluding <b>somaclonal</b> <b>variants</b> (e. g. Red King Edward and King Edward) and mutants. The whole identification process from DNA extraction to accurate identification can be carried out in a single day...|$|R
