40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{suitable}} <b>satellite</b> <b>multimedia</b> network architecture and the results of simulated medium access control (MAC) protocols. The new generation of <b>satellite</b> <b>multimedia</b> networks is going to handle different types of traffic such as multimedia traffic. The ATM technology was developed for the integrated transmission of various types of traffic. The future networks protocols should be as much as possible compatible and that is one of the main reasons to think about the use of ATM technology for transmission over satellites. Satellite networks present a lot of challenges related to quality of services (QoS) provision and the medium access control access protocols are strongly related to QoS provision.

40|$|AbstractAccording {{to large}} {{coverage}} of satellites, {{there are various}} channel states in a satellite broadcasting network. In order to introduce an efficient rateless transmission method to <b>satellite</b> <b>multimedia</b> broadcasting/multicast services with finite-length packets, a cross-layer packet transmission method is proposed with Luby transform (LT) codes for efficiency in the network layer and low density parity check (LDPC) codes for reliability in the physical layer jointly. The codewords generated from an LT encoder are divided into finite-length packets, which are encoded by an LDPC encoder subsequently. Based on noise and fading effects of satellite channels, the LT packets received from an LDPC decoder either have no error or are marked as erased, which can be modeled as a binary erasure channels (BECs). By theoretical analysis on LT parameters and LDPC parameters, the relationships between LDPC code rates in the physical layer and LT codes word lengths in the network layer are investigated. With tradeoffs between the LT codes word lengths and the LDPC code rates, optimized cross-layer solutions are achieved with a binary search algorithm. Verified by simulations, the proposed solution for cross-layer parameters design can provide the best transmission mode according to satellite states, so as to improve throughput performance for <b>satellite</b> <b>multimedia</b> transmission...|$|R
