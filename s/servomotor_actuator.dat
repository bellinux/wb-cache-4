50|$|The IAC {{actuator}} is an electrically controlled device, {{which gets}} its {{input from the}} vehicle's ECU. The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the throttle butterfly valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo <b>actuator</b> <b>servomotor</b> that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the servomotor and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the engine's idle speed to be maintained constant.

Focused on the S-shape {{deviation}} {{problem in}} the narrow fabric production process, this paper introduces an intelligent control system with DC <b>servomotor</b> as the <b>actuator</b> for an intermediate guide roll system. To improve the dynamic performance of the deviation control system and solve the motor vibration problem, the deviation control algorithm is proposed, which is related to intelligent PD feedback control combined with the feed-forward regulation for the system deviation, and its MatLab simulation results show its good performances and advantages. Furthermore, a technical approach for the deviation controller using DSP processor chip TMS 320 F 2812 is presented.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral para la obtención del Título de Grado de Doctor. xxiv, 191 p. : il., diagr. Fecha de defensa de la Tesis Doctoral: 13 de diciembre de 2012. Bats are {{animals that}} posses high {{maneuvering}} capabilities. Their wings contain dozens of articulations {{that allow the}} animal to perform aggressive maneuvers by means of controlling the wing shape during flight (morphing-wings). There is no other flying creature in nature with this level of wing dexterity and there is biological evidence that the inertial forces produced by the wings have {{a key role in}} the attitude movements of the animal. This can inspire the design of highly articulated morphing-wing micro air vehicles (not necessarily bat-like) with a significant wing-to-body mass ratio. This thesis presents the development of a novel bat-like micro air vehicle (BaTboT) inspired by the morphing-wing mechanism of bats. BaTboT¿s morphology is alike in proportion compared to its biological counterpart Cynopterus brachyotis, which provides the biological foundations for developing accurate mathematical models and methods that allow for mimicking bat flight. In nature bats can achieve an amazing level of maneuverability by combining flap- ping and morphing wingstrokes. Attempting to reproduce the biological wing ac- tuation system that provides that kind of motion using an artificial counterpart requires the analysis of alternative actuation technologies more likely muscle fiber arrays instead of standard <b>servomotor</b> <b>actuators.</b> Thus, NiTinol Shape Memory Al- loys (SMAs) acting as artificial biceps and triceps muscles are used for mimicking the morphing wing mechanism of the bat flight apparatus. This antagonistic con- figuration of SMA-muscles response to an electrical heating power signal to operate. This heating power is regulated by a proper controller that allows for accurate and fast SMA actuation. Morphing-wings will enable to change wings geometry with the unique purpose of enhancing aerodynamics performance. During the downstroke phase of the wingbeat motion both wings are fully extended aimed at increasing the area surface to properly generate lift forces. Contrary during the upstroke phase of the wingbeat motion both wings are retracted to minimize the area and thus reducing drag forces. Morphing-wings do not only improve on aerodynamics but also on the inertial forces that are key to maneuver. Thus, a modeling framework is introduced for analyzing how BaTboT should maneuver by means of changing wing morphology. This allows the definition of requirements for achieving forward and turning flight according to the kinematics of the wing modulation. Motivated by the biological fact about the influence of wing inertia on the production of body accelerations, an attitude controller is proposed. The attitude control law incorporates wing inertia informa- tion to produce desired roll (¿) and pitch (¿) acceleration commands. This novel flight control approach is aimed at incrementing net body forces (Fnet) that generate propulsion. Mimicking the way how bats take advantage of inertial and aerodynamical forces produced by the wings in order to both increase lift and maneuver is a promising way to design more efficient flapping/morphing wings MAVs. The novel wing modulation strategy and attitude control methodology proposed in this thesis provide a totally new way of controlling flying robots, that eliminates the need of appendices such as flaps and rudders, and would allow performing more efficient maneuvers, especially useful in confined spaces.

40|$|Groundnut is {{predominantly}} grown by communal farmers in Zimbabwe. The price of shelled kernel is approximately {{double that of}} pod. Hand shelling of peanuts is a time consuming and laborious process which is mostly used in the remote areas in Zimbabwe. Manual shelling of peanuts using â€œManual Shellerâ€™sâ€ has been adopted to reduce the time invested in hand shelling. These machines have high defective rates of almost 50 % which reduce the overall gain achieved by the farmer after harvesting. As a result, the need has risen to design an automated powered peanut Sheller machine automated using a Program Logic Controller and having a <b>servomotor</b> as its <b>actuator</b> to solve the high labour, huge amounts of time lost through shelling and the low efficiency of previous Sheller designs. First hand results were obtained in this project by determining the crushing force required to shell peanuts at approximately 10 % moisture content.

Shelling throughput, automatic gap adjustment, shelling efficiency, mechanical damage {{are some of the}} parameters used to determine the overall performance of the peanut Sheller. However exhaustive research on peanut engineering properties has to be done in future to lay out a foundation for improved future designs. On an overall note, this project includes the design and assembling of different components {{to come up with an}} environmentally friendly machine that meets the set objectives...|$|R
