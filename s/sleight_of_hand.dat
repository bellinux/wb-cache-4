5|$|Because of {{its heavy}} use and {{practice}} by magicians, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> is often confused as {{a branch of}} magic, but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> without the slightest interest in magic.|$|E
5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection {{and years of}} practice. For these reasons, the term <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> in his stage shows.|$|E

5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E

5|$|Unlike card tricks done on {{the streets}} or on stage and card cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without illusions, deceit, {{misdirection}} and other elements commonly used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry, or card flourishes, are always intended to be visually impressive and appear extremely difficult to perform. Card flourishing {{is often associated with}} card tricks, but many <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> artists perform flourishing without considering themselves magicians or having any real interest in card tricks.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E

5000|$|Other critics saw {{the work}} as a magical tour de force. Joyce Carol Oates, writing in The New York Review of Books, said: “Of {{literary}} <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> none is more exhilarating for the writer, as none {{is likely to be}} riskier, than the appropriation of another—classic—writer’s voice.” [...] In the Globe and Mail, reviewer William Kowalski wrote: “I had hoped that there was someone like Dickinson out there. My one regret, after finding her, was that I would never get to make her acquaintance. No doubt millions of others feel the same. It’s for us that Jerome Charyn has written this book.” ...|$|R
50|$|Carpenter was a {{successful}} mystery novelist in the 1970s and 1980s. One of his books, Deadhead, {{was turned into a}} Broadway musical.

5|$|The art of card {{throwing}} generally {{consist of}} throwing standard playing cards with excessively high speed and accuracy, {{powerful enough to}} slice fruits like carrots and even melons. Like flourishing, throwing cards {{are meant to be}} visibly impressive and does not include magic elements. Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> industry with the release of his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The New York Observer stated Witz [...] [...] [...] [...] "is {{the sort of}} postmodern epic that arrives like a comet about once every decade, like Infinite Jest or Gravity's Rainbow. Like any epic, it defies summary and overflows with puns, allusions, digressions, authorial <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and structural gags-in the tradition of Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce, Jonathan Swift and Laurence Sterne." [...] Its extravagant imagined world also suggests William Burroughs and Hunter Thompson, {{as well as the}} paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. Its voice, however, is consistently in the rhythms and vocabulary of New York Yiddish.|$|R
60|$|Of all {{the wondrous}} devices and dexterities, the <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and countless subtleties, {{to which the}} veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that fine {{manoeuvre}} with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter {{than that of the}} harpoon, and also of a lighter material--pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting.|$|R
500|$|As {{they are}} the movie's [...] "central {{dramatic}} piece", the encoffining ceremonies in Departures have received extensive commentary. Mike Scott, for instance, wrote in The Times-Picayune that these scenes were beautiful and heartbreaking, and Nicholas Barber of The Independent described them as [...] "elegant and dignified". James Adams of The Globe and Mail wrote {{that they were a}} [...] "dignified ritual of calming, hypnotic grace, with <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> bordering on the magicianly". As the film continues, Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald opined, the audience gains an improved knowledge of the ceremony and its importance. Viewers see that the ceremonies are not simply about preparing the body, but also about [...] "bring dignity to death, respect to the deceased and solace to those who grieve", through which the encoffiners are able to help repair broken family ties and heal damage done to those left behind.|$|R
25|$|Deception is {{the act of}} {{propagating}} {{beliefs in}} {{things that are not}} true, or not the whole truth (as in half-truths or lying by omission).

40|$|Arthur Levitt (Holdings and Carlsen, 1999, A 1) : “Too many {{corporate}} managers, auditors {{and analysts}} are {{participants in a}} game of nods and winks.

How many half-truths, and how many accounting <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> will it take to tarnish that faith? ” Crenshaw and Fromson (1998, H 1) similarly noted, “As in most professions, the real problems aren’t the big things- the gross breaches of ethics- but the little things. What clients want isn’t an outright lie, but a shading that casts the client’s situation in the most favorable light. ” And more recently, U. S. Representative John Dingell (2001) chastised the profession saying, “The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and auditing processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers or untruthful reporting. ...|$|R
5000|$|Lovers prose is {{distinctly}} postmodern, eschewing conventional narrative {{for experimental}} narrative techniques. In contrast to some lesbian novels of the time, such as Rita Mae Browns Rubyfruit Jungle (also, incidentally, published by Daughters), which used a prototypical bildungsroman technique with a lesbian placed squarely at the center, Lover reflects complex notions of radical lesbian philosophy, community, family structure, and eroticism by using highly inventive, often fantastical storytelling techniques. In Harriss {{introduction to the}} 1993 edition, she writes, [...] "Lover should be absorbed {{as if it were}} a theatrical performance. Theres tap dancing and singing, disguise, <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> mirror illusions, quick-change acts, and drag." [...] Amanda C. Gable has argued that Lover [...] "can be considered an exemplary novel within discussions of both postmodern fiction and lesbian (or queer) theory," [...] and calls for [...] "Harris to be added to the group of writers such as Wittig, Anzaldúa, Lorde, and Winterson, who are discussed within the context of a postmodern lesbian narrative." ...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{the author}} started selling {{the book for}} $2.00 in 1902 {{and the next year}} it dropped to $1.00 and he sold the rights. Although the author did not renew the copyright, the book has {{remained}} in print since 1902, albeit small private printings on occasion. [...] The influence of this book is such that it has been issued in annotated form; translated into Japanese, German, Spanish, French, and Italian; and issued as a series of DVDs by a professional magician, demonstrating and explaining Erdnase's techniques and methods. Among numerous demonstrations of techniques described in the book, the most comprehensive reviews <b>of</b> the <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> are the same-titled DVDs published by Allan Ackerman, Wesley James, R.

25|$|John Taylor {{has written}} {{there is no}} real case for psychic surgery as the {{explanation}} of fraud is highly likely in all the operations. The practitioners use <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> techniques to produce blood or blood-like fluids, animal tissue or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a confidence trick for financial benefit.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie Marcus, an Israeli psychic and {{claimant}} of psychokinetic metal bending, was tested in 1994 in scientifically controlled conditions {{and failed to}} produce any paranormal phenomena. According to magicians, his alleged psychokinetic feats were <b>sleight</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> tricks. Marcus bent a letter opener by the concealed application of force and a frame-by-frame analysis of video showed that he bent a spoon from pressure from his thumb by ordinary, physical means.|$|E
50|$|In {{his work}} on parapsychology, Marks adopts a sceptical {{analysis}} of paranormal claims. He published evidence in Nature that the original claims of remote viewing experiments were based on flawed experimental procedures. Marks also published evidence in The Psychology of the Psychic (1980, 2nd edn. 2000; co-authored with the late Richard Kammann; forewords to both editions by Martin Gardner) that Uri Geller was able to hoodwink scientists, journalists and the {{many members of the}} public with a series of simple but audacious <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> In that book, which investigates anomalistic psychology and describes case studies of paranormal claims together with a set of principles for explaining how people may come to believe so strongly in the paranormal claims. This includes the concept of subjective validation, a process through which people find a correspondence between randomly paired events, including coincidences (Marks, 2000). In 1986, while working in New Zealand with the late Denis Dutton, Marks co-founded the NZ Skeptics. He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI).|$|R
40|$|Notions of the ‘central’ – as a dense core – have {{dominated}} the sense that urbanisation is replete with the possibilities of accessibility, concentration, efficiency, and productive power. The city was thought to culminate in a centre, an almost mystical gravitational pull that would pull materials and bodies into its regard. If there were any doubt as {{to the existence of}} such an overarching organizational force, its location was marked with excess – as the physical dimension of the built environment and valuations of all kinds would inflate. In some respects the affirmation of a centre as far as cities are concerned would prove somewhat counter-intuitive to urbanization processes seemingly more inclined to disperse, multiply and fragment rather than gather up. Distinctions between a clearly discernible centre and periphery, and other such gradations, historically have proven ambiguous as indicators of a capacity to make things happen. Centres have always seemed unduly aided by various administrative <b>sleights</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> things that would seem to slow down rather than quicken urbanized relations (Pacione 2009; Parker 2006; Soja 2000).
