40|$|AbstractBased on the {{differences}} of operation characters between ATC service and manufacturing industry, this paper researched {{the implication of}} safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service</b> by combining the latest implication of process capability and safety. And this paper established the elemental composition system made of safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service,</b> which is composed of 4 second-level elements and 15 third-level index. The 4 second-level index includes personnel capability, equipment capability, environmental capability and management capability. Considering the fuzziness of each index, the value of <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service</b> was confirmed by fuzzymatter- element analysis method and entropy weighting method. With evaluating ATC service of ATM division by this safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> model, it was indicated that this ATM division possessed strong safety <b>services</b> <b>capability,</b> personnel capability. Equipment capability was stronger than environment capability. It was conformed to the fact. The evidences showed that this safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> model for ATC service is practical, feasible, and conformed {{to the level of}} actual safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the world economy have had a {{significant}} impact on container shipping in recent decades. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> are related to competitive advantage and organizational performance. When encountering an environment characterized by economic uncertainty, the shipping industry was required to emphasize dynamic capabilities associated with adaptation to sustain competitive advantage. The purpose of this study was to examine the linkages between dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> <b>service</b> <b>capabilities,</b> competitive advantage, and organizational performance in container shipping using data surveys from 134 respondents in container shipping firms in Taiwan. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to identify the crucial dimensions underlying dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> and <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The research findings indicated that dynamic capabilities positively influenced both competitive advantage and <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>capabilities</b> and competitive advantage were positively related to organizational performance. Practical implications of the research findings for container shipping firms are discussed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} described in this paper is to evaluate the relationship between the <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> and performance of UK and Taiwanese third-party logistics (3 PL) providers. A study is presented based on a recent survey. The results identify the most important services offered by 3 PLs and the most important aspects of 3 PL operational performance. The results also suggest that excellence in operations is more important than wide-ranging service provision. Furthermore, {{the research}} suggests that the range of service provision offered by 3 PLs does not directly influence the 3 PLs' financial performance. However, 3 PL providers with <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> that correspond to the key priorities of customers will gain superior financial performance through a better operational performance.

40|$|AbstractSMEs need to {{innovate}} in services {{in order to}} survive and to create value. Service SMEs are facing the challenge of offering their customers continuously improved or completely new services and hence require service innovations to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. We used <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> to assess <b>service</b> innovation <b>capability</b> of SMEs. <b>Service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> is a holistic approach which consists of Strategic capability, Managerial capability, Organizational capability and Adaptive capability to transform an SME into a value creation SME. It offers an overview of <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> and activities against which service SMEs can critically reflect their service innovation performance. Our research primary focus is to explore and to find the relationship of <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> with <b>service</b> innovation <b>capability</b> and to assess the service innovation by using a proposed model for <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability.</b> The model is empirically validated in Danish and Turkish SMEs to identify the correlation between the service value creation and service innovation through an integrated <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> model analysis. The empirical data analysis reveals that there is strong positive correlation between the SME's <b>service</b> innovation <b>capability</b> and <b>service</b> value creation <b>capability</b> (strategic capability, managerial capability, operational capability and adaptive capability) ...|$|R
