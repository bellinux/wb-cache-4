They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the Astra <b>satellite</b> <b>transponder.</b> The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although he too was impressed, SBC's offer eventually failed because of sponsorship doubts.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the launch}} of CNN, other cable news {{channels}} launched {{in an attempt to}} capitalize on the channel's growing success, which often had marginal to no success in competing with CNN. One of the first was Satellite News Channel, which launched on June 21, 1982 with a mix of national and regionally focused newscasts; after the channel ceased operations on October 27, 1983, its <b>satellite</b> <b>transponder</b> slot was subsequently purchased by Ted Turner to expand the distribution of Headline News further into additional homes.|$|E
25|$|By 1968, NTV {{put forward}} its first {{official}} license application, {{under which the}} original 96 transmitters would be supplemented by 43 more transmitters to distribute a separate French language service, along with provisions for the free distribution of CBC Television, Radio-Canada and a new noncommercial educational television service on the network's <b>satellite.</b> <b>Transponder</b> space would also be leased to CTV and Télé-Métropole, but as competing commercial services {{they would not have}} been granted the free distribution rights the plan offered to the public television services. However, after federal communications minister Paul Hellyer announced plans to move forward with the publicly owned Anik series of broadcast satellites through Telesat Canada instead of leaving the rollout of satellite technology in the hands of private corporations, Power Corporation backed out of the application and left NTV in limbo.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, ABC sold KXYZ to the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. On January 4, 1984, The New York Times {{reported}} that ABC, through its subsidiary ABC Video Enterprises, had exercised its {{option to purchase}} up to 15% (or between $25 million and $30 million) of Getty Oil's shares in ESPN, which would allow it to expand its shares at a later date. In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts & Entertainment Television (A); the new channel subsequently leased a separate <b>satellite</b> <b>transponder,</b> ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service. Meanwhile, ABC withdrew from the theme park business for good when it sold the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park.|$|E
25|$|A {{launched}} on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television {{homes in the}} U.S. and Canada. The network {{is a result of}} the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC's Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel. When A debuted, the channel took over the <b>satellite</b> <b>transponder</b> timeslot that ARTS occupied from its launch in 1981. Children's television channel Nickelodeon signed off just before 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, and A took over at 9:00p.m. with a three-hour programming block, which was repeated at 9:00p.m. Pacific Time. In January 1985, A moved to its own dedicated transponder and began delivering its programming 24 hours a day, while Nickelodeon replaced the vacated A programming with a classic television block, Nick at Nite, on July 1 of that year. However, some cable providers continued to carry Nickelodeon and A on the same channel and would usually switch over to A at 8:00p.m. Eastern. It was not until the early 1990s, when providers began installing advanced headend equipment that allowed for expanded channel capacity, that these companies allocated separate channels for both networks.|$|E

With the introduction of the IntelliStar system (the sixth-generation STAR system, which was introduced in 2002), traffic information was also generated that provided roadway flow, construction and accident information for metropolitan areas where traffic.com (via its TrafficPulse service) provides traffic data; however, this feature was eliminated from the IntelliStar's programmed [...] "flavors" [...] (the arrangements of specialized segments played during individual local forecasts) when traffic.com ended its content agreement with TWC in 2010.|$|E
