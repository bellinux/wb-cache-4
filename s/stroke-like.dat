5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent <b>stroke-like</b> episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

25|$|Cavernous sinus {{thrombosis}} is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, {{where there}} is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura, due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face. The facial veins in this area anastomose with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins of the orbit, which drain directly posteriorly into the cavernous sinus through the superior orbital fissure. Staphyloccoal or Streptococcal infections of the face, for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus, causing <b>stroke-like</b> symptoms of double vision, squint, as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the central}} nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the {{peripheral}} nervous system may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause <b>stroke-like</b> episodes, headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as amaurosis fugax). Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst. Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis (decreased power in the legs) or cauda equina syndrome, a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the bladder, rectum and skin sensation around the anus. If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, {{one needs to}} understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return <b>stroke-like</b> process occurs and a dart leader travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.|$|E

50|$|MELAS is a {{condition}} that affects many of the body's systems, particularly the brain and nervous system (encephalo-) and muscles (myopathy). In most cases, the {{signs and symptoms of}} this disorder appear in childhood following a period of normal development. Early symptoms may include muscle weakness and pain, recurrent headaches, loss of appetite, vomiting, and seizures. Most affected individuals experience <b>stroke-like</b> episodes beginning before age 40. These episodes often involve temporary muscle weakness {{on one side of the}} body (hemiparesis), altered consciousness, vision abnormalities, seizures, and severe headaches resembling migraines. Repeated <b>stroke-like</b> episodes can progressively damage the brain, leading to vision loss, problems with movement, and a loss of intellectual function (dementia). The <b>stroke-like</b> episodes can be mis-diagnosed as epilepsy by a doctor not aware of the MELAS condition.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 Brain et al. {{described}} a 49-year-old man with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who presented with <b>stroke-like</b> episodes and subsequently delirium. The patient {{did not respond}} to prednisone, but eventually recovered, leading Brain to suggest that autoimmune mechanisms might be responsible. Since that time, there have been many further cases reported in the literature of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. The term Hashimoto's encephalopathy is used to describe an encephalopathy of presumed autoimmune origin characterized by high titres of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is more common in women than in men. It has been reported in paediatric, adult and elderly populations throughout the world. The clinical presentation may involve a relapsing and remitting course and include seizures, <b>stroke-like</b> episodes, cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms and myoclonus. Thyroid function is usually clinically and biochemically normal. It is likely that antithyroid antibodies are not pathogenic, but titres can be a marker of treatment response. Pathological findings can suggest an inflammatory process, but features of a severe vasculitis are often absent.|$|E
50|$|Because Non-parenchymal NBD targets {{vascular}} structures, {{the symptoms}} {{arise in the}} same area. The main clinical characteristic is the cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). If one experiences CVT, a clot {{in one of the}} blood vessels in the brain blocks the blood flow and may result in stroke. This happens in the dural venous sinuses. <b>Stroke-like</b> symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and dizziness may be monitored. Headache tends to worsen over the period of several days.|$|E

50|$|Not all of {{the above}} manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia. There is no {{consistent}} order to the appearance of the symptoms. Specific manifestations vary by age and by the severity of the hypoglycemia. In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble mania, mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal <b>stroke-like</b> effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person do tend to be similar from episode to episode.|$|E
50|$|There are {{uncommon}} {{cases of}} more persistent harm, and rarely even death due to severe hypoglycemia of this type. One reason hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin {{can be more}} dangerous is that insulin lowers the available amounts of most alternate brain fuels, such as ketones. Brain damage of various types ranging from <b>stroke-like</b> focal effects to impaired memory and thinking can occur. Children who have prolonged or recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy can suffer harm to their brains and may be developmentally delayed.|$|E
50|$|A small {{percentage}} of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and <b>stroke-like</b> episodes (MELAS) are caused by a G>A mutation at base pair 13513 in the MT-ND5 gene. Mutations in the MT-ND5 gene cause impaired Complex I function of the mitochondrial electron transport system, impairing those tissues that require significant energy input, such as the brain and muscles. Those with MT-ND5 mutations can display the major features of MELAS in some patients, as well as symptoms of Leigh's syndrome and/or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in others.|$|E
50|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH), {{also known as}} benign {{intracranial hypertension}} (BIH) or pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), is a neurological disorder that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) {{in the absence of}} a tumor or other diseases. The main symptoms are <b>stroke-like</b> headache, nausea, and vomiting, as well as pulsatile tinnitus (sounds perceived in the ears, with the sound occurring in the same rhythm as the pulse), double vision and other visual symptoms. If untreated, it may lead to swelling of the optic disc in the eye, which can progress to vision loss.|$|E
