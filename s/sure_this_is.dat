500|$|In Arguing about Gods, Graham Oppy {{offers a}} dissent, {{acknowledging}} that [...] "any philosophers seem {{to suppose that}} [...] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" [...] but continuing [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a correct assessment of {{the current state of}} play". Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.” Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the problem of evil presently revolves around the evidential problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.|$|E
500|$|For writing Ibuki, Zubkavich was {{nominated}} for a Joe Shuster Award. He said that, compared to Sakura, [...] "Ibuki's a more complex character, more flawed. She's a great ninja but she isn't even <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what she wants out of life. (...) Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, but I feel Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the life I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Karpinski told Spain's El País {{newspaper}} she {{had seen}} a letter apparently signed by Rumsfeld that allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation. [...] She stated, [...] "The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques." [...] According to Karpinski, Rumsfeld's handwritten signature was above his printed name {{and in the same}} handwriting in the margin was written: [...] "Make <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> accomplished." ...|$|E
2500|$|... magine {{the time}} when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a good idea, and others notice it. They {{naturally}} imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But {{the first man to}} invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule {{flies in the face of}} the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what he was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E

2500|$|A 2004 {{report by}} the New Yorker stated that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had {{authorized}} the interrogation tactics used in Abu Ghraib, and which had previously {{been used by the}} US in Afghanistan. In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's El País newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation. [...] "The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques." [...] According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name, and the comment [...] "Make <b>sure</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> accomplished" [...] was in the margin in the same hand-writing. Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques that he knew to be illegal under international law.|$|E
