25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and sarong in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a sarong that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of sarong depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a difference in the way a dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi is more like a wrap around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E

5000|$|Time {{dilation}} {{refers to}} the expansion or contraction in {{the rate at which}} time passes, and was the subject of the Gravity Probe A experiment. Under Einstein's theory of general relativity, matter distorts the surrounding spacetime, so that the space, in particular, gets bent similar to the way a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> would bend if a bowling ball was dropped {{in the middle of the}} sheet. But the distortion manifest itself in the time direction as well: the time would appear for a distant observer to flow slower in the vicinity of a massive object. For example, the metric, surrounding a spherically symmetric gravitating body, has a smaller coefficient at [...] closer to the body, which means slower rate of time flow there.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} linenfold {{style is}} [...] "parchemin" [...] (also known as [...] "parchment fold"), a low relief carving formed like {{a sheet of}} paper or piece of linen folded in half and then spread out with the sharp centered fold running vertically, and the top and bottom running out to the corners of the panel, with something of the appearance of an opened book. This style of linenfold can be created using a plane and a pre-drawn pattern, with a little finishing chisel work required at each end. A stitched embroidered border could be counterfeited by the use of punches. More complicated styles resemble a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> that has volute folds back and forth many times. Linenfold might be fielded, visually complete against a flat panel surface and contained within each panel, or it might provide the appearance of a continuous linenfold passing behind the stiles of the framing.|$|E

Speaking about the inspiration behind the idea, Williams said, [...] "The thought was that we are currently living {{in a time when}} we could really use a more feminine spirit in our leadership and a way to illustrate this might be to celebrate some of the great female pioneers of the past." [...] Bono wanted to find [...] "the sort of women that aren't welcome, that President Trump doesn't want in America" [...] and commissioned French artist JR to find such a person. After traveling to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, he found a 15-year-old Syrian refugee named Omaima. Performances of [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] are preceded by a clip of her speaking of America as a dreamland, which Bono said [...] "gives you a kick in the balls, but in the most velvet way".

40|$|Fabric {{formwork}} {{is a novel}} {{concrete construction}} method which replaces conventional prismatic moulds with lightweight, high strength <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric.</b> The geometry <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> formed structures is therefore dictated by the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> under hydrostatic loading. While there are numerous examples of digital and physical modelling of this problem, there have only been limited efforts to link the two through measurement. In this investigation, a number <b>of</b> small scale <b>fabric</b> formed beams were manufactured using both ‘free hanging’ and ‘keel mould’ methods, and the resulting forms were accurately measured with a digital 3 D scanner. Computational form finding tools were also developed, enabling a comparison to be made between the predicted and build geometries. This allowed assessment of both {{the accuracy of the}} construction methods and the limitations of the form finding techniques used. The data collected provides a useful assessment of existing form finding techniques and will be used as a reference data set as these are developed further...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Searching for {{signatures}} of fossil or present life {{in our solar}} system requires autonomous devices capable of investigating remote locations with limited assistance from earth. Here, we use an artificial chemistry model to create spatially complex chemical environments. An autonomous experimentation technique based on evolutionary computation is then employed to explore these environments with the aim of discovering the chemical signature of small patches of biota present in the simulation space. In the highly abstracted environment considered, autonomous experimentation achieves fair to good predictions for locations with biological activity. We believe that artificially generated biospheres will be an important tool for developing the algorithms key to the search for life on Mars. 1 Life Detecting Machines A spot of rust on a sheet of steel has much in common with a spot of mold on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric.</b> Discerning alive matter among dead matter is a challenge eve...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of automating the garment manufacturing {{process has been}} understood since the early 1980 s. However, in spite {{of millions of dollars}} spent on research, three decades later, the industry is still far from achieving a fully autonomous process. Previous work on fabric control in automated sewing focused on the control of only a single <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> using an industrial manipulator with an overhead vision system. These methods did not meet the accuracy and robustness requirements of the sewing process with respect to fabric position and fabric tension. To address these issues, a new method for fabric control in automated sewing is described. It uses the current feed mechanism on sewing machines, feed dogs, but modifies them to be servo-controlled. These servo controlled actuators, servo dogs, individually control two sheets of fabric before the fabric reaches the needle and during the sewing process. The servo dogs actuate the fabric 180 o out of phase with the sewing needle, providing incremental control of the fabric when the needle is out of the fabric. To achieve this type of control successfully for automated sewing, the servo dogs have been designed for short displacement, high acceleration motions using a cable drive system powered by voice coil motors. Feedback of fabric position has been determined to be necessary and is to be provided by a thread-tracking vision system. This thesis outlines the general design of the system and discusses a prototype used to validate the design, and describes experiments performed to examine how the fabric will behave with the use of this type of actuation method.

The results of these tests demonstrate how a fabric formwork construction system may be used to facilitate a sustainable future for concrete construction, providing a design method by which structurally optimised elements may be cast in an economical manner while also providing significant durability and visual benefits that combined provide an advantageous whole-life performance for fabric formed concrete that is unmatched by many other construction systems...|$|R

With increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>sheets,</b> the <b>fabric</b> size and the wash spin speed, fabrics had a tendency to move a longer distance along the drum wall, and thus the most frequent movement shifted from sliding or falling to rotating. The fabric movement patterns during the washing process that were varied according to the washing conditions had a direct effect on washing efficiency. The complex movement pattern, which showed the movements of sliding, falling and rotating by turns during the washing process, exhibited higher washing efficiency than the single movement pattern that represented only sliding or rotating repeatedly...|$|R
