5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may <b>squeal,</b> bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male <b>squeal</b> approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or <b>squeal.</b> During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression {{is similar to that of}} the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E
5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also <b>squeal</b> while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the <b>squeal</b> of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E

50|$|Female {{mountain}} tapirs have a 30-day estrous cycle, {{and typically}} breed {{only once every}} other year. During courtship, the male chases the female and uses soft bites, grunts, and <b>squeals</b> to get her attention, while the female responds with frequent <b>squealing.</b> After a gestation period of 392 or 393 days, the female gives birth to a single young; multiple births are very rare.|$|R
40|$|Curve <b>squealing</b> of {{railroad}} vehicles occurs when trains run through narrow curves and a given set of at-mospheric and mechanical conditions are present. The modal {{characteristics of the}} wheel play an impor-tant role in this phenomenon and have therefore been studied. The numerical {{as well as the}} experimental determination of its eigenforms and eigenvalues have been performed. The modal damping coefficients of the wheel have also been measured. When curve <b>squealing</b> occurs, it is supposed that a limit cycle between wheel and rail is established. In or-der to numerically simulate curve <b>squealing,</b> a general multi-body contact problem with Coulomb friction and unilateral contact is set up. The dynamic response of the wheel is evaluated by superposition of its modes. The time-integration is performed with a time-stepping method and the solution of the contact problem is con-ducted with the Augmented Lagrangian algorithm.

25|$|Black bears may {{communicate}} with various vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking and grunting {{are the most}} common sounds and are made in cordial situations to conspecifics, offspring, and occasionally humans. During times of fear or nervousness, bears may moan, huff or blow air. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping. In aggressive interactions, black bears produce deep-throated pulsing sounds. Cubs may <b>squeal,</b> bawl or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

25|$|The {{brake pads}} must usually be {{replaced}} regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), {{and some are}} equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to <b>squeal,</b> a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.|$|E
25|$|In 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs {{were used}} as decoys and were transported in strong canvas sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the canvas bags, were made to <b>squeal</b> {{in order to attract}} the wolves. Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot the wolves when they came out after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and canvas bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|E
25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake <b>squeal</b> and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a puff of smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a <b>squeal,</b> whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
25|$|Navy {{recruiter}} Don C. Lingle, originally of Anna, Illinois, {{working at}} the office in Marion, Illinois, decided to auction the pig to raise war bonds. Lingle and auctioneer L. Oard Sitter traveled throughout southern Illinois auctioning Neptune for bonds for the battleship Illinois which was under construction. Eventually, the individual parts of the pig were auctioned; his <b>squeal</b> was auctioned for $25 {{on at least one}} occasion. After each auction, King Neptune was returned to be auctioned again later. High demand for appearances by Neptune led them to travel the rest of Illinois raising funds. The mostly red, with white features, Hereford was often displayed covered with a blue Navy blanket and wearing a crown and silver earrings.|$|E
25|$|Vocalizations are variable, {{and some}} are listed as follows: (1) ua - a soft bark given {{repeatedly}} and used by {{all members of the}} group when danger is perceived; (2) ya - excited animals around the alpha, towards alpha and towards perceived danger; (3) eh-eh - threat towards potential danger, but especially adult females; accompanied with open mouth showing teeth (OMT); (4) squeaky hinge - threat given especially by young animals; (5) <b>squeal</b> - conflict within the group during a fight; (6) whistle - conflict in the group of a young animal; (7) ahr - a lost animal; others answer this call, apparently to direct it back to the group; (8) uh!uh!uh! - a common vocalization during feeding which may allow contact to be maintained and show general contentment; (9) uch!uch! - an animal {{trying to keep up with}} the group; (10) warble - young animals establishing contact or coming close to an adult; (11) purr - close and pacific contact; (12) chirriar - pacific interaction of young ones during play.|$|E

25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, <b>squeal,</b> and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, wrestle with each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.|$|E
500|$|The cart, {{constructed}} of native materials, {{could easily be}} repaired. A supply of shaganappi and wood was carried as a cart could break a half-dozen axles in a one-way trip. [...] The axles were unlubricated, as grease would capture dust which would act as sandpaper and immobilize the cart. [...] The resultant <b>squeal</b> sounded like an untuned violin, giving it the sobriquet of [...] "the North West fiddle". One visitor wrote that [...] "a den of wild beasts cannot be compared with its hideousness". [...] The noise was audible for miles. The carts were completely unsprung, and only their flexible construction cushioned the shocks transmitted from the humps and hollows of the trail.|$|E
500|$|Elephants produce several sounds, usually {{through the}} larynx, though {{some may be}} {{modified}} by the trunk. Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression. Fighting elephants may roar or <b>squeal,</b> and wounded ones may bellow. Rumbles are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be infrasonic. Infrasonic calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication, in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90dB and last 10–15 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15–35Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around [...]|$|E
