500|$|Although pure silica is a {{perfectly}} viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass {{in the form of}} other materials to lower its working temperature. These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> <b>glass</b> or A-glass ("A" [...] for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (<2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy E-glass.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper shows {{that the use of}} the single aliquot regeneration (SAR) method for thermoluminescence (TL) measurements applied to <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> <b>glasses</b> allows to carry out a retrospective dose evaluation. We have followed a fast and efficient sample preparation procedure which permits measurements without powdering and sieving processes. We have analyzed the TL signal of commercial <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> watch <b>glass</b> irradiated with 6 Mega Volts (MV) LINAC photons, 10 MeV LINAC electrons and 62 MeV protons. After the initial exposure and following TL reading, the samples are successively irradiated with increasing doses of photons. Therefore, for each sample its calibration curve is constructed and the initial dose is reconstructed. We have found that for samples initially irradiated with photons the SAR procedure allows to reconstruct dose of 1 Gy with an accuracy of 20 %. The application of the SAR procedure has highlighted the ability of measuring even low photon doses (e. g. ≈ 0. 5 Gy) with appreciable accuracy. The application of the SAR method for samples initially exposed to electrons and protons provides values of reconstructed doses less accurate. The effect of the fading on the dose reconstruction with this SAR procedure is also discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{coordination}} number (CN) of atoms or ions in many materials increases through application of sufficiently high pressure. This also applies to glassy materials. In boron-containing glasses, trigonal BO 3 units can be transformed into tetrahedral BO 4 under pressure. However, {{one of the key}} questions is whether the pressure-quenched CN change in glass is reversible upon annealing below the ambient glass transition temperature (T g). Here we address this issue by performing 11 B NMR measurements on a <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> borate <b>glass</b> that has been pressure-quenched at ∼ 0. 6 GPa near T g. The results show a remarkable phenomenon, i. e., upon annealing at 0. 9 T g the pressure-induced change in CN remains unchanged, while the pressurised values of macroscopic properties such as density, refractive index, and hardness are relaxing. This suggests that the pressure-induced changes in macroscopic properties of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> borate <b>glasses</b> compressed up to ∼ 0. 6 GPa are not attributed to changes in the short-range order in the glass, but rather to changes in overall atomic packing density and medium-range structures...|$|R

Stresses, due to thermal expansion mismatch, have developed at glass-metal interface after high temperature joining and cooling down to room temperature. The finite element calculations, performed using ANSYS 14 software, suggested that the glass-metal interface was experiencing rather low maximal and minimal principal stresses due to joining. Highest maximal principal stress level was about 25 MPa and lowest minimal principal stress level was about 40 MPa for used sandwich sample profiles. Heat treatment duration affected tensile bonding strength and interfacial reaction between the glass and the Ti alloy. Scanning electron microscope analysis of glass-alloy joining interface showed that a secondary K, Ca, Ti rich sodium silicate phase was forming in glass, starting at glass alloy interface {{and that it was}} growing with the increase in heat treatment duration. Low joining stress levels at the glass-alloy interface for used sandwich sample profile and good bonding between the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> silicate <b>glass</b> and Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy resulted in creation of successful <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> silicate glass-Ti 6 Al 4 V joints...|$|R
