2500|$|Unlike modern genetic {{analyses}}, ancient DNA {{studies are}} characterised by low-quality DNA. This {{places limits on}} what analyses can achieve. Furthermore, due to degradation of the DNA molecules, a process which correlates loosely with factors such as time, temperature, and presence of free water, upper limits exist beyond which no DNA is deemed likely to survive. Allentoft et al. (2012) tried to calculate this limit by studying the decay of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in Moa bones. The DNA degrades in an exponential decay process. According to their model, mitochondrial DNA is degraded to an average length of 1 base pair after 6,830,000 years at −5°C. [...] The decay kinetics have been measured by accelerated aging experiments further displaying the strong influence of <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> and humidity on DNA decay. Nuclear DNA degrades {{at least twice as}} fast as mtDNA. As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from Cretaceous dinosaur remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.|$|E

They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. [...] The ideal <b>storage</b> <b>temperature</b> for wine is generally accepted to be 13°C (55°F).

40|$|The {{extent and}} nature of {{biochemical}} changes {{that take place in}} canned fruits during <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> above freezing have been reviewed and discussed by Pederson, et al. (1947). These changes include loss in nutritive value, e. g. ascorbic acid, thiamine (Brenner, et al., 1948) and deterioration of color (Tressler, et al., 1955). Bauernfeind (1953) reported that canned peaches, apricots, and sweet cherries, after a few months of storage at 70 ° F, frequently undergo changes such as destruction of anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments with the subsequent formation of brown colored compounds. Darkening of fruit-color eventually results in their unacceptability at consumer level. Preference for fruit is mainly based upon the attractive appearance of the products. Thus, color is an important factor governing the quality of fruits and fruit products. In earlier studies, conducted elsewhere, emphasis was placed on effects of low <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the quality of canned apricots and cherries. Paucity of scientific literature on the stability of processed apricots and cherries gave impetus to a study of the comparative influence of high <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> and their duration, as such tests will have considerable economic bearing upon storing and shipping processed products to tropical countries. This thesis presents the effects of <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> (40, 70, 100, and 120 ° F) and their duration (16 weeks) on colors (anthocyanins and carotenoids), total titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, carbohydrates (total 2 and free reducing sugars, pectins), volatile reducing substances, hydroxymethyl furfural, and organoleptic quality of canned apricots and cherries...|$|R
40|$|Background: Large animal veterinarians carry {{drugs in}} their {{practice}} vehicles in storage {{areas that are}} not typically refrigerated. The most common upper limits of manufacturers’ <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> for United States (U. S.) -approved non-refrigerated drugs are 25 or 30 °C. Because ambient temperatures in many locations in the U. S. exceed these temperatures during the summer, we measured <b>storage</b> area <b>temperatures</b> over 4 months {{in the summer of}} 2013 to evaluate the extent to which labeled <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> are exceeded. Methods: A convenience sample of 12 vehicles from 5 central Texas practices and 12 vehicles from 4 south central Nebraska practices was used. Temperatures were recorded in one drug storage compartment in each vehicle from May 15 – September 16, 2013, at 15 -minute intervals using a self-contained, battery operated temperature recording device. Results: The highest temperatures recorded in a storage unit were 54. 4 and 47. 7 °C in Texas and Nebraska, respectively. The mean temperature recorded across all 24 storage units was 29. 1 °C, with a mean of 26. 9 °C in Nebraska and 31. 4 °C in Texas. In Nebraska, at least one temperature over 25 °C was recorded on a mean of 111 / 124 days and a mean of 63 % of total logger readings. In Texas, temperatures over 25 °C were recorded on a mean of 123 / 124 days and a mean of 95 % of total logger readings. Conclusions: <b>Temperatures</b> in <b>storage</b> units in participating veterinary practice vehicles exceeded labeled drug <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{a significant portion of the}} summer of 2013.

40|$|Home {{storage is}} the final step of the frozen foods {{distribution}} chain, and little is known on how it affects the products quality. The present research describes frozen green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris, L.) quality retention profile during the recommended ‘star marking’ system dates, at the <b>storage</b> <b>temperatures</b> of þ 5, 26, 212 and 218 8 C (along 1, 4, 14 and 60 days, respectively).
