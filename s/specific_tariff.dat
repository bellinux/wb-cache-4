40|$|Price-equivalent import {{tariffs and}} quotas are {{compared}} when domestic production {{is controlled by}} a monopolist, say an agricultural marketing board {{with the power to}} restrict domestic supply, under endogenous terms of trade. Welfare comparisons boil down to sourcing costs comparisons. Quotas tend to dominate at high domestic prices, ad valorem tariffs at intermediate prices and <b>specific</b> <b>tariffs</b> at low domestic prices. Welfare maxima are achieved with more restrictive policies than under perfect competition. These results rationalize separate negotiations for sensitive products in the Doha Round and the setting of tariff-rate quotas that mimic import quotas for these products. Finally, in ascertaining the robustness of our policy ranking to the choice of variable anchoring the comparisons, we found that <b>specific</b> <b>tariffs</b> unambiguously dominate ad valorem tariffs and quotas when government revenue or imports anchor the comparisons.

In this paper, we use world market prices and Norwegian import prices to calculate ad valorem equivalents of <b>specific</b> <b>tariffs.</b> This shows that 28 % of the tariff lines in agriculture are above 100 %, and 10 % are above 300 %. The average of MFN applied tariffs is in the range 73 - 103 %, depending on the calculation method. Protection is somewhat lower (54 - 74 %) for goods exported by developing countries. While the Least Developed Countries have zero tariffs, other developing countries obtain 10 - 15 % tariff reductions under the GSP system of tariff preferences. Tariff rate quotas provide some increase in market access.

40|$|We {{examine the}} trade policy {{effects on the}} quality and {{composition}} of imports in an oligopolistically competitive market. Foreign producers compete in quantity {{as well as in}} quality of outputs. We show that consumer exclusions always occur due to the trade policy and prove that a <b>specific</b> <b>tariff</b> upgrades the quality choice of some consumers who purchased the minimum quality requirement's quality level. However, the <b>specific</b> <b>tariff</b> does not a ect the quality choice of the remaining consumers who purchased at a quality level higher than the minimum quality requirement (MQR). Under some conditions, an ad valorem tariff is shown to downgrade the quality of imports. Furthermore, a quota is also proved to downgrade the quality of imports, to lower the social welfare, and to raise the prices of imports. Moreover, we also investigate a policy with a quality ceiling on imports. In this regime we demonstrate that a <b>specific</b> <b>tariff</b> downgrades the quality choice of some consumers who purchased the maximum quality level. Finally, we derive the condition and demonstrate that an increase in the MQR results in a smaller market size and upgrades the quality of imports...|$|E

The welfare-maximizing tariff can be very low, voire negative in some cases, while in others it can even exceed the maximum-revenue tariff. The relationship between the welfare-maximizing tariff and the number of firms need not be monotonically increasing, because the tariff is not strictly used to internalize terms of trade externality. It is also used to manipulate cost asymmetries between producing and importing firms. Welfare-maximizing <b>specific</b> <b>tariffs</b> are never worse than their ad valorem counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} tariff liberalization {{within an}} environment of heterogeneous demand elasticities. Varieties produced {{at a lower cost}} (a) are imported at lower absolute demand elasticities and (b) earn higher revenues. By virtue of larger demand elasticities, low revenue varieties benefit the most from tariff liberalization. Further, if varieties are substitutable, low revenue varieties benefit at the expense of high revenue varieties. These predictions are confirmed using a case study of US Uruguay Round ad-valorem tariff cuts, where within exporter-industry groups, low revenue varieties experienced large gains, and high revenue va-rieties experienced negligible gains. Further, I find evidence suggesting that these effects were also relevant for other trade shocks, such as exchange rates and <b>specific</b> <b>tariffs...</b>|$|R
40|$|According to the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), all {{agricultural}} non-tariff {{trade barriers}} should {{be converted into}} equivalent tariffs and further, reduced over time. However each member country {{has the authority to}} choose the tariff types when it converts NTBs to tariffs such as ad valorem tariff and <b>specific</b> <b>tariff.</b> The paper tries to find the reason for the choice of a certain type of tariff in the process of tariffication after the UR negotiation on agriculture. To achieve this goal, the paper analyses the effects of tariffication of a fixed quota into tariffs on price, trade and welfare in a number of scenarios related to the sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the nonequivalence of <b>specific</b> <b>tariff</b> and ad valorem tariff, which are general type of tariffs used in the most of countries. The paper has shown that the two types of tariffs selected by tariffication of import quota are not generally equivalent in both their effects on price and trade stability and welfare with the trade model under uncertainty. The main conclusion {{of this study is that}} there is no general presumption that one tariff regime is superior to the other tariff regime under conditions of uncertainty. The precise source of uncertainty and the properties of the relevant demand and supply functions might affect the determination of tariff type selected after tariffication of non-tariff barriers...|$|E
