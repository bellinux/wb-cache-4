50|$|The {{standard}} conveyor uses {{a specially}} designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached {{to the other side}} plate by means of a <b>snap</b> <b>pin.</b> This gives the chain a very small bending radius and allows the conveyor to make the tight corners found in most conveyor belt sushi restaurants. Further, the horizontal layout means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates chain sag and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design.|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates {{primary and}} {{secondary}} clinical outcome measures in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 A (CMT 1 A) {{with regard to their}} contribution towards discrimination of disease severity. The nine components of the composite Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Neuropathy Score and six additional secondary clinical outcome measures were assessed in 479 adult patients with genetically proven CMT 1 A and 126 healthy controls. Using hierarchical clustering, we identified four significant clusters of patients according to clinical severity. We then tested the impact of each of the CMTNS components and of the secondary clinical parameters with regard to their power to differentiate these four clusters. The CMTNS components ulnar sensory nerve action potential (<b>SNAP),</b> <b>pin</b> sensibility, vibration and strength of arms did not increase the discriminant value of the remaining five CMTNS components (Ulnar compound motor action potential [CMAP], leg motor symptoms, arm motor symptoms, leg strength and sensory symptoms). However, three of the six additional clinical outcome measures - the 10 m-timed walking test (T 10 MW), 9 hole-peg test (9 HPT), and foot dorsal flexion dynamometry - further improved discrimination between severely and mildly affected patients. From these findings, we identified three different composite measures as score hypotheses and compared their discriminant power with that of the CMTNS. A composite of eight components CMAP, Motor symptoms legs, Motor symptoms arms, Strength of Legs, Sensory symptoms), displayed the strongest power to discriminate between the clusters. As a conclusion, five items from the CMTNS and three secondary clinical outcome measures improve the clinical assessment of patients with CMT 1 A significantly and are beneficial for upcoming clinical and therapeutic trials...|$|E
5000|$|After {{struggling}} with a back injury during practice, Plushenko decided {{to withdraw from the}} competition after his pre-short program warm up on 13 February 2014. It was announced shortly after that he would be retiring from competitive skating. A few days after, he announced that he was [...] "not ruling out" [...] the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. It was announced shortly after {{that he was going to}} have another back surgery on March 2, 2014, citing a <b>snapped</b> <b>pin</b> in his back.|$|R

5000|$|At {{its core}} was a cube-shaped {{building}} block called a [...] "Tog'l Block". Each {{side of the}} block had a hole or a pin {{that could be used}} to connect to the corresponding element (<b>pins</b> <b>snapped</b> into holes) on the side of another block. A chief advantage of Tog'l blocks over Lego (and similar) bricks is that a Lego brick can only attach to other bricks on two of its faces (top or bottom), while Tog'l blocks could attach to others on all six of its faces (each of its six faces could attach to another block).|$|R
50|$|A hole in an arm {{attached}} to the bottom bracket shell <b>snaps</b> onto a <b>pin</b> {{attached to}} the drive side of the lower seat tube (part of the main frame), locking the rear end in place. A pin {{attached to the}} side of the seatmast snaps into a hole in a piece attached to the non-drive side of the mainframe, locking it in place. Finally, a cap on the end of a screw attached to the stem slides into a slot on the drive side of the mainframe, securing it. This allows the bike to be picked up as one piece without unfolding and also allows the bike to wheel around by the front wheel, unlike the other Bike Fridays.|$|R
50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using shear pins in an explosive device. A shear pin can here hold a striker pin in place, preventing the striker pin from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would <b>snap</b> the shear <b>pin,</b> allowing the striker pin to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a pyrotechnic delay composition for auto destruction. In this use shear pins prevent the striker pin from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles. Typically, the shear-pin in an anti-tank mine is designed to snap (and release the spring-loaded firing pin) when a weight in excess of 150 kilograms is applied to the pressure plate.|$|R
