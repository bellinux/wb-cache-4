25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
2500|$|A passive {{capacitance}} sensor use {{the principle}} outlined above {{to form an}} image of the fingerprint patterns on the dermal layer of skin. [...] Each sensor pixel is used to measure the capacitance at that point of the array. [...] The capacitance varies between the ridges and valleys of the fingerprint {{due to the fact that}} the volume between the dermal layer and <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> in valleys contains an air gap. [...] The dielectric constant of the epidermis and the area of the <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> are known values. [...] The measured capacitance values are then used to distinguish between fingerprint ridges and valleys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of a}} piezoelectric sensor is that a physical dimension, transformed into a force, acts on two opposing faces of the <b>sensing</b> <b>element.</b> Depending {{on the design of}} a sensor, different [...] "modes" [...] to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{capacitance}} sensors use a charging {{cycle to}} apply a voltage to the skin before measurement takes place. [...] The application of voltage charges the effective capacitor. [...] The electric field between the finger and sensor follows {{the pattern of the}} ridges in the dermal skin layer. [...] On the discharge cycle, the voltage across the dermal layer and <b>sensing</b> <b>element</b> is compared against a reference voltage in order to calculate the capacitance. The distance values are then calculated mathematically, and used to form an image of the fingerprint. [...] Active capacitance sensors measure the ridge patterns of the dermal layer like the ultrasonic method. [...] Again, this eliminates the need for clean, undamaged epidermal skin and a clean sensing surface.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{ultraviolet}} detectors {{use either}} a solid-state device, {{such as one}} based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride, or a gas-filled tube as the <b>sensing</b> <b>element.</b> UV detectors that are sensitive to UV {{in any part of}} the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band, whereas the Sun's radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The result is that the UV detector is [...] "solar blind", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} a competent tactile sensor for manipulating an {{object is to}} determine the magnitude and the position of an applied force on it. In addition, it is important to determine orientation of the object in relation to the tactile sensor. In order to achieve these goals, most investigators have attempted to design a tactile sensor using an array of <b>sensing</b> <b>elements</b> arranged in matrix form. There are several problems associated with this type of tactile sensors. These problems include cross-talk between <b>sensing</b> <b>elements,</b> fragility, and complexity. This thesis reports on the design, modeling, fabrication and testing of a membrane tactile sensing system with only four <b>sensing</b> <b>elements.</b> By using membrane stress combined with triangulation approach, it is shown {{that it is possible to}} overcome the above problems. The prototype sensor consists of a single film of 25 micron thick Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) film, which is held between two 12 mm-thick flat Plexiglass plates, each with a 90 mm-diameter center hole. Four square <b>sensing</b> <b>elements,</b> each 3 min side, were fabricated around the center of the membrane. The fabrication of the <b>sensing</b> <b>elements</b> is performed using photolithographic and etching techniques. By applying force with a probe of various shapes and sizes at various points away from the <b>sensing</b> <b>elements,</b> and using a geometric mapping process, the sensor is calibrated. As the result of calibration various isocharge contours were drawn. Using both finite element and experimental analysis, it is shown that it is possible to determine the position, orientation and the magnitude of the applied load though various flat shaped probes, by using only four <b>sensing</b> <b>elements.</b> The experimental and the finite element results are compared. It is shown that there is a good correlation between the finite element predictions and experimental data...|$|R
