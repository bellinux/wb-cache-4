5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a landing {{on the edge of}} Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a <b>seismometer</b> at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E
5|$|Seismometer: The Chinese polymath and {{inventor}} Zhang Heng (78–139) of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) {{invented the}} first <b>seismometer</b> in 132, a large metal urn-shaped instrument which employed either a suspended pendulum or inverted pendulum acting on inertia (i.e. ground tremors from earthquakes) to dislodge a metal ball by a lever trip device; this ball would {{fall out of}} dragon-shaped metal mouth into the corresponding metal toad mouth indicating the exact cardinal direction of where a distant earthquake had occurred {{in order for the}} state to send swift aid and relief to the affected regions; several subsequent recreations of his device were employed by Chinese states up until the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when use of the device fell into obscurity, a fact noted even by the writer Zhou Mi around 1290, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was {{an age of}} {{economic}} prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c.1050–256 BC). The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including papermaking, the nautical steering rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a <b>seismometer</b> employing an inverted pendulum.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of STS- 2 <b>seismometers,</b> no common {{systematic}} anomaly could be found among the multiple sensors examined (Figure  14 a). Furthermore, index parameters at 100 to 200  s periods for STS- 2 <b>seismometers</b> were more concentrated in the standard values than those for STS- 1 <b>seismometers,</b> and F-net STS- 2 <b>seismometers</b> were found to work more stably without typical response errors.|$|R

50|$|Deflection sensors (geophones; force-balance <b>seismometers)</b> mounted {{radially}} {{from the}} center of the load plate measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load. Some typical offsets are 0mm, 200mm, 300mm, 450mm, 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm 1500mm. The deflections measured at these sensors are termed D0, D200, D300 etc. The advantages of <b>seismometers</b> compared to geophones are built-in calibration devices and higher range (5 mm vs 2 mm). Geophones are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. Geophones however are much cheaper than <b>seismometers.</b> Dynatest, Carl Bro, Jils and PaveTesting use geophones while KUAB have <b>seismometers</b> in their standard FWD's and geophones in their low-cost models.|$|R
5|$|Boarding was {{phased out}} in 1989 and the {{buildings}} used for boarding, School House and the Bishop's Palace, were converted into teaching space. Girls were {{admitted to the}} sixth form {{for the first time}} in 1994, ending nearly 900 years of single-sex education. In 1999 the Daynes Sports Centre opened and the former gymnasium was converted into the Blake Drama Studio and two further laboratories. The same year the artists Cornford & Cross were commissioned by the Norwich Gallery to produce a series of sculptures beside the River Wensum. One of the works, Jerusalem, was installed on the school playing fields until July 2002. Part of the installation was later donated to the art department. In 2008 new science laboratories opened on St Faiths Lane in the south section of the Close. The facilities include a <b>seismometer</b> which is part of the British Geological Survey's schools network. That same year, the school began to admit girls below the sixth form for the first time, initially as young as age eleven. The next year, 2009, all school-age girls were eligible for admission. An eighth house called Seagrim, named after distinguished ONs Derek and Hugh Seagrim, was created in 2009. In 2011 the first female head of school in the school's history was chosen. In late 2013 work began to extend the Lower School.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} <b>seismometer</b> that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>seismometer</b> is {{a digital}} strong-motion <b>seismometer,</b> or accelerograph. The data {{from such an}} {{instrument}} is essential to understand how an earthquake affects man-made structures, through earthquake engineering.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the Hanford Seismic Network. The network {{consists of two}} instrument arrays: <b>seismometers</b> and strong motion accelerometers. The <b>seismometers</b> determine the location and magnitude of earthquakes, and the strong motion accelerometers determine ground motion. Together these instruments arrays comply {{with the intent of}} DOE Order 5480. 20, Natural Phenomena Hazards Mitigation...|$|R
500|$|More than 1,000 {{earthquakes}} {{were recorded}} by regional seismic networks within {{three weeks of}} October 20, 2007. Because the <b>seismometers</b> that recorded the Nazko swarm were more than [...] away from where the earthquakes took place, {{the locations of the}} hypocenters were measured with poor resolution. Following the earthquake, five <b>seismometers</b> were placed by the Geological Survey of Canada from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter. Analysis of the data recorded by these <b>seismometers</b> indicates a much larger total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597 earthquakes were recognized during a period of only six hours.|$|R
25|$|The word {{derives from}} the Greek σεισμός, seismós, a shaking or quake, from the verb σείω, seíō, to shake; and μέτρον, métron, to measure, and was coined by David Milne-Home in 1841, to {{describe}} an instrument designed by Scottish physicist James David Forbes. The <b>seismometer</b> was invented by the Chinese polymath Zhang Heng in AD 132 during the Han dynasty. The first Western description of a <b>seismometer</b> comes from the French physicist and priest Jean de Hautefeuille in 1703. The modern <b>seismometer</b> {{was developed in the}} 19th century by John Milne, James Alfred Ewing and Thomas Gray while working as oyatoi gaikokujin for the Meiji government in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Richter {{magnitude}} scale, {{or local}} magnitude ML scale, assigns a number {{to quantify the}} amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake. It is a base-10 logarithmic scale obtained by calculating the logarithm of the combined horizontal amplitude of the largest displacement from zero on a Wood–Anderson torsion <b>seismometer</b> output. Co-invented in 1935 by Charles Richter along with Beno Gutenberg of the California Institute of Technology, the Richter magnitude scale was firstly intended to be used only in a particular study area in California, and on seismograms recorded on a particular instrument, the Wood-Anderson torsion <b>seismometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|A strong-motion <b>seismometer</b> {{measures}} acceleration. This can be mathematically integrated {{later to}} give velocity and position. Strong-motion seismometers {{are not as}} sensitive to ground motions as teleseismic instruments but they stay on scale during the strongest seismic shaking.|$|E
40|$|Wide-angle seismic {{data from}} the Eastern Black Sea {{have been used to}} {{determine}} the geological structure of the sediments, the entire crust, and upper mantle. Data were acquired using a combination of ocean-bottom <b>seismometers</b> (OBS), land <b>seismometers,</b> and a marine air-gun source, providing refracted and reflected energy recorded to offsets in excess of 100 km...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Seismometers</b> spaced in {{an array}} {{can also be}} used to {{precisely}} locate, in three dimensions, the source of an earthquake, using the time it takes for seismic waves to propagate away from the hypocenter, the initiating point of fault rupture (See also Earthquake location). [...] Interconnected <b>seismometers</b> are also used, as part of the International Monitoring System to detect underground nuclear test explosions, as well as for Earthquake early warning systems. These <b>seismometers</b> are often used as part of a large scale governmental or scientific project, but some organizations such as the Quake-Catcher Network, can use residential size detectors built into computers to detect earthquakes as well.|$|R
30|$|The {{method is}} based on {{comparisons}} between teleseismic surface wave records at a target station and those at multiple surrounding reference stations, from which we calculate three index parameters and evaluate in situ instrumentation conditions, including amplitude and phase responses against input ground motions. In our experiments, we applied the proposed method to F-net broadband <b>seismometers</b> covering the Japanese Islands, where station intervals are approximately 100  km. This allows us, through calculations of the index parameters, to evaluate instrumentation health at each station at least once every 60  days. Using our proposed method, we found that approximately 75 % of the evaluated index parameters distributed well around the standard values, and for most examined broadband <b>seismometers,</b> response anomalies are not detected at the period range of 50 to 200  s. However, instrumentation errors, such as gain decrease over the evaluated periods and gradual changes in amplitude and phase frequency responses (sometimes covering several years) were identified at a few stations. Additionally, overdamping errors at the STS- 1 <b>seismometers,</b> which experience significant amplitude and phase frequency response variations around the 360 -s corner, {{appear to have been}} common at several stations. In contrast, STS- 2 <b>seismometers</b> appear to have functioned more reliably than STS- 1 <b>seismometers.</b>|$|R
25|$|After Hiten in 1990, ISAS {{planned a}} lunar {{penetrator}} mission called LUNAR-A but after delays due to technical problems, {{the project was}} terminated in January 2007. The <b>seismometer</b> penetrator design for LUNAR-A may be reused in a future mission.|$|E
25|$|Seismology: To better {{prepare for}} calamities, Zhang Heng invented a <b>seismometer</b> in 132 CE which {{provided}} instant alert to {{authorities in the}} capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction. Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern Gansu). Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and {{the movements of the}} Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air. See Zhang's <b>seismometer</b> for further details.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{performed}} the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the Command Module Odyssey to the Lunar Module (LM) Aquarius, and {{pulled away from}} the spent third stage, which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the Moon in range of a <b>seismometer</b> placed on the surface by Apollo 12. They then settled in for the three-day trip to Fra Mauro.|$|E
30|$|The seismic {{monitoring}} network operated and {{maintained by the}} Aso Volcanological Laboratory (AVL) has been gradually updated with denser and more modern <b>seismometers.</b> Because SP <b>seismometers</b> have been replaced with BB <b>seismometers</b> at some stations, 8 BB (CMG- 40 T or STS- 2; red circles in Fig.  1) and 12 SP (PK- 110 or L- 4 C- 3 D; yellow triangles in Fig.  1) sensors were employed. A further 5 BB seismic stations equipped with STS- 2 <b>seismometers</b> (green circles in Fig.  1)—the JNU station of the JMA and 4 stations operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED; V-net: ASH and ASI; F-net: TKD and TMC)—were also selected to increase station and path density. In total, 25 seismic stations (corresponding to 13 BB and 12 SP <b>seismometers)</b> comprised the network (Fig.  1). Interstation distances were much shorter (~[*] 1 to 2  km) near the Nakadake crater than in the area surrounding Aso caldera (~[*] 10 to 20  km). The seismic data set covered a time period of approximately 4  years, from November 1, 2009, to September 20, 2013. The selected period ended approximately 1  year before the most recent volcanic eruptions that began on November 25, 2014.|$|R
30|$|The {{permanent}} volcano monitoring network {{included two}} permanent GeoNet seismic stations (WIZ and WSRZ) during the eruptive period (Fig.  1). In addition, GNS Science operated four portable seismic stations (WI 01, WI 02, WI 04, and WI 13) {{as part of}} the re-occupation of a wider portable network from 2011 (Jolly et al. 2017). The GeoNet seismic stations consisted of Guralp 3 ESP broadband <b>seismometers</b> with Quantrerra Q 330 digitizers. In addition, GeoNet operated Setra model 270 - 600 and InfraBSU pressure transducers located near the permanent seismic stations. The portable <b>seismometers</b> were composed of both Trillium compact <b>seismometers</b> and 24 -bit Nanometrics Taurus digitizers. All seismic data are sampled at 100  Hz and have a corner frequency of 120  s.|$|R

25|$|Block 2 of the Ranger project {{launched}} three {{spacecraft to}} the Moon in 1962, carrying a TV camera, a radiation detector, and a <b>seismometer</b> {{in a separate}} capsule slowed by a rocket motor and packaged to survive its low-speed impact on the Moon’s surface. The three missions together demonstrated good performance of the Atlas/Agena B launch vehicle and {{the adequacy of the}} spacecraft design, but unfortunately not both on the same attempt. Ranger 3 had problems with both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft, missed the Moon by about 36,800km, and has orbited the Sun ever since. Ranger 4 had a perfect launch, but the spacecraft was completely disabled. The project team tracked the <b>seismometer</b> capsule to impact just out of sight on the lunar far side, validating the communications and navigation system. Ranger 5 missed the Moon and was disabled. No significant science information was gleaned from these missions. The craft weighed 331kg.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} cases where large {{differences}} between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning {{system and the}} actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. JMA attributed the reason behind such discrepancy in the warning to the system's inability to separate two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, and also the reduced amount of available <b>seismometer</b> due to power outage and connection fail. The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this kind of situation.|$|E
25|$|Electronic analog PID {{control loops}} were often found within more complex {{electronic}} systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning {{of a power}} supply, or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern <b>seismometer.</b> Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs, to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.|$|E

25|$|The last {{function}} of the IU was to command the very small maneuver necessary to keep the S-IVB/IU {{out of the way}} of the spacecraft. On some missions the S-IVB/IU went into high Earth or Solar orbit, while on others it was crashed into the Moon; seismometers were left on the Moon during Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, and the S-IVB/IUs of Apollo 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were directed to crash. These impacts provided impulses that were recorded by the <b>seismometer</b> network to yield information about the geological structure of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|A simple <b>seismometer</b> that is {{sensitive}} to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging on a spring. The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides {{a measure of the}} vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a rotating drum attached to the frame, and a pen attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram.|$|E
