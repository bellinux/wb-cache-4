40|$|Fracture flow {{is fairly}} well {{documented}} with the widespread application of, for instance, the cubic law and assumed <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> plate model. Geometrical intricacies such as aperture, roughness and infill do however significantly influence {{the validity of}} the cubic law with even its application to <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> systems being contestable. Rock mechanical discontinuity surveys provide valuable information regarding the discontinuity geometry that can likely contribute to the evaluation of flow through individual fractures with variable properties. The hydraulic aperture is available for the transmission of flow, while normal and shear stresses alter discontinuity properties over time. In this, numerous advances have been made to better accommodate deviations of natural discontinuity geometry to that of <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> plates and at partial saturation. The paper addresses these advances and details conditions under which the cubic law, even in local form, fails to adequately estimate the hydraulic properties. The role of roughness in open discontinuities is addressed in particular, as contact areas and high amplitude roughness cause most extensive deviation from the cubic law. Aperture of open fractures still governs hydraulic properties, but inertial forces control flow in very rough fractures, in which instances the applicability of the cubic law should be revisited. Open questions are finally posed,assessment of which will contribute significantly to the understanding of flow through individual discontinuities as well as fracture networks.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and <b>parallel</b> <b>blending</b> of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an action flow that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual lowlevel MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.

This paper presents results of the computations performed in the ETSIN for different ships with the RANSE free surface commercial solver CFX. Some of the computational results are validated against experimental data in terms of various global and local quantities. The CFX code is based on a finite volume discretization. The turbulence model used in the calculations was the SST (Shear Stress Transport) model, and the volume of fluid method is used to model the free-surface flow. The numerical schemes use higher order cells to satisfy the momentum, pressure and turbulence quantities where each hexahedral cell is further subdivided into eight sub-volumes.

40|$|Field {{studies show}} that the {{variance}} of travel distance often increases nonlinearly with time elapsed after release of solute tracers. The nonlinear relationship between variance of travel distance and time is attributed to the heterogeneity of the porous media. To describe the transport in such a heterogeneous system, a time-dependent dispersivity is necessary. Though more attention has been devoted toward the study of non-Fickian dispersion at early time, there are no known studies that explicitly describe the dispersivity behavior in a fracture–matrix-coupled system. The observation from numerical results suggests that dispersivity has a time-dependent behavior and it reaches asymptotic values after a long time. The preasymptotic behavior of a solute front in fracture is characterized by increasing effective dispersivity with time. The role of fracture and matrix transport parameters on this behavior is analyzed for linearly sorbing solutes. Approximate expression is provided for the time-dependent dispersivity of the solute front in a single fracture with matrix diffusion and the expression for the time required to attain the asymptotic behavior is also obtained. A comparison of the front dispersivity behavior between parallel multiple fractures with a constant aperture width model and <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> multiple fractures with a varying aperture width model is done...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} approach to accurately simulate flow experiments through a fractured core using experimental, stochastic, and simulation techniques. Very often, a fracture is assumed {{as a set of}} <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> plates separated by a constant width. However, the flow characteristics of an actual fracture surface are quite different, affected by tortuosity and the impact of surface roughness. Though several researchers have discussed the effect of friction on flow reduction, their efforts lack corroboration from experimental data and have not converged to form a unified methodology for studying flow on a rough fracture surface. In this study, an integrated methodology involving experimental, stochastic, and numerical simulations that incorporate the fracture roughness and the friction factor is shown to describe flow through single fractures more efficiently. Laboratory experiments were performed to support the study in quantifying the flow contributions from the matrix and the fracture. The results were used to modify the cubic law through reservoir simulations. Observations suggest that the fracture apertures need to be distributed to accurately model the experimental results. The methodology successfully modeled fractured core experiments, which were earlier not possible using the parallel plate approach.

40|$|Rock {{fracture}} roughness and tortuosity {{caused by}} contact asperities produce extra resistance for fluid flow {{in comparison with}} the channel consisting of two <b>smooth</b> <b>parallel</b> plates. To characterise the role of roughness and tortuosity in water flow through rock fractures, the existing studies of the effect of fracture roughness and contact area (tortuosity) on fluid flow through rock fractures were firstly reviewed. Then, an explicit flow model was derived using the friction factor predictor previously proposed according to the flow data of sandstone fractures. Regarding the introduced relative roughness of rock fracture as the correction variable, the developed flow model can be considered as a corrected form of classic cubic law, where the relative roughness is defined as the ratio of the averaged peak asperity height to equivalent hydraulic aperture. Sensitivity analysis shows that the cubic law can overestimate the flow rate by 10 % when the relative roughness increases to 70. 7. With further increase in relative roughness up to 300, which usually represents tight rock fractures, the flow rate is only approximately 64 % of that predicted by cubic law.
