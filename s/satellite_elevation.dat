However, existing studies on stochastic models of GNSS observations are limited to sampling rates not higher than 1 Hz. To support very high-rate GNSS applications, we assess the precisions, cross correlations and time correlations of very high-rate (50 Hz) Global Positioning System (GPS) /BeiDou code and phase observations. The method of least-squares variance component estimation is applied with the geometry-based functional model using the GNSS single-differenced observations. The real-data experimental {{results show that the}} precisions are elevation-dependent at <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles below 40 ° and nearly constant at <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles above 40 °. The precisions of undifferenced observations are presented, exhibiting different patterns for different observation types and satellites, especially for BeiDou because different types of satellites are involved. GPS and BeiDou have comparable precisions at high <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles, reaching 0. 91 – 1. 26 mm and 0. 13 – 0. 17 m for phase and code, respectively, while, at low <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles, GPS precisions are generally lower than BeiDou ones. The cross correlation between dual-frequency phase is very significant, with the coefficients of 0. 773 and 0. 927 for GPS and BeiDou, respectively. The cross correlation between dual-frequency code is much less significant, and no correlation can be found between phase and code.

The stochastic models based on these indices can mitigate the errors such as diffraction; but each model is suitable to process some kinds of errors.

The results show that the model based on signal strength as power as the model based on C/No, It means that the signal strength can substitute C/No as the indea in SIGMA stochastic model when there is no C/No output in observation data.

40|$|The {{detection}} of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals that are reflected off the surface, {{along with the}} reception of direct GNSS signals, offers {{a unique opportunity to}} monitor water level variations over land and ocean. The time delay between the reception of the direct and reflected signals gives access to the altitude of the receiver over the reflecting surface. The field of view of the receiver is highly dependent on both the orbits of the GNSS satellites and the configuration of the study site geometries. A simulator has been developed to determine the location of the reflection points on the surface accurately by modeling the trajectories of GNSS electromagnetic waves that are reflected by the surface of the Earth. Only the geometric problem was considered using a specular reflection assumption. The orbit of the GNSS constellation satellites (mainly GPS, GLONASS and Galileo), and the position of a fixed receiver, are used as inputs. Four different simulation modes are proposed, depending on the choice of the Earth surface model (local plane, osculating sphere or ellipsoid) and the consideration of topography likely to cause masking effects. Angular refraction effects derived from adaptive mapping functions are also taken into account. This simulator was developed to determine where the GNSS-R receivers should be located to monitor a given study area efficiently. In this study, two test sites were considered: the first one {{at the top of the}} 65 m Cordouan lighthouse in the Gironde estuary, France, and the second one on the shore of Lake Geneva (50 m above the reflecting surface), at the border between France and Switzerland. This site is hidden by mountains in the south (orthometric altitude up to 2000 m), and overlooking the lake in the north (orthometric altitude of 370 m). For this second test site configuration, reflections occur until 560 m from the receiver. The planimetric (arc length) differences (or altimetric difference as WGS 84 ellipsoid height) between the positions of the specular reflection points obtained considering the Earth's surface as an osculating sphere or as an ellipsoid were found to be on average 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles greater than 10 °, and 13. 9 cm (or less than 1 mm) for <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles between 5 and 10 °. The altimetric and planimetric differences between the plane and sphere approximations are on average below 1. 4 cm (or less than 1 mm) for <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles greater than 10 ° and below 6. 2 cm (or 2. 4 mm) for <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles between 5 and 10 °. These results are the means of the differences obtained during a 24 h simulation with a complete GPS and GLONASS constellation, and thus depend on how the <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angle is sampled over the day of simulation. The simulations highlight the importance of the digital elevation model (DEM) integration: average planimetric differences (or altimetric) with and without integrating the DEM (with respect to the ellipsoid approximation) were found to be about 6. 3 m (or 1. 74 m), with the minimum elevation angle equal to 5 °. The correction of the angular refraction due to troposphere on the signal leads to planimetric (or altimetric) differences of an approximately 18 m (or 6 cm) maximum for a 50 m receiver height above the reflecting surface, whereas the maximum is 2. 9 m (or 7 mm) for a 5 m receiver height above the reflecting surface. These errors increase deeply with the receiver height above the reflecting surface. By setting it to 300 m, the planimetric errors reach 116 m, and the altimetric errors reach 32 cm for <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> angles lower than 10 °. The tests performed with the simulator presented in this paper highlight the importance of the choice of the Earth's representation and also the non-negligible effect of angular refraction due to the troposphere on the specular reflection point positions.

40|$|Necessity is {{the mother}} of invention. A unique method of {{processing}} stereo satellite photos, independent from the ground survey control, was developed not because the advantages of this approach were initially identified, but instead because the majority of PhotoSat's first stereo <b>satellite</b> <b>elevation</b> mapping projects had no accurately surveyed ground control. Conventional stereo photo elevation mapping begins by identifying numerous ground survey control points on the stereo photos. The east, north and elevation coordinates of these points are then applied to the many location points in the photos. The elevation data is processed using the combination of the stereo photos and the ground survey points. During the 2003 to 2008 resource boom, Vancouver based mining exploration companies worked many advanced exploration and development projects in remote parts of the world. These projects required accurate, high resolution elevation maps for development plans, feasibility studies and resource and reserve estimates. Many of these projects, particularly at their early stages, had no or very poor quality ground survey data. Mapping for these early projects were carried out using 1 m stereo satellite photos. With many of these projects, the initial elevation mapping relied exclusively on the geometric accuracy of the stereo satellite photos.
